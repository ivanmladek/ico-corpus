1. INTRODUCTION
The Internet is making its way into every part of our lives. With the speed of adoption
increasing, technical barriers are being lowered and we find our physical and digital lives
beginning to integrate, creating a huge impact, especially on millennials. They are the
first digital-native generation to be born into this world and the largest generation in
history—significantly larger than the baby-boomer generation, and are expected to be in
control of 24 trillion dollars of the world's wealth by 2020. They are more likely to live in
cities, they own fewer cars, and they choose their brands based on values like ethical
sourcing, social justice, and environmental effects. They are looking for meaning, and
often find it in making a positive impact on the community around them, thus creating a
demand for financial community ties.
Technology is dramatically changing the way millennials make payments and consume
other financial services. As physical cash is being replaced by digital means, from cards
to mobile, they come to expect payments to be quick, safe, cool to use, and available
24/7. This creates pressure on merchants to broaden the means of payments they
accept, in an effort to catch up with user demand. This pressure is especially
burdensome for smaller merchants in today’s environment as they often pay the highest
fees for payment processing, making for an uneven playing field for local initiatives.
Moreover, as a consequence of accelerating globalization, the diminishing frictions in
cross-border commerce have incentivized corporate rent extraction through
cost-externalization and the outsourcing of production. Encouraged by the continuation
of open policies on multilateral trade, global supply chains have penetrated domestic
markets, resulting in the incremental centralization of capital flows toward multinational
organizations.​[1] ​ While the free movement of goods is imperative to open markets, SMEs
(small to medium size enterprises) get the short end of the stick, being unable to
compete in their native markets. In particular, small businesses with less than 10
employees make up over 93 percent of all enterprises in the EU and account for around
two-thirds of employment.​[2] ​In the US, small businesses account for 99.7 percent of firms
with paid employees, and annually contribute almost 40 percent of US private, non-farm
output.​[3]​ ​ ​Yet, these small businesses often face difficulties accessing capital.

3
A comparison study published by the OECD shows that the share of SME loans in
total business loans in 2014 was 22.5% in the UK, 21.2% in the US and France, and
14.2% in Canada.​[4]
Community financial service providers typically provide services to SMEs and consumers
based on “relationship banking”; however, they encounter tough competition from large
national and multinational financial institutions. Credit unions and community banks play
an important role in the US by lending to small businesses and providing access to
payments services for a large percentage of the population. However, their share in total
deposits and loans has been decreasing significantly over the years.​[5]​ Credit unions are
typically another type of community financial service provider. A study in Canada shows
that they retain a higher share of net income to support future growth and investment in
creating jobs, that they provide loans through periods where availability of credit is low,
and that they lead in SME business lending.
The idea of a community currency as a secondary medium of exchange, store of value,
and unit of account has also been around for a while.​ ​Community currencies have
attracted attention from academics and policy makers alike, due to their unique ability
to produce and retain wealth within communities.​[6] ​These currencies have the potential
to increase overall profitability for local stakeholders and to facilitate countercyclical
growth cycles and increased social welfare.​[7] ​Several projects have attempted to
establish local payment systems; however, due to lack of sufficient infrastructure these
initiatives have failed to provide a secure, liquid, and scalable environment for
financial transactions.​[8]
Technological advancements, notably the emergence of blockchain technology, lower
the barriers to offering payment processing solutions and establishing local payments
systems. While the macroeconomic consequences of issuing digital peer-to-peer
currencies remain hypothetical, regulators are exploring opportunities in distributed
financial solutions.​[9] ​As the notion of digital currency manifests itself in private and
regulatory institutions, the efficiency, resilience, and accessibility of disintermediated
digital payment infrastructure is gaining momentum with a broader audience. The CLN is
looking to build an ecosystem that will combine the two changes discussed
above—technological and social—by creating a network that supports the evolution of
local payment systems, each of which provides incentives to its local stakeholders, while
sharing tools and services provided over the entire network.

4
A fresh approach to community “banking” using blockchain technology, where
transactions are verified P2P and intermediaries are removed, shows the promising
potential to generate value by increasing competition on the price, quality, and variety of
services relative to existing means of payment and other relevant services.
Colu is firmly rooted in the open-source blockchain developer community as a leading
member of the​ ​ColoredCoins​ ​pr​ oject, and is investing additional resources in open-source
code with the latest release of​ ​Bankbox​.​ This commitment is also reflected in the initial
release of the Colu Local Wallet.

2. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE CLN
NETWORK AND PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE

The current state of payment systems globally, even in well-developed markets such as
the UK and the US, is such that the gap between end-user needs, both of consumers and
of businesses, and what is being delivered by the current payments infrastructure is
growing and creating significant detriment for users, who are demanding greater control,
greater assurance, enhanced data, and reduced financial crime.​[10]​ A recent report by the
Payments Strategy Forum in the UK, identifies key requirements that current legacy
systems and the entire payment infrastructure must meet:​[11]
●

The ability to respond to current and future end-user needs

●

Improving trust in the safety and certainty of payments

●

Simplifying access to data and to systems in order to promote competition

●

A new architecture for the payment ecosystem

In thinking of a new architecture for the payment ecosystem, one that can support us in
achieving the desired goals given today’s technologies, a recent dedicated report (the
“NPA Report”) details a proposed conceptual framework.​[12]​ The guidelines listed in the
NPA report include:
●

A single set of standards and rules with strong central governance

●

End-to-end interoperability (including Application Programming Interfaces and
common messaging standards)

●

A collaborative infrastructure, allowing multiple providers of overlay services to
compete in the market simultaneously

●

The need to ensure our payment systems are secure and resilient with financial
stability as a key foundation

Somewhat surprisingly, both regulators and traditional financial players on the one hand,
and disruptive innovators in the blockchain arena on the other, agree on most of the
above guidelines, with the notable exception of the form of governance.

6
The blockchain space is currently experimenting with different methods of community
governance, but it is already clear that this technology offers new capabilities that are not
possible in the financial system when it comes to transparency and the ability to
coordinate a large group of organizations around an open and secure protocol.
The proposed CLN network implements an infrastructure that will facilitate the evolution
of an ecosystem that adheres to many of the above principles:
●

The choice to develop the CLN as an open-source project​ ​on a public blockchain
implies there is a transparent set of standards and rules that ensures
interoperability.

●

Moreover, the existence of a vibrant, fast-growing community of developers
facilitates the emergence of overlay services offered by third parties that will
compete on the network. This is evident by the Ethereum transaction volume,
which has already surpassed Bitcoin’s transaction volume by allowing new
functionality that has attracted thousands of companies to develop on top of it.

●

A new network evolving over the blockchain is more prone to being dynamic and
adaptive to future end-consumer needs than would be any result of a mere
transformation of an old network built, as it is, on the foundation of legacy
systems owned and operated by traditional players.

●

The ability to bypass the network or fork it and make changes where it is proving
to be inefficient or failing to create value for end consumers provides ongoing,
healthy competitive pressure on the network. Such competitive pressure is often
missing in many other proprietary payment schemes owned and operated by
banks and credit card companies.

2.1. THE BUSINESS MODEL AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CLN NETWORK
The key business goals that the CLN network is designed to support are:
●

Providing economic incentives that will facilitate the development and provision of
new services to the network

●

Providing services in an accessible manner, which will support broad adoption of
the technology (“bringing the use of crypto currencies to the masses”)

●

Using economic incentives as a growth engine by facilitating the introduction of
community currencies [See Chapter 3 for details]

The importance of designing the network in such a way that it will organically provide
adequate incentives to the various participants in order to facilitate broad adoption is also
reflected in a recent report by the US Faster Payments Task Force concerning the design

7
of a faster payments system in the US.​[13]​ The report discusses the need to provide
incentives to consumers and merchants to encourage them to learn, access, and use
the system, and to provide solution operators and service providers with incentives to
develop and deliver solutions and participate in an ecosystem that enables interoperability
among competing solutions. Moreover, the report acknowledges the importance of
enabling financial service providers of all sizes to participate and deliver solutions “by
fostering competitive fairness, continued innovation, and flexibility to take advantage of
emerging technologies.” Therefore, the network should be structured to provide incentives
to entities providing those financial services that address everyday needs, entities often
referred to as gateways.
The CLN network proposes a framework via which to provide incentives using blockchain
technology. Next, we discuss the multiple stakeholders that could participate in the CLN
network and the fundamental role they each play in establishing, developing for, and
maintaining the network, on the one hand, and in using the services provided, on the other.
The incentives to the various players would be provided through the circulation of the
network’s native token (CLN) and community currencies in the form of rewards or fees.

Role

Description

Financial

A financial gateway accepts fiat or crypto deposits from users, and acts as a

Gateways

custodian for user funds flowing in and out of the network. A gateway can be
any institution, including financial institution, as long as it provides services
that accompany the custody of consumers funds, such as KYC and other
regulatory requirements. Gateways act as entry and exit points for fiat
currencies. They are in a position to play a vital role in the network by
providing transaction verification and settlement across the network, without
a central operator and without reliance on a single gateway. Gateways are
compensated for their services in CLN fees.

Community

A community currency issuer uses the tools provided by the CLN network to

Currency

issue a community currency for its community and provide liquidity for it. This

Issuers

role can be taken by merchant networks, local businesses, consumer clubs, and
other entities that have a community of users for which they wish to facilitate
consumption, payments, lending, crowdfunding, or credit.

Developers and

Developers and service providers will build tools and services on top of the

Service

CLN network, enhancing its capabilities. The network will support partnerships

Providers

with products or other networks that complement the CLN network’s services,
such as credit providers, credit-scoring service providers, or integrators to
legacy networks.

Merchants

Local merchants accept fiat payments for the services they provide. Merchants
are rewarded in their community currency for transactions that take place at
their point of sale.

End-users

Consumers pay at merchants’ point of sale with digital fiat currency. They
are rewarded in their community currency for pursuing this economic activity
on the network.

9
2.2. NETWORK CAPABILITIES FOR ISSUERS AND GATEWAYS
Issuers are entities that issue cryptocurrencies and provide them with liquidity. This role
can be taken by merchant networks, local businesses, consumer clubs, and other entities
that have a community of users for which they wish to facilitate consumption, payments,
lending, crowdfunding, or credit. Issuers are at the heart of the network, and they are
also in a position to act as gateways, although it is not mandatory. The network will
launch with two key functionalities for issuers—the ability to issue community currencies
using a template that is easy for developers to use and to provide a smooth exchange
between community currencies, as well as ERC-20 tokens, via the CLN token. Both
functionalities will be implemented using a set of smart contracts.
→The issuer tools are discussed in detail in Section 3.

2.3 PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE OF THE CLN NETWORK
A successful token is one with a distribution pattern that creates a system of incentives
that support the business goals set for the token. For the CLN, it is creating a token that
provides access to a network of local payments. The CLN token allows financial
gateways, developers, and service providers to make payments, exchange between
currencies, and provide additional services that address local communities’ needs, thus
providing an alternative to traditional financial institutions. Moreover, the goal of
community currencies is to be a store of value for local communities, connecting
consumers and businesses.
In the previous section we discussed the network capabilities for issuers and gateways.
We refer to these capabilities as the issuer layer. Next, we discuss how the proposed
architecture enables two layers of services that facilitate various stages in the payment
process to be developed on top of the issuer layer.

10

2.3.1. Products and services layer
Products and services developed by anyone in the community could be integrated
to the network as the network is an open-source public blockchain. The development of
payment processing capabilities will provide merchants with an easy, bundled API/SDK
to collect payments made using all types of payment means, including POS or
e-commerce. Payment processing services will also support innovation in advanced
payment types—for example, the introduction of recurring payments or of decentralized
fiat exchange between gateways. Merchant services will handle merchant-related
operations, such as the generation of invoices or fund withdrawals to the merchant’s
bank account. Any operation using SDK tools will pay the applicable gateway or service
provider a fee in CLN.

11
The goal of using community currencies as rewards to facilitate payments in fiat between
consumers and merchants is enabled by the network architecture, which allows for the
development of the capability to issue crypto-fiat pegged to the corresponding fiat
money by gateways holding fiat deposits.​[14]

2.3.2 Clients Layer
The clients layer interfaces with end-users—consumers and merchants. Tokens issued
on the CLN network will be compatible with any Ethereum wallet. A key requirement of
this layer is that it is independent of the CLN network. The CLN network will incentivize
many potential players to build clients on top of the CLN, and it will be attractive thanks
to the capabilities it will provide for processing fiat payments and cryptocurrencies. The
freedom of clients to bypass the CLN network in order to process payments will drive the
CLN network to focus on providing value-added services that reduce the technical
barriers and increase usability of payments on the blockchain.

12

3. THE ROLE AND DESIGN OF COMMUNITY CURRENCIES
The CLN network lowers the barriers that stakeholders are facing when attempting to
launch and maintain a new financial system in their community by providing them with
tools and services that make it easier to launch a new digital payment infrastructure
and design the growth engines that will make it flourish.
Community currencies that could be issued on the CLN network, may be used to offer
incentives to end-users in the community (consumers and merchants) as well as
developers and service providers. Thus community currencies could support an organic
reward scheme for transactions being made within the community. The community
currency will be issued by community gateways, with a transparent supply schedule
and distribution rules.
The community currency will serve as an alternative medium of exchange and store of
value, allowing users to transact with it freely with any Ethereum-compatible wallet. In
order to create a mechanism that allows this functionality, the CLN network will provide
two main network tools:
Issuance—​Community currencies will be issued as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum,
leveraging Ethereum smart contract capabilities to set and enforce business rules like
milestone-based access to funds for issuers. This will remove the current need for users
to have blind trust in issuers. Any deviation from, or agreed change in, supply or
governance is visible and verifiable by the public.
Liquidity provision​—Providing liquidity for newly issued currencies requires major effort,
and is addressed by the automatic market-making contract. In order for the community
currency vision to be realised there is a need for liquidity, so that supply and demand
forces will manifest in the price. This is achieved by leveraging smart contracts’
capabilities and by using the CLN as a reserve currency.

13
The CLN network thus solves the fundamental chicken-and-egg problem, as engaged
communities will be able to launch currencies regardless of their size, location, or
transactional volume. In doing so, they will be able to benefit from having access to a
decentralized group of stakeholders and service providers that take on a variety of roles
in the value chain. The implication is an open-source and distributed financial framework,
facilitating a safe and transparent payment system, accessible to all.

3.1 THE ISSUANCE OF COMMUNITY CURRENCIES
Community currencies will be issued by stakeholders within the community. These
stakeholders will have a vested interest in the success of the community. Organizations
like community banks, credit unions, merchants’ associations and the like are potential
issuers. We refer to these organizations as community issuers. All communities will be
interconnected through the CLN.
Each community issuer can launch a new community currency for its local community.
The issuance and allocation process will be transparent and publicly verifiable using an
Ethereum smart contract. The currency will be an ERC-20 token that will be compliant
with any Ethereum wallet.
As part of the issuance process the issuer locks a certain amount of CLN in an automatic
market-making contract. The lock-in of CLNs releases a portion of community currency
tokens to the issuer and establishes an “issuance price” for the community currency.
That is, the amount of CLNs locked in by the issuer determines the initial value of the
local community, measured by the product of the amount of circulating tokens and the
issuance price. From this point onwards, this price evolves according to the flow of
trades sent by anyone to the market making contract. If the issuer chooses not to lock
any CLNs in the reserve of the market making contract, the issuance price is set to zero
and all community currency tokens are locked in the contract initially, implying a starting
value of zero to the community. Any appreciation in value from this point onwards will be
as a result of demand for the community currency, paid for in CLNs.
In fact the issuer can allow investors to participate in the issuance process and
receive community currency tokens in exchange for their investment in CLNs. See
Appendix 2 for a detailed description of the process.

14
The two reserves established by the issuance process will provide a functionality of
exchange, and thus liquidity, for community currencies, without having to list these
currencies on centralized exchanges in the early stages, during which the potential value
of doing so is relatively small.
The issuance process of a community currency could allow a milestone-based process
for the allocation of CLN funds received and tokens issued. This supports an alignment
of interests whereby additional community currency is released to a community issuer as
the economic activity in the community—measured, for example, by the volume of
transactions—increases, in order to cover their growing operational costs.
As the community currency network expands, new issuers and gateways will integrate into
the network. Through the CLN network, financial institutions and companies will be able to
offer value-added services, further stimulating local economic development and growth.

3.2 THE PROVISION OF LIQUIDITY FOR COMMUNITY CURRENCIES
Once a local payment system, supported by a community currency, is up and running, it
will generate value by increasing competition on the price, quality, and variety of services
relative to existing means of payment and other relevant services. However, this value
will have to be built up over time, and be reflected in the value of the community
currency. Consequently, consumers and merchants will likely value the option to
exchange a community currency for the CLN network token or for other cryptocurrencies
that can be used as means of payment or stores of value. Furthermore, participants may
want to convert these tokens to fiat money.
However, it is unlikely that there will be sufficient liquidity for community currencies at
their inception. Participants looking to exchange community currencies may not find a
counterparty to trade with. On a typical exchange, the price of the asset is determined in
response to the supply of and demand for the traded asset, and so the price reflects a
willing exchange between a buyer and a seller. While there is no way to mimic the
behavior of such an exchange mechanically, the CLN network will provide the community
currency gateway with a tool that allows it to act as a market maker for the community
currency, from the time of issuance. It will do so by executing exchange transactions
automatically using a smart contract according to a preset formula. We will refer to this
process as “mechanical market making”.

15
There are a number of important features that a liquidity model should satisfy. First, as
argued above, it is important to realize that mechanical market making, predetermined
and “set in stone” (or smart contract), cannot mimic the behavior of a real-time market
exchange. In fact, hypothetically, were the community currencies to be traded on an
exchange, there could be a gap between the exchange rate on the exchange and the
one determined by the mechanical market-making contract. Therefore, it is important that
the way that the contracts are implemented should not prevent the CLN and the
community currencies from being traded on exchanges (other than through the
mechanical market maker) or prevent other entities from providing an exchange service
in parallel (i.e., function as competing market makers for community currencies).
Moreover, the model should not create unfair conditions that would preclude this in
practice. Consequently, we find it preferable that the mechanism should not have the
authority or capability to alter the amount of community currency issued through the
operation of liquidity provision. Otherwise, the ability of the mechanism to issue or
destroy tokens in the process and affect the value of the currency could potentially harm
the incentives to others to provide liquidity, and could potentially be used to manipulate
the exchange rate. Moreover, the more available means there are for arbitrageurs to
correct a mis-pricing caused by mechanical market making relative to the market
perception, the smaller such possible gaps in pricing are likely to be.
Second, the model should mimic the basic behavior of a market, and therefore should
posses the following characteristics:
●

When there is demand for a community currency its price (relative to the CLN)
should increase, and vice versa when there is demand for CLN in exchange for
the community currency.

●

There should be sufficient liquidity to execute each trade. Our proposal is to
maintain two reserves—one in CLN and another in the community currency—that
are dedicated to serve as a counterparty for each exchange transaction.

●

The price instrument should be used to implement the above characteristics, and
in particular to ensure that the reserves do not exhaust themselves in the
process, unless the entire money supply from one side is being added to the
reserve (in which case it can exhaust the reserve on the other side).

●

The price is only a function of the state of the two reserves and other fixed
parameters (e.g., the amount of tokens issued in total). Therefore, whenever
reserves are in the same state, the exchange price should be the same.

16
The equations that will be used to set the exchange rate for a community currency
against the CLN are provided in the appendix. We show that they maintain this set of
desired properties. We note that the model is inspired by a model presented in an article
titled “Dealership Market - Market-Making with Inventory” by Amihud & Mendelson.1 The
article presents a dealership market which is dominated by a single centralized
market-maker. The possible temporal discrepancy between market buy and sell orders,
and the obligation to maintain continuous trading, induce the market-maker to carry an
inventory of the stock. The crux of the analysis is the dependence of the quoted bid and
ask prices on the market-maker’s inventory. The paper establishes that the optimal policy
is one where prices are monotone decreasing functions of the inventory at hand. In the
case of linear demand and supply for the stock, transition rates in each state, which
respect a one-to-one correspondence with the bid and ask prices, satisfy an ellipse
equation.

3.3 THE USE OF COMMUNITY CURRENCIES AS REWARDS
FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
The goal of community currencies is to be a store of value for local communities by
connecting consumers and businesses. Thus we envision that the distribution of
community currency will be carried out through purchasing transactions taking place at a
brick-and-mortar merchant’s terminal, as this form of distribution implements the focus of
the CLN network on strengthening economic activity in local economies. To facilitate this,
a portion of each transaction at a merchant’s terminal will be subtracted from the
payment to the merchant and allocated, as a ​reward in community currency​, to the
consumer and the merchant involved in the transaction for their economic activity in the
community and on the network. In particular, when a consumer conducts a transaction
using digital-fiat or crypto-fiat, a portion of the fiat payment will be exchanged to CLN and
then to community currency using the market-making contract before being allocated to
the parties. The use of the community currency in this manner will allow the network to
offer a competitive alternative to traditional financial models.

4. SUMMARY
The CLN creates a decentralized network of tools and services that support community
payment systems. Through the introduction of community currencies, the CLN network
creates a potential link between the economic activity taking place at brick-and-mortar
merchants within the community, which is facilitated by fiat payments (whether digital or
crypto-fiat), and the distribution of the community currency among stakeholders as a reward
for engaging in this economic activity. The CLN network provides a platform for currency
issuers and local gateways to support payments for goods and services and provide other
financial services. Therefore, community currencies lower the barriers for communities to
upgrade their payment infrastructure and reduce costs to intermediaries.

The issuance of crypto-fiat tokens will reflect the gateway’s liabilities to
consumers. The token will behave like any other cryptocurrency except that the
trust in the value of the token issued is merely the trust in the gateway that issued
it to back it up with a fiat deposit and allow its convertibility back to fiat money.

APPENDIX A—MATHEMATICAL EQUATION FOR THE MECHANICAL
MARKET-MAKING CONTRACT
The mechanical market-making contract is a formula that adjusts the exchange rate
between two tokens—the CLN and a community currency—based on the total supply of
tokens from each and the state of the reserves in each currency, which the contract
controls. The reserves and the price evolve over time in response to demand for the
tokens. The formula has a number of desired properties.
Given the total supply of the two tokens S​1​,S​2​, the reserves owned by the contract for the
two tokens, denoted by R​1​ and R​2​ , must satisfy at any time the following equation:

Eq (1):
Alternatively stated, denote the percentage of tokens circulating outside the reserve of
the contract by
, then
. In particular, given the reserve in Token1 R​1​, which determines ​x​, we can
express ​y​ and the reserve of Token2
,
and this determines R​2​ in return,

Note that given that starting conditions for the two reserves satisfy the relationship
above,2 the reserve of either of the tokens exhausts itself only when the entire supply of
the other token is put into the opposite reserve—that is,
and

,

or, alternatively stated, when R​1​=S​1 ​ it implies R​2​=0 and, symmetrically, when R​2​=S​2 ​ then
R​1​=0.

2

The smart contract responsible for the issuance of a new community currency ensures

that starting conditions are satisfied. This is discussed in detail in Appendix B.

23
To derive the price of Token1, differentiate Eq (1) with respect to R​1​,

Price can also be expressed in terms of ​x​ and ​y​,

Note that when the limit cases are approached, the price approaches zero or
infinity—that is, when
R​1​=S​1​ then P=0, and when R​1​=0 then P​1​ approaches infinity.
The smart contract needs to calculate for any amount E1 of Token1 sent to the contract,
and thus added to the reserve of Token1, the corresponding amount E​2​ (in Token2) to be
released from the reserve in exchange.

s.t.

To understand the price behavior, we can derive the percentage change in the price of
Token 2 in response to an amount E​1​ of Token1 sent to be exchanged. Assume that
before the exchange of E​1​,

This can be expressed as

24
After the exchange of E1,
, where
Resulting in

Thus the percentage change in the price of Token2 can be expressed as

As can be seen from the equation, the percentage price change depends on the size of
the reserve relative to the total supply of Token1, and on the size of the amount sent to
be exchanged relative to the size of the reserve.
Alternatively, we can derive an expression for the percentage price change when E​1​ is
measured as a percentage of circulating supply outside the reserve of the contract. Let
, where
.
After the exchange of E1,

Thus, the percentage change in the price of Token2 can be expressed as

APPENDIX B—MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF THE ISSUANCE OF A
COMMUNITY CURRENCY AND THE LOCK-UP OF INITIAL RESERVES

The process
We want to define the parameters that an issuer has to provide the smart contract in
order to facilitate a process that: a) issues a community currency, and b) establishes a
two-side reserve in the CLN (Token 1) and in the community currency (Token 2). Denote
the total supply of CLN by S​1​. There are two types of issuance procedures:
● Where CLN tokens are sent to the issuance contract by the issuer, referred to as
“issuance with issuer’s own fund”
● Where the issuer specifies certain parameters for the issuance, but CLN tokens
are sent to the contract by “investors” (i.e., any CLN token holder), referred to as
“issuance with investors’ funds”

Issuance with issuer’s own funds
When issuing using this option, the issuer follows certain steps.
● Step 1: The issuer specifies to the contract the desired amount of tokens to issue,
S​2​. The contract issues the tokens and locks them in the reserve—that is to say,
R​2​=S​2​. This sets the price of Token 2 to zero, as
●

where
Step 2: The issuer then sends an amount,
contract, thus establishing

, of CLN to the market-making

●

Step 3: The issuer receives
of Token 2,
is the ​issuance price, ​and the
total value of Token 2 in circulation (i.e., outside the reserve of the contract) in
CLN terms is equal to

●

Step 4: The market-making contract opens to any Token 1 or Token 2 holders.

Issuance with investors’ funds
When issuing using this option, the issuer follows certain steps.
● Step 1 is the same as in the first option.
● Step 2: The issuer specifies the amount, ​I​1,​ of CLN expected to be received (“hard
cap”) and a fraction of the amount (“soft cap”) designated to be locked in
reserve for the purpose of market making and establishing an issuance price.

●

Step 3: The contracts test the validity of the
pair, verifying that if
of
Token 1 are received, then the value of Token 2 in circulation (in CLN terms) is at
least I​1​—that is, assuming that

of Token 1 are received, then

26

And the requirement is that

Thus requiring that

Note that the expression
satisfies it automatically.

is less than 0.5 for

, and so

●

If the contract passes the validity test, the contract opens to accepting CLN
tokens from investors. Tokens sent to the contract are locked in the reserve.

●

If less than
tokens are sent within the specified time, the contract returns the
tokens to their holders and the contract shuts down (as funds received are below
the “soft cap”). Any tokens in excess of I​1​ (“hard cap”) are not accepted by the
contract. Assuming the amount of tokens sent is within the range

●

, any

tokens in excess of
are sent to the issuer.
Token 2 released from the reserve R​2​ are distributed to investors so that their
value given the issuance price is equal to the value of the investment sent in CLN.
The validity test ensures that there are enough Token 2 in circulation to satisfy
this condition given the issuance price established by the contract. Any excess
Token 2 are sent to the issuer.
