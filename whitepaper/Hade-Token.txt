ANALYSIS

INVESTMENTS

We built a platform that can redefine the standard for equity and crypto research with superior
products and services to the legacy offerings of our competitors. We believe that our ready-touse HADE Platform will do just that; and we aim to take our vision one step further with
the inclusion of blockchain technology to launch premium services, an advertisement
network, as well as to promote social engagement on our platform via a reward system.
The HADE Platform was built around the deployment of innovating technologies such as: data
visualization, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence that will push boundar- ies,
lower costs, and significantly improve the quality of legacy financial services. We believe that
blockchain technologies and HADE Token are crucial elements of that vision, in which our
entire business is built around. We believe that HADE Platform is the first and only product that will
actually bridge the gap between fiat and cryptocurrency investors with products & services to serve
both groups in one place.

WHY BLOCKCHAIN?
MOST OBVIOUS WAYS THAT HADE PLATFORM WILL USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
1 - Customer and user ac- 2 - Payment processing
count verification

from customers and
organizations

3 - Improved security for

database and our customers
against cyber-crime

These three benefits will be seen immediately as we deploy and integrate blockchain technologies, and HADE Token will be an equally large component in realizing these benefits. Naturally,
these benefits give us yet another advantage over the competition.

OUR DATABASE & TECHNOLOGY WITH BLOCKCHAIN
However, deploying blockchain to improve our database and the trust our customers have in
our data could play a huge role in gaining ground on market leaders in our industry.
Customers often wonder how reliable is data. The HADE Platform prides itself in having the
most reliable database due to our manual collection, review, and quality control process before
any information is added to our database. However, being able to source the origination of each
data point in a decentralized, verifiable, immutable ledger would be game-changing as a way to
support the accuracy, management, and reliability of our database, which is the most important
component to our business.
In addition to gaining greater confidence and certainty about the origin of data, we believe
shared data could take our artificial intelligence capabilities and insights to the next level. The
use of blockchain with our database will lead to more data, and thereby increase our capabilities with entirely new models.

WITH BLOCKCHAIN, THE DAYS OF TRUSTING DATA, RESEARCH, AND ITS
CONCLUSIONS ARE OVER. WITH BLOCKCHAIN, DATA IS VERIFIABLE,
AND THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE GAMECHANGER FOR EARLY ADOPTERS OF
THE TECHNOLOGY, LIKE HADE PLATFORM.

HADE.io - HADE TOKEN White Paper

BLOCKCHAIN: THE PERFECT ADVERTISEMENT SYSTEM
What’s great about blockchain is it gives us the power to make leaps forward that were never
before possible with technology. It takes every innovating technology we utilize and makes it
even better. The same applies with our services.
With the integration of blockchain, we will build the world’s first fully transparent advertising
system to enforce accountability, and thereby deliver unprecedented results for ad campaigns.
By developing an advertising system from the ground up with the integration of blockchain,
deceiving advertisers with inflated impressions will be a thing of the past. And we believe this
will make our platform more attractive for advertisers, because with blockchain, conversions are
verifiable, as is the audience who is viewing advertisements.

MARKET OVERVIEW
HADE PLATFORM
Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg are multi-billion dollar companies that derive the overwhelming majority of their revenues from premium financial services. Most individual investors can’t
afford these services, thereby limiting use to finance professionals who can pay upwards of
$20,000 each year for services. As seen in the following chart, the HADE Platform provides the
same core services to individuals for free that one gets by using the Bloomberg Terminal or
Thomson Reuters’ flagship product, the Reuters Eikon.

Over the last year we have built a network of products, services, and tools around our
database, that utilize the world’s most innovating technology. This will allow us to offer services
and products that we believe will redefine the equity research industry altogether; such as real
time in-depth research reports and stock grades on more than 4,000 companies from machine
learning and artificial intelligence technology.

How big is our core market?
Over $50 Billion!
Reuters and Bloomberg are a duopoly in the premium financial services space, but neither
reach the total addressable market of investors because of their respective price. Still, even
with a relatively low penetration of the overall investment research community, these companies generate large sums of revenue. It is believed that the overwhelming majority of Thomson
Reuters’ $4.7 billion in subscription revenue from its Financial & Risk segment came from Eikon
last year. And according to a report by Burton-Taylor International, Bloomberg Terminal subscriptions finished 2016 at 324,485 and created $9.18 billion in revenue. While both companies
can create meaningful revenue from their user base and premium products, the chart below illustrates how far even the larger Bloomberg is from peak penetration of those who do monthly
investment research.

PHASE 1

CREATE A UNIQUE & NECESSARY PRODUCT

2015

The HADE Platform provides a multitude of services, all of which could demand a premium
monthly price. It is the world’s first collection of financial services created from machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to serve finance professionals, individual investors, and
institutions, for the purpose of company information and equity research. What makes these
products and services possible is our database, with unique historical data that can’t be found
anywhere else.
In Phase 1, since we could not acquire the data, we had to create our unique database and the
platform that surrounds it. In order to do so, we had to manually search through company reports for each quarter on thousands of companies. Then we collect data, quality check data, and
finally upload the information into our database. This ongoing project required many full time
data analysts who manually collected and updated company information. These analysts have
manually collected nearly 4,000,000 unique data points that fall in over 100,000 categories on
more than 4,500 companies. We made the HADE Platform so that a user can access any one of
these data points with the click of a button. A user can then compare any one data point to any
other data point they choose, which enables them to then analyze whatever data points they
choose.

HADE.io - HADE TOKEN White Paper

16

While many competitors such as Reuters, Bloomberg, and Morningstar have their own respective databases of company information, The HADE Platform is different because it includes the
unique company data that can’t be found anywhere else.
Here is an image that shows some unique data for MGM Resorts and Visa. You may think that
MGM’s Las Vegas Strip Occupancy Rate, Bellagio revenue, or its Casino revenue is irrelevant.
However, if you are an investor who is trying to find areas of disconnect among various casinos, this detailed data is the difference in determining which would be a good, bad, or great
company to invest in. Or, maybe you are a Las Vegas entertainer or an entrepreneur, seeking
information that can help you in contract negotiations or planning an expansion; HADE Platform
is where you can find the information you need.

Before the HADE Platform, investors would have to manually search for unique company data
in SEC filings and company earning reports. Investors would seek this data because it is what
often determines whether a company is a good or bad investment. What we did was put all that
data in one place for investors to access with the click of a button. We developed the industry’s
most innovating visualization technology, and incorporated unmatched analysis technology to
give users the ability to compare and contrast any combination of data points. This accelerates
the research process that goes into finding a good investment, and by itself, is a product that
institutions would pay to access.

HADE.io - HADE TOKEN White Paper

17

We did not stop there. With such an impressive, unmatched database, we created product
after product, and incorporated the world’s best technology throughout. We invested resources
in machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence. Now, an investor can simultaneously
rank more than 4,500 companies or produce real time research reports on any company with
the click of a button. In addition to this breakthrough technology, we also have interactive predictions and forecasts that look several years into the future by using machine learning algorithms. These algorithms were 63% more accurate than the Wall Street consensus estimates;
that virtually all investment banks, money managers, financial advisors, and investors alike, use
to determine a company’s revenue for the coming quarter or year.

HOW CAN WE ACCOMPLISH WHAT NO OTHER COMPANY IN OUR
INDUSTRY HAS?
It all goes back to our database. Since we have the data that no one else has, we can analyze
companies and potential investments in ways that have never been done. As a result, our service has proven itself extremely useful to finance professionals and individual investors alike.
In a trial of 65 random finance professionals and individual investors, the average time spent on
the HADE Platform per user was 27 minutes and 47 seconds per session, with nearly 30 pages
per session. That compares very well to top social networks like Facebook and Snapchat that
make a fortune from advertising.

As a result, we succeeded in Phase 1 by creating a useful, powerful, truly unique and absolutely
necessary product that we believe will become the new standard for equity research and company information technology. However, our success does not mean we will stop with the development of Phase 1.
We will continuously strengthen our existing database, apply new technologies, and in early
2018 will begin the development of a new database with the same technology for cryptocurrencies and alternative investment information and analysis. We will not only become the
go-to platform for company and financial information and analysis, but also the information and
analysis of cryptocurrencies, Token Sales, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts, and fixed
income investments among others.
You can see our development timeline for our crypto-currency database and products, which
will create a new industry that we believe could generate even more revenue long-term than
our business in equity research software and services, where we expect to operate on a $250
million revenue run rate by October 2020.

THE HADE GIVEAWAY

2017-2018

We are going to give HADE Platform and nearly all of its services away for free. Over the course
of time, this action will cause disruption to the company information technology industry. Investors will find it difficult to pay $1,000 per month for charting services, or $2,000 each month for
even the most wide ranging legacy service providers when they can get most of the valuable
services they desire for free, with better technology and a superior database.

3 Year Outlook For Company Specific Product Services

Reuters Eikon Bloomberg Terminal

Our intention is to introduce traditional investors to the crypto-currency market slowly, and
introduce tokenized investment funds even slower. In the long run, we believe this will be a
far more effective strategy for achieving long-term, sustainable adoption to an alternative, but
cheaper and more secure type of investing.

HADE.io - HADE TOKEN White Paper

20

Our goal in Phase 2 is to grow our network to more than 5,000,000 monthly active users within
36 months. By giving away such valuable products and services, we believe our goal will be met.
The goal in Phase 2 is to create the best possible customer experience, retain all users, and to
continuously grow our user base.
During this 36 month span, we aim to grow the network; disrupting the services and business
models of our competitors, develop new technologies and services that are currently in our
pipeline, collect and analyze internal data; to ensure that Phases 3, 4 and 5 are a success as we
roll out HADE Token Rewards, HADE Advertising Network, and the HADE Store.

HADE.io - HADE TOKEN White Paper

21

PHASE 3

HADE TOKEN REWARDS

2018

The growth and user base of our platform will allow us to build a social network of sorts where
we can incorporate many tools like chat, message boards, and instant messaging to keep users
engaged and sharing the ideas they form by using the HADE Platform.
On the HADE Platform, it is possible to create billions of different charts, all of which tell a story
about a specific company. One reason that users spend so much time on the HADE Platform
is because there are so many services, companies, and so much data to consume. One person
could not possibly absorb it all.
However, a network of users working together and sharing thoughts could, and therefore would
create a more valuable product in the process. That is why we aim to introduce HADE Rewards
in the first quarter of 2018.
HADE Rewards will create a system for delivering HADE Token to users who achieve certain
milestones or carry out certain functions to encourage users to be social, share the content they
create, and play their part in making the HADE Platform the best possible experience for all users. These HADE Token rewards will range from:
^^Publish the charts and content you create to the HADE Platform network
^^Achieve milestones such as 30 likes or comments on content you publish to the
HADE Platform Network.
^^Promote the HADE Platform with referrals
^^Improve the functionality with bug reports and contacting us with any
visualization or analysis issues
The exact number of HADE Tokens per action will be determined at a later time as we near deployment of Phase 3. What we do know is that users are more likely to be engaged when content is
original and diverse. With the HADE Token Reward Program, the quality and quantity of content
will improve and a social network amongst all investors will be created. Meanwhile, the adoption of
HADE Token will serve as the building blocks for the bridge that will connect traditional to cryptocurrency investors, thereby setting the stage for large scale success in Phase 4 and Phase 5.
We will allocate approximately 10% of all outstanding HADE Token to our Rewards Program.

PHASE 4

ADVERTISE WITH HADE TOKEN

2018

Once we surpass 500,000 monthly active users and grow in usage and consumption, advertising opportunities will be created. Those opportunities will only grow as we approach 5,000,000
monthly active users.
Our business is built on staying ahead of the competition and deploying the most innovating
technologies that exist. Blockchain is undoubtedly a natural part of the HADE Platform’s evolution, creating a more secure network for transactions that is cost effective. That’s why we will
use HADE Token as a future component of all transactions that take place on our platform. This
includes, but is not limited to, advertisers, partners, and customers.

As seen in the above chart, usage on HADE Platform is very impressive with virtually no social
media like presence. With the inclusion of HADE Token Rewards, we believe our platform will
become a social network of sorts for the large finance community, thereby keeping the average
time spent on our platform high on a large scale.
With an addressable market of 70 million potential users, expected social media-like usage, the
usefulness of our program, coupled with the HADE Token Rewards program; we believe the
HADE Platform can penetrate the $36 billion social media advertising market, thereby creating
meaningful usage potential for HADE Token.

HADE STORE

2018

The HADE Store will be an ever-evolving hub for premium financial services within our platform.
This will include HADE Platform premium services and that of other financial service providers.
While we present HADE Store as the fifth stage in our disruption process, it will likely be the
first or second deployed use of HADE Token since three of our premium services are ready for
purchase at this time.
With that said, the HADE Store will be add on items that users can purchase to add value to
their HADE Dashboard of services. This will be the first time we put our blockchain technology to
use by allowing users to subscribe to additional services with HADE Token and USD as payment
options.

By incorporating blockchain technology and HADE Token into our equity research platform,
we have a great opportunity to bridge two investment worlds, traditional with crypto-currency.
Many traditional investors who have never owned a cryptocurrency will be exposed to its usage
on the HADE Platform. Therefore, with a network of crypto-currency owners and traditional investors, we will create services and products within the HADE Store to serve all while expanding
our platform’s free usage to serve more customers.

and financial information with products and services built around
that database for the purpose of analysis. We will continue to

investments, along with crypto-currencies and Token Sales.

With that said, Stages 1, 2, and 3 will further ensure that the HADE

for competing premium financial services (Stage 1) we ensure
that the HADE Platform is a service that all investors and cryptocurrency owners will use. By letting users access this product for

The premium services we will sell in the HADE Store are cutting edge beyond anything in the
multi-billion dollar equity research industry. Three of these services are already created and
market ready, and what’s so appealing about these services is that A) they are real time and B)
compare any company against 1,000s of others to truly allow investors to find misplaced bets.

^^A service that grades all

opportunity.

^^A service that grades all

for its attractiveness as a

These are services that many in our large network of users will purchase. Since many of these
users will own HADE Token via the Token Rewards Program, using HADE Token for services will
be a popular choice. We believe there are many ways in which the HADE Store will encourage
the use and purchase of HADE Token.

Hade store will:
^^Allow users who own
HADE Token to purchase
premium services.
^^Promote the
purchase of additional
HADE Tokens for users
who have earned or
bought some HADE Token,
but don’t own enough to

^^Showcase the

^^Encourage the use of

cheaper to process.
^^Incentivize the
participants of HADE Token

their contributions to the
program.
^^Give traditional
investors a sense of
familiarity and comfort with
using cryptocurrencies to
make real life purchases.

^^Let traditional

concern.

HADE TOKEN MARKET OPPORTUNITY
We believe the HADE Store has a huge opportunity in the premium financial services space, an
arena where Reuters and Bloomberg created nearly $15 billion combined last year. With what
we believe are superior services, the opportunity to create meaningful revenue from the HADE
Store, with HADE Token, could be unprecedented for a crypto-currency.
As explained in Phase 3, which detailed why we believe the HADE Platform will penetrate the
social media advertisement spending market, coupled with our target market of premium financial services, we estimate our total addressable market at $51 billion for HADE Platform’s core
service related to equity research.
We believe that HADE Platform will eventually surpass $1 billion in annual revenue from the
HADE Store and HADE Advertising as we pursue crypto-currency research, online brokerage,
and investment products.
While it is difficult to accurately predict
what percent of our transactions and rev-

The graph above illustrates our expected monthly active user growth trajectory from HADE Platform launch on September 25, 2017 until October 2020, when we anticipate 5,000,000 monthly

This goal represents a conservative estimate of our addressable market; we internally project
more than twice our goal of 5,000,000 monthly users. We expect to achieve such rapid growth
by implementing the growth strategy detailed in “5 Stages of Market Disruption”, which includes,
allowing free access and use of our platform, implementing a social network of shared investment ideas, and analysis via HADE Token Rewards. It also includes the continuous development
of free and premium financial & company analysis products. We believe our product’s uniqueness and superiority to all existing products and services in our field will allow us to reach, if not
exceed, our monthly active user target of 5,000,000.

IT INFRASTRUCTURE & PROGRAMMING
The HADE Platform was built from the ground up by talented programmers and software engineers. As we grow, it is important to have the right
development, testing, repair, and deployment processes in place to seamlessly scale. That’s why having a top notch programming and IT team has
always been and will remain a top priority.

DATA SCIENCE & ANALYTICS
Our entire business is built around a valuable, unique database that gives
us the ability to visualize, analyze, and create services using the best technology like never before. Our future success depends on the health, size,
and reliability of our database. We must continue to invest and ensure the
growth of our database, while prioritizing the best quality control methods
to be confident in its accuracy.

LEGAL
Many of the services in our pipeline like tokenized investment funds; or
becoming an online brokerage; or a “fiat to token” exchange will require
proper regulatory approval and licenses to function correctly. Furthermore, many of the services and functions of the HADE Platform should
have patent protection. That is why we have and will continue to invest in
protection across all facets of our business.

CUSTOMER SERVICE & TECHNICAL SUPPORT
The HADE Platform was built with the user and easy navigation in mind.

Some of the biggest institutions in the world are being compromised daily,

RESEARCH ANALYSTS
In order to create the world’s best equity research platform, we need

the factors that make each type of company a good investment. We aim to

become more valuable.

INVESTMENTS & PARTNERSHIPS
The HADE Platform aims to become a hub for exclusive services and information that can’t be found anywhere else. One strategy for achieving this

We have identified a list of more than a dozen potential candidates that
