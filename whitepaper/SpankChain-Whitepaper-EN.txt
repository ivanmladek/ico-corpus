Abstract
In this paper, we present SpankChain, an adult entertainment ecosystem powered by
blockchain technology.
The SpankChain ecosystem possesses a tiered architecture featuring three layers:
SpankChain Core, SpankChain Services, and SpankChain Applications.
SpankChain Core is comprised of smart contracts and tooling which provide the
foundational functionalities necessary to operate a streaming or static content distribution
application, namely a user profile system and payment capabilities.
The SpankChain Services layer contains a suite of ancillary services which add enhanced
functionality to applications built upon SpankChain Core, including payment channel hubs,
age verification, live video, an ad network, an affiliate network, indexing/search, and an
interface builder.
SpankChain Applications exist on top of SpankChain Core, leveraging various SpankChain
Services. The applications layer is a collection of branded interfaces that tie together
underlying pieces of the ecosystem to attract paying audiences. The SpankChain team will
develop the ecosystem’s first application, a live cam site aptly named SpankChain.
SpankChain utilizes a multi-token economic model, beginning with the SPANK token.
SPANK is a staking token which can be utilized to mint alternative tokens, offering specific
payment and governance rights throughout the SpankChain ecosystem. The multi-token
model is designed to abstract away ecosystem-wide coordination processes from
mechanisms which meter platform usage rights.
We also introduce a novel verification game called Proof-of-Spank to address underage
model swapping and simultaneously incentivize active participation in the SpankChain
ecosystem.

Introduction
The $100B1 adult entertainment industry has faced routine discrimination at the hands of
banks, payment processors, and financial institutions. These service providers simply
refuse to service those in the adult industry. In 2014, JPMorgan Chase closed the bank
accounts of several high profile porn stars and their families without justification2. In 2015,
Visa and Mastercard stopped processing payments for advertising on B
​ ackpage.com3.
Paypal is notorious for closing the accounts of performers and seizing their funds4. This
discrimination and censorship has persisted despite the FDIC declaring it unconstitutional
and in violation of the First Amendment5.
Making matters worse, middlemen in the adult entertainment industry have historically
extracted exorbitant fees due to a lack of competition in the space. The popular
adult-friendly payment processor ​CCBill​ takes a 10.8-14.5% cut of payments and charges a
$1,000 'high-risk’ registration fee annually, pricing out many potential entrepreneurs. Most
adult camsites take between a 30-50% cut of performer earnings, and adult content
marketplaces such as ​ManyVids​ take a 40% cut or more.
Blockchains represent a viable alternative to the discrimination and inefficiencies of legacy
financial institutions. Public blockchains are globally distributed systems of record that
provide permissionless access to anyone with an internet connection. Anyone, regardless
of their profession, can use a public blockchain to store their funds and transact without
fear of having their accounts shut down. Blockchain transactions also have strong finality
guarantees, so the fraudulent chargebacks used as justification for classifying adult
entertainment businesses as ‘high-risk’ are effectively impossible. Further, blockchains such
as Ethereum, which support smart contracts, can be used to decentralize the business
processes of expensive middlemen and render them obsolete.

The Adult Entertainment Industry
Adult Entertainment Historically
Historically, the adult entertainment industry has consistently driven the mainstream
adoption of new technologies. The printing press was propelled to glory by the publication
of the famous ​I Modi (The Ways)​. I​ Modi, ​which consisted of graphic sexual illustrations and
explicit sonnets, became one of the most widely distributed books of the Italian
Renaissance and compelled many Italians to learn how to read6. Much of the internet’s
early value was captured by way of helping people find pornography. Jimmy Wales, founder
of Wikipedia, funded the collaborative encyclopedia’s early development with revenue from
his adult site Bomis7.
From the printing press to the Super 8 Film, from pay-per-view to VCRs, adult
entertainment has accelerated technology for decades. The vast demand for porn on the
internet has led to the creation of streaming video, credit-card verification sites, web
referral rings and video technologies like Flash​.

Adult Entertainment Today
Today, porn is driving innovation in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) with teledildonics, and there
are physicists implementing advanced fluid dynamics in Virtual Reality (VR) graphics
engines to perfect the “jiggle”.
Currently, the dominant forms of online adult entertainment businesses are paid
membership sites, free tube sites, and live camsites. Paid sites are typically operated by a
studio and charge a monthly subscription fee for access to their full content library.
Free tube sites offer unlimited access to a collection of full-length videos, clips, photos and
mashups. They earn revenue from video and display advertising, primarily supporting
dating apps, adult toys and other porn sites. The most popular free tube site is P
​ ornhub​,
which according to Alexa is the 20th most visited site in the US.
Camsites typically fall into one of two categories: public tipping sites or pay-per-second
private/group sites. Most camsites sell site-specific “tokens” to their viewers which they can
use to tip models or pay for private shows. The most popular camsite is L
​ iveJasmin​, which
offers private shows and is ranked 27th on Alexa. Close behind are ​Chaturbate​ and ​Bonga
Cams​, which offer public tipping shows and are ranked 109th and 149th on Alexa,
respectively.

Adult Entertainment Trends
In the last decade, a few notable adult industry trends have emerged. First, viewers are
migrating from paid membership sites to free tube sites and live cam sites. Presumably,
viewers prefer the range of free options they can find on tube sites and the engagement
they can experience by joining live cam shows relative to purchasing memberships to
individual sites.
Second, social media distribution channels are becoming increasingly important. Studios,
porn stars, and cam models are marketing their new videos and upcoming cam sessions to
their followers on social networks like Twitter, Instagram, and SnapChat. A few tube sites
have begun to build their own social networks so that users can follow their favorite
performers, track their favorite videos, and get personalized recommendations. New
marketplaces have emerged to allow performers to upload their content and sell access to
their fans directly. ManyVids, for example, allows models to charge for access to their
videos, and some performers use the platform to offer paid Skype and texting sessions.
A third trend is the new status quo of rampant piracy perpetrated by free tube sites.
Generally speaking, tube sites are not content creators, so all of their content can be
reasonably expected to be pirated. Only in rare cases will tube sites partner with content
creators to obtain distribution rights and offer them a share of the advertising revenue.
Content creators have little power to defend themselves because the U.S. is complacent
about enforcing DMCA (The Digital Millennium Copyright Act) takedown notices for adult
content. A further complication is that most major tube sites are owned by M
​ indGeek​, the
same porn conglomerate that owns most of the studios producing porn in the first place.
Performers are afraid of speaking out against tube site piracy for fear of being blacklisted
from the studios.

The SpankChain Ecosystem
SpankChain has received significant support from those who recognize the adult
entertainment industry as a driver of innovation and those who understand that the
communities most motivated to switch to a new economic platform are those marginalized
by the existing one.
The SpankChain mission is to bring the core benefits of blockchain technologies - privacy,
security, self-sovereign identity, and economic efficiency - to the adult entertainment
industry. Our goal is to do this while remaining maximally compliant with legal codes.
To execute this mission, we will deploy a framework which provides the core functionalities
necessary to create and operate a streaming or static content distribution application,
while offering a range of services that provide enhanced functionality for these
applications.
The SpankChain ecosystem will be composed of three layers: Core, Services, and
Applications.

6

SpankChain Core
The SpankChain Core layer provides the foundational smart contracts and infrastructure
for the ecosystem: a Performer Registry contract, a Payment Channel contract, and the
Vynos payment channels wallet. These will be open source and free to use.

Performer Registry
The Performer Registry smart contract is the basis for identity in the SpankChain
ecosystem. Performers will use it to create their performer profiles, which will connect their
Ethereum addresses with their existing profiles on social media sites, allow them to receive
identity attestations (e.g. age verification), and allow them to link to any off-chain profile
data they have on I​ PFS​.
Simply having the Performer Registry connect performer Ethereum addresses to their
social media profiles will allow anyone to look up a performer and send them gifts of ETH
or tokens without any intermediaries.
More importantly, moving performer identity to Ethereum and storing their profile data on
IPFS represents a paradigm shift to self-sovereign identity, moving away from centrally
owned identity by traditional web 2.0 platforms. The end result is that performers have
more freedom to switch between sites and applications they prefer since there is total
freedom on the blockchain.

Payment Channel Contract
The Payment Channel contract allows for secure, instant off-chain payments that cost no
gas. It manages the secure opening, closing, and settlement of peer-to-peer payment
channels.
SpankChain currently uses the M
​ achinomy​ payment channel library and its ‘Broker.sol’
smart contract which allows for unidirectional ether-only payment channels. In the future,
we plan to iterate on the Payment Channel contract with new features including token
transfers and trustless hash-locked atomic multi-hop payments.

Vynos
The Vynos wallet is the f​ irst Ethereum wallet​ with support for payment channels. It allows
users to interact with our Payment Channel contract and make signed off-chain payments

7

to our SpankChain Hub. The current implementation is browser-based and lives in an
iframe, allowing users to use it on all devices and without needing to download a browser
extension. Similar to ​MetaMask​, it stores private keys encrypted in the browser’s local
storage.

Vynos will be open sourced in conjunction with the first production release of the
SpankChain camsite. After, we will release an SDK allowing partner sites to easily integrate
Vynos for their viewers and performers to use. In the future, we plan to add support for
connecting to a bounty hunter network (to protect against replay attacks), as well as
support for multi-hop payments.
Vynos is a critical infrastructure component because it fundamentally changes the user
experience of interacting with adult sites. In place of the status quo of usernames,
passwords, email addresses, and credit cards for each website, users with Vynos wallets
will be able to immediately start using and making payments on the SpankChain platform
without any setup. The user’s Ethereum address is their identity, and Vynos acts as a
passport to the entire SpankChain ecosystem.

8

SpankChain Services
The SpankChain Services layer will offer additional paid services to applications built on top
of SpankChain Core. These services will include payment channel hubs, age verification, live
video streaming, an ad network, an affiliate network, indexing/search, an interface builder,
and more. These services are intended to be modular and interoperable, allowing
businesses to pay only for what they require. In other words, we intend to develop the
Amazon Web Services​ of the adult entertainment industry.

Payment Channel Hubs
The SpankChain Payment Channel Hub is the primary economic vector of the SpankChain
ecosystem, allowing users to process payments for a fraction of the cost of traditional
payment processors. Payment channels allow you to group a series of payments into a
single blockchain transaction in order to avoid paying fees on each transaction and waiting
for each transaction to get mined.
Payment channels function similar to bar tabs. For example, a customer at a bar opens a
tab upon arriving, orders some number of drinks, and then settles the final balance with
the bartender when they are ready to leave. Similarly, someone who wants to make
repeated payments for a service (e.g. a live cam show) can open a payment channel with
the service provider by depositing ETH or ERC20 tokens in escrow on a smart contract,
make numerous payments offchain (e.g. tips), then settle the final balance on the smart
contract when they are finished receiving services.

9

In our current implementation, users open payment channels with the SpankChain Hub via
the Vynos interface, deposit funds to the channel, send tips to performers, and make
payments by the minute for private shows. The SpankChain Hub is responsible for verifying
payments, monitoring for replay attacks, tracking performer earnings, and providing
payouts upon request.
The second iteration of the SpankChain Hub will include support for trustless multi-hop
payments, allowing performers and partner sites to receive payouts instantly. In the future,
we plan to open source the SpankChain Hub code and help grow a decentralized network
of payment hubs with the goal of connecting all viewers, performers, and platforms within
the adult industry.

Age Verification
SpankChain will comply with all age verification laws in the jurisdictions we serve.
Performers on our platform will need to provide a valid form of government issued
identification to prove they meet the age requirements for adult entertainment industry
work. SpankChain will be responsible for keeping this sensitive information private and
secure
For platform businesses that wish to list and promote consenting performers, we will share
verification information through an API. In the future, we plan to create an open platform
via which performers can receive age verification attestations on their Performer Registry
profiles.

Live Video
The SpankChain team is developing high-quality live video streaming infrastructure that
supports the entire range of mobile devices. Platform businesses will be able to leverage
our video player SDK to seamlessly connect performers with viewers.
The video player will interoperate with the Vynos wallet, allowing users to join private
shows and pay per second. In the future, we plan to upgrade our video player to be
censorship resistant by supporting P2P connections over WebRTC and fully decentralized
video streaming protocols like ​LivePeer​.

Ad Network
Outside of payment processing, advertising represents the largest opportunity for
monetization in the SpankChain ecosystem. The SpankChain team plans to develop an
advertising network for display ads, video ads, and native ads (e.g. cam models reading
sponsor messages). Our goal is to maximize revenue share with the entertainers whose

10

audiences we target. We believe this will motivate many performers and studios to make
the SpankChain ecosystem the primary distribution channel for their free content.
The first version of our ad network will only serve SpankChain applications, but we plan to
release an SDK for platform businesses to use as well. The ad network architecture will use
state channels to track impressions and conversions in real-time and eventually move to a
per-ad micropayment model8. In the future, we plan to use a token curated registry
mechanism, similar to A
​ dChain​, to verify that sites and apps selling their advertising
opportunities are not fraudulent.

Affiliate Network
In place of rigid, exclusive promotional agreements with centralized camsites, we plan to
create an open market for promotional revenue-sharing agreements through our affiliate
network. Performers and platform businesses who wish to promote their live cam sessions
and paid content can join our affiliate network to connect with distribution partners, give
them unique referral links, and reward them with a share of the spend from viewers that
followed their links.
Just like our ad network, the affiliate network will only be available to SpankChain
applications at first, made available later to platform businesses through an SDK. The
affiliate network will interoperate with Vynos to manage affiliate payouts via payment
channels.

Indexing/Search
SpankChain will expose an indexing/search API and SDK for platform businesses that want
to help promote performers connected to the SpankChain platform on their own sites and
apps. This API will allow them to access a list of live entertainers, search for entertainers by
name and by keywords, and search for content by keyword. We plan to integrate payment
channels with the API and use a metered access pay-per-query model.

Interface Builder
The Interface Builder will help non-technical performers and businesses easily set up their
own applications to display their profiles, sell their content, and stream their cam sessions.
It will integrate with the SDKs for all our services and provide a WYSIWYG (what you see is
what you get) interface for site creation. The WYSIWYG editor will feature a set of standard
template options and offer tools allowing for the rearranging and alteration of elements of
an interface in real time.

SpankChain Applications
The SpankChain Applications layer is composed of user interfaces that target various adult
industry audiences. These applications can be specific to performers (e.g. Kayden Kross) or
launch partners (e.g. C
​ amversity​), language specific, interest based (e.g. fetish), or device
specific (e.g. Virtual Reality).
To bootstrap the SpankChain ecosystem, we will launch a live camsite named SpankChain,
to be followed by an adult content marketplace developed in collaboration with d
​ istrict0x​,
The Red Light District. We anticipate our efforts paving the way for third party platform
developers to join us in building apps on our platform. Our vision for the SpankChain
ecosystem is to have a wide variety of adult sites and apps built on top of the same
infrastructure, SpankChain Core, allowing users and performers to seamlessly switch
between any applications in our ecosystem.

SpankChain Camsite
To bootstrap adoption of our platform, we will build and operate our own adult camsite. At
large, it will function like most existing camsites. Users will be able to join public shows for
free and pay in tips, or they can pay per second to get access to private and group shows.
Differentiating ourselves from the current industry options, we plan to charge a 5% fee on
model earnings, in stark contrast to the 30-50% charged by traditional camsites today.

12

The Red Light District
The Red Light District will allow performers to upload and sell digital content directly to
their fans. The Red Light District is being developed as a joint venture with the ​district0x
Network​, a collective of decentralized community owned and operated marketplaces.
Users will be able to purchase content directly via ETH and ERC20 transactions or by using
the Vynos wallet and SpankChain Hub.
Marketplaces on the district0x Network leverage the A
​ ragon framework​ to provide
community governance options via the district0x Network Token (DNT). Both teams have
agreed to allow the Red Light District to be jointly governed with both DNT and SPANK
tokens. As the total supply of either token is 1B each (2B total), they will be treated in equal
accord. Either token can be staked to the Red Light District’s deposit pool to mint tokenized
voting rights in the Red Light District’s Aragon entity. These voting rights can be utilize to
propose and vote on various aspects of the Red Light District.
We anticipate that the primary topics the community of token holders will propose and
signal for will be the development roadmap, content quality controls, content ranking
algorithms, the implementation of revenue generating modules, and the parameters of any
modules in use.

Future Applications
Our goal is to make the SpankChain platform as open to innovation as possible, and we
anticipate that third parties will use our platform to build applications which we could

13

never anticipate. That said, here are some of the applications that we do anticipate being
launched across the SpankChain ecosystem.
●
●
●

●

●

Porn Bounties​ - A platform for crowdfunding the creation of new porn scenes,
which could involve celebrities and sending some fraction of the proceeds to charity.
Ethereum Webcam Hardware​ - A webcam with a built-in hardware wallet and
Vynos integration.
Tube Site​ - A tube site with free content paid for by advertising, possibly with an
integrated attention market which allows users to earn a fraction of the ad revenue
or pay the real-time price of an ad in order to avoid it.
VR Apps​ - The same set of apps that exists for the web (i.e. live cams, content
marketplace, etc..), but also live social events (e.g. a strip club cantina where the
dancers are holographic projections of real dancers).
Adult Dating​ - An adult dating matchmaking service that connects people based on
their porn preferences.

Market Opportunity and Strategy
Aggregation Theory (​link​) states that when transaction costs fall, existing
distributor-supplier relationships stop being as important as user experience. With
payment channels, we can reduce transaction costs by one to two orders of magnitude, so
we fully expect UX to be the most important differentiating factor moving forward. With
SpankChain positioned to launch a community-owned ecosystem of adult dapps, all usable
through a secure cryptocurrency wallet and without needing email addresses or credit
cards, we believe we have an opportunity to gain significant market share.

Market Strategy
Our go to market strategy is to partner with top performers who have loyal followings and
provide them with the tools to launch their own branded sites for both camming and clips
on the SpankChain platform. This strategy is informed by our observation that performers
are already disintermediating traditional distributors by cultivating followers for their
personal social media brands and advertising their cam sessions and clips to their fans
directly. This makes performers less dependent on the expensive paid advertising
campaigns that traditional distributors run. In turn, this presents us with an opportunity to
unbundle tech and payments from marketing and branding, and offer our superior
technology at lower prices (​link​).

14

Advertising Opportunity
SpankChain will also attempt to capitalize on the massive arbitrage opportunity that
currently exists in advertising on adult content. An intuitive but obscure fact is that
advertising on adult content - even major tube sites - typically earns 10x less than
advertising on mainstream platforms like Google and Facebook9. This is despite the
well-known statistics that nearly everyone watches porn10. The explanation is simple: big
brands don’t want to associate with adult content.
We believe that gradually, over the next few years, this will change. For context, advertising
revenue has consistently been 1-1.5% of the US GDP for the last 100 years11, which means
that advertising is a zero-sum game (more ad spend in one area means less in another).
Today, estimates suggest that at least 20% of the $80B online advertising market is
fraudulent12. As the sex positivity movement continues to expand and the cultural stigma
against sex and adult entertainment unwinds, we expect that some of this $16B+ will move
from targeting botnets to targeting real humans consuming adult content, increasing
revenues across the entire adult industry.

Token Model
SpankChain utilizes a multi-token economic model, beginning with the SPANK token.
SPANK is a staking token which can be utilized to mint alternative tokens offering specific
payment and governance rights throughout the SpankChain ecosystem. The multi-token
model is designed to abstract away ecosystem-wide coordination processes from
mechanisms which meter platform usage rights.
SpankChain will mint a finite supply of 1,000,000,000 SPANK.
For metering platform usage rights, SpankChain will develop a staking contract called the
SpankBank which will allow SPANK holders to lock down their SPANK tokens to generate
BOOTY tokens, which are redeemable for $1 in SpankChain infrastructure fees. While
viewers will be able to pay models in ETH or any ERC20 token that models accept;
performers and platform businesses can pay their SpankChain fees (payment channel
hubs, live video, etc.) in BOOTY.
This token model makes it possible to make a one time purchase of SPANK and then use
the generated BOOTY to pay for SpankChain fees. At a very basic level, SPANK function as

15

fee credit (BOOTY) generation machines. As a result, SPANK give access to the platform at a
fixed cost, comparable to holding a license.

BOOTY Generation
In order to mint BOOTY from SPANK, holders needs to lock down SPANK tokens. Locking
down a token means that the token cannot be transferred during this period. The exact
amount of BOOTY generated by the locking transaction is known prior to the users decision
to lock down the SPANK tokens. This number is determined algorithmically and
implemented by a smart contract. The algorithm adjusts the BOOTY emission rate
constantly to create the right amount to maintain the total at 20 times the average monthly
BOOTY use. Consequently, when the use of the platform grows, the amount of BOOTY
generated per SPANK grows along with it. When the use of the platform is stagnant, the
amount of BOOTY generated per SPANK remains the same. In this scenario, for every
BOOTY consumed, one new BOOTY is generated. This will prevent hyperinflation of BOOTY
and thus will give it a stable utility value. The lockdown period can be chosen by the user
with options ranging from one month to twelve months. 30%(*) of the new BOOTY is
generated immediately, and the rest is generated continuously over the locking period.
Longer lock down periods receive a slightly higher BOOTY/time ratio.

16

The above table demonstrates a hypothetical BOOTY generation scenario. Initially, the total
BOOTY supply is 200. During the first time period, 10 BOOTY is consumed in fees. Because
the SpankBank BOOTY generation algorithm targets a total BOOTY supply of 20x the usage
of each period, the new target BOOTY supply is 200. At the end of the first time period, 10
new BOOTY is generated and the final BOOTY supply is 200.
During the second time period, the platform usage increases to 20 BOOTY, so the new
target BOOTY supply is 400 and 220 new BOOTY are generated to hit the target (200 - 20 =
180; 180 + 220 = 400). In time period 3, platform usage decreases to 15 BOOTY which
makes the target BOOTY supply 300. No new BOOTY is generated at the end period 3
because the total BOOTY supply is already 385—above the 300 target. In periods 4 and 5
we see platform usage stabilize at 20 BOOTY and so the target BOOTY supply is 400 in
both. In period 4 the SpankBank generates 35 new BOOTY (to make up for the 15 used in
period 3) and in period 5 only the 20 that were used are generated.
In all of the above rounds, BOOTY is distributed proportionally to SPANK holders who have
chosen to stake their SPANK on the SpankBank smart contract, taking into account the
varying lockup periods.

Proof-of-SPANK
One problem which plagues live camsites is age verified models “swapping” with underage
performers. Short of constantly running verification software, performer swapping is
difficult to detect. In order to address swapping and simultaneously incentivize active
participation in the SpankChain ecosystem, we are introducing a novel verification game
called P
​ roof-of-Spank​. Every 10 minutes, one performer doing a live public show will be
selected at random for spanking. Using a source of randomness (e.g. a recent blockhash)
the performer will be presented with four numbers between 1-20, recite all four, pick one,
and then spank themselves live that many times. Everyone staking SPANK on the
17

SpankBank contract will have the opportunity to participate in a token vote on whether the
current performer matches their profile—if they vote that the performer is actually an
imposter, the performer’s account will be revoked.
In order for those staking their SPANK in the SpankBank contract to receive their newly
minted BOOTY, they must participate in at least some to-be-determined number of
Proof-of-Spank rounds every month. As we scale, the SpankChain team plans to work
closely with the Plasma project to develop an infinitely scalable, hierarchical Proof-of-Spank
blockchain system.

Fee Options
If BOOTY were the only option to pay for fees on SpankChain someone might think about
speculating on and horde BOOTY. We prevent this from happening by letting models and
platform pay their fee with any widely used token they are willing to accept for payment
(ETH / BTC-tokens / USD-tokens).

Fee Reduction Mechanism
We assume that most fees will be paid in BOOTY however, if fees are paid with any other
token these fees will be credited directly to an external auction contract. The auction
contract will sell the fees for SPANK. The SPANK acquired in this way will be used
permanently to reduce the platform fee via concurrently triggering a linear fee reduction.
For instance, if 10% of all existing SPANK is held by the auction contract, the fee will be
automatically reduced by 10%. If the auction contract were to hold all SPANK tokens the
fees would be 0. This long term perspective makes SpankChain even more appealing today
for users and application developers. This process will not decrease the utility of the
remaining SPANK. If the use of SpankChain remains constant, a fee reduction of 10% would
mean that 10% less BOOTY is consumed and therefore 10% less BOOTY is generated as
well. The newly generated BOOTY would then be distributed to 10% less SPANK tokens as
the SPANK held by the smart contract does not receive BOOTY. Consequently, the ratio of
BOOTY generated per user holding SPANK would stay constant. If we assume that reduced
fees will lead to increased platform use, we can assume that the BOOTY/SPANK ratio will go
up.

Token Distribution
The SpankChain Genesis Contract will mint ​1,000,000,000 SPANK​ tokens. The minted
SPANK will be allocated as follows:
●
●
●

Up to ​600,000,000 SPANK w
​ ill be distributed during our Oct. 31 token sale. Leftover
SPANK tokens will be distributed back into our reserve.
160,000,000 SPANK​ will be distributed to founding team, team members, advisors,
and early contributors.
240,000,000 SPANK w
​ ill be reserved for platform subsidies, industry partners,
strategic incentives, and additional fundraising.

SPANK tokens minted for allocation to founders, advisors, and early contributors, are
subject to a one year time lock. The SpankChain team intends to keep 95% of SPANK
tokens held in reserve locked up for a minimum of 6-months following the launch.

Token Auction
The SpankChain token sale will be conducted through a custom, single-round, blind, dutch,
state channel auction system which eliminates blockchain network congestion and also
allows our team greater flexibility to determine the price and quantity of tokens sold.
Of the 1 billion SPANK tokens minted, we plan to sell between 30%-60% (300M-600M) for
between $5M-$69M in ETH. The final price and quantity will be determined by the
SpankChain team once all bids have been received. All buyers will receive their purchased
SPANK for the same final price.

Purchase Phase
There will be a ​2 week​ ​purchase phase​ during which buyers will submit an ETH deposit to
the auction smart contract and then submit any number of bids offchain through our
website (using​ ​MetaMask​) ​to our server. Bids will each have an ETH quantity and an
ETH/SPANK price, and thus will approximate a buyer’s demand curve for SPANK.

In the above hypothetical auction, buyer 0x6969 places a 100 ETH deposit with the
‘Auction.sol’ smart contract, and then sends a series of signed bids offchain to the
SpankChain server.
By bidding 50 ETH at 0.0004 ETH / SPANK ($120M Mkt Cap @ $300 / ETH) and 75 ETH at
0.0003 ETH/ SPANK ($90M Mkt Cap), they are rationally choosing to bid less ETH at higher
SPANK prices.
Because our auction contract verifies that signed bids and deposits are made from the
same Ethereum address, and because we require buyers to sign their bids from their
MetaMask wallets, ether deposits must also be placed from MetaMask (or at least using the
same private key as MetaMask).

20

Processing Phase
At the end of the the purchase phase, a ​1 week processing phase​ will begin. SpankChain
will generate a cumulative demand curve from all bids, evaluate it against our internal
supply curve, and decide on the strike price. We will submit this strike price to the auction
smart contract and submit selected bids (max 1 per buyer) to the contract for processing.
Once all selected bids have been processed, we will trigger the completion of the auction,
which will enable withdrawals of both ETH and SPANK for buyers and for SpankChain.

21

In the above continuation of the hypothetical auction from the previous diagram, after
seeing all the bids, SpankChain decides on a strike price of 0.0003 ETH / SPANK.
SpankChain sets this strike price on the auction contract and then submits the 75 ETH bid
from 0x6969 and the 269 ETH bid from 0x1337 to the contract as well. After that,
SpankChain ends the auction, withdrawing the ETH proceeds and all unsold SPANK. Once
the auction is complete, buyer 0x6969 withdraws 325K SPANK (accounting for their 30%
presale registration bonus) and their 25 remaining ETH (deposit of 100 ETH - bid quantity of
75 ETH), and buyer 0x1337 withdraws 897K SPANK and 0 ETH.
Both of the accepted bids in the above example were exactly at the strike price—if there
were accepted bids above the strike price they would have received the strike price as well.
The SpankChain team can trigger auction completion any time during the processing
phase; failure to do so before the end of the processing phase will result in a void auction
and a full ETH refund for all buyers.
The auction can only be completed successfully if the global constraints set at deployment
are respected. If the total SPANK sold is outside of 30%-60% the total issuance, or if the ETH
proceeds are not between $5M-$69M, any attempts to complete the auction will fail.
In case of emergency during either the purchase phase or processing phase, the
SpankChain team has the ability to cancel the auction which will allow buyers to
immediately withdraw all their deposited funds.

Bid Selection
During the processing phase, SpankChain submits selected bids (max 1 per buyer) at or
above the strike price to the auction contract until the desired quantity of ETH to accept is
reached. SpankChain has full discretion over which bids to select and submit. Generally
speaking, SpankChain intends to prioritize bids from registered presale buyers over regular
unregistered auction participants, but we make no guarantees of participation for any
buyers. If demand is high, it is quite possible for a buyer to place a bid above the strike
price and still not have it accepted.
In a high-demand auction, SpankChain may choose to favor a broader distribution by
selecting smaller bids from a greater number of buyers. For example, if the strike price is
0.0003 ETH / SPANK, and a buyer has one bid exactly at 0.0003 ETH / SPANK for 75 ETH and
another bid at 0.0004 ETH / SPANK for 50 ETH, we may select the higher priced bid (the
buyer would still get the same strike price). We suspect that anyone placing a bid to buy
SPANK for ETH will be happy to receive more SPANK for the same amount of ETH.

22

Contract Audits
The SpankChain auction contract has received two independent audits and been subjected
to a $50K bug bounty. The first bounty was conducted by Andrey Petrov and Max Veytsman
in August on an early version of the auction, and the second was conducted by the
Blockchain at Berkeley (B@B) and completed on October 18th on the most recent auction
version. One participant in the bug bounty found an adversarial owner re-entrancy attack
that would allow SpankChain to call the ‘completeSuccessfulAuction’ function on the
auction contract multiple times and withdraw additional ether. This bug was also
discovered independently during the B@B audit, and has since been fixed. No other bugs
were reported.

Secure Browser Signing
Another security concern addressed by the SpankChain team is cross-site scripting attacks
in the browser. In order to participate in the auction, buyers must sign their bids using the
MetaMask chrome extension. The web3 javascript object injected by MetaMask is secure
against tampering by malicious client-side javascript due to process isolation enforced by
the browser security model. However, the bid signing process takes place in two steps:
First, the bid parameters are sent to web3 to be hashed, and only then is the resulting hash
is sent back to web3 to be signed. This leaves a vulnerability open for malicious client-side
JS to replace the hash the buyer is about to sign, which in the worst case could be a real
Ethereum TX that sends the attacker all the buyer's ether.
To eliminate this class of attack forever, we implemented Ethereum Improvement Proposal
(EIP) 712 (​link​), which combines hashing and signing into a single, secure, web3 function
called ‘eth_signTypedData’. We also worked closely with the MetaMask team to include our
implementation in the MetaMask extension (​link​).

Roadmap
SpankChain intends to deliver a decentralized adult social network with integrated
payments and self-sovereign identity. To accomplish this more quickly, we plan to start
with centralized infrastructure and focus on building our community and improving user
experience with payment channels. Once we build the SpankChain camsite and the Red
Light District, we plan to modularize and decentralize the infrastructure components and
offer them to our platform partners. For more information, check out our comprehensive
roadmap dependency graph (​link​).
