HedgeTrade: Blockchain Enabled Social Trading
August 2019

Abstract
Capital markets, in general, are riddled with fear, uncertainty, and doubt. As a result,
volatility cannot be explained through conventional principles and financial predictions
available on the internet generally become baseless and hard to trust. The lack of a
democratic process when determining reliable information with the sheer volume of
participants leaves many with information that is challenging to rely on. HedgeTrade is a
networking hub for financial and cryptocurrency trading experts, and for newcomers
seeking trading predictions for cryptocurrencies, stocks, options, commodities, or any other
tradable product. The HedgeTrade platform is driven by the HEDG token, this improves
investor confidence for these predictions through staking mechanisms operated via smart
contracts, and through a proprietary user rank algorithm that highlights users with excellent
performance.

Introduction

Financial prediction markets are speculative markets created with the intent of trading
outcomes for financial instruments from participants. The structure of these markets is very
simple; users trade contracts through an exchange that provides payout. Prediction markets
work using similar fundamental principles that drive other markets. The value of assets is
uncertain, so a large number of traders attempt to profit by trading based on their beliefs,
analytics, and available information. Prediction markets are important for the development
of a trusted and transparent economy. Blockchain technology allows traders to enter
predictive contracts without the need of a broker to manage the trade. ​Prediction markets
have an enhanced capability to efficiently aggregate all accessible data that is pertinent to
the outcome of an event. A large number of firms have thousands of active traders
producing millions of dollars in trading volume with exponentially growing profits, but most
are not taking advantage of the potential of prediction markets.

How HedgeTrade Works
Blueprint Staking Mechanism

The HedgeTrade platform incorporates blockchain technology directly into its functionality
whereby traders submit predictions into a smart contract driven "Blueprint1" that will
execute true or false results based on real market information. HedgeTrade rewards traders
with HEDG tokens for successful predictions as paid for by the Blueprint purchasers. If the
trader makes a correct prediction via the Blueprint, they will receive tokens from the
purchasing audience. Otherwise, the tokens are returned to the purchaser as coded in the
smart contract. This reward and automated verification system greatly enhances a trader's
credibility, motivation to succeed, and earning potential.
Each smart contract is written based on parameters set by the trader using the HedgeTrade
web application. Any audience member can then 'buy' this analysis, or 'Blueprint.' Depending
on the result of the Blueprint (a correct or incorrect trading prediction), the contract will
then execute an outcome when specific parameters are carried out. The executed contract
will affect the trader's reputation, ranking and HEDG earnings; HEDG is only awarded from
the purchasing audience to the trader upon making a correct Blueprint, otherwise the HEDG
tokens are returned to the audience members. This means that audience members will only
'pay' for trader recommendations with HEDG if their Blueprint is 'true,' otherwise the smart
contract will execute a 'false' outcome and return the HEDG to the audience member.
The purpose of the smart contract integration into the Blueprints is to create a higher level of
validation, verification and transparency of analyst performance, which in turn affects their
ranking and reward.

2.2

Proof-of-Rank

The Proof-of-Rank algorithm is a proprietary multi variable set of formulas which assigns
each trader on the platform an overall rank. It can be understood as leveraging the
blockchain’s most powerful property, its immutable ledger, which will integrate our
proprietary algorithm that effectively quantifies the prediction performance of each
Blueprint creator. Blueprints will thus carry an intrinsic value based on the trader's track
record and ranking.
This scheme allows data to be indexed relative to importance and value. Our implementation
of multiple variables within the algorithms will consist of numerous factors, a sampling of
which are listed below as examples:
1. Birth of account

​A key feature of the staking mechanism. It contains the details of a user’s personalized prediction in
the form of a smart contract.

v4.1

2. Number of successful Blueprints
3. Viewership
4. Unique contributors
5. Amount of HEDG earned
6. Account age of contributors
7. Streak
All these factors, among a proprietary list of others, are taken into consideration to output an
assessment of users/data and distinguish a level of credibility for the platform and each
user.
Implementation
The premise of the formula is to filter each individual and provide an accurate risk analysis
on the user as they grow their track record.
Let R(u,t) be the Proof-of-Rank function describing a user u at a time t. R(u,t) is a real-valued
function where u=(u\_1,u\_2,...,u\_N) is an N-dimensional vector of real values.
R(u,t) = f(u,t, w(t))
Where w(t) is a real-valued scalar weighting function, independent of the user u, and only
depending on the time.

2.3

Oracle

In our context, an Oracle is an agent that finds, validates and submits market information to
the blockchain to be used by our smart contracts. When a particular value (i.e., date/time,
price, etc.) is reached an event automatically triggers. The primary task of an Oracle is to
provide these values to the smart contract in a secure and accurate manner, while
maintaining verifiable proof of its integrity.

2.4

Decentralized Dispute Resolution

The Decentralized Dispute Resolution process is designed to incentivize truthful action. The
technology gives Blueprint creators the option to hold a challenge period at the Blueprint
time of expiry. During this challenge period, the creator will be required to stake additional
HEDG tokens to begin the dispute resolution process.
The process will begin by automatically notifying a randomized selection of high ranking
users that have opted to join dispute resolutions. Each qualified user must then stake HEDG
tokens to cast their vote on whether the Blueprint in question was correct or incorrect.
Users that vote on the side of the majority will be rewarded with HEDG tokens.

Milestone Releases

Due to the nature and complexity of our blockchain technology, the HedgeTrade platform
will be separated into several milestone release versions.

3.1

HedgeTrade Alpha

The HedgeTrade Alpha release contains all necessary functionality congruent to our
Blueprint staking model. Introductory features provide HedgeTrade platform users with the
ability to create smart contract predictions on any cryptocurrency available through the
exchanges listed.
The primary staking model introduced in this release gives Blueprint creators the ability to
stake a variable number of HEDG tokens to signal their level of confidence to the audience.
In order to incentivize initial purchasers, the first group of purchasers of a Blueprint will be
entitled to an increased return in their purchase stake if the prediction is incorrect.

3.2

HedgeTrade Beta

The HedgeTrade Beta release will be available for access to private invite-only members.
User feedback will be attained to ensure the public release is stable and fully functional.

3.3

HedgeTrade V1

The initial public release will possess the same features as the Beta version, albeit with
improved UX and UI additions.

3.4

HedgeTrade V2

The HedgeTrade V2 platform will integrate our proprietary Proof-of-Rank technology,
accompanied by an upgraded Blueprint resolution mechanism, and referral system. V2 will
support data from additional financial markets, allowing users to create Blueprint
predictions on more exchanges and eventually stocks, commodities, or any other exchange
traded product.

3.5

HedgeTrade V3

Blueprints created in HedgeTrade V3 will feature the Decentralized Dispute Resolution
process and the implementation of an additional staking model. This staking model will
benefit users that hold a greater number of HEDG tokens. All Blueprint purchasers and
creators will be entitled to an increased payout using a tiered system that depends on the
amount of HEDG tokens the user is holding in their wallet (see Section 6).

Spam and Manipulation

A key advantage of the HedgeTrade platform compared to other trading platforms is the
degree of difficulty it will present to spammers and manipulators, making the execution of
such fraudulent activities perverse and impractical. Most all traditional social media investing
and sharing websites are plagued with fake upvotes, comments and followers.
Many of these heavily manipulated sites are frequently used to carry out pump-and-dump
schemes and therefore can pose a massive risk to new investors in the space. The core
architecture is dependent on a complex algorithm that eliminates gaming and abuse.
An integral element of spam prevention is the ability to detect anomalies, such as:
1.

Account Creation Spam: Multiple accounts created by one person or a robot.

2.

Shilling: Accounts used to artificially manipulate the perception of a person or
product.

3.

Usage of Accounts: Are the accounts only used to contribute to one person?

Amongst the tools used to help us identify account legitimacy is Artificial Intelligence (AI):
We build a base model from the data that asks the following question:
"What is the probability that the selected data is not an anomaly?"
Employing this model that we built utilizing our data structure, we can differentiate if other
examples are anomalous or not.
Having built this model, we can assume:
if

Possible Anomaly

if

OK

ε = is a probability value which we deﬁne depending on our needs.
t = is the test subject.
We model each of the features by assuming each one is distributed according to a normal
distribution:

Assuming that there are n features assumed for each training data, p(x)p(x) is:

We now have a group of data which ﬁts valid interactions and can continue to ﬁlter the
data through more validity tests.

General Token Information

As part of our attempt at generating initial platform adoption, we will release the HEDG
token to the public prior to the launch of HedgeTrade.

5.1

HEDG Token Specifications

• Token: HEDG
• Token Name: HedgeTrade Platform Utility Token
• HEDG Token Supply: 1,000,000,000

5.2

Cryptoeconomics

Modern cryptoeconomics suggests that a stable blockchain platform relies on well structured
network economics for its token. Properties such as stakeholder incentivization dynamics
enable better individual productivity on the platform, on the other hand, bad actors will be
subject to penalties. Much of this leads to better network performance, resulting in more
platform attention and an appreciation in token demand.

Incentivizing Token Usage

With the initial V1 release, HEDG tokens can be staked favorably as the design delivers a
high profit margin for both predictors and audience purchasers. In future releases, the
HedgeTrade platform will experiment with other Blueprint staking mechanisms, these
additional options will encourage users to utilize their tokens on the platform through a
tiered payout model. This model will rely on a users Proof-of-Rank calculation, HEDG token
staking in each Blueprint and the number of HEDG tokens currently held in their wallet.
Through the interface provided by HedgeTrade, confidence between end-users and data
sources will increase, businesses and consumers will be assured with quality controlled data,
and end-users will have a simplified interface with a quick payment system. The tables below
serve as examples for Blueprint traders and purchasers and the revenue payouts earned and
discounts received (number values in the tables are for illustration purposes only and are
subject to change with the functional release of the HedgeTrade platform).

Purchaser Eligibility & KYC / AML Compliance

All token sale rounds will strictly follow KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money
Laundering) policies. The participants’ personal information and identity proofs are then
gathered and run against a legal database. HEDG Tokens do not represent company shares or
give rights to revenue sharing. From token economics point of view, the HEDG Tokens are for
use on the HedgeTrade platform, therefore, there is no guarantee for any future economic
value of the HEDG token.

Our Team

The HedgeTrade headquarters are based in Singapore, with team members extending into
North America and Europe. Development on the HedgeTrade platform began in 2017 and its
operations are currently supported by 25 full-time employees. More team information can be
found on the HedgeTrade website.

Summary

Prediction markets have an enormous potential in long-term forecasting and assessment.
Blockchain enabled prediction markets reduce bottlenecks associated with contract
fulfilment, manipulation and provide better transparency and dispute resolution than
traditional prediction markets. The HedgeTrade platform creates financial incentives for real
market insights and an environment that deters market manipulation through the use of
artificial intelligence. HedgeTrade strives to establish a community based on trust and
transparency, that enables individuals to improve their trading skills, market awareness, and
transactional profitability.
