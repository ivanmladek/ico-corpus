1 CRYPTERIUM EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1 The Future of Digital Banking and Cryptocurrencies
Over the past decade there has been an explosion in the demand for cashless and digital payments.
Global transaction volumes grew by 11.2% from 2014 to 2015 to reach 433 billion, an increase partially
fuelled by Emerging Asia1. In the past 24 months this growth has been enhanced by the introduction
of mobile contactless payment solutions such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, Alipay and a whole host of
other innovative solutions. Between 2015-2020, mobile proximity payment volume (such as Near Field
Communication (NFC) and QR codes) is expected to rise by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
of 80 percent, which would bring mobile proximity payments volume over US$4 trillion by 2020 2.
Similarly, the cryptoeconomy and cryptocurrencies in particular are growing at a phenomenal rate. It
is estimated that by 2020 the cryptoeconomy will exceed three trillion dollars 3 and that by 2022 it could
be equal to 10% of world GDP4. Only time will tell whether these predictions are correct, but what is
certain is that cryptocurrencies have passed their point of no return. They are here to stay, and their
importance will only increase.
On the other hand, universal transaction processing for cryptocurrency against fiat based goods is
practically non-existent. This is an unsatisfied demand across a cryptocurrency capitalization that
has already surpassed US$150 billion5.
Crypterium solves this problem with the commercial launch of its global banking transaction
processing platform dubbed ‘Cryptobank 2.0’.

1.2 What Is Crypterium
Providing cryptocurrencies to mainstream everyday users, will require dedicated cryptobanking
services. Only once a person is able to use cryptocurrency in the same way that they use any other
currency, will all of the benefits of cryptocurrency, such as lower transaction costs, speed of payment,
removal of national boundaries and so on, become real. There are already 3 million daily users of
cryptocurrencies, a number that is expected to exceed 200 million by 20256. The demand for
cryptocurrencies exists now and will grow at an annual CAGR of ~70% for the foreseeable future.
The potential to satisfy this demand is perhaps the most exciting banking development of the past
100 years and the prize for those who are successful is a place on the global banking landscape at a
rate of growth and a worldwide presence that can never be matched by any traditional banking
development plan.
The Crypterium Cryptobank will be a first step in satisfying this demand. It will be made available for
download via the IOS or android marketplace and is planning to be ready-to-use on mobile devices
immediately. Unlike conventional mobile banks that take weeks to process and issue cards, the
Crypterium Cryptobank provides an instant processing engine for both fiat and crypto based currency
transactions while enabling inter-changeability between the two. With Crypterium's digital bank
customers will finally be able to use cryptocurrencies to pay for fiat based goods without transaction

limits and with low commission on any of the world’s existing 42 million payment terminals and many
internet stores and payment points. Crypterium's technology platform is developing to be based on
algorithms that allow for the most efficient exchange rates matching across natural peer-to-peer
flow as well as third party Crypto-exchanges. This is planned to be quickly followed by a range of
complimentary banking services from simple Peer to Peer payments to Cryptocurrency backed
lending.
Crypterium aims to meet the banking needs of the Cryptocurrency Era.

1.3 ICO Overview
Over the past 5 years, the team at Crypterium has been building the platform on which its
cryptobanking services will be launched. The next stage in our development will be the release of a
cryptobanking payment platform that will in turn will its own cryptocurrency - CRPT, to feed the
transactional process. This platform will be ready for the release at the end of Q4 2017 - early Q1
2018, and we aimed on developing it in future. This Whitepaper highlights the key stages and features
of Crypterium payment solution and the future trajectories in which our products will be developed.
In advance of their use within the Crypterium cryptocurrency bank, Crypterium is offering prepayment of the CRPT token. Crypterium allow for pre-payment up to 210 000 000 CRPT tokens at the
initial market value of 0.0001 Bitcoin per CRPT.

2 INTRODUCTION
2.1 A Brand New Cryptoeconomy
Global demand of cashless payments continues to rise at such a rate that the end of cash as the
payment of choice is now a stark reality. The number of worldwide cashless transactions was over
430 billion in 2015 whilst the rise of mobile payments is expected to exceed $3.8 trillion by 2020 7.

Cap Gemini World Payments Report 2017

As people change the way that they interact with money, we have also seen the introduction of a
brand-new form of money, cryptocurrencies. It is less than 10 years since the creation of the Bitcoin,
the world’s first digital currency that in turn built a brand new financial ecosystem called the
blockchain. Today there are over 1,000 digital currencies8, known as cryptocurrencies, and that
number is growing every day.
The advantages of cryptocurrencies over traditional fiat currencies are numerous and impossible for
fiat currencies to match. Today a transaction between two people in different countries can still take
several days and cost the parties a significant share of the money transferred (the average cross
border transaction fee is 7.45%9) as each party in the chain, of which there are many, requires a small
margin for their efforts. This can now be done in seconds using cryptocurrencies via the blockchain
for practically zero cost and more securely than ever before.
But for many people, even those with a strong interest in new technology and better ways of doing
everyday actions, cryptocurrencies are still perceived as an investment instrument. The single most
important step in moving benefits from the conceptual and into the practical mainstream is to enable
people to use cryptocurrencies in the same way as they can any other currency, and that means

enabling instant payments with their Cryptocurrency as if it were cash or money stored in their digital
bank accounts.
Crypterium is building Cryptobank 2.0 for the Cryptocurrency era. People will be able to store, spend,
exchange and later borrow practically any Cryptocurrency in the same way as they could any other
currency, but in a quicker, cheaper and more secure environment than it is possible in any traditional
bank or fiat currency. The Cryptobank will be the decentralized core that interlocks the restricted
financial world we live in today and a future Cryptoeconomy with limitless borderless opportunities
Most of the technology for this financial revolution already exists: Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Alipay;
the world’s biggest banks and payment platforms have already installed more than 42 million
contactless payment terminals throughout the world, a number that is growing rapidly.
Crypterium will take full advantage of this global contactless phenomenon, but instead of using it for
traditional payment cards using fiat currencies, we will use it for cryptocurrencies through personal
smartphones. We can skip generations of dedicated development by some of the biggest companies
in the world, and adapt that technology to the Cryptocurrency Era within months, or years, but
definitely, not decades.

We anticipate that soon practically any cryptocurrency can be instantaneously transferred into any
local fiat currency anywhere in the world where cashless payments through contactless payments
terminals are possible and in turn can be spent. This will be done quicker, cheaper and safer than
any fiat currency bank has ever been able to achieve. For the retailer, they are none-the-wiser. As far
as they are concerned, they were paid in their currency of choice.
It is just a small step from cashless Cryptocurrency payments to additional banking services, such
as cross border transactions and eventually Cryptocurrency based loans.
Crypterium is aimed on commence operations by delivering one of the best Cryptocurrency mobile
banking payment application available today. As adoption increases, additional services are intended
to be added.
The team at Crypterium has many years of experience building fintech and mobile payment solutions
including the building and launch of one of Eastern Europe’s most important and award winning
contactless payment platform’s PayQR. Further details of the team are presented in Section 9 of this
Whitepaper.

2.2 Comparing The World’s Best Traditional Banks With A New
Blockchain Bank
With the advent of any new market changing technology, the old world order often struggles to adapt
to the new world realities. It will be no different for the current banking giants who even today cannot
agree whether or not cryptocurrencies are their future or a passing phase. Whilst they decide, new
dedicated blockchain based Cryptobanks will take their place in the Cryptoeconomy.
The following table provides just a few examples of the advantages of a new blockchain bank
compared to any leading traditional bank.

It is Crypterium’s strong belief that no single blockchain bank will dominate the new Cryptocurrency
banking sector, but rather that a network of new innovative players will drive the market forward and
that within the next 10 years, roughly the same length of time that Bitcoin has been in existence, the
leading blockchain Cryptobanks will be challenging the leading traditional banks for control over the
Cryptoeconomy.

3 THE CRYPTERIUM TEAM
Crypterium’s management team is made up of highly experienced digital payment professionals from
some of the most innovative FinTech sectors in Europe, who have spent the better part of 10 years
developing digital payment and banking solutions. This team is supported by experienced financial
professionals and experienced C-level executives who have developed worldwide.
When combined, the team has attracted more than $50m of investment into fintech projects they
have been responsible for creating and developing, including PayQR (Russia’s leading independent
contactless payment platform – see further comment below), Workle (a digital sales platform that

Club (a digital loyalty program that is integrated inside leading publishers’ web sites).
In 2013, two of the founding partners of Crypterium (Vladimir Gorbunov and Gleb Markov, see below)
launched PayQR, a Cypriot based company, its goal being the establishment of a contactless
payment platform that works with any smartphone and which does not rely on the current
international payment systems or mobile phone manufacturers such as ApplePay. Working with QR
codes, the company moved to commercial operations in 2015, and quickly became a leader in the
Appstore rankings for Google Play, was named as one of the top 100 Russian start-ups one of the
top 50 start-ups with international potential, was awarded the top prizes for its antivirus solutions at
the Emerging Challenges Competition and best innovation of the year (2016) at the safety leaders
awards in the Financial services category. Further prestigious awards and recognition continued into
2017 including Russia’s Ministry of Communications selecting PayQR to showcase at the world
Mobile Congress in China. Today, users of the platform include many European banks and technology
leaders such as Alipay (for Russia).

4 MOBILE CRYPTOBANK
4.1 Mobile Contactless Payments
Physical bank branches, plastic payments cards, your personal neighbourhood banker, are all things
of the past. Now everything is digital, mobile and contactless. Crypterium is building a new digital
solution to Cryptocurrency era, that does mostly the same things as the current mobile bank
providers, but faster, cheaper, safer using cryptocurrency on the decentralised blockchain.
As soon as a customer downloads the Crypterium mobile banking App customers will be able to start
to make transactions in current VISA, Mastercard or UnionPay infrastructure practically instantly.
Gone are the days when you need to apply for a debit card and wait weeks for it to be delivered.
Customers will be able to instantly pay in certain major cryptocurrency (at least BTC and ETH) or in
ERC20 standard tokens for any product or services at any POS terminals (there are already over 42
million installed throughout the world) that are fitted with NFC (near field communication) via the
Crypterium mobile banking App.
Crypterium uses NFC HCE (host card emulation) protocols to tokenise the data on the virtual payment
card and in turn the POS terminal reads the connections as if it were a standard plastic card.
Practically any NFC payment service, such as Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Google Pay and a host of
other providers, can now be used to pay with cryptocurrencies and as far as the retailer or online
store is concerned, they are paid in the currency of their payment order. This capability possibly
extends to ATM cash withdrawals and most other standard banking activities.
Today it is practically impossible to pay for your daily coffee, the morning newspaper, or your utility
bill with cryptocurrency. Of course, a cryptocurrency owner could make an exchange of
cryptocurrency on one of the exchanges, wait for confirmation that it is completed, then wait for the
transfer of funds to their nominated account and so on. But who in all reality would do that to buy a
coffee? With Crypterium’s mobile banking app that changes instantly. The Crypterium mobile
banking app does all of that for the customer. From any cryptocurrency that are preselected by the
user in Crypterium App, perhaps in different percentages depending on their current trading value,
Crypterium does all the communication and ultimately conversion to and payment in fiat without the
user having to do anything other than bring up their smartphone to the NFC terminal and press go.
Only the exact number of cryptocurrency in the order and ratio prescribed are exchanged to meet the
payment needs.

5 CRYPTERIUM TOKEN – CRPT
5.1 Overview
Crypterium token CRPT – is the core of all transactions made in Crypterium banking platform. No
payment can be conducted without CRPT, its main goal, regulated by smart-contract, is to stimulate
tokenholders to use Crypterium in their daily life, and to attract new users to Crypterium. The only
issue of CRPT tokens will be during the ICO, which in fact is the pre-sale of Crypterium services usage
opportunity. Crypterium in future is planning to list its tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges to
enlarge userbase and fulfil users’ expectations to provide the most comprehensive services.

5.2 Decentralised Fuel to Power the Engine
Only CRPT tokenholders are able to use the Crypterium cryptobank platform. Every time a person
makes a payment, a fee equal to 0.5% of the value of the transaction in CRPT is taken from the CRPT
token holder’s account and is burnt as fuel for the transaction. Ownership of CRPT creates a reserve
that can be used as the fuel for future transactions.
Thanks to Crypterium’s intelligent proprietary technology, this 0.5% is 100% transparent to the user,
carried out immediately, at current exchange rate available. In fact, Crypterium, which is based on
robotic algorithms that automatically search for the optimal rate for a given transaction at any given
time on all exchanges with which Crypterium has integrated, and the instant formation of a
corresponding lot for the purchase or sale of cryptocurrency on the selected currency exchange, will
ensure that the customer gets the best conversion rate possible for the whole transaction which will
more than likely compensate for the small 0.5% transaction charge that is applied at the time of
purchase. Crypterium is naturally aware of services which offer supposedly 0% commission
transaction, but this is simply hidden in a wider bid offer spread (it can be as high as 10%) and
ultimately the customer will receive a higher real cost than that which is applied by Crypterium.
Crypterium is committed to 100% transparency with the customer and in the same way that customers
are not fooled by the zero percent commission deals in fiat currency conversion, they will not be fooled
by such deals in crypto conversion.

Example:
Bill, who is a CRPT token owner, wants to purchase a cup of coffee costs $10 using
his Bitcoins stored inside his Crypterium Wallet. At the time of the transaction, 1
Bitcoin had a best market value of $5,000 and 1 CRPT had a best market value of $4.
When Bill makes his payment, by just tapping his smartphone to NFC terminal, he
will be charged an additional 0.5% in CRPT. His total is now $10.05 which in turn
reduces his Bitcoins by 0.002 BTC ($ 10 / $ 5000) and reduces his CRPT by 0.0125
($ 0.05 / $4).

CRYPTERIUM WHITEPAPER VERSION 1.0 L 31.10.2017

Utility comparison to purchase a cup of coffee:
Without Crypterium

With Crypterium
technologies

With CRPT tokens

To purchase a cup of coffee in
a regular coffee shop using
cryptocurrencies, users have to
top up the balance on the
exchange (avg. 20 min. for
BTC), exchange their currency,
and wait up to three days to top
up their fiat accounts. Only
then can a user purchase a cup
of coffee.

Users can make an immediate
payment in the preferred
cryptocurrency
in
their
Crypterium wallet. However, to
conduct the settlement, CRPT
tokens should be used. In the
event the user has no tokens,
he will have to find a token
holder that transfers CRPT
tokens

Users just tap the standard
NFC terminal with their
smartphones. A small of 0.5%
CRPT transaction fee is
charged
and
burned.
Transaction is done.

5.3 Permanent Loyalty Reward
Today all merchants are charged for acquiring services, whether this is Visa, MasterCard, American
Express etc., measured as a percentage of the payment they receive. Some of these fees can be as
high as 5% to 6%. With Crypterium ecosystem, merchants will pay back 0.5% - 1% from their turnover,
0.15% of this turnover will go to the Monthly Loyalty Program to thank purchasers for making
transactions. The higher volume of transactions a purchaser makes, the higher loyalty rewards he or
she will be given.
We want to reward loyalty because it lowers our marketing expenses. We divide our user base into
four categories depending on their willingness to make transactions via Crypterium. The more tokens
users acquire during the month, the more transactions they are expected to make in the future (tokens
are necessary to fuel transactions). But also, users’ monthly activity on Crypterium predominantly
determines their loyalty rewards. This can be compared in many ways to the mechanics of current
rewards programs like Air Miles.
As previously noted, in order to use the Crypterium platform, the person must own/spend CRPT to
complete a transaction. The great the CRPT ownership, the greater the prefunding of future
transactions. Therefore, Crypterium recognises 4 groups of loyalty members:

Crypterium reserves the right to change the category criteria in line with developing company
performance.

18

CRYPTERIUM WHITEPAPER VERSION 1.0 L 31.10.2017

Example:
Merchants paid back $240 million in a given month. Applying a rate of 0.15%, the total Loyalty
Program would have $240 * 0.15% = $360,000. This is in turn allocated to the various loyalty groups
as follows:

Bill is the owner of 30,000 CRPT and is therefore a member of the Platinum Loyalty
Group.
The total value of transactions during the month by all members of the Platinum
Loyalty Group was $640,000, of which $8,000 was made by Bill. Bill in turn is
therefore entitled to his share of the total value of transactions in his Loyalty Group
$8,000 / $640,000 = 1.25%. Applied to the total value of the MLP available for
Platinum Loyalty members, Bill will be entitled to 1.25% * $180,000 = $2,250. The reward will be paid
by Crypterium is CRPT tokens or in ctyprocurrency at the company’s own discretion.
In this way our users are motivated not just by the quality of the Cryptobanking services provided, but
also by the rewards for using those services and in turn, the enhanced rewards for prepayment of the
future transaction fees through the ownership of CRPT. The higher the activity, the greater the
ownership of CRPT tokens, the greater the reward.

5.4 Additional Token-holder Benefits

expect to receive a discount of up to 75% from standard fees (the exact benefits will depend on
the service)



Those token-holders that are also merchants using the Crypterium payment platform for
acquiring will be entitled to fee discounts of up to 50% from standard fees (exact details will

6 CRYPTERIUM ICO TOKEN SALE OVERVIEW
6.1 Purpose of the ICO
Crypterium is offering to potential users of its Crytpobank platform to right to pre-purchase its own
CRPT tokens through an ICO event that commences on the 31st October 2017.
The CRPT token is based on the decentralised Ethereum market standard smart contract ERC20
token. Formed within the blockchain and subject to automatic execution upon the occurrence of predefined criteria and events and subject to certain conditions, CRPT tokens are valid indefinitely and
are the property of their respective holders.
Crypterium is registered under the laws of the European Union, with its head office located in Tallinn,
Estonia. It is subject to a market best practice audit in accordance with European regulations thereby
ensuring total transparency and absolute accountability of all Crypterium activities including the
publishing of full company statements.
Estonia has been chosen for its favourable climate of digital innovation including e-Residency.
Estonia was ranked first on Bitcoin.com in its assessment of countries that support cryptocurrency
development, typified by Estonia being the first country to have a Bitcoin-ATM.
CRPT tokens bestow on its holder’s special product benefits including increased rewards depending
on user activity. CRPT tokens are not stocks, securities or their equivalent and therefore do not create
the right of ownership or disposal of Crypterium or its assets. CRPT token-holders do not exert any
influence over the decision making of the company or its activities.
CRPT tokens will be distributed in direct proportion to the amount paid by the participants during the
ICO in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
All organisation and implementation processes connected a successful Crypterium ICO have been
prepared in accordance with industry best practices, supported and audited by ICObox. Additionally,
Crypterium has employed the services of an escrow account Blockchain Law Group thereby applying
an additional level of security and providing further confidence for contributors that the distribution
of tokens will be in accordance with Crypterium’s smart contract conditions. The funds received as
a pre-payment for service fees through the use of CRPT tokens will remain in escrow until the
distribution of CRPT tokens to tokenholders.

21

CRYPTERIUM WHITEPAPER VERSION 1.0 L 31.10.2017

6.2 Fixed Token Value
Upon launch, a single CRPT token is valued at 0.0001 BTC (due to the USD equivalent value of a
single Bitcoin this is a more convenient measurement of value). For equivalent prices in other
cryptocurrencies, the following exchanges will be used; Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitfinex and Poloniex.

Crypterium is focused on delivering those products that support mass scale adoption as quickly and
efficiently as possible and thereby simultaneously delivering value to CRPT holders.
The final 15% of tokens will be distributed amongst the project team, advisors and the participants
of ‘bounty’ campaign.
Crypterium ensures the existence of tokens in the ownership of people who will purchase tokens no
later than 25th January 2018 (23:59:00 UTC-4), in case of providing by that people all the necessary
account details. Distribution of tokens can be conducted before 25th January, but tokens will be
inactive for usage and transfers. All possible functionality of tokens will be active on 25th January.
Purchase of tokens via wire transfers will be stopped in 10 days before expected date of ICO
completion. People, who intended to use this transfer method should deposit all funds before that
date or use other transfer methods (BTC, ETH, LTC)

6.4 ‘Bounty’ Structure
Support is required for many marketing and expert discussion forums such as bitcointalk, the
contribution of opinion leaders, banner ads and participation in selected publications that specialise
in Cryptocurrency and blockchain. The exact distribution of CRPT tokens for the marketing campaign
is managed by the ICO organisers and adjusted regularly, but under no circumstances will it increase
beyond 3% of the total issued CRPT.

CRYPTERIUM FUTURE TRAJECTORIES
Crypterium is a part of the fast-growing ecosystem, which constantly develops
innovative solutions for users of cryptocurrencies to make their adoption easier
and more efficient. The following products are now in the development and are
intended to be available for the use of CRPT tokenholders in the future.

23

CRYPTERIUM WHITEPAPER VERSION 1.0 L 31.10.2017

1 MOBILE CRYPTOBANK 2.0
1.1 Cryptowallet
Crypto asset and currencies are contained in digital smart contract wallets. Using currently available
smart contract wallet technology, there is no need for customers to move money out of their wallets
and into Crypterium, Crypterium will simply debit the appropriate amount from the wallets in the
predefined manner as identified by the payment protocols, and displays the remaining balances to
the customer within the Crypterium mobile banking App.
In this way, the customer will be able to see all their Crypto assets in one place, whilst at the same
time being able to spend them in practically any order or mix of their desire, even if the assets are in
different wallets, in the secure knowledge that Crypterium has no access to such assets unless the
smart contract triggering payment takes place. Maximum freedom with ultimate security.

1.1.1 CrypteriumSX (Smart eXchange)

Crypterium's technology platform is based on algorithms that ensure the most efficient bid-offer
matching across natural peer-to-peer flow as well as third party crypto-exchanges. All historical
transactions are stored in a dedicated data-warehouses that continuously analyses the data to
enhance risk management and identify predictive behaviours, and in turn enable Crypterium to
optimize the cryptocurrency exchange process and better educate the customer on possible
payment strategies, for example, it may highlight different payment mixes depending on the current
cryptocurrencies valuations. In other words, everything possible is done to ensure that the customer
gets the best deal.

2 CRYPTOBANK FOR BUSINESSES
2.1 QR Code Payments
There are two equally important sides of the infrastructure required to ensure the rapid adoption of
cryptoeconomy. The ability to make payments and the ability to receive payments.
The Crypterium Mobile Banking App will process the payments which in turn will utilise the vast
resources of the world’s biggest payment providers by using digital contactless payment technology
through supporting POS terminals to receive payments.
Nevertheless, there are still millions of businesses that for a wide variety of reasons are unable or
unwilling to connect to this payment network. For example, you will not find many street traders in
Delhi that have a contactless visa terminal.
The Crypterium team has more than 5 years of development in fintech, actively building alternative
contactless payment solutions for business covering all areas of business life from key retail sectors
such as restaurants and bars, to street traders and the internet stores. Over the past year alone, more
than 350,000 payment transactions have been made through payment processing platforms,
developed by our team. This knowledge and experience will be embedded into Crypterium enabling
it to reach a much wider audience than is possible today.
The Crypterium Cryptobank for business will be a dedicated in-module solution for businesses that
can be applied to all sectors. Functions include:
−
−
−

Cryptocurrency exchange and settlements/acquiring in fiat or cryptocurrency no matter how
the payment was made
Customised loyalty and cashback programs
Universal web-office with:
− Transaction history
− Payment details managing
− Filter by currencies, payment time, shopping methods etc.
− New store connections

Crypterium’s business banking solutions generates not only the ability for merchants to accept
cryptocurrencies, but also:
−
−
−
−
−

Conversion between cryptocurrencies and fiat money
Increases the speed of payment, (compared to other than cash)
Reduced costs. On average payments through the Crypterium infrastructure will be 4 to 5
times cheaper than the cost of card acquiring About 0,5% - 1% depending on turnover
Flexibility with a wide range of payment solutions
Reliability, all solutions have been tested over years of development and 2 years of usage

Crypterium has developed a universal solution that has the ability to replace expensive and restricted
POS contactless terminals, or simply act as an alternative to those terminals when the merchant has
no access to them or would prefer an enhanced experience. To receive cryptopayments, the
merchant has to simply install a special Crypterium App on their mobile device, such as a tablet,
which in turn produces QR payment codes containing all of the essential payment details. The

26

CRYPTERIUM WHITEPAPER VERSION 1.0 L 31.10.2017

purchaser uses their Crypterium mobile banking solution to scan the QR code and the payments are
processed practically instantaneously.
This solution has become the overriding leader in many countries, especially China where such
methods of payment have almost eliminated the competition. It is estimated that over 70% of
payment points are equipped with QR payment solutions, which in turn support the most popular
apps Alipay and WeChat. With the support of Crypterium, such mass adoption could easily be
extended to cryptocurrencies, for any merchant, anywhere in the world. All they need is an internet
connection via a mobile device.

2.2 Crypterium E-Commerce and Automated Services Solutions
Crypterium developed API enables any internet store to display a QR code, which in turn can be read
by the Crypterium mobile banking customer to scan that code and make a payment using
cryptocurrencies in the same way as they could at any contactless payment point. Not only does it
enable the same benefits of the mobile banking app as noted previously, it also simplifies the
checkout process by filling in essential payment information such as delivery address, contact phone
number etc. when scanning the QR code. This is all done instantaneously at a cost for the merchant
which is many times cheaper than they pay today.
Such benefits are also being applied to offline contactless payment points where there is no need for
a human interaction, for example to pay for a parking permit or paying for petrol without leaving the
car.

27

CRYPTERIUM WHITEPAPER VERSION 1.0 L 31.10.2017

3 CRYPTERIUM OPEN PLATFORM
Crypterium believes that the cryptocurrency era will
require a much wider development community than just
a few leading cryptobanks. For this reason, Crypterium
is providing an open platform that enables companies to
build their own products using Crypterium API. Many of
the features of the mobile platform will be made
available for developers to use inside their own payment
applications and solutions.

Examples of products and services that can be created
and provided through the Crypterium API include:
-

Cryptocurrency wallets
Cryptocurrency exchanges
Cryptosystems for payments on and off-line
Loyalty programs
Payments with the use of cryptocurrency and tokens
Information retrieval
Automated regular payments
Billing
Receive automatic notification of transactions

The following diagram shows the range of modules that will be available for developers.

28

CRYPTERIUM WHITEPAPER VERSION 1.0 L 31.10.2017

Please note that solutions described in this section are not guaranteed and may or may not be
delivered in the future depending on the market needs, regulations, ability of the team to achieve best
technical performance and other risks which may be known or unknown to the team now.
The Crypterium Future Trajectories are all planned developments and are presented for informational
purpose only to show what the team had been working on and how the entire ecosystem may look
like if developed. You should not rely on these solutions when making a purchase of CRPT tokens
because these are planned to be bonus features rather than the essential functionality of the CRPT
token.

CRYPTERIUM WHITEPAPER VERSION 1.0 L 31.10.2017

4 CRYPTERIUM CORPORATE VISION
4.1 Corporate Culture
Our corporate culture formed by the years of successful development and achievement of planned
results is based on following principles. Not less than 50% of all available resources are distributed
for scaling and increase of userbase, this trajectory led us to success most of time. No more than
15% of resources is intended to be used to maintain current operational activities including wages of
management. The rest part of all available resources is aimed on research and development and
search for new stack of technologies.

4.2 Product Development
Product development and further roll-out is naturally affected by our corporate vision. The following
are considered to be our current objectives:
Crypterium Cryptocurrency Wallet with Fiat Settlements – we are planning to provide full stack of
innovative technological solutions, including Processing Centre, Fiat-to-Crypto and vice versa
instant exchanges, NFS payments support (only for Android devices via card emulation), integrations
with third-party Cryptocurrency payment infrastructure, P2P transfers in fiat and crypto currencies.
Our plans are to spend on the development in this direction at least 9 500 ETH in the nearest 2 years.
Crypterium Mobile Bank 2.0 should be the one the best payment solution in the industry including
such technologies as CrypteriumSX, Native contactless payment support (Apple Pay, Samsung Pay,
Android Pay and oth.), Partnership with banks or financial institutions in every region of financial
activities – to guarantee stability and security of settlements. We estimate that around 14 500 ETH
has to be invested to achieve our product vision.
The next big thing is Crypterium own payment infrastructure, which we plan will cover at least 25 000
POS and online stores around the world. It is rather difficult to estimate marginal expenses on every
connection of the store, but it is definitely looks like we will spend at least around 50 000 ETH on
building all the solutions and expanding our minimal infrastructure.
We expect to spend at least 29 000 ETH on creating universal OpenAPI for our products, developing
Crypterium in the direction of providing standard banking services and developing complementary
services. All rest available funds we will intend to use in R&D for such technology as Credit Subtoken
Protocol and others.

ADHERENCE TO ALL LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS
The purchase of any tokens involves a high degree of risk, including but not limited to the risks
described below. Before purchasing CRPT Tokens, it is recommended that each participant carefully
weighs all the information and risks detailed in this White Paper, and, specifically, the following risk
factors.
A. Dependence on computer infrastructure
Crypterium dependence on functioning software applications, computer hardware and the Internet
implies that Crypterium can offer no assurances that a system failure would not adversely affect the
use of your CRPT Tokens. Despite Crypterium implementation of all reasonable network security
measures, its processing center servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic
break-ins or other disruptions of a similar nature. Computer viruses, break-ins or other disruptions
caused by third parties may result in interruption, delay or suspension of services, which would limit
the use of the CRPT Tokens.
B. Smart contract limitations
Smart contract technology is still in its early stages of development, and its application is of
experimental nature. This may carry significant operational, technological, regulatory, reputational
and financial risks. Consequently, although the audit conducted by independent third party increases
the level of security, reliability, and accuracy, this audit cannot serve as any form of warranty,
including any expressed or implied warranty that the CRPT Smart Contract is fit for purpose or that
it contains no flaws, vulnerabilities or issues which could cause technical problems or the complete
loss of CRPT Tokens.
C. Regulatory risks
The Blockchain technology, including but not limited to the issue of tokens, may be a new concept in
some jurisdictions, which may then apply existing regulations or introduce new regulations regarding
Blockchain technology-based applications, and such regulations may conflict with the current CRPT
Smart Contract setup and CRPT Token concept. This may result in substantial modifications of the
CRPT Smart Contract, including but not limited to its termination and the loss of CRPT Tokens as
well as a suspension or termination of all CRPT Token functions.
D. Taxes.
Token holders may be required to pay taxes associated with the transactions involving CRPT Tokens.
It will be a sole responsibility of the token holders to comply with the tax laws of the relevant
jurisdictions and pay all required taxes.
E. Force Majeure.
Crypterium performance may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to force majeure
circumstances. For the purposes of this White Paper, force majeure shall mean extraordinary events

34

CRYPTERIUM WHITEPAPER VERSION 1.0 L 31.10.2017

and circumstances which could not be prevented by Crypterium and shall include: acts of nature,
wars, armed conflicts, mass civil disorders, industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts, slowdowns,
prolonged shortage or other failures of energy supplies or communication service, acts of municipal,
state or federal governmental agencies, other circumstances beyond Crypterium control, which were
not in existence at the time of Token sale. If such circumstances occur prior to issuance CRPT
Tokens and Crypterium is unable to issue CRPT Tokens within 3 months from the projected date, the
escrow agent may issue a refund at the request of the CRPT Token purchasers. The refund will be
issued in the original form of payment to the same digital wallet or bank account where the funds
were transferred from.
F. Disclosure of information.
Personal information received from CRPT token holders, the information about the number of tokens
owned, the wallet addresses used, and any other relevant information may be disclosed to law
enforcement, government officials, and other third parties when Crypterium is required to disclose
such information by law, subpoena, or court order. Crypterium shall at no time be held responsible
for such information disclosure.
G. Value of CRPT Token.
