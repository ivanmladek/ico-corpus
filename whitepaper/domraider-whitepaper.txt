Advance warning
The Initial Coin Offering (“ICO”) project presented by the company DomRaider is an
unregulated fundraising operation. It poses several risks to buyers, in particular, that
of losing all amounts traded for tokens issued by DomRaider.
Only people who are fully aware of these risks should participate in the ICO. Note
also that the ICO excludes certain groups of people such as consumers and “U.S.
Person” (within the meaning of “Regulation S” of the Securities Act 1933 in U.S. law),
Canadian and Singapore citizen”.

An introduction to Drop Catching
The secondary market for domain names
Presently, there are close to 330 million active domain names throughout
the world
(see: https://investor.verisign.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=1015020).
They are divided into approximately 2,500 domain name extensions or TLDs (Top-Level
Domains). ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the nonprofit regulatory organization, has delegated their management to different registries
throughout the world, including:
•
•
•

300 generic domain name extensions (.com, .net, .org,….)
260 country code domain name extensions (.cn, .de, .co.uk, .fr,….)
1,930 new domain name extensions (.club, .xyz, .global,….)
created in 2012 by ICANN and launched since 2014.

The domain name industry is today known for the spectacular transactions which are
regularly operated on the secondary market, with some of the more notable examples below:

These examples date from the beginning of 2017, and demonstrate that the market is not
showing any signs of slowing down:
Fly.com: US $2,89 m
Freedom.com: US $2 m

01.com: US $1,8 m
20.com: US $1,75 m

Nevertheless, a significant number of transactions operated in this market are not made
public because they often include non-disclosure agreements.
Thus, the secondary market for domain names was officially worth $500 million in 2016,
but is estimated that in reality it was maybe worth up to 5 times more, in other words,
$2.5 billion.

5
If the .com domain extension continues to be the reference and generates the largest
transactions, in the past few years we have seen increasing interest in country code (.fr,
.eu, .london…) or theme based (.loan, .men, .tech…) domain extensions. This attraction
has been boosted by liberalization of domain name extensions which has given access
to domain extensions which were previously reserved for residents of the countries in
question.
Taking advantage of the very low prices of the less well-known domain name extensions,
the number of transactions has exploded. Over the past 5 years, there has been no fewer
than 570,000 transactions, with more than 150,000 in 2016 alone.
(see: https://namebio.com/ & http://dnpric.es/).
Today, domain names have taken on the status of true digital assets: thus, more than 120
transactions worth more than US$ 100,000 were made in 2016. This has led to the arrival
of new, important investors. In particular, the Asian domain name market has grown
exponentially these past few years. Thus, in 2016, 50% of the largest transactions were
made by Chinese investors.
(see: https://namecorp.com/china-the-new-king-of-domains/).
Materializing this status as a digital asset, the average unit value of domain name
transactions continues to increase.

Catching expired domain names
The sudden rise in prices has raised the barrier to entry for new domain name investors.
This has contributed to the emergence of a business which up to recently was under the
radar: drop catching.
Also called ‘domain sniping’, ‘backorder’ or even ‘snap’, this practice consists of registering
an expired domain name as soon as it becomes available.
Indeed, when a person or entity registers a domain name, he, she or it becomes the holder,
for an unlimited duration, as long as the annual renewal fees are paid. Nevertheless, when
a registrant no longer renews the said domain name, the latter enters into an expiration
process.

6

1st stage
The first stage is the Redemption Grace Period (RGP). During this period, the
domain name is deactivated, but its registrant still retains the possibility
to reactivate it by paying the reactivation fees. This period, which varies
depending on the registry, lasts approximately 1 to 3 months.

2nd stage
The second stage only lasts for a few days and corresponds to the period
in which the domain name is dropped. The domain name is finally deleted
and can be reserved by any one or any entity, similarly to a new domain
name.

On average, 1% of the 330 million domain names activated in the world are dropped
in this manner, in other words, the equivalent of 100,000 drops per day.
Even though 99% of them are of little interest, the remaining 1% are real treasures.

Buyers throughout the world are searching for certain domain names for diverse
reasons:

•

Rarity: rare, short, generic or even numerical

domain names are extremely prized by domainers
who then negotiate them on the international
market places.

•

•

Historical SEO (Search Engine Optimization):
domain names which previously had a lot of links
pointing to their websites (backlinks) rediscover
their ‘spark’ when they are restored. Natural
referencing companies cannot get enough of them
as they improve their positions in search engines or
are useful for marketing links.

Traffic: a lot of domain names immediately
generate a lot of traffic (sometimes several tens of
thousands of hits per day) when they are restored.
Visitors can come from bookmarks, links or even
social content. They are popular with marketing
agencies who associate them, for example, with
advertising or by affiliation.

•

Digital identity: trademark owners, company
names, or family names, which or who could not
initially reserve their names monitor drops very
closely in order to get catch the domain name
which corresponds to them.

8
We have a three-pronged drop catching process:

had preordered the same domain
name, it is then put to auction for a
period of 7 days.

9
Of course, the main difficulty is to successfully catch the preordered domain names.
The rule of thumb is first come, first served. In other words, only the very first reservation
request for a domain name just after it has been dropped shall be the winning tender.
The difficulty is increased because it is extremely difficult to ascertain the exact moment when
a domain name is going to be dropped. The registries randomly stagger drops in timeslots
which can last from several minutes to several days.

The level of competition is such that a
domain name is general caught in a few
hundredths of a second.
At that type of speed, manual attempts to
reserve them are doomed to failure.
In today’s climate, in order to be competitive
and to have a chance you must obtain
accreditations from the domain name
registrars in order to have a direct connection
with the registration servers. We then exploit
these connections with bots which we
create specifically for these type of tasks, in
accordance with each registry’s specific rules
and regulations.
For a long time, drop catching was considered
as a marginal and parasite practice by the
registries, but it has recently acquired true
legitimacy and recognition.

One of the most striking examples of this was when DENIC, the official German registry
of the .de domain name extension (the largest registry in Europe with 16 million active
domain names, and the 3rd largest domain name extension worldwide behind .com and
.cn) formalized the practice of drop catching. In May 2016, DENIC launched RRI Rush, a
specific commercial offer for drop catching operators, thus regulating the practice. It was an
immediate success. RRI Rush has already generated additional annual income of more than
€5 million for the registry. France followed suit in December 2016. Thanks to this impetus, a
large number of registries throughout the world are also preparing to regulate drop catching.

10
ICANN has not yet positioned itself on the issue but, in the meantime, the key players in the
market have already openly multiplied their accreditations, a vital prerequisite for obtaining
the best performances. One of them currently has 1,250 accreditations, a 31% increase from
2016, or in other words, an annual budget of more than $6 million just for these accreditations.

In its new ‘recognized’ form, there are only a few dozen worldwide operators in this market.
They share in a very fragmented manner the different domain name extensions in often
limited geographical zones. There is still no common multi domain name extension offer.

This fragmentation can be explained by the fact that each registry has its own specific
domain name drop rules. Though it is true that there is a standard communication protocol
(EPP: Extensible Provisioning Protocol) between the registries and the registration offices,
it has yet to be universally applied and does not integrate the needs of the drop catching
business. Furthermore, the rules are not often published by the registries. You therefore
need to establish them by retro engineering, by putting into place observation cycles and
implementing permanent tests. Thus, drop catching management for each new registry
involves a significant amount of adaptation work. This explains why the initial drop catchers
often chose to focus on one single domain name extension.

11

A ‘Winner takes it all’ market

The recovery rate obtained by drop catchers in comparison to their competitors
depends on 2 key factors:
•
•

The effectiveness of the algorithm
The number of connections to the registry server

Each accredited registration office has a limited number of creation requests that it can
send. The only way to exceed this ceiling is to multiply the connections and therefore the
accreditations.
This phenomenon dramatically increases fixed costs and requires operators to have a
sufficiently high business volume to cover these additional costs.
The bigger a drop catcher’s budget the more it can subscribe to a significant number of new
connections or accreditations. Therefore, it will have a more successful reservation rate and
therefore more satisfied customers. With an increasing number of customers, the auction
price will be positively impacted, thus improving the available budget.
This virtuous circle is a significant barrier to entry for any newcomers wishing to enter the
market once it becomes mature.

12

DomRaider today

Founded by Tristan Colombet in 2013, DomRaider today offers the best service for reserving
dropped domain names. We offer a permanent choice from hundreds of thousands of
domain names on the verge of being dropped.
Each domain name has been qualified in order to provide the most pertinent criteria for
analyzing its value.

We offer our customers every type of administration option for their domain names,
redirections, DNS (Domain Name System) entry management,…

In order to offer the best recovery rate in the market for the majority of the domain name
extensions that we cover, we rely on 4 years of internal research and development.
We have fine-tuned an innovative and unique technological solution thanks to an
architecture designed to be universal. We are thus capable of integrating new domain
name extensions and updating our capture algorithms much more quickly.

13

Our key points
Supported by the stunning growth of our sales, our team has tripled in size in one
year, and we now have 30 people working in 3 countries, with the recent opening of
offices in Montreal and London adding to our international coverage.
We have carried out more than 20,000 transactions and have prestigious customers such
as Warner Music Group, the French National Education Ministry, Axa, the French National
Olympic and Sports Committee, and the French weather forecast organization, Météo
France.

We have received accreditations for 27 domain name extensions from international
registries (at, be, biz, ca, cc, ch, co, co.uk, com, cz, de, es, eu, fr, info, io, it, me, net, nl, nu,
org, pl, se, tv, uk, us) as well as that of ICANN, the worldwide regulatory authority for 330
million domain names. We are already the drop catcher which covers the most domain
name extensions in the world.

We have become the European leader in less than 4 years and broke even in 2016.
Supported by the Inovaa and Eefficiency investment funds, the BPI France public bank, the
Crédit Agricole, Banque Populaire and CIC private banks, we have € 3.5 million in financing.

The blockchain shift
Blockchain

Introduction

Since 2015, the “blockchain” phenomenon, created in 2009 and stemming from
Bitcoin, has received a lot of media hype with promises of significant changes in
the relations between private individuals, organizations or states.
The term blockchain refers to a structure of chained data, produced in a
chronological manner within a decentralized network and according to consensus
rules defined in a protocol. Each distributed registry protocol produces its own
blockchain (data) which represents the history of the network’s statuses. This
medium resembles that of a public registry, it is replicated between users and
validators.
When a block is created, the validators (often called ‘miners’) lock the information
it contains via cryptographic transactions and include a reference to the previous
block (block chaining). Secure cryptographic hashing insures the integrity of
blocks and prevent modification of data inside blocks without invalidating all
the later blocks. The whole chain of blocks is subject to strict consensus rules
(Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Work mechanisms) designed to make it extremely
costly or difficult to alter the events or transactions stored in the blockchain.
By extension, the term blockchain, though it only represents the data structure
aspect, can refer to all the components and cryptographic tools implemented in
this distributed computer protocol.

Smart contracts
A Smart Contract is by definition a protocol drawn up on the basis of promises
between several parties. Well before today’s distributed automatically executed
Ethereum scripts, it existed in traditional contracts in the form of conditional
execution clauses.
The nature of the Smart Contract is linked to the type of registry protocol it is
applied to. Thus, in Ethereum (https://www.ethereum.org/), the Smart Contracts
are computerized scripts spread out over the different nodes of the registry’s
protocol network, and therefore the execution result is also subject to consensus
between the nodes. Thus, the result of a Smart Contract calculation or Smart
Contract transaction is deemed to be reliable and difficult to falsify.
Though, in theory only applicable in cyberspace, certain Smart Contracts can
model contractual clauses, and certain jurisdictions, for example, the state of
Delaware in the USA, are working on their legal recognition.

15

The ‘trust’ revolution or trust
via proof.

When certain criteria are grouped together, the blockchain
can become a medium which makes it possible to create trust
between several players from different entities. The trust which is
thus established is intrinsically linked to the rules of its protocol,
its architecture, as well as the players’ ecosystem.
It is therefore interesting to note that this is not just about
technology but also about governance and a community of
users which adhere to the rules of the protocol.

Classification
The existing platforms, can be divided between:
• Public networks and private networks
• Permissionless networks and permissioned networks
These two criteria can be combined. Thus, there are public
permissionless (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum), public permissioned
(Ripple), private permissioned (Ethereum private, Hyperledger
Fabric) networks.

16

Blockchains and domain names

At present, the world of domain names is still highly centralized due to ICANN’s exclusive
control of the DNS root, and therefore of global domain name rules of governance.
In the past, a few unsuccessful attempts have been made to create an open DNS, such as Open
NIC, but the next big development appears to be the decentralized ecosystem. The number
of initiatives in this regard has in fact multiplied recently. Below are the most significant:
• Namecoin is a derived open source (fork) Bitcoin technology that uses, amongst other
things, the addition of 2 new OP_CODEs (elementary operation of bitcoin script language),
which makes it possible to record and read information linked to domain names.
Namecoin promises to increase the decentralization of DNS management, and to improve
security, censorship and privacy.
Unfortunately, Namecoin is not currently operational due to many reasons such as domain
squatting. It is worth noting that the Namecoin community has put forward a very simple
solution to a major problem, that is, the significant increase in the cost of domain name
renewal. This solution has not yet been implemented due to insufficient take-up.
• Blockstack is the first implementation of a decentralized DNS system on top of the Bitcoin
network. This implementation combines DNS functionality with a key public infrastructure
and is primarily intended for use by new applications.
Blockstack has been operational since September 2015 and currently manages over 70,000
domain names.
• Ethereum Name Service (ENS). Rather than sending ETH to a public key that is difficult
to memorize, ENS sends to a jon.sno.eth. type address. The ENS initiative is without
doubt one of the most promising. Its May 2017 launch was a success with 150,000 names
attributed at auction using a deposit system that had already collected over 3 million ETH.
https://ens.codetract.io/

ENS opens up a promising method for future developments that may give them the exact
same features as domain names. Further, they may already be used in this way within
navigators such as Mist, the Chrome Metamask plug-in or the online wallet MyEtherWallet.
Although ENS does not yet include a maintenance cost for each name held, this development
is in the pipeline. It will lead to questions similar to those that have historically impacted the
world of domain names, that is, concepts of life cycle, grade period and, lastly, drop catching.
The second market has already begun with https://www.enslisting.com/, for example.

17

Decentralizing auctions in real time
The limitations of current auctions
All the online auction platforms that currently exist are based on one centralized operation.
They rely on proprietary and closed software. As a result of this centralization, these platforms
share the same limitations:
•

They are not transparent
Bidders have no way to ensure the origin, authenticity
and legitimacy of a higher bid. Only the organizer has this
information.

•

They are not open

Every bidder must use the organizer’s platform for registration,
authentication and bidding. So, as there are a huge number of auction
organizers worldwide, a bidder must register many times over. They must
therefore manage many different accounts and learn how to use a new
and different interface each time.
•

The ecosystem is very limited

Because no one standard exists, each organizer has developed
its own bidder interfaces and tools. But this proliferation has
brought down the quality. For example, most auction organizers
don’t have mobile applications – or their mobile apps aren’t
ergonomic. Similarly, it is almost impossible to find associated
auction services even though there is a high level of interest from
buyers for services ranging from purchase finance to delivery.
Multiple worldwide auction platforms with a range of standards mean that bidders face
additional limitations involving payment methods or the cost of making international
payments (exchange rate charges and commissions).
In the world of LIVE auctions, physically run by an auctioneer, most are not yet connected
through an online platform. Even when this is the case, once again, the ecosystem is of
extremely poor quality: limited ergonomics, poor quality audio and video streaming, a
lack of delivery options…
Currently, auctioneers must go through only one provider that sets its own tools and
platform. No open solution exists that would allow auctioneers to directly and easily
expand the audience for their sales worldwide.

18

Designing an auction blockchain

We will launch a new, open, decentralized platform that is dedicated to real time
management of any auction, worldwide, whether online or live.
We want to establish the fundamentals of an ecosystem that is accessible to all, with unlimited
functionalities and potential. In effect, everyone will be able to connect in order to sell, bid,
organize an auction or offer a service to the ecosystem.
The functionalities available on our platform will therefore expand progressively and quickly,
as they are more widely adopted by the community and by auction professionals.
Thus, our solution is:
•

Scalable, reliable and transparent:
Thanks to the distributed repository
protocol, each operation will be
registered within the network in a way
that is transparent, publicly verifiable
and virtually impossible to falsify.

•

Interoperable: The client will be able to
participate in auctions run by numerous
worldwide auction organizers – using just
one interface. In this way, each bidder
will be able to select from numerous
applications or interfaces in order to
follow or participate in any auction in
the world without changing their habits.
This interoperability will also make it
possible to link to other distributed
repositories such as those processing
identity or background data.

19

•

Fast: In order to remain compatible within the
“real time” constraint of live auctions (that is, those
physically run by an auctioneer), the blockchain will
offer the technical consensus mechanism detailed
below, ensuring that each higher bid is validated in
less than 1 second.

•

Very low transaction cost: The technical consensus
mechanism selected will make it possible to
secure highly reduced transaction costs based on
new tokens. This will make it very easy to join the
blockchain

> > > > In itself, the decentralized platform will be a low level layer. It will only provide the
technical fundamentals required (detailed below) to register transactions when bidders and
higher bidders create sales.
But thanks to its open standard, it will be possible to superimpose numerous additional
layers and modules to extend the functionalities and possibilities:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Time limits
Anti snipping
Increments
Payment guarantees

20

Quick up-take by professionals

Designed by a player active in the auction world, the DomRaider solution offers an
immediate response to industry needs.
Professional auction organizers will be keen to connect their system to the network as it
will offer visibility to their auctions and will bring them new buyers.
As the number of buyers increases, the prices will increase, offering them an immediate
benefit.

Further the DomRaider solution will not require them to abruptly break away from the system
they already use. They will be able to adopt it gradually, fully independently, by separating
out the functional stages. For example:

1. Straightforward publication of auctions on DomRaider by the organizer without
clients being able to participate,
2. Publication and participation authorized for clients already registered with the
organizer,
3. Participation and payment (in paper money or cryptographics),
4. Participation open to all, secured by a payment guarantee,
5. Participation open to all with payment services, trusted third parties, delivery…

The key point is that professionals will be able to adopt the DomRaider
solution without having to suddenly switch from their existing system.

21

The emergence of an ecosystem

Thanks to its open and standardized nature, anyone will be able to offer sales relating
to interfaces or services, and to receive remuneration for these.
For example, a mobile developer could design and offer an application that acts
as a universal interface for all blockchain auctions. It could receive remuneration
through the automatic deduction of a commission on the sales generated through
its application.
In this example, the auction organizer will have set the initial auction parameters, and
whether or not an intermediary is authorized to deduct a commission. If yes, then they
will be able to set a minimum tariff.
There fore allowing each party the freedom to implement their own rules sets a fair market
value:
•

The auction organizer will control the level of the commission that they is willing
to pay,

•

The distributors and publishers of client applications will be able to decide a
maximum commission tariff for featuring or valuing auctions that are underway.

A specific operation

Currently, most blockchain technologies experience real uptake challenges. However,
DomRaider benefits from a structure that is already established and financed, as well
as a proven business model that can facilitate the adoption of blockchain technologies
by integrating them into a solution that is open to the public and accessible to all.
As the DomRaider interface is able to remain unaltered, there is no need for users to be fully
aware of the disruptive principles or technical complexities of the world of decentralized
applications, which sometimes hinder adoption.
We intend to progress through the following stages:

1

3

Launch of our network
with a number of limited
and controlled nodes
(contained latency
network)

5

Launch of a program of
financial incentives to
encourage other parties to
set up new nodes on the
network

Migration of the existing
DomRaider platform to
ensure compatibility with the
decentralized network, and
switch of client domain name
auctions onto this platform

Development of first

2

Expansion and
diversification of nodes in
order to guarantee ever
more transparency and
immutability

We will do the same with
providers of auction

We will offer financial incentives to
third parties to contribute to the
expansion of the ecosystem in order to
integrate specialist partners (specialist
knowledge, KYC, financial guarantees,
lenders, logistics, market places…)

23

The technological element
Technical challenges and limitations
In order for the DomRaider network to be widely adopted, it must offer a solution that is
flexible enough to fulfill the following criteria:

•

Rapid approval: To remain compatible
with “live” auctions, it is necessary to
have a short approval time regardless
of the number of users and transactions
competing on the network. We envisage an
approval time of less than one second.

•

Scalability – Supporting millions of users
and transactions: As each auction generates a
significant number of signatures, the technology
used must be able to carry the burden of this
information without however reducing the
network’s performance or creating transaction
delays. The ability to put an interface in place
depends on the availability of a thin client
and the ability to manipulate data (research,
navigation) that have reached consensus on
the network’s various nodes.

24

•

Maintaining an extremely low transaction
cost: Wide network adoption must inevitably
involve strict control of transaction costs for
users.

•

•

Staying up to date: Taking into account the
network’s high financial load, the technology
used must be able to ensure sufficiently smooth
maintenance, correction and development. In
particular, we must be able to remain fully able to
respond to any security threat.

Interoperability: We must be in a position to accept
any type of fiat currency ($, ¥, €) or cryptocurrency
in order to enable escrow deposit guarantees, but
also to manage identity or any other user profile
metadata.

25

Accessibility – Focus on the issue of interfaces
Many interface categories must be put in place depending on the target user’s level of
competence:
•

API for automatic auction software

•

Javascript or turnkey mobile modules for our partners

•

Lightwallet for general public users accessing the service from their smartphones or
phones

•

Heavywallet (full client) for advanced users and those using the service from a laptop or
desktop. This offers more auction options as well as a research and navigation interface
in public auctions.

The token management system also plays a role here and for professional users we must
enable the option to manage hot and cold wallets, that is wallets that reveal their DRT
reserve (DomRaider Token, detailed below) online (hot wallet) and others that enable
offline storage (cold wallet). Being offline, ‘cold storage’ solutions are more secure and
therefore more difficult to hack.

User authentication
The user’s cryptographic identity is also their network authentication and allows them to
carry out transactions (creation or offer of bids).
There are two potential auction registration methods:
•

Private auction: The auction organizer shares an auction username with a list of users.
Only those invited (on a whitelist) may place a bid

•

Private auction: Anyone may join and take part.

26

Development of our platform
Before planning to develop our own technology, we will benchmark (carry out a comparative
study) of all the technological variables that might form the basis of our auction solution,
either for setting up our solution on platforms, of for implementing a fork to adapt it
specifically to auctions.
The alternatives that have been examined can be categorized into two categories:
•

Full on-chain solutions: auctions are entirely managed under the network infrastructure

•

Mixed hybrid on-chain and off-chain solutions: auctions are partially managed
outside the network infrastructure using security provided by the deposit of on-chain
guarantees and by transactions signed and published outside the network.

On-Chain Solutions

27

•

MultiChain :

MultiChain (a solution published by Coin Sciences Ltd) is a (fork) technology that emerged
from Bitcoin and is dedicated to the business world, which is why functionalities such
as rights management (permissioned) have been added, an installation process and the
addition of automated nodes, the ability to manage multiple assets, and the functionality
known as “Data Streams.
The Data Streams functionality involves adding a key value database to a blockchain
infrastructure, which can also be used for managing time series. This function could prove
a good basis for the (on-chain) management of auction data with accurate time stamping.
“Production ready” MultiChain 1.0 was announced very recently, that is, on 2 August 2017,
which makes it even more appealing, especially as scalability has been quoted as 1,000
transactions per second (to be benchmarked within our context).

•

Bitcoin sidechain:

The sidechain concept was invented and patented by the well-known company
Blockstream, which employs some contributors to the Bitcoin Core.
A “sidechain” is a blockchain (Bitcoin) extension that serves to put in place functionality
that isn’t available within the “parent chain”: privacy, confidential transactions (hidden
values), scalability, new signature standards, Zero Knowledge Proof, etc.…
Blockstream recently (22 May 2017) announced that its product “Liquid” was in a beta
program with around a dozen large client companies.
Among the advantages of sidechains for auction management, we already foresee:
•

The ability to segment sidechains: geographic information, auction professional
categories, etc.…

•

Scalability, both in terms of the number of users and the number of transactions

•

Data reliability and security when we peg our sidechains to the Bitcoin network.

28

•

Ethereum (permissionned):

At this stage, use of the public Ethereum network isn’t suitable for managing on-chain
auctions.
However, a permissioned Ethereum infrastructure (but with a public playback network)
with Parity and an ad hoc consensus algorithm such as Proof of Authority might make
it possible to achieve significant capacity. Moreover, this configuration is currently being
tested at the Energy Web Foundation (http://energyweb.org/), which has announced that
capacity could in time reach 1 million transactions per second.
Another advantage of the Parity solution is the highly promising Polkadot infrastructure
(https://polkadot.network/) that would enable numerous blockchain infrastructures to
communicate (credit exchange, execution of smart contracts).
Within the Ethereum ecosystem, auctions could be put in place using a Smart Contract,
which would be in charge of verifying norms while the infrastructure would time stamp the
bids placed by participants.

•

BigchainDB:

BigChainDB is a technology that uses the benefits of classic NoSQL solutions to achieve
scalability and resilience by incorporating the idea of transactions and by adapting the
consensus algorithm (a model known as the Federation Consensus Model)
BigChainDB technology can be deployed on a private or public network (IPDB network).
This technology’s clear benefits could make it extremely appealing within the auctions
context: load capacity (1m writes per second), rich permissions model (flexibility for open
auctions or auctions restricted to a whitelist), dynamic changefeed, linear capacity.

29

•

HyperLedger Fabric:

The Hyperledger Fabric product was initiated by IBM, which soon entrusted it to the Linux
Foundation. The Hyperledger ecosystem (which is bigger than Fabric) has experienced
extremely high growth and the consortium already has 150 members from all industry
sectors, including Cisco, Airbus, American Express, SAP among others.
Hyperledger Fabric (in 1.0 since June 2017) was designed to respond to business needs
and offers privacy, scalability, a fully searchable datastore to easily access the content of
transactions organized in blocks, and numerous consensus algorithms that can be adapted
according to context.
•

ByteBall:

Although it doesn’t operate using the block concept, the Byteball platform forms part of
the blockchain ecosystem because it offers the same promise of decentralization and
transaction management without a central controlling body. For the sake of simplicity, one
could argue that it does in fact use the block concept but with only one transaction. It is
interesting to note that a fundamental reason for implementing block is the ability to pay
miners, which isn’t a requirement of the Byteball ecosystem.
The absence of a block above all means the absence of block time. Thus, a transaction (a
bid in our case) is written onto the network without a confirmation time lag, other than
network latency. False or invalid transactions remain present but are disregarded.
Byteball transaction data are organized in DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which creates a
data structure that is hard to falsify in so far as each new transaction validates preceding
transactions.
The chatbot technology incorporated into Byteball is also of interest as it can act as the
basis for an auction interface.
Equally, Byteball displays two types of asset: bytes for classic transactions, and Blackbytes
for private transactions where the raw transaction content (legible format) is sent directly
to the receiver rather than being published. In order to ensure that there is no doublespend within Blackbytes, the transaction hash and spend-proof are stored. It is therefore
possible to manage closed or private auctions even when the network is open.

30

Finally, Byteball makes it possible to issue assets that cannot be moved without the cosignature of the issuing body (e.g. bank, auction organizer who wishes to manage and
validate the identity of a bidder). This option is of interest when managing bids in line with
KYC / AML requirements where they apply.

•

IOTA:

The features of the IOTA platform (relevant to auction management) are similar to those set
out in the Byteball section so do not need to be set out again.

•

NEM:

The NEM platform provides services such as payment, messaging, asset issue, and also
domain name management.
One of NEM’s unique features is the consensus algorithm known as Proof of Importance
(POI). The algorithm adjusts the importance (of a node or identity) depending on the
number of transactions, the identity used to carry out transactions, and other factors.
Importance strongly influences the probability of a node being selected for calculation of
a block and collection of charges linked to that block. This system is connected to the
reputation management Eigentrust++, which makes it possible to filter false identities
within the network. This mechanism is extremely encouraging within the auction context
where it is sometimes necessary to avoid dealing with individuals whose behavior is
inappropriate.
NEM (or an in-house network based on the same principles) may also be of interest for when
it comes to putting in place an auction system because of the POI benefits, particularly
the low barriers to entry (energy, cost) necessary for setting up a node. The concept of
importance is also of interest.

31

•

WAVES:

The WAVES platform includes a decentralized exchange and trading platform, a wallet
with a simplified customer experience, but also a gateway that complies with fiat currency
regulations (including the euro). This highly unique positioning makes it a potential
competitor to leading platforms such as Ethereum.
From a technical point of view, the implementation of a limited number of miner nodes
and the consensus algorithm known as Leased Proof of Stake (LPoS), a derivative of the
Delegated Proof of Stake, adds above average scalability and speed.
Within the context of auctions, it is worth undertaking an analysis of the type of the actors
that will operate the nodes.

•

Open Bazaar:

Open Bazaar is a fully decentralized free e-commerce marketplace. The project is founded
on multiple technologies: the Kademlia hash table system (based on the BitTorrent
protocol), IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), Ricardian Contracts and the Bitcoin network.
The OpenBazaar platform (currently only accessible on desktop) is extremely inspiring
from the client experience viewpoint as it allows the final user to search and navigate a
service catalogue (which could also include bids). It also offers live chat, which allows
e-traders and users to communicate. Our ability to create this type of experience is key to
the success of our project.

•

Other:

We remain open to and on the lookout for any exciting new developments within the
ecosystem to find any new system that applies and is useful to a decentralized auction
system. In particular, we will follow the development of new Tezos, EOS and other new
platforms that will soon be launched.

Off-Chain Solutions

•

Principles of micropayment channels:

The principle of micro-payment channels is similar to the tab system currently used by, for
example, hotels. The process has 3 stages:
> A security deposit opens the tab. This is the payment network’s 1st request: the
channel open transaction,
> The tab increases each time a service is consumed – the network does not request
payment: channel use,
> The tab is closed when the trader settles the balance due – this is the second and
final payment request made by the network: closure of channel.
The process is similar in the blockchain universe:
> The channel is opened through the (on-chain) publication of a multi-signature
security with an (on-chain) lock
> There is an (off-chain) exchange between the client and the trader through shared
intermediate transactions (tab’s intermediate amounts) or signed cryptographic
information that is not published on the network
> The channel is closed when (one of the parties) publishes the final intermediate
transaction (or closing information), which enables the amount due from the client to
be settled.
The advantage of this method is that thousands of transactions can be made with only
two requests for payment from the network, which minimizes transaction costs while
also guaranteeing settlement.

34
•

Application to the auction mechanism:

This process is described from the perspective of micropayment for an ERC20 token
available through the Ethereum network. This depiction can be adapted to any other
platform. The process unfolds in 3 stages:

TRADER

2

0

Deposit (10%)*

3

Deposit returned to client

Payment of the auction that has been won

Auction
Smart Contract
TRAFFIC ON
YOUR WEBSITE

1

Participation in the auction
CLIENT
*10% of the bidder’s maximum participation

> Stage 1: Opening of micropayment channel. Each auction participant places a “deposit”
through a Smart Contract, which represents a bid.
From the technical point of view, the deposit is a combination of “transferForm”
functions (to the “smart contract address) and “approves” the ERC20 token standard.
> Stage 2: Off-Chain exchanges. Exchange of a signed character chain that combines the
bid amount and its identity.
> Stage 3: Channel closing. Reimbursement of all auction participants other than the
auction winner.
It is worth noting that the payment taken to initiate the bid may not represent the total
amount, which would allow professional users to participate in numerous auctions (on
the basis that they won’t win all of them). We can envisage payment of a small sum, for
example 10% of the target amount, on the basis that a delay in payment by the winning
bidder is possible. In the event that the amount is not settled, the user may lose their
security deposit and get a bad reputation within the system, which may exclude them from
certain types of auction.

35

Other issues
•

Clock synchronization:

The operation of auctions requires that particular attention be paid to registration of the
date that information is received from bidders. Thus, particular attention is paid to the
issue of clock synchronization within network nodes.
We intend to use NTP (Network Time Protocol) type protocols and must examine their
efficiency when nodes are not located within the same network.
•

Privacy:

The transparency of a decentralized approach may allow all users (both well intentioned
and ill-intentioned) to reconstruct a person’s activity through data analysis (data mining).
This possibility makes it difficult to protect a person’s privacy on our decentralized auction
system.
Various (combined) approaches will be implemented to protect user data:
> Use of Hierarchical Deterministic wallets (inspired by BIP32 Bitcoin) in order to access
new sub-identities for each new transaction
> ZKP (Zero Knowledge Proof) protocols
•

Token migration:

The first version of the DRT token is managed on the Ethereum platform via the ERC20
token standard.
Once the target platform is in place, we envisage the eventual migration of the token onto
this new platform.
Should this become necessary, a token migration mechanism will be put in place to offer
all DRT token holders the option to migrate their tokens onto the platform that has been
put in place. The exact methods and time available for carrying out this migration will be
shared in due course.

36

Roadmap
First version
Description:
The first version of our platform is developed on the basis of security guarantees that
use ERC20 DRT tokens and on an auction management system founded on BigChainDB
technology.
In fact, we have deemed this a realistic approach for the establishment of our platform
within the given timeframe, that is, December 2017, with a view to integration into our
DomRaider service in 2018.
In order to control transaction costs, we initially favor using BigchainDB on our own servers
rather than using the public IPDB infrastructure. Partnerships will be created to diversify
the parties operating our network nodes.

Using the DRT token:
The DRT token is used to open credit within
our auction platform.
This approach makes platform use easy and fluid
while ensuring that participants are serious, as
any user who fails to finalize their payment within
the given time frame (in the event of winning a
bid) will lose their security deposit and will receive
a reputation score that may exclude them from
certain sales.
We suggest the principle that a security deposit
(SD) will by default cover a credit search to a value
equivalent to 10 times the deposit amount. This
default amount may be adjusted on a case-by-case
basis by each auction organizer.
From a technical point of view, the deposit is made when a specific function is requested from our
DRT token. This function has the following parameters: amount to be frozen, length of freezing
period, address of the bot that can unfreeze the funds or seize them as a transaction penalty (the
penalty can be set by each auction organizer).

37

Using BigchainDB:
Each transaction is a BigchainDB asset whose configuration settings represent information relating
to the bid.
Each bid, higher bid and winning bid is a BigchainDB transaction relating to the asset.
BigchainDB load capacities may (following configuration) allow for handling of a large number of
bids and in close to real time.

PRIOR TO AUCTION
•
•

The auction organizer creates a BigchainDB asset that opens the sale
The user(s) place a DRT deposit to open a credit search whose sum is linked to the
number of tokens deposited. This deposit can be made in two ways:
> The DRT token gel (cf paragraph above)
> A Bitcoin payment, Ethereum to a DomRaider bot that generates a deposit address
and carries out the DRT token gel for the user account. It is worth notice that by using
the Shapeshift service this operation will be possible using other cryptocurrencies.

•

The bot registers the deposit and records the information within the BigchainDB data

DURING AUCTION
•

Users place bids and higher bids via a BigchainDB transaction on the “targeted” asset. The
auction rules are verified in accordance with the asset’s configuration data.

•

The validity of a higher bid is still linked to the deposit being sufficient (information is updated
by bots)

END OF AUCTION
•

The winner is declared and they must make payment in order to end the operation. If the
payment is made other than with DRT, the auction organizer must note this on the system
(cryptocurrency payments may be registered automatically by Domraider bots)

•

Other users have the option to either withdraw their DRT tokens or leave them as a guarantee
for other auctions.

•

The bots release the tokens and renew each participant’s “credit search”. Withdrawal of a user’s
DRT deposit guarantee is only authorized when no auction is in progress.

39

Administering nodes:
Initially, the system is launched using a small number of BigchainDB nodes, all administered by
DomRaider. Nevertheless, to increase the extent of our service’s decentralization, we will launch
a program aimed at diversifying the number of parties operating the network. Various different
incentives encourage an operator to set up a new node:
> Optimization and control of network latency for an auction network user
> Partnership with auction sector operators.
> Monthly sponsorship program (participation costs carried by servers) of the TOP
100 DRT nodes according to the quality of service and length of availability. This
program will be launched over only 12 months and when it ends DomRaider will
decide whether or not it is worth replicating.

Proof of Concept to determine the best long-term
solution
In parallel to developing version 1 of our platform, an R&D team is working on a number of distinct
Proofs of Concept (POCs) to follow the evolution of different technologies.
At this stage, we envisage that the following POCs are the most relevant:
> Byteball for testing time stamping without the constraints of block time,
> Sidechain in order to test chain segmentation,
> Micropayment channel with ERC20 tokens to assess scalability and check our
control over transaction costs using this principle.
However, depending on the way things evolve, the solutions assessed may be different to those
envisaged and set out in this document.
In the event that a technological solution demonstrates greater relevance than that in development
or in production, we will work on (and communicate) a plan to migrate from our platform, under
the proviso that this does not change user interfaces.

the amount held corresponds to 50 euros. In the event
that the auction participant wins the sale, they will have
5 days to pay for the bid and any failure to do so will result in them losing their security deposit (the 50 euros).

42

Using the DomRaider Token
Information
DRTs may only be used to participate and access auctions set up using DomRaider technology.
Once this auction network has been created, DRTs may be used on the network as outlined below.
However, DomRaider tokens cannot be used prior to DomRaider having developed the blockchain
technology for auction sales. They may, however, be freely exchanged once they have become
available.

To sum up, the bidding system set up by DomRaider will make it possible to:
•

Acquire DRTs

•

Use DRTs

PROVIDERS OF ADDITIONAL SERVICES

Spotters

Bidders / Buyers

Organizers

Sellers

43

Acquiring tokens

• By selling goods or products at auction
Rather than settling with fiat currency, the auction organizer may choose to directly provide
the seller with the profits of the sale in DRTs. A skilled seller may also act both as seller and
organizer. In this way they will have complete control over their auction.

•

By receiving sales commissions:
> As an auction organizer:
An organizer is free to set the level of the commission they wishe
to deduct from the winning bid of any auctions they launch. This
commission, paid in DRTs, will be added or deducted from the
final sales price, in line with the initial settings.
> As an intermediary:
When an organizer has allowed for this in their initial configuration,
business providers, platforms or even mobile application
providers may receive a commission in DRTs on sales where the
winning bidder has gone through this intermediary.

•

By selling associated network services: Any service provider wishing to provide a
complementary auction service may take part in the planned transactions and receive
payment from clients in DRTs. For example, a financial services provider who guarantees
a security deposit against volatility during an auction may bill for its services in DRTs.

44

Spend tokens

•

By organizing auctions: Publishing a new auction on the network does
not involve a direct transaction cost for the organizer, however they must
first provide a deposit guarantee in DRTs. This will be fully reimbursed at
the end of the completed sale as all sale transaction costs are added to
the sales price. The security deposit may at any time be partially retained
to cover transaction costs in the event that the sale does not complete, or
if the organizer cancels it, or if the winner is exempt from direct payment
(organizer client or sales parameters).

•

As a security deposit for certified auctions: For auctions where the
organizer requires a security deposit, bidders must systematically “cover”
their bids with an associated security deposit in DRTs. This deposit will be
held in escrow only during the time that the auction is valid and will be
released as soon as the client loses their hand. It works in a similar way to a
debit pre-authorization on a bankcard.

•

By winning bids: For auctions where the organizer requires a security
deposit, winning a bid leads to the transfer of the corresponding sum placed
by the bidder in their security deposit. The sum is then distributed between
the buyer, organizer and intermediary. It is possible to envisage that the
security deposit might be a little higher in order to cover exchange rate risk
between an auction’s fiat currency and the DRT, which might arise during the
sale period. Where applicable, the buyer will be reimbursed the remaining
differential at the end of the sale.

45

Volume of transactions

Launch of the DomRaider network will very quickly involve all transactions from
auctions directly organized by DomRaider.
With their already high growth, this will ensure that the network is immediately used
effectively, increasing the probability of large scale and quick uptake.
In addition, DomRaider will, as soon as possible, put everything in place to finalize first
integration contracts with major auction organizers.
An increase in the volume of global transactions will depend directly on the correlation of
3 intrinsically linked factors:
•

An increase in the number of organizers publishing new auctions

•

An increase in the number of auctions launched by organizers

•

An increase in the number of potential buyers following and taking part in
available auctions

•

An increase in the number of intermediaries promoting auctions on offer and
providing access tools

•

An increase in the number of complementary service providers extending the
network’s functionality for organizers and buyers.

46

Sale of DomRaider tokens
Trade-off
The tokens issued come with an “action requirement” from DomRaider, that is, to
develop a public auction blockchain.

Duration and process
Tokens will be sold from 16/08/2017 to 11/10/2017, in 2 phases:

The pre-sale: From 16/08/2017 at 0800 UTC/GMT to 11/09/2017 at 0800 UTC/GMT
The sale: From 12/09/2017 at 0800 UTC/GMT to 11/10/2017 at 8h00 UTC/GMT

The total number of tokens sold during the pre-sale period cannot exceed 75% of the total
number of tokens initially put up for sale by the ICO; that is, a maximum of 262,500,000 tokens.
If the number of requests received during the pre-sale period exceeds this level, requests
will be honored in chronological order in line with the set limit, and the excess orders will be
returned to clients.

•

15% of tokens, that is 150,000,000, will be distributed ex-gratia
to stakeholders that have contributed to the operation’s success

•

50% of tokens, that is 500,000,000, will be held in reserve by DomRaider.
Their use is detailed below

The tokens sold during the ICO, DRT, will only be issued at this time. In this way, their total
number will be determined and fixed at the end of the sale, guaranteed by a smart contract
linking them to the blockchain.

Les DRT seront négociables sur les exchanges. Nous sommes actuellement en discussion

48

Token availability
When the sales period ends, tokens will be issued and distributed to clients via a smartcontract within 7 days, that is, by 18/10/2017.
•

Sold tokens may be used and transferred from the time they are assigned.

•

20% of tokens distributed free of charge to stakeholders that have
contributed to the operation’s success will be immediately useable and
transferable. The remaining 80% will be released gradually at 10% of the
total each month from the date the first tokens are issued. In this way, every
holder of tokens obtained through this category will have received full free
usage and transferability of these tokens 8 months following their issue.

•

The tokens held in reserve by DomRaider will be locked at a level of 90% of the
reserve and released gradually at 5% of the total reserve per month. Their use
is described below.

Unlocking is carried out automatically in line with the rules set out in the token smart-contract.

49

Acquisition price and conditions

During the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) sales period, the tokens shall be offered at the
single price of €0.10/DRT ($0.117/DRT) (DomRaider Token).
As the payment of Orders are offered in multiple currencies, the number of tokens preallocated during an Order shall be calculated on the basis of the exchange rate in force at the
moment that the Customer’s payment is received.
Between the moment that the Order is validated by the Customer and the reception of the
Customer’s payment, there may be exchange rate variations which could lead to a subsequent
increase or decrease of the number of tokens pre-allocated to the Customer.
The payment of the tokens can be made by credit card, by SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)
direct debit, by SWIFT bank transfer or by PayPal.
Customers also have the possibility of acquiring tokens against other crypto currencies.
Thus, they can order DRTs against Ethers (the Ethereum network’s currency) or even against
Bitcoins.
Once again, the number of tokens pre-allocated during an order shall be calculated on the
basis of the chosen crypto currency exchange rate at the moment when the reception of the
Customer’s payment is confirmed. When a payment transaction is still valid 15 minutes after
its execution, it shall be considered as being confirmed (the number of confirmation blocks
can vary according to the blockchain used and the network’s level of congestion).
The chosen rate shall be that supplied by the Kraken exchange platform
> https://www.kraken.com
Any transaction fees (gas) shall be in addition and be paid by the
Customer.
The instantaneous conversion service, Shapeshift, shall also be offered to Customers wishing
to pay with another crypto currency used by the service. The same calculation method used
for the payment in Ether shall also be applied to set the number of pre-allocated tokens.
All the indicated and displayed prices shall be drawn up exclusive of tax and exempt from any
service not specifically listed.

50

The entire amount shall be due and payable at the moment of the order. The ordered tokens
shall only be allocated and delivered upon receipt of payment.
During the timeframe between the payment of the Order and the delivery of the tokens, the
funds or crypto currency paid by the Customer shall be kept by DomRaider.

The payment shall be considered to have been made when DomRaider cashes the effective
price. Any remittance of a title recognizing an obligation to pay does not constitute an
effective payment (bill of exchanges must be accepted beforehand). Early payment shall not
lead to a discount.
If the instructing party is not the End Customer, then the Customer shall undertake to
make sure that the End Customer complies with the formalities of French Law No. 75-1.334
regarding subcontracting, which shall be considered under the terms of the General Sales
Conditions as being an international public policy enactment, the absence of any presentation
or approval leading to the Customer’s impossibility to claim an Order against DomRaider (e.g.
for any claims regarding a non-compliance with regard to the specifications). The Customer
shall remain, nevertheless, bound to perform its contractual obligations with regard to any
third parties of the chain. Any telecommunication expenses incurred when accessing the
Company’s services shall be paid by the Customer.

51

Ordering process

1. Any Customer wishing to purchase tokens must register beforehand at DomRaider’s ICO
website:
> https://www.domraider.io/.
2. Customers must then validate the email address they have indicated, and then enter
their invoicing information.
3. Customers shall then be requested to enter the Ethereum portfolio address in which
they wish to receive the DomRaider tokens. If they do not yet have a portfolio, they can
follow the instructions to generate one.
4. They may then enter the number of tokens they wish to purchase and choose the
payment method of their choice.
5. In the event that a Customer wishes to make a payment in crypto currency, they shall
receive their own unique recipient address to which the currency they have chosen shall
be sent.
6. As soon as the deposit of the funds has been validated, Customers shall receive a
confirmation of their allocation by email.
7. At any moment, Customers can consult the history of their Orders and the tokens which
they have been consequently allocated at DomRaider’s ICO website.
8. At the end of the ICO sales period, Customers can monitor the status of the final
allocation of tokens and their delivery.

In order to prevent any phishing risks, please make sure that the address which
appears in your browser is uniquely and exclusively: https://www.domraider.io/ before
attempting to make a connection or purchase. In particular, check that the connection
is secured (green padlock) and that the extension of the ‘.io’ domain name is the right
one.

52

Token buyback program

In addition, and when its own reserve of tokens has been used up, DomRaider shall set up
a continuous buyback program in order to pursue the actions described in the previous
paragraph.

Stretch goals
If all the issued tokens put up for sale are sold out during the ICO sales period, DomRaider
reserves the right to increase the total number of DRTs to be issued during the Commercial
Operation.
In this case:

70% OF THE
ADDITIONAL TOKENS

shall be put on sale

AT THE SAME PRICE USED
IN THE PREVIOUS SALES
PHASE

30% OF THE
ADDITIONAL TOKENS
shall be distributed

FREE OF CHARGE BETWEEN ALL THE
DRT HOLDERS, IN PROPORTION TO
THE NUMBER OF TOKENS THEY OWNED
BEFORE THE INCREASE OF THE TOTAL
NUMBER OF TOKENS TO BE ISSUED.

If there are several successive modifications during the ICO sales period, the distribution of
additional free tokens shall be cumulative for each holder.
The calculation shall be identical whatever the nature of the future holders, including for the
stakeholders who contributed to the Commercial Operation and DomRaider with regard to
its token reserve.

53
Example:

Customer A purchases 10,000
DRTs pour €1,000 at the ICO
launch on 12/09

DomRaider decides to add 200
million DRTs to the total to be
issued, i.e., a total of 1.2 billion
tokens
30%, i.e. 60 million are
distributed free of charge to the
previous holders

The additional 140 million
tokens put up for sale are all
sold by 20/09

The 350 million DRTs put up for sale
(out of a planned total of 1 billion)
are all sold by 14/09

70%, i.e. 140 million are put up for sale
at €0.10 each

Customer A receives 600 additional
free DRTs as he or she already owns
10,000 / 1,000,000,000 (0.001%) of the
tokens. They shall therefore receive the
same proportion of the 60 million DRTs
distributed free of charge

DomRaider decides to add 300 million
DRTs to the total to be issued, i.e. a total
of 1.5 billion tokens
70%, i.e. 210 million are put up
for sale at €0.10/token

Customer A receives 800 additional free
DRTs as he or she already owns
10,600 / 1,200,000,000 (0.00088%) of the
tokens. He or she shall therefore receive
the same proportion of the 90 million
DRTs distributed free of charge

30%, i.e. 90 million are distributed free
of charge to the previous holders

In this example, the final distribution of the issued tokens shall be modified as follows:
• 46.7 % of the tokens, i.e. 700,000,000, sold during the ICO
•

12.3% of the tokens, i.e. 184,615,000, distributed to the stakeholders who contributed to
the success of the Operation

•

41% of the tokens, i.e. 615,385,000, to be kept by DomRaider

End of the sale

54

•

If, at the end of the sale period, on 11/10/2017, there are still some unsold
tokens, the two major shareholders of DomRaider, Eefficiency and Inovaa,
have undertaken to purchase the surplus.

•

If, on the other hand, at the end of the sale period, the orders are higher than
the number of available tokens, these will be allocated to the Customer by
chronological order of their Orders. Any Orders which are not honored, shall
be reimbursed to the Customers in question within the week via the original
payment method (bank transfer, credit card, PayPal or crypto currency).

Use of the funds
The profits from the sale of the tokens shall enable DomRaider to fund:
•
•
•

The growth of DomRaider’s business
The development of the blockchain dedicated to auctions
The acquisition of stakes in strategic targets in order to develop the use of the
network and its functionalities

The breakdown of the planned use is presented hereinafter, in the ‘financial considerations’
section.

55

Use of the tokens in reserve

DomRaider shall use the planned reserve of tokens for the following purposes:
•

To promote the project in order to develop the visibility and adoption of the network
> Bonuses and Bounty for the community
> Purchasing advertising visibility and media

•

Payment of incentives to broaden usage:
> Bug bounty
> Funding open source contributors
> Partnerships with auction organizers
> Partnerships with additional service providers

•

Additional sales to fund new aspects of the project or new acquisitions in order to
develop the DomRaider network

exponentially with its headcount increasing from 5 to 28 employees. In 2017, DomRaider has
been accredited in more than 20 countries and has opened its first 3 international branches.

In June 2016, Tristan was elected onto the AFNIC Board of Administration, the French
state’s official .fr registry under the authority of the Minister in charge of the Digital Economy.

Eric GU,
FOUNDER AND CEO OF METAVERSE
CHAIRMAN OF METAVERSE FOUNDATION
VICE PRESIDENT OF SHANGHAI
INFORMATIZATION ASSOCIATION
DomRaider is a hyper growth startup. We are specialized in drop-catching, a technique
developed to catch expired domain names.
Let me share a few numbers with you:
• Our team has tripled in one year
• This is spread over 3 countries, soon expanding to 5
• We’ve carried out more than 20.000 transactions, building an impressive customer base
• We are accredited by international registries for 27 extensions
• We secured 4M$ in funding
Our business is auction based and today, we would like to introduce the DomRaider network.
It’s an open source blockchain for decentralized real-time auctionsThe blockchain will be
transparent, reliable, scalable and interoperable - without compromising on speed. The
DomRaider network will be the core of a complete new auctioning ecosystem. This network will
provide an innovative solution for all worldwide auctioning players. Live auctioneers, escrow,
appraisal experts, delivery services, online auctions providers and mobile apps developers...
will all be able to join the network, provide their services and add value to the blockchain.
For several months now, new kinds of public offerings have been appeared. They carry out
fundraising in the form of cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or ether. They are called Initial Coin
Offering, referring to an IPO (Initial Public Offering). These operations are a method of rapid
financing for entrepreneurs in the world of blockchain. They allow them to test their project/
ideas on a community of experts. These fundraisings are attracting more and more investors
in search of financial gains, without always understanding the technological specifities of the
project.

Financial considerations
Underlying assumptions of this financial
forecast
Impact of the ICO on our business activity (turnover):
•
Token Sales (ICO): sales of 350,000,000 tokens at 0,10€ / token, averaging an agreed
average discount percentage of 20%, that is, an overall sale value of 28,000,000€
•
Token Sales (Stock): sale of 500,000,000 tokens over 40 months, that is, a spread
twice the length of that permitted. The overall sale value of the tokens is 1,250,000€
NB: this does not take into account sales or commissions resulting from third party use of
our “Blockchain auctions” solution.

Additional expenses:
•

Expenses associated with setting up the ICO:

•

1,000,000€ for the total amount of all expenses associated with setting up of this
operation (principally marketing/communication/press relation expenses)

•

280,000€ for commissions to intermediaries

•

Buyback program: 500,000€ per month from November 2017

•

Development of our community (promotions, bounty, incentives, partnerships, etc.):
250,000€ per month from November 2017

86

Other expenses and products:
•

Risk provision (exchange / illiquidity risks) to the sum of 22,400,000€ that is 80% of
overall sales

•

Reversal of these provisions over the 4 years following the sale at 25% per year
(5,950,000€ / year).

Investments:
•

Acquisition of an LBO company (April 2018)
•

•

•

Financial operation:
•

Purchase price and expenses: 20,000,000€

•

LBO with 25% capital contribution (that is 5,000,000€) and 75% bank
financing (15,000,000€) by means of a 6 year loan at 2.5%/year

Target activity:
•

Turnover: 30,000,000€

•

Gross profit: 10%

•

3% annual turnover growth

Development of our “Blockchain auction” solution (Intangible assets amortized
over 3 years):
•

At 300,000€ per month during the 1st year

•

At 200,000€ per month during the 2nd year

•

At 100,000€ per month from the 3rd year

NB : these developments are likely to lead to tax reductions (Research Tax Credit) or to increased activity (capitalized
production) as well as to appreciably improve the company’s accounting position. As a precaution, these elements have
not been taken into account in the attached forecasts.

An ICO inspired by the
principles of IPO
DomRaider is a French société par actions simplifiées
(simplified joint stock company) registered in France since
2013. The company’s annual accounts are audited by
KPMG, its statutory auditor.
The operation’s regulatory compliance is therefore a key
aspect of the company.

For this groundbreaking operation, DomRaider’s adopted
principle has been to follow as closely as possible the methods
used for IPOs in order to put in place «good practices» similar
to those already used in the stock market.
Maître Hubert de Vauplane, partner at Kramer Levin Naftalis
& Frankel, and Maître Simon Polrot at the Fieldfisher law firm,
also co-founder of Ethereum France, counsel DomRaider in
their capacity as experts in the legal, regulatory and tax issues
relating to blockchains.
While this does not involve the sale of securities or financial
instruments, the documentation embraces the principles of
stock market regulations in order to ensure that subscribers
understand the risks associated with this operation, as
required by said stock market regulations.
> Informal contacts have also been made with certain French

General terms and conditions of sale

These General Terms and Conditions of Sale («GTC») are entered into between the Company
DomRaider, 22 Allée Alan Turing, 63000 CLERMONT-FERRAND, France, with a Share Capital of
€ 23,426, registered in the Clermont-Ferrand Trade and Companies Register under number
794 171 140 (represented by its chairman, SARL INOVAA (itself represented by its manager,
Mr. Tristan COLOMBET) duly authorized for the purposes herein, hereafter referred to as «the
Company», and the natural or legal person purchasing the Company’s products or services,
hereafter referred to as the «Buyer» or «Client».
These GTC apply fully and automatically to all the products and services offered for sale by
DomRaider as part of the commercial operation entitled «DOMRAIDER ICO» (the «Commercial
Operation») towards its Clients.
These terms and conditions do not apply to other products and services marketed by
DomRaider, concerning domain name reservations in particular. Please refer to the specific
terms and conditions for each product, available on the corresponding website
These terms and conditions form the basis for the sales negotiation. They prevail over all
other documents issued either by the Client (e.g. GPC, Charters, etc.), or by DomRaider (e.g.
correspondence) and, as from their date of entry into force, shall apply to all purchases,
including outstanding orders, and are deemed to be unconditionally accepted by the Client
as of the conclusion of an order. Any derogation from the GTC herewith will require the
express agreement of both Parties. Any other document (e.g. sales prospectus, quotation,
presentation, etc.) is therefore given for information only and shall not constitute a contract
document that commits the liability of DomRaider, which may therefore withdraw or modify
such documents, without entitling the client to any compensation. These points are a key
factor for DomRaider’s consent.
The GTC form a contract between the Client and DomRaider for the purposes of the
Commercial Operation. By clicking on «I hereby certify that I have read and expressly accept
the present General Terms and Conditions of Sale», the Client accepts and acknowledges
that they are entering into a binding contract with DomRaider and agrees to abide by it. To
accept the General Terms and Conditions of Sale, click on «I hereby certify that I have read
and expressly accept the present General Terms and Conditions of Sale».

106

Website

All the details on the Commercial Operation are available on the website
https://www.domraider.io/
DomRaider reserves the right, with no prior notice, to:
•

Modify, add or delete any content on the website excluding any binding contract items
between DomRaider and the Client. The Client will be deemed to have accepted these
modifications as soon as they visit and use the website following publication of said
modifications.

•

Block, limit or restrict access to the website, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently.
DomRaider may not be held liable for the website being unavailable or difficult to connect
to, regardless of the consequences for the Client.

Tokens
Tokens - role and attributes
The Commercial Operation covered herewith involves the sale of virtual tokens, referred to
as «DomRaider Tokens» («DRT»).
These tokens will allow their owners to access the DomRaider auction network, once
this has been designed, developed and deployed. Under no circumstances may DRTs be
used as a method of payment or exchange for other services offered by DomRaider. The
Company is solely responsible for deciding whether to provide the auction service to token
owners, within the technical, legal, economic or other constraints imposed by third parties
or by the Company itself on its operations. The Clients’ attention is therefore drawn to the
fact that purchasing tokens does not confer automatic access to the auction service. DRTs
may not be used before the effective creation of the DomRaider auction service.
DRTs will not be reimbursed in the event that the DomRaider Auction Service is
not ultimately developed, or does not operate on a permanent basis. DRT owners
acknowledge that this is a significant risk that they accept.
The token owner is the person eligible to perform a cryptographic transaction, subject to
approval by the Ethereum network.

107
The buyer accepts and acknowledges that these tokens do not entitle their owners:
•

to participate in any decision or vote within the Company

•

to benefit from the Company’s results;

•

to derive any economic or other gain from the Company.

The Client therefore acknowledges that they are fully aware both that the tokens are in no
way associated with ownership rights, voting rights or dividend rights, and that they do not
constitute shares in DomRaider or in any other comparable asset.

Issuing tokens
On concluding the Commercial Operation, these tokens will be issued by a technical
process referred to as a «Blockchain». This is an open source IT protocol over which the
Company has no rights or liability in terms of its development and operation. The token
distribution mechanism will be controlled by a Smart Contract; this involves a computer
program that can be executed on the Ethereum network or on a blockchain network that is
compatible with Smart Contract programming language. The Tokens will meet the ‘ERC20’
standard (https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard), and will be
subject, inter alia, to the operating conditions of the Internet computer network and the
«Ethereum» blockchain protocol. The Company has no control, right or liability over the
operation of the protocol and the Ethereum network.

The tokens will be issued by the Company or by a third party with the Company’s
authorization. Instructions will be posted on the Commercial Operation website at
https://www.domraider.io. The Company has no control over and may not take any action
against blockchain technology, the Ethereum network and the protocol, or the Smart
Contract and its code in performance mode. Therefore, DomRaider may not be held liable
in any way for any feature that might affect the token passing scheme or ownership of the
tokens sold, or that might hamper the client’s ability to use the tokens, including display
of the tokens in an electronic wallet compatible with the ERC20 token standard, or the
assignment of these tokens to a third party.

108

The acquisition of tokens by transferring tokens or crypto-currencies to the Smart Contract
comes under the Buyer’s sole liability and will be subject to the terms and conditions of
the protocol and the Ethereum network. As Tokens are issued under a Smart Contract, the
Company is not obliged to reimburse or compensate in any way any Buyer whose Tokens
have not been issued by the Smart Contract for any reason.
Once issued, the tokens may be freely assigned or transferred to third parties by the Client,
in whole or in part, at their own initiative, in return for payment or free of charge. However,
the Client shall be solely and fully liable for the conditions and consequences of such an
assignment or transfer of the tokens in their possession. In particular, given that DomRaider
will have no control over such transactions, the Client may not claim against DomRaider
for any loss of their tokens due to any error of any kind that may occur during the transfer.

109

Information and knowledge of the
subject by the client

By adhering to the GTC, the Client expressly acknowledges having been thoroughly
and comprehensively informed about the Commercial Operation.

•

The Client is deemed to be fully aware of all the legal norms and technical constraints
relating to the purchase, possession and use of crypto currencies and tokens based
on blockchain technologies, and to the auction service offered by DomRaider.

•

The Client agrees to notify DomRaider in full concerning any information
likely to impact on their order directly or indirectly. Should the Client fail
to do this, DomRaider may not be held liable in any way in this regard.

An order is any order relating to the services marketed on the DomRaider website and
accepted by DomRaider (the «Order»). It is deemed to be irrevocably accepted by the Client
as from the time DomRaider issues the order’s acknowledgment of receipt; as from this date,
it may not be cancelled or amended without DomRaider’s express agreement, the latter
being entitled to decide not to proceed without entitling the client to any compensation.
DomRaider also reserves the right to rectify any clerical error or omission in the contract
documents binding it to the Client without entitling the client to any compensation.
OBLIGATIONS BINDING UPON DOMRAIDER: DomRaider agrees to take all the necessary
care and diligence to provide a quality service in accordance with current business practice
and state of the art. DomRaider is solely bound by an obligation of means. In particular,
it will not be possible to use DRTs if development of the DomRaider auction network
is not implemented. In such a case, the DRT value would most likely be equal to zero.

110

Client eligibility and liability

As with the Domain Name Reservation Services offered by DomRaider, the sale of
tokens under this Commercial Operation is reserved for experienced professionals
who have an in-depth understanding of the nature of the product they are purchasing,
a firm grasp of the technologies on which they are based, and who are fully aware of
all the associated risks.

Clients seeking to buy tokens are deemed to be acting for the purposes of a professional
business activity and not as a consumer;
The Client is solely liable for determining which legal, accounting, financial and fiscal
conditions of any nature it is required to comply with in order to participate in the
Commercial Operation, in accordance with the laws and regulations applicable in their
country of residence.
DomRaider may not be held liable for the Client’s filing obligations in the country in
which it is domiciled. The same applies to any tax or charge that would be payable
by the Client, in relation to the purchase, ownership, use or passing of its tokens.

Limitations of Use
Prior to any Order, the Client acknowledges and accepts that tokens sold by
DomRaider do not, under any circumstance, represent any form of investment or
financial investment and agrees not to attempt to divert their function for speculative
purposes.
•

The Client also agrees not to use the ICO website, the issued tokens and, more
generally, any content or service provided to the Client by DomRaider that does
not comply with the objectives and methods set out in these GTC.

•

In particular, the Client agrees not to modify, interfere with, deactivate or saturate,
nor to breach the security of or impair data integrity and confidentiality in relation
to any service offered by DomRaider.

•

The Client agrees to respond to any specific request for information issued by
DomRaider under the application of these terms and conditions.

111

Cancellation and refund

All token Orders are deemed firm and final. No Order confirmed on the DomRaider website
may be subsequently canceled at the Client’s request.
The Client acknowledges that they are fully aware that they will not be entitled to claim any
full or partial reimbursement under any circumstances whatsoever.

As the sale of the proposed tokens is strictly reserved for an experienced professional
clientele, the Client may not claim any right of return against DomRaider.

Guarantee
No claim may suspend payment of the Order.
As the tokens offered for sale are deemed intangible property, having no value or
functionality other than the DomRaider service credit that they represent, no guarantee is
attached to them following delivery.
Although ownership of the tokens depends on smooth operation of the Ethereum network,
DomRaider, which has no control over said operation, may not, under any circumstances,
be held liable for any failure of said network that could result in the Client losing or being
unable to use the tokens.

Software Risks
Certain platform items and features are currently under development. Accordingly, the
Client accepts that the development is not guaranteed to succeed, that the platform is
subject to software and technical risks and that said items and features may never be
deployed on the platform.

112

Validity of tokens

The tokens’ period of validity, during which they can be used, is not time-dependent.
However, DomRaider reserves the right to set a limit at a later date should this prove
necessary.
In such a case, the announcement would be made on the DomRaider website, together
with an email to all the clients who participated in the ICO. A minimum period of 6 months
would be granted to token holders in order to enable them to use their remaining credit.
Tokens cannot be deleted due both to their strictly decentralized nature and to the fact
that, once issued, they are no longer under DomRaider’s control. They would, in any case,
remain the property of their owner. On the other hand, on expiration of the period of
validity, they would simply be no longer accepted on DomRaider.
Any tokens not exchanged on DomRaider by this date would simply be of no more value.

Incidents, late payments, penalty clause
The Client is prohibited from any illegal practice of automatic debit or credit, here assumed
to correspond to a non-payment or late payment. However, the Parties reserve the right to
seek legal or contractual compensation for claims. Any delay in payment will automatically
result in the application of a flat-rate €40 fee as from the date following the invoice’s due
date; this fee will supplement late penalties, including the application of an interest rate
on arrears equal to the rate applied by the ECB to its most recent refinancing operation
plus 10 percentage points, with DomRaider being entitled to automatically demand full
and immediate payment of the Order, all amounts owed to DomRaider becoming payable
immediately with no prejudice to the application of the other clauses herein, while any
discounts that may have been granted will be canceled and the full cost of the debt collection
procedure charged to the Defaulting Client. DomRaider also reserves the right to suspend
or cancel any Order relating to said Defaulting Client, and to accept subsequent Orders
only if payment is made in advance. Should the Client breach any one of its obligations,
and should formal notice issued by means of registered mail remain unsuccessful for 15
clear days after dispatch, then, under a penalty clause, the Client will be required to pay a
flat-rate compensation equal to one third of the total Order amount, with no prejudice to
the application of the other clauses accepted herein.

113

Client liabilities

The Client acknowledges that they are solely liable for storage and use of the purchased
tokens under normal conditions of use, and in accordance both with current legislation at
the time and place of use and with their profession’s code of conduct, which they declare
they are fully aware of.
Accordingly, they shall be deemed personally liable for any damaging consequences arising
from the abnormal, noncompliant or unforeseeable storage, transfer or use of said tokens.
The Client also acknowledges that they have received all the necessary details from
DomRaider on the information and data they have communicated and are therefore solely
liable for the ordered tokens’ suitability in terms of their specific planned use.
The Client agrees to send DomRaider their correct and updated payment and personal
details at the time of creating their client account and each time they may modify the said
account. DomRaider reserves the right to request supporting documents from the Client to
ensure the accuracy of the details they have supplied.
The Client will be solely and exclusively liable for the logins required to sign into the
DomRaider website. DomRaider shall not be held liable for any illegal or fraudulent use
of the Client’s login. The provision of logins is deemed confidential. Any suspicion of
intentional or unintentional disclosure of the login shall engage the Client’s sole liability,
excluding that of the company.
The Client will assume full responsibility for the consequences of any theft or misuse of
tokens acquired as a result of any use by the members of its staff or by any person to whom
the Client has provided their login(s). Similarly, the Client will assume full responsibility for
the consequences of the loss of the above-mentioned login(s).

114

DomRaider disclaimer

The Client expressly acknowledges the random nature of the DomRaider auction
network development project as presented in this document (see below for risk
factors) and that this project, therefore, may not come to fruition or may have to be
abandoned due to technical constraints, without the DRT tokens being used. In such
a case, the Client expressly acknowledges and accepts as an essential condition of
the GTC that it will not be entitled to sue or bring any direct or indirect legal action
before the courts, the arbitration bodies or any alternative dispute settlement body,
either in France or abroad, against DomRaider, its directors, shareholders, employees
and subcontractors in the event of the non-performance, non-deployment or nonimplementation of the DomRaider auction network, even in cases where their DRTs
have lost some or all of their value.
In addition, DomRaider may not be held liable for any of the following:
(a) use of services that are not compliant with the terms of the contract;
(b) non-performance, failure, malfunction or unavailability of the services due to a third
party, the Client, a third-party product, or the Client’s breach of its obligations;
(c) indirect damages such as business loss or disturbance, loss of orders, operating
loss, infringement of the trade mark, loss of profits or clients (e.g. improper disclosure
of confidential information concerning said clients due to failure or piracy of the system,
third-party proceedings against the Client, etc.)
(d) loss, disclosure or unlawful or fraudulent use of user sign-ons by the client or third
parties;
(e) suspension of access or temporary or permanent suspension of services (in particular,
arising from a request issued by an appropriate administrative or judicial authority, or
notification received from a third-party;
(f) loss, alteration or destruction of all or part of the content (information, data,
applications, files or other items) hosted on the infrastructure, insofar as DomRaider
is not responsible for managing the continuity of client activities, and data backups in
particular;
(g) mismatch between the services and the client’s needs (in particular, with regard to
the sensitivity of the relevant data),
(h) security incidents relating to use of the Internet, concerning in particular the loss,
alteration, destruction, disclosure or unauthorized access to the Client’s data or details
on or via the Internet;
(i) damage to systems, applications and other items installed by the client on the
infrastructure

115

Title retention clause

DomRaider retains full ownership of the ordered tokens up to full and effective payment
of the price agreed with the Client, including the principal and other charges, any contrary
clause being deemed unwritten. As such, DomRaider will be entitled to claim them as
compensation for any unpaid invoices with no prejudice to its right to rescind any sales in
progress, with the Client also agreeing to immediately notify DomRaider of any third-party
development that would infringe DomRaider’s right of ownership. Should the tokens be
resold before payment is complete, the sale between DomRaider and the Client will be
automatically rescinded and the assets transferred deemed to have been sold on behalf of
DomRaider. The enforcement of DomRaider’s right to claim is carried out without prejudice
to any other legal and/or contractual damages or rights (e.g. compulsory execution or
cancellation of the contract) and is made by simple registered letter sent to the Client.
Should DomRaider decide to cancel the sale, the Client will be required to pay a lump sum
equal to 30% of the total contract amount (principal and other charges), with DomRaider
retaining all the amounts it has already collected.

Intellectual property, reference
The Client acknowledges that DomRaider retains sole and exclusive ownership of all
intellectual, industrial and expertise rights relating to tokens, documents, data, etc. The
technical and technological resources and expertise used to design both DomRaider
tokens, and documents of any nature, shall remain the exclusive property of DomRaider
regardless of whether they are protected under an intellectual property clause. Therefore,
any document, listing, database, etc., in its entirety, is given to the Client in return for
payment or free of charge solely as a loan for use that exclusively enables them to make their
Order, under or not a separate availability and/or non-disclosure agreement that forms an
integral part of these GTC, and may not be used by the Client for any other purpose without
incurring their liability.

116

Cancellation

Should the Client fail to comply with any one of these clauses, DomRaider may cancel the
sale automatically 15 full days after sending a simple notice that has remained unsuccessful,
the said cancellation being performed with no prejudice to the other clauses herein.
DomRaider will be entitled to declare or uphold the cancellation thus incurred despite any
offers to pay and execute obligations that are made subsequent to the cancellation, or any
payment or execution of obligations made after the allotted deadline.

Contract completeness, waiver, interpretation
Should any of the clauses in these GTC be declared null and void or deemed unwritten,
all other clauses shall remain in full force and effect. DomRaider’s decision not to avail
itself of any one of these clauses shall not be construed as a waiver of its right to apply
the same clause at a later date. The interpretation and assessment of the validity of any
contract is understood in accordance with the following documents, in descending order
in the hierarchy of norms: GTC, order acknowledgment of receipt, invoice, and delivery
notification.

Force majeure
Force majeure is deemed any event beyond the parties’ control, which they cannot
reasonably foresee or reasonably avoid or overcome, provided that its occurrence makes
it impossible to fulfill the obligations, and adversely affects Order execution or contract
balance (e.g. natural cataclysm, substantial change in the price of resources, variation in
customs duties, armed conflicts, labor disputes, changes in regulations, subcontractor
failure, machine breakdown, etc.). The most diligent Party shall promptly notify the other
Party by any means, and the Parties will then agree to negotiate in good faith any changes
required to ensure the continuity of contract obligations. If, however, such impossibility
exceeds three months, the most diligent Party may terminate the contract in writing
without incurring its liability and without entitling the other party to claim any right of
recourse or compensation, with DomRaider retaining previously collected amounts, which
are irrevocably acquired.

117

Protection of personal data

The processing of personal data performed under the Service has been declared in France
to the National Commission for Data Protection and Liberties under N° 1738136.
In accordance with Article 32 of French law N° 78-17 of 6 January 1978 relating to Information
Technology, Files and Civil Liberties, DomRaider, which is responsible for processing the
said data, will inform the Client that it is processing their personal data. The details entered
by the Client on the forms available on the website are intended for authorized DomRaider
personnel for administrative and business management purposes. These data are
processed, firstly, to allow Clients to access and use the service and DomRaider to execute
the service, and secondly, to prospect for new clients. Data marked with an asterisk are
mandatory. Failure to enter such data may delay enrollment or the use of the service.
•

The Client agrees and authorizes DomRaider to share its personal data with
other Clients as well as with any trusted third party for the sole purposes of the
service.

•

The Client is entitled to access, question, modify, rectify and delete their own
personal data.

•

The Client is also entitled to object to the processing of their personal data for
legitimate reasons, as well as to object to the use of such data for the purposes of
prospecting activities.

To exercise their rights, the Client shall notify their request to DomRaider, attaching a copy
of their signed ID document.

•

The Client shall comply with the provisions of French law N° 78-17 of 6 January 1978
relating to Information Technology, Files and Civil Liberties, amended, any breach
of which is deemed a criminal offence. In particular, they shall not collect or misuse
data and, in general, perform any act likely to infringe the privacy or reputation of
individuals.

118

Legislative developments

The Client acknowledges and accepts that the DomRaider ICO operation is taking place
within a French legal environment that is still under development. New laws or rules may
subsequently frame, modify or clarify the practice of such operations. Where necessary,
should legislative changes conflict with all or part of these terms and conditions, DomRaider
reserves the right to amend the terms of the operation as appropriate, retroactively if
necessary, in order to ensure that the operation remains legal and compliant with the
various French regulatory bodies.
DomRaider will respond to any request issued via regular legal process aimed at obtaining
specific information about the operation or its clients, particularly in terms of the fight
against money laundering.

Language, jurisdiction
These GTC and any contract relationship relating to the products and services sold by
DomRaider are governed exclusively by French law, DomRaider’s commitment being
subject to this clause. Translations of the terms and conditions herein, made available to
the Client, are purely informative and are not legally binding. The French version of these
terms and conditions has sole legal force.
The Parties agree to seek an amicable settlement prior to bringing any legal action. Failing
this, any dispute, of any nature whatsoever, will be brought expressly before the court
with jurisdiction over DomRaider’s registered headquarters, as no document can effect a
novation or waiver of this jurisdiction clause.

119

(i) any reliance on the information contained in this
document,

A DRT does not represent an investment
in a security or a financial instrument within the meaning of EU Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 relating to
markets in financial instruments: DRTs confer no direct
or indirect right to DomRaider’s capital or income, nor
does it confer any governance right within DomRaider;

120

A DRT is not proof of ownership or a right of control
Control over a DRT does not grant the controlling individual any asset or share in DomRaider, or in the
DomRaider network. A DRT does not grant any right to
participate in control over DomRaider’s management
or decision-making set-up, or over the DomRaider
network.
A DRT is not an electronic currency
Within the meaning of EU Directive 2009/110/EC of

supervision of the business of electronic money institutions: DRTs are not accepted outside the DomRaider
network and a DRT does not have a fixed exchange
value equal to the amount delivered at the time of its
issue;
A DRT is not a payment service
Within the meaning of EU Directive (2007/64/EC) of

Council of 25 November 2015: the ICO does not involve
the purchase/sale of cryptocurrency and DomRaider’s business does not consist in receiving currencies
against the delivery of cryptocurrencies.

A DomRaider Token, or «DRT», is a cryptographic
token used by the DomRaider network.
A DRT is a crypto-currency, i.e. an unregulated, digital
asset, issued and controlled by its developers, and used
and accepted by the members of a given community.

121

Selling Restriction
Participation in the ICO is reserved for natural or legal persons acting within the scope
of their professional activities. Any private individual acting on a non-professional
basis as a simple consumer within the meaning of EU Directive 2011/83/EU relating to
consumer rights is excluded from the ICO.
Documents linked to the issue of DRTs may not be transmitted or distributed to a
"U.S.person", to a Canadian or Singapore citizen or to a mail or email address in the
United States of America, Canada, and Singapore. It is prohibited to transmit, distribute
or reproduce documents linked to the issue of DRTs to or for a "U.S. person", Canadian
or Singapore citizen, or within the territories of the United States of America, Canada
and Singapore in whole or in part.
To ensure their eligibility for the purchase of DRTs, the buyer declares that they are not
a Canadian or Singapore citizen, nor a "U.S. person", (within the meaning of Regulation
S of the Securities Act 1933 in U.S. law), i.e.:
•

Any private individual resident in the United States;

•

Any partnership or business organized or established under U.S. law;

•

Any property of which the executor or administrator is a U.S. citizen;

•

Any trust of which a proxy is an American citizen;

•

Any agency or branch of a foreign entity located in the United States;

•
Any non-discretionary account or similar account (other than a trust or property)
held by a trader or other trustee for the benefit of or on behalf of a U.S. citizen;
•
Any discretionary account or similar account (other than a trust or trust) held by a
trader or other trustee, that is organized, established or (if a private individual) resident in
the United States; and
•

Any partnership or company if:
a

It is organized or established under the law of a foreign jurisdiction; and

b
It is formed by a U.S. citizen primarily for the purpose of investing in
securities not listed under the U.S. Securities Act, unless it is organized or established, and
owned, by accredited investors who are not private individuals, trusts or properties.

122

Warnings on the risks inherent to the ICO

Risk of loss of access to a DRT due to loss of
credentials
Until it is distributed to the buyer, the said buyer’s DRT may be linked to a DomRaider account. You can only access the DomRaider account using the credentials selected by the
buyer. The loss of these credentials will result in the loss of the DRT. Good practices advise
buyers to store their credentials securely in one or more backup locations that are geographically separated from the work location.

Risks associated with the Ethereum protocol
Both DRTs and the DomRaider network are based on the Ethereum protocol. Therefore,
any malfunction, unplanned function or unexpected operation of the Ethereum protocol
may cause the DomRaider network or DRTs to malfunction or operate in a way that is not
expected. Ether, the native Ethereum Protocol account unit may itself lose value in a similar
way to DRTs, and also in other ways.
For more information on the Ethereum protocol, see
> http://www.ethereum.org

Risks associated with the buyer’s credentials
Any third party that obtains access to the buyer’s credentials or private keys may be able to
use the buyer’s DRT. To minimize this risk, buyers must protect themselves against people
gaining unauthorized access to their electronic devices.

123

Legal risk and risk of adverse regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions

Blockchain technologies have been reviewed by various regulatory bodies around the
world, including within the European Union. The ICO has been structured to comply with
EU law applicable at the time of the offer.
Operation of the DomRaider network and of DRTs may be impacted by the passing of
restrictive laws, the publication of restrictive or negative opinions, the issuing of injunctions
by national regulators, the initiation of regulatory actions or investigations, including but
not limited to restrictions on the use or ownership of digital tokens such as DRTs, which
may prevent or limit development of the DomRaider network.
Given the lack of crypto-currency qualifications in most countries, each buyer is strongly
advised to carry out a legal and tax analysis concerning the purchase and ownership of
DRTs according to their nationality and place of residence.

Risk of an alternative, unofficial DomRaider
network
Following pre-sale and development of the original version of the DRT platform, there is
a possibility that alternative networks may have been established using the same open
source code and open source protocol that underlies the DomRaider network. The official
DomRaider network may find itself in competition with these alternative, unofficial
networks based on DRTs, which could potentially adversely impact the DomRaider network
and DRTs.

Risk of a lack of interest in the DomRaider
network or distributed applications
There is a possibility that the DomRaider network may not be used by a large number
of companies, individuals and other organizations, and that there may be limited public
interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest
could impact on the development of the DomRaider network and, therefore, on the uses
or potential value of DRTs.

Risk that the DomRaider network, as developed,
does not meet buyer expectations

The DomRaider network is currently under development and may undergo significant
redesign prior to its launch. For a number of reasons, not all buyer expectations concerning
the DomRaider network or DRT form and function may be met on the launch date, including
changes in design, implementation and execution of the DomRaider network.

Risk of theft and piracy
Hackers or other malicious or criminal groups or organizations may attempt to interfere
with the DomRaider network or the availability of DRTs in several ways including, but not
limited to, denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, mystification, smurfing, malware attacks,
or consensus-based attacks.

Risk of security weaknesses in the DomRaider
network’s core infrastructure software
The DomRaider network’s core software is based on open source software. There is a
risk that the DomRaider team, or other third parties, may intentionally or unintentionally
introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructure elements of the DomRaider
network, by interfering with the use of or causing loss of DRT.

Risk of weakness or exploitable breakthrough
in the field of cryptography
Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum
computers, may present risks for crypto-currencies and the DomRaider platform, which
could result in the theft or loss of DRTs.

Risk of a DRT mining attack

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and crypto-currencies, the blockchain
used for the DomRaider network is vulnerable to mining attacks, including but not
limited to, dual-expense attacks, powerful mining attacks, selfish mining attacks, and
critical competition attacks. Any successful attack poses a risk to the DomRaider network,
the expected performance and sequencing of DomRaider markets, and the expected
performance and sequencing of Ethereum contract calculations. Despite the best efforts of
the DomRaider team, the risk of known or new mining attacks exists.

Risk of the DomRaider network failing to be used
or adopted
While DRTs should not be considered an investment, their value is bound to change over
time. This value may be limited if the DomRaider network is not sufficiently used and
adopted. In such a case, there could be few or no markets at the platform launch, which
would limit the value of DRTs.

Risk of a tight market for DRTs
There are currently no exchanges or trading facilities on which DRTs can be traded. If such
exchanges or trading facilities do develop, they will probably be relatively new and subject
to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They may therefore be more vulnerable to fraud
and default than the established and regulated exchanges that exist for other products.
Should exchanges or trading facilities that represent a substantial part of the DRT trading
volume be involved in fraud, security failures or other operational problems, the failures of
such exchanges or trading facilities may limit the DRT value or liquidity.

Risk of an uninsured loss
Unlike bank accounts or accounts in other regulated financial institutions, funds held
through the DomRaider or Ethereum network are generally uninsured. At present, there
are no public or private insurance agents providing buyers with coverage against a loss of
DRTs or a loss of value.

126

Risk of winding-up of the DomRaider project

For a number of reasons including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in Bitcoin
value, an unfavorable fluctuation in DRT value, the failure of business relationships or
competing intellectual property claims, the DomRaider project may no longer be a viable
activity and may be dissolved or simply not launched.

Risk of malfunction in the DomRaider network
The DomRaider network may be impacted by an adverse malfunction including, but not
limited to, a malfunction that results in the loss of DRTs or market information.

Unforeseen risks
Crypto-currencies and cryptographic tokens are a new, untested technology. In addition to
the risks stipulated above, there are other risks that the DomRaider team cannot predict.
Risks may also occur as unanticipated combinations or as changes in the risks stipulated
herein.

Know your customer procedure (KYC)
As part of the Know Your Customer procedure (KYC), anyone wishing to acquire DRTs will
have to provide DomRaider with the following details via the dedicated ICO website prior
to purchasing DRTs:
• Surname and first name (for private individuals):
• Company name (for companies):
• Country of tax residence:
• Address:
• E-mail address.
