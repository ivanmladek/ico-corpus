Abstract
Due to its trustless nature, blockchain technology will come to dominate many
interconnected systems as its rate of adoption grows. When cryptocurrencies
first became available to the public, initial methods of mining blocks used
tremendous amounts of hashing power. However, Elixir proposes and
implements a new mining system based on proof of time and batch creation
with​ ​genesis​ ​transfers.
Elixir will also be the base token of a lending platform capable of analyzing
financial transactions between borrowers and lenders, and rewarding them for
successful loan payoffs. In the pages below, the mining system which Elixir is
built on will be explained in full detail, as well as the initial market that Elixir
intends to pursue to introduce cryptocurrencies to the mainstream and provide
real​ ​world​ ​use-cases​ ​of​ ​this​ ​new​ ​blockchain​ ​technology.

Introduction​ ​and​ ​Purpose
Ethereum smart contracts are revolutionizing the way information is distributed across the
world. The Ethereum blockchain can include these contracts, allowing new tokens and services
to be created for all manner of applications. The financial industry is incredibly large and
centralized, and has often been regarded as an unfriendly and profiteering market that does
not have the best interest of its clients in mind. With the creation and mass adoption of
blockchain technology, it is now possible to move towards a decentralized and more
trustworthy​ ​system.
Elixir aims to revolutionize the way lenders and borrowers make and receive loans with one
another. In a traditional model, a borrower will request an amount of money from a lender,
usually a bank or a credit union, and pay it back through installments over a specified amount
of time with interest in addition to the principal sum. This results in a lender being rewarded via
interets, while the borrower has received a suitable loan they have paid back in time. However,
the borrower is left unrewarded for completing their part of the deal. The Elixir lending
platform intends to reward both lender ​and ​borrower for completing a loan successfully and
uses rewards to incentivize each borrowing participant to pay back their loans in their agreed
installments and on time. Additionally, the lending service will eliminate the need to pay for
brokers, allowing the lender and borrower to receive the best deal between one another. To
help financial applications of cryptocurrencies become mainstream (in a way other than simply
functioning as a currency, such as Bitcoin), the initial lending service will be provided in the
form of a mobile application. This application will serve as a kind of social payment network
between friends and family. In addition, this initial lending service will include zero collateral
and interest, providing a purely incentivized reward system for borrowers and lenders to
partake. In the long term, this lending service will expand to a global scale, allowing anonymous
participants to create loans and borrow from others in a decentralized manner. This system will
2

track the credibility of a borrower to show how trustworthy they are, and give the lender an
idea​ ​of​ ​any​ ​potential​ ​risk​ ​a​ ​loan​ ​being​ ​made​ ​to​ ​a​ ​borrower​ ​would​ ​have.
Elixir aims to simplify the process of requesting a loan. To receive a loan from a bank or credit
union, one must apply through the bank’s lending department and identify how much is being
borrowed, for what reason, the length of time, and what interest rate. All of these factors are
then taken into account and a decision is made based on the worthiness of the borrower’s
credit score, which is also calculated in a way that favors people who have simply had a credit
profile for a longer amount of time. One of Elix’s goals is to develop a new
credibility/reputation system to tied to a user’s wallet address, without requiring participants to
divulge information that will be kept on a central server. This creditability system will be used in
the global lending service, and will be implemented after the friend and family lending
application. Requesting a loan on the global lending platform will be as simple as providing the
amount of Elixir a borrower wants, the time they need to pay it back, the number of
installments that will be made, and the collateral that will be put up to ensure the repayment of
a​ ​loan.

Genesis​ ​Pair​ ​Mining
Elixir can be mined by transferring any amount of Elixor (the base layer of ELIX) from a parent to
child genesis address. Elixor was distributed to genesis address holders, who provided a parent
and child Ethereum address that were be locked into the Elixir smart contract. There are three
types of addresses that exist in EXOR, the base layer of ELIX: parent addresses, child addresses,
and normal Ethereum addresses. Each parent address has an associated child address. Each
child address begins with one unit of currency. Every other type of address begins with zero
balance. When the owner of a parent-child pair wishes to generate currency, they move a
nonzero amount of currency into the parent from its child. The first ten transactions from a
child to its parent trigger the generation of currency in the child. To elaborate, each owner of a
parent-child pair can only create ten batches of tokens. The longer the owner waits to create
batches, the more tokens they will receive. Specifically, the tokens per batch created is a linear
function that allows 25% of maximum token generation when the system goes online, and
100% after 10 years. The maximum number of tokens per batch is 5000 tokens. Therefore, the
theoretical maximum number of tokens per parent-child pair is 50000. The increased batch
return over time is meant to incentivize long term interest in the token. Only the
aforementioned interaction between parent-child pairs produces batches. All other interactions
occur​ ​as​ ​expected.​ ​The​ ​number​ ​of​ ​tokens​ ​given​ ​per​ ​batch​ ​mined​ ​can​ ​be​ ​represented​ ​by:

where ​t ​is the time since the contract deployment, represented in years. To help better
understand the benefits of waiting to mine a batch between a genesis address, a list of several
possible​ ​scenarios​ ​are​ ​shown​ ​below:

Scenario​ ​1
You deploy all batches when the contract goes online. For each batch, you get the minimum
batch reward: 1250 EXOR. In total, you get 12500 EXOR. This is summarized in the following

Because Elixir relies on a proof of time mining system, the total supply of the Elixir token cannot
be determined at this moment, but a range value can be calculated by finding the minimum
total supply count and the maximum total supply count. It is assumed here that all batches will
be created, which probably will not be the case. The minimum total supply count can be
calculated by taking the total number of genesis address pairs (4,113) and multiplying by the
minimum batch size of every batch (12,500). The resulting minimum total supply would
therefore be 51,412,500. In contrast, the maximum total supply count with the maximum batch
size of every batch (50,000) would result in a total of 205,650,000. However, at the time of
revising this whitepaper, the current maximum total supply size is 139,356,672 and the
minimum total supply size is 52,727,808. It should be noted that because of this mining model,
the total supply count will follow a pattern of convergence; the sooner genesis pair address
holders mine their batches, the lower the maximum total supply will be. However, the longer
they hold, the higher the minimum total supply will rise. Early creation of batches will cause low
inflation in the long term. As of the time of this whitepaper revision, 42.5% of batches have
been mined. Eventually, these values will converge and ELIX will reach a final total supply count.
We​ ​estimate​ ​that​ ​this​ ​value​ ​will​ ​most​ ​likely​ ​be​ ​around​ ​60-70​ ​million​ ​tokens.

Lending​ ​Service
Consider​ ​a​ ​borrower​ ​and​ ​a​ ​lender.​ ​The​ ​borrower​ ​takes​ ​some​ ​amount​ ​of​ ​currency,​ ​uses​ ​it​ ​for​ ​a
purpose,​ ​and​ ​returns​ ​it​ ​at​ ​a​ ​later​ ​time.​ ​Virtual​ ​currency​ ​can​ ​be​ ​sent​ ​quickly​ ​by​ ​a​ ​lender,​ ​and​ ​a
borrower​ ​can​ ​receive​ ​that​ ​currency​ ​almost​ ​instantly.​ ​This​ ​document​ ​proposes​ ​a​ ​system​ ​in​ ​which
both​ ​the​ ​borrower​ ​and​ ​lender​ ​are​ ​rewarded​ ​when​ ​the​ ​borrower​ ​returns​ ​a​ ​loan.​ ​The​ ​act​ ​of
repaying​ ​the​ ​loan​ ​will​ ​be​ ​analogous​ ​to​ ​a​ ​trigger​ ​from​ ​child​ ​to​ ​parent,​ ​except​ ​in​ ​this​ ​system​ ​both
the​ ​child​ ​and​ ​parent​ ​will​ ​earn​ ​currency.​ ​Miners​ ​who​ ​do​ ​not​ ​need​ ​loans​ ​for
temporary​ ​spending​ ​can​ ​issue​ ​loans​ ​to​ ​themselves​ ​by​ ​moving​ ​tokens​ ​between​ ​2​ ​pairs​ ​of
addresses.​ ​Through​ ​the​ ​process​ ​of​ ​issuing​ ​and​ ​repaying​ ​loans,​ ​currency​ ​will​ ​be​ ​generated.
Simple Mining: A miner owns address A and address B. The miner would like to pair the
addresses to mine more tokens. The miner initially has 1500 tokens and plans to mine for a
month. The miner would like address A to charge Address B zero percent interest over the loan
period, since he can maximize loan reward by minimizing interest. The miner lets the smart
contract know he would like to form a borrower-lender pair. Interaction with the contract
specifies the loan period, loan amount, and interest rate. The miner moves the tokens to A by
the loan repayment time, and then holds the tokens in A for as long as he waited to pay back
the loan. Both addresses are rewarded. The reward for each address is proportional to the loan
amount​ ​and​ ​time​ ​the​ ​miner​ ​waited​ ​to​ ​move​ ​the​ ​loan​ ​amount​ ​back​ ​to​ ​A.
Clever​ ​Mining:​ ​Once​ ​a​ ​miner​ ​has​ ​created​ ​a​ ​loan,​ ​there​ ​is​ ​something​ ​clever​ ​he​ ​can​ ​do.​ ​He​ ​can
issue​ ​himself​ ​a​ ​loan​ ​for​ ​half​ ​the​ ​repayment​ ​time​ ​of​ ​the​ ​previous​ ​loan,​ ​thereby​ ​reaping​ ​some
extra​ ​reward​ ​before​ ​the​ ​holding​ ​period​ ​of​ ​the​ ​first​ ​loan.​ ​Indeed,​ ​though​ ​this​ ​behavior​ ​may​ ​seem
unfair​ ​at​ ​first,​ ​the​ ​miner​ ​will​ ​never​ ​more​ ​than​ ​double​ ​his​ ​rewards​ ​for​ ​a​ ​given​ ​time​ ​period.​ ​In
fact,​ ​this​ ​loan​ ​halving​ ​procedure​ ​is​ ​how​ ​this​ ​new​ ​currency​ ​is​ ​expected​ ​to​ ​be​ ​mined.​ ​Real
borrowers,​ ​who​ ​need​ ​to​ ​spend​ ​currency​ ​sent​ ​to​ ​them​ ​will​ ​likely​ ​participate​ ​less​ ​in​ ​this​ ​process.
Mathematically,​ ​if​ ​the​ ​longest​ ​loan​ ​is​ ​required​ ​to​ ​be​ ​paid​ ​back​ ​within​ ​x​ ​blocks​ ​and​ ​x​ ​is​ ​even,​ ​a
clever​ ​miner​ ​in​ ​an​ ​idealized​ ​case​ ​with​ ​zero​ ​gas​ ​costs​ ​could​ ​receive​ ​the​ ​following​ ​total​ ​reward
after​ ​waiting​ ​2x​ ​blocks,​ ​where​ ​r​ ​is​ ​the​ ​reward​ ​for​ ​the​ ​longest​ ​loan:

This​ ​sum​ ​converges​ ​to​ ​4r​ ​as​ ​x​ ​increases.​ ​Idealized​ ​miners​ ​who​ ​choose​ ​an​ ​odd​ ​number​ ​of​ ​blocks
for​ ​the​ ​largest​ ​loan​ ​will​ ​get​ ​slightly​ ​less​ ​a​ ​reward​ ​per​ ​block​ ​r/x​ ​due​ ​to​ ​the​ ​necessity​ ​to​ ​make​ ​the
number​ ​of​ ​blocks​ ​in​ ​the​ ​second​ ​loan​ ​even.
In​ ​this​ ​idealized​ ​example,​ ​the​ ​miner​ ​was​ ​able​ ​to​ ​insert​ ​two​ ​transactions​ ​in​ ​a​ ​specific​ ​order​ ​into
the​ ​same​ ​Ethereum​ ​block.​ ​In​ ​reality,​ ​miners​ ​will​ ​probably​ ​leave​ ​a​ ​break​ ​between​ ​the​ ​end​ ​of​ ​the
last​ ​holding​ ​period​ ​and​ ​the​ ​next​ ​loan​ ​repayment​ ​deadline​ ​to​ ​ensure​ ​they​ ​can​ ​pay​ ​off​ ​their​ ​next
7

loan​ ​in​ ​time.​ ​Automated​ ​systems​ ​will​ ​likely​ ​make​ ​this​ ​mining​ ​process​ ​more​ ​precise.​ ​The​ ​hashing
power​ ​of​ ​these​ ​automated​ ​systems,​ ​however,​ ​will​ ​not​ ​be​ ​of​ ​interest.​ ​These​ ​automated​ ​systems
will​ ​only​ ​perform​ ​a​ ​few​ ​transfers​ ​in​ ​rapid​ ​succession​ ​between​ ​the​ ​end​ ​of​ ​the​ ​last​ ​holding​ ​period
and​ ​the​ ​next​ ​payment​ ​time.
A​ ​borrower​ ​who​ ​does​ ​not​ ​participate​ ​in​ ​this​ ​halving​ ​procedure​ ​but​ ​borrows​ ​a​ ​loan​ ​of​ ​equal
magnitude​ ​for​ ​equal​ ​time​ ​will​ ​receive​ ​a​ ​reward​ ​of​ ​r.​ ​This​ ​makes​ ​sense​ ​that​ ​miners​ ​who​ ​use
halving​ ​and​ ​have​ ​to​ ​pay​ ​extra​ ​gas​ ​costs​ ​will​ ​be​ ​rewarded​ ​more.​ ​The​ ​actual​ ​number​ ​of​ ​loans​ ​the
miner​ ​chooses​ ​to​ ​create​ ​within​ ​a​ ​time​ ​frame​ ​will​ ​be​ ​limited​ ​by​ ​the​ ​price​ ​of​ ​gas.​ ​If​ ​either​ ​the​ ​loan
time​ ​period​ ​is​ ​too​ ​short​ ​or​ ​the​ ​loan​ ​amount​ ​too​ ​small,​ ​the​ ​gas​ ​cost​ ​for​ ​executing​ ​the​ ​loan​ ​will​ ​be
more​ ​than​ ​the​ ​reward.

Mobile​ ​Application
As mentioned previously, the mobile application will be the first demonstration of the lending
service’s capabilities to reward users for repaying loans between family and friends. The mobile
space is a largely untapped market for cryptocurrencies. Although many wallets and trading
services have been adapted to provide mobile interfaces, financial services using
cryptocurrency (like lending and borrowing) have not been added to mainstream stores like
Apple​ ​and​ ​Google​ ​stores.​ ​This​ ​lack​ ​of​ ​products​ ​is​ ​likely​ ​due​ ​to​ ​these​ ​factors:
1. The​ ​technology​ ​behind​ ​cryptocurrencies​ ​is​ ​new​ ​and​ ​has​ ​not​ ​developed​ ​to​ ​a​ ​large​ ​extent.
This​ ​includes​ ​cryptocurrencies​ ​themselves​ ​and​ ​the​ ​technology​ ​required​ ​to​ ​integrate
them​ ​into​ ​businesses​ ​seamlessly.
2. Most​ ​people​ ​aren’t​ ​aware​ ​of​ ​the​ ​wider​ ​applications​ ​of​ ​cryptocurrencies.
For​ ​our​ ​first​ ​product,​ ​we​ ​will​ ​be​ ​creating​ ​a​ ​mobile​ ​lending​ ​and​ ​borrowing​ ​platform​ ​with​ ​the
following​ ​key​ ​advantages​ ​over​ ​current​ ​services​ ​like​ ​PayPal​ ​and​ ​Venmo:

Token-backed​ ​reputations​ ​that​ ​double​ ​as​ ​earnings
Lower​ ​transaction​ ​costs
Higher​ ​Security
Greater​ ​Privacy
Reduction​ ​of​ ​fraud

Imagine you need to borrow money from a close friend to finish paying off your rent for the
month. You might pull out your phone, open a popular app like Venmo, and request your friend
send you the money you need. Next week when your paycheck comes in, you’ll pay them
back — possibly the same way. After doing this for a while, you hear about the ELIX app. Using
ELIX, you can borrow money from your friend, pay them back later, and both of you receive a
reward for you repaying your friend. Better yet, that reward isn’t in the form of useless “points”
or “stars” — instead, you receive tokens which you can trade for cash. You might need to
8

borrow money frequently. That’s ok — many people in the world do. But given the choice
between​ ​an​ ​app​ ​like​ ​Venmo​ ​and​ ​ELIX,​ ​which​ ​would​ ​you​ ​choose?

After​ ​you​ ​borrow​ ​your​ ​ELIX,​ ​you​ ​can​ ​sell​ ​them​ ​for​ ​USD,​ ​withdraw​ ​that​ ​USD,​ ​and​ ​use​ ​the​ ​money
for​ ​whatever​ ​you​ ​need.​ ​When​ ​you​ ​have​ ​the​ ​money​ ​to​ ​pay​ ​your​ ​friend​ ​back,​ ​you​ ​can​ ​buy​ ​ELIX
and​ ​square​ ​up.​ ​Finally,​ ​after​ ​a​ ​holding​ ​period,​ ​you​ ​and​ ​your​ ​friend​ ​can​ ​go​ ​out​ ​to​ ​dinner​ ​using
the​ ​tokens​ ​backing​ ​your​ ​now​ ​improved​ ​reputation.​ ​Through​ ​the​ ​ELIX​ ​app,​ ​we​ ​plan​ ​to​ ​use
cryptocurrency​ ​to​ ​re-imagine​ ​borrowing​ ​for​ ​people​ ​around​ ​the​ ​world.

There​ ​are​ ​also​ ​additional​ ​considerations​ ​to​ ​integrate​ ​purchasing/selling​ ​into​ ​the​ ​mobile
application.​ ​This​ ​includes​ ​using​ ​payment​ ​APIs​ ​like​ ​Stripe​ ​linked​ ​to​ ​a​ ​company​ ​ELIX​ ​wallet,​ ​which
would​ ​streamline​ ​the​ ​transition​ ​to​ ​and​ ​from​ ​fiat.
9

This​ ​app​ ​is​ ​the​ ​first​ ​service​ ​and​ ​beginning​ ​step​ ​in​ ​our​ ​journey​ ​to​ ​decentralize​ ​lending​ ​using
incentive​ ​driven​ ​payments.

Security
Security has increasingly become an issue in the financial sector. Just recently, a security breach
in the company Equifax affected the personal data of an estimated 145.5 million American
customers. Having sensitive financial data on a central server, especially data used to
authenticate financial transactions, is not ideal. Another primary issue with credit cards is the
linking of personal data like social security numbers and names to financial history. Ethereum
provides a way around this by using addresses to make transactions. This also increases user
privacy. Fraud is also easier to combat with decentralized systems, since there is no centralized
authority​ ​required​ ​to​ ​execute​ ​transactions.

Credit​ ​System
One of the long-term goals of ELIX is to build a credit score system backed by tokens. A credit
score can be represented by a tally of token rewards. In a general sense, rewards are generated
when users behave in a positive manner, such as successfully paying off loans in the number of
installments specified over a period of time. Other factors can include the number of trades a
wallet address has made, and the amount of money it had already traded. These factors would
all be read and analyzed through a smart contract, and would not require any information to be
saved on a database other than the blockchain. In our mobile app, token rewards will be
awarded when a borrower returns loans. The mechanism behind these rewards could be the
beginning​ ​of​ ​a​ ​much​ ​more​ ​complicated​ ​credit​ ​system​ ​executed​ ​by​ ​automated​ ​contracts.

Business​ ​Model
The mobile application space has a variety of options for generating revenue. Many mobile
platforms rely on paid features to generate revenue. This includes apps in gaming, lifestyle, and
many other categories. These profit models extend into the financial sector as well. Some
companies​ ​require​ ​payments​ ​for​ ​each​ ​use​ ​of​ ​a​ ​service.​ ​For​ ​example,​ ​from​ ​the​ ​PayPal​ ​website
There​ ​is​ ​a​ ​fee​ ​to​ ​send​ ​money​ ​as​ ​a​ ​personal​ ​payment​ ​using​ ​a​ ​debit​ ​card​ ​or​ ​credit
card.​ ​The​ ​fee​ ​in​ ​the​ ​U.S.​ ​is​ ​2.9%​ ​plus​ ​$0.30​ ​USD​ ​of​ ​the​ ​amount​ ​you​ ​send.​ ​For
example,​ ​if​ ​you​ ​send​ ​$100.00​ ​USD​ ​by​ ​credit​ ​card,​ ​the​ ​fee​ ​would​ ​be​ ​$3.20​ ​USD
($2.90​ ​+​ ​$0.30).
Since we want to make the ELIX mobile app simple and cheap to use, we do not plan to collect
money for user transactions. There is no reason a payment of 100,000 USD should forfeit the
10

customer of over 2,900 dollars. In our view, sending a payment should cost at maximum tens of
cents.
One variable in our model scales directly with both the size and involvement of the user base.
As more users join the app, and more miners buy up tokens to mine, this demand will be
reflected in increased net rewards. To sustain continuous development of the product, the
company can allocate a percentage of these rewards for company use. In this way, the business
continuously generates capital. Receiving this capital depends upon delivering a great user
experience​ ​and​ ​onboarding​ ​more​ ​users.
There are a variety of other features often incorporated into apps that could be introduced as
well. Many apps have paid features and limitations on freemium models. However, because our
freemium model generates revenue, we can focus on the above business model first. This
model will be simple to implement and requires the addition of only several lines of code. We
do not need teams of engineers to build memberships or paid upgrades; rather, we can focus
on​ ​our​ ​product​ ​and​ ​base​ ​our​ ​revenue​ ​stream​ ​only​ ​on​ ​its​ ​quality.

Fees
The only transactional costs between borrowers and lenders will be gas costs. Our goal is to
engineer​ ​the​ ​reward​ ​function​ ​in​ ​such​ ​a​ ​way​ ​that​ ​these​ ​costs​ ​are​ ​more​ ​than​ ​offset.
