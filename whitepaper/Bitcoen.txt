1. Introduction
The world first Community Open Exchange Network. Have you heard about the
cryptocurrency for communities before? Sure you haven’t. Because we’re the
first, the one and the only in the world.
We create a swift, decentralized and secure network that unites communities in
a global ecosystem.

BitCoen
The power of traditions and technologies
BitCoen (abbreviated BEN) is the first Community Open Exchange Network, a
blockchain-project, a business platform and a services system, complementing
it, developed for interaction between representatives of communities around
the world.

2. Short description of BitCoen blockchain
project
The goal of BitCoen project is First Community Open Exchange Network.
The objectives of the BitCoen project are:
1. Emission of BitCoen token on a stand-alone BlockChain independent of
others.
2. Development of the first loyalty program with points having a value equal to
BitCoen token. The name of this -token comes from the Open Exchange
Network.
3. Development of BitCoen ecosystem – BitCoen-wallet, the API payment
system. The main task of the BitCoen ecosystem is to develop the economy of
the communities, to provide employment opportunities and to help the
community to enter the crypto-economy, where the future comes.
4. Development of a payment system with popular crypto-currencies and
BitCoen in offline stores and Internet networks.
5. Providing maximum transparency of charitable transfers due to the
blockchain technology, the convenience of transferring funds to tzedakah and
others are needs of the community.
6. Association of businesses, goods and services on a single communication
platform to increase convenience for consumers, as well as the growth of
effectiveness of community businesses due to their advertising and attracting
attention by using a single advertising platform.

The needs of the communities
1. Stimulate the clients of different companies for the permanent use
of products and services of particular companies
2. A simple and fast tool for transferring funds. Transfers of funds to different
countries require a lot of time to collect documents, and that complicates
business processes and the solution of personal issues;
3. An understandable mechanism for transferring funds to charity. This platform
will allow us to make charitable contributions transparent. The project
as a whole makes it possible for ordinary users to use modern cryptotechnologies.

Why do we propose to use the blockchain and
crypto-currencies
The blockchain is a system in which all the actions of its participants are
recorded. Blockchain makes all the operations as transparent as possible; no
information can be withdrawn or restricted in the blockchain.
Bitcoen - token (short name BEN) - is a decentralized virtual payment tool, used
for payments within the ecosystem. token is not pegged to any one state, so it
can be easily used around the world. There is information on how many tokens/
points (in case of BitCoen) were emitted by the company in the blockchain. The
number of points remains unchanged: they cannot be reduced or emitted more,
thereby reducing their purchasing power. Since the number of points, а также
история движения токенов, issued by BitCoen is recorded in the blockchain,
BENs cannot be adulterated.

Main components of BitCoen blockchain project
1. BitCoen token is a tool, allowing purchasing, making mutual payments, paying
for services and donating to charity. The offline and online payment system,
which allows using BitCoen in everyday life.
2. BitCoen loyalty program (“BitCoen Loyalty”) for the community around the
world. By using this system for payments in stores, a user receives BitCoens
which can be spent wherever BitCoen is accepted for payment. A validity
period of charged BENs is not limited, they do not disappear.
3. BitCoen wallet (“BitCoen Wallet”) is a convenient system for daily use, both
for private persons and business, and has the form of online and offline
payment system.

BitCoen - how to earn and where to spend
BitCoen can be obtained by exchanging it for fiat currency or crypto-currency,
earned by receiving payments BENs, by doing something useful for the
ecosystem, or got, purchasing at partners of the loyalty program. (Link to
Blockchain loyalty program)

You can spend BitCoen:
•

at the partners of the project - these are the companies, that decided to
accept payments in BitCoens and participate in the loyalty program;

•

to join the general BitCoen loyalty program (for business)

•

for payment of services or gratuitous help to each other;

•

for charity.

•

for additional services in the Bitcoen Platform

•

as a commission for using the BitCoen Pay service

Six reasons, why you should become a partner of
BitCoen project
1. This is the first blockchain project, the use of which is supported by the
communities in Russia. The project was supported by the members of the
communities in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and Russia. Now the
negotiations with communities of other countries are in progress, it means
that while you are traveling, you can use the token with BitCoen and receive
bonuses for using it.
2. BitCoen ecosystem, on the one hand, is a set of handy tools for the life of the
communities, and on the other hand, it stimulates its development and
prosperity, creates new jobs and opportunities for implementation of new
ideas, staying within the limits of cultural traditions and values.
3. Using BitCoen platform, users can support their businesses, purchasing and
performing mutual settlements (both in B2C and in B2B segments) while
getting points from the loyalty program – BitCoen tokens.
4. Communities gets a tool, facilitating the collection of tzedakah, a tool for
receiving charitable donations, as well as for fundraising for specific
purposes, for the needs of community members from anywhere in the world.
Blockchain allows the accurate tracking of the arrival and distribution of

charity donated.
5. The representatives of communities receive a single point of entry for sale
and purchase services for other representatives of the communities,
effectively strengthening the connection.
6. The mutual help becomes even easier with BitCoen. BitCoen services allow
any member of the community from any place of the world to make a transfer
to another member of the community also regardless of his/her location. At
that, the transaction is almost immediate, with minimal fees and without the
need for additional levels of confirmation and control.

… And more reasons to become a member of the
BitCoen project
1. Connecting your business to the BitCoen platform (to do this, you have to
purchase BitCoens tokens), you get an opportunity to accept payments and
participate in BENs loyalty program, stimulating your customers to come
back to you again and again.
2. BitCoen holders participate in the privileges program, which includes not
only additional discounts and bonuses but also provides an opportunity to
receive education in the field of crypto-economy and the expansion of useful
business contacts.
3. BitCoen ecosystem is a friendly community that is easy for getting
opportunities for business development and advice from leading experts.
4. BitCoen company has advisers consisting of reputable representatives of
communities around the world, helping to develop the system. Maximally
transparent structure of BitCoen and processes inside is a guarantee of the
reliability of BitCoen ecosystem.
5. Joining the BitCoen project, you master the future technologies today and
step ahead of your competitors.

3. BitCoen blockchain project in details
BitCoen company emits 100,000,000 BitCoen tokens.
The organization sells BitCoen tokens to representatives of the community
around the world. The emission of BitCoens tokens is not limited to
communities, but it is supposed, that up to 90% of tokens will be gathered
within the community. The distribution is possible only by the registered
participants in the project.

4. Justification of BitCoen blockchain
project
The world communities and its needs, the blockchain technology, the
crowdfunding platform for creating new businesses and the developed loyalty
program, which, among other things, strengthens the interconnections within
the community are the main components of the project.

Practical example: David worked in the construction industry and for almost
ten years he saved up money to open his bar. Finally, the bar was opened. The
owner was tired of his long way to this dream but very happy. However, in a few
months, David has to close the bar, since there were no clients who would give a
minimum necessary profit, as for the interest loan it was forbidden by faith, and
his personal funds were over.
So this businessman needed a tool that would help him to get funds, not
breaking the rules of the religion, create an original client base and loyalty
program to keep customers since a bar is a highly competitive business.

5. Main products of BitCoen blockchain
project
5.1 BitCoen wallet
BitCoen wallet is a wallet, supporting BitCoen tokens. The wallet is available on
various platforms – Apple, Android, Windows, iOS for smartphones and tablets.
This means that by registering a wallet, for example, on a PC, the client is able to
use it and on other devices by taking private keys.
The interface of the wallet is intuitive, one can check the balance, receive and
send funds, and the design of the wallet provides the opportunity to use it
comfortably even for the most inexperienced user.
The program that allows defining points in a specified radius accepted by
BitCoen wallet is built in the mobile wallet. So the user does not have to look
in advance for shops and institutions, where he/she can spend BENs, the
program shows such points automatically in real time and constantly updating,
discovering new points
The interface of the wallet supports Hebrew by default.
The 15 years of experience of our team in the development of payment systems
allowed making BitCoen wallet functional, easy to use, and fast as much as
possible: quick transactions, a high accuracy of displaying of all processes on the
device screen.
The security of the wallet is a top priority task of its developers. BitCoen wallet
stores private keys on the device, therefore, only the user can control the funds.
One of the most significant options for users of technological payment platforms
is an efficient and high-quality support service. Support service of BitCoen wallet
and its mobile version works in all popular messengers 24/7.

5.2 BitCoen loyalty program
BitCoen loyalty program allows receiving BENs, making purchases at program
partners and spending them also at program partners
The Bitcoen team developed integration with the largest online stores, and

just after launch the users of the loyalty program can get BENs, making online
purchases in more than 700 store and buying goods offline.
The loyalty program stimulates the activity of customers of various businesses,
which have joined to the BitCoen Loyalty program.
You can pay for goods and services from partners of the loyalty program both
with BENs and with fiat money. In any case, the program participant gets bonus
BENs.
Unlike all current loyalty programs, user’s BENs cannot be canceled either by
the developers of the program or by its partners. The blockchain technology
does not provide such an opportunity. You can store the accumulated BitCoen
tokens for an indefinitely long term and spend them when such a need arises.
BitCoen loyalty program does not limit the amount of accumulated points. The
increase in the number of BENs allows any user to join the privilege program
(link to privilege app).

6. Essence of BitCoen tokens
BitCoen plans to release only 100,000,000 tokens.
Emission of tokens occurs once, at the launch of the network, and is distributed
among the participants according to the distribution scheme indicated in this
White Paper. Additional emission is not expected.
BitCoen tokens are essentially an independent product, an internal payment tool
within our platform.
At this BitCoen tokens within BitCoen Loyalty programs are the points of loyalty,
but can also be used as a payment tool within the BitCoen ecosystem, including
those for working with the BitCoen platform.
BitCoen tokens do not have a functional share and do not imply receipt of a
passive profit or other income. Tokens do not give voting right; tokens do not
give rights to income of the company. Tokens do not give the right to own shares
in the company, and stakes of the company.
There are two types of BitCoen tokens: basic and those with restrictions. The
BitCoen recipients and company’s partners owe most of the BENs.
The project team, advisors, Board members and recipients of bounties with a
view to project stabilization owe the tokens with restrictions on sales and/or
exchange.
For the project team, the limitation period is 2 years from the moment of the
allocation of BEN. For the board members – 2 years from the distribution of
BEN.
For advisers - 6 months from the date of distribution of BEN.
For recipients of bounties - 3 months from the date of distribution of BEN.

6.1 BitCoen for user
For a typical user, BitCoen token can be used as a payment tool for payments
for goods and services in kosher stores and establishments that joined BitCoen
blockchain-project.
You can pay tzedakah with BENs, as well as give them to the needs of the

synagogue, the evening Kollel for Chevra Kadisha, for Keren Chaya Mushka
mutual aid fund, for the help of veterans, charity events, tickets for holidays and
so on.
BitCoen tokens can be given to other persons within the personal settlements or
in the form of help. The geography of the transfer is not limited.
BitCoen is not restricted to the purchase of BENs. Large BitCoen holders
become clients of the privilege program.

6.2 BitCoen for business user
The Bitcoen ecosystem provides the business user with an online storefront
for his/her products and services, which is a single market place for community
businesses. Each user of the marketplace, as well as business, which joined
the platform is the member of the BitCoen Loyalty program, and also has the
opportunity to receive payments via Bitcoen Pay and pay for internal paid
services with BitCoen tokens.

6.3 Blockchain as the project basis
BitCoen is based on the source code of the izzz.io platform and uses a
consensus that is based on Limited Confidence Proof of Activity (LCPoA) and
a trusted node system (Thrusted Nodes) to speed up the network. It is also
planned to create a BitCoen compatibility layer with the ERC20 standard, for
easy integration with exchanges.
The choice of the izzz.io blockchain-platform is justified by the characteristics of
this system, which exceeds the analogs for a number of characteristics:

Bitcoen blockchain features:
- LCPoA blockchain algorithm that reliably protects the network from spam and
false transactions, while it does not require large expenditures of computing
resources;
- lack of mining in the system;
- transactions within the platform network - are free;
- high network speed (up to 25,000 transactions per second)

Scheme of the Bitcoen transactional system:

Thrusted Nodes are nodes that work with the keys that released at the launch
of the blockchain network, and used to speed up transactions by the absence of
distributed consensus.
Proof-of-Activity Fallback Consensus - a standby system of consensus in the
network. Completely decentralized, and allows the network to continue to work
if Thrusted Nodes are not available within 24 hours.
For distributed consensus, the time-dependent LCPoA is used.

7. Token Sale of BitCoen project
Token sale is launched to attract partners, ready to use the BitCoen ecosystem
for business and private interests.
November 28, 2017 – the official start of the Token sale, which will last until
February 15, 2018.

Should the circumstances hamper the Token Sale (technical disruptions caused
not by the developers, political situation, difficulty of transactions) BitCoen
system users can prolong the Token Sale in the concert-established period.

7.2 POST Token Sale
The BitCoen team reserves the right to issue BENs to the market from its
reserves. The cost of BENs issued after the completion of the Token sale
is determined by the market. The release of BitCoen from the company’s
reserves after the completion of the Token sale and their placement on the
stock exchange may be due to the need to fund new projects necessary for the
development of the BitCoen ecosystem.

7.3 Timeline of BitCoen blockchain project

7.5 Payment methods
Payments for BitCoen can be made using crypto-currencies BTC and ETH and
other cryptocurrencies.

Download the BitCoen wallet app and create your own wallet.
Step 1.
Go to the website http://bitcoen.io, enter your wallet number and log in.

the system generates the wallet address for the buyer (BTC, ETH), to which the
buyer should make a payment from his/her personal wallet (BTC, ETH). You
cannot directly send funds from exchangers, because the system is not able to
identify you correctly. BENs are charged to the account of the buyer.
Fiat money-payment with bank transfer
You can get the account details for payment in your personal account, as well
as all the necessary data for identification.

8. Marketing activity
The priority marketing task of the BitCoen team is to ensure the popularity
and fame for the blockchain project and BitCoen-token. The experience of the
BitCoen command allows us this to do.
For more than 15 years, the BitCoen team has been developing mobile
applications, the mobile payment systems and their implementing to the market.
Art Bureau studio Creators.ru (top 20 studios in Russia) the clients are Akado,
Gazprom, FLY Segway
Life-pay.ru service is the leader of the Russian hardware and software market of
acquiring. With 23,5 thousand customer companies for the first three years, it is
at the peak (2.5 billion turnover).
PayQR company allows paying for goods and services without cash, using
QR code. In 2016, PayQR received 300 million rubles of investments from
the president and co-owner of the «Incom» development company, Sergei
Kozlovsky. The total amount of financing exceeds $6 mln
For 15 years of work, our team has created more than 30 businesses with a total
amount of investments in 2 billion rubles.
The BitCoen team was the first to use the technologies of classic PR to support
its blockchain project. The articles in the leading media and television. The
stories tell the business community and ordinary users about the benefits
participation in the BitCoen project.
According to the National Agency for Financial Research (NAFI). About 28%
of the respondents have some information about crypto-currency, 16% of
respondents “have heard something”, and 12% know much about it. And only not
more 1% of Russians used crypto-currency.
The task of the BitCoen PR campaign in Russia is to tell about the project not
only to 1% of crypto-currency uses but also to that part of the audience, which is
only interested in products based on blockchain technology.
PR-campaign of BitCoen in the world implies the increasing of BitCoen brand
recognition and increasing confidence in it and the use of the BitCoen-token
throughout the offline-world.

Even before the start of Token Sale, BitCoen project managed to attract its
ambassadors, the people, who are ready to broadcast the values of the project.
Alexander Moiseyevich Boroda – the President of the Federation of Jewish
Communities of Russia, the founder of the Jewish Museum and the Center of
Tolerance. Member of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation.
Moti Crystal – the Professor of Skolkovo business school, the founder and the
president of Nest Consulting company. Crystal is a professional negotiator.
From 1994 to 2001 he worked for the Israel Prime Minister and participated
in the settlement of relations with Palestine. Crystal developed a Negosystem
negotiation system model.
The launch of the BitCoen project requires the use of contextual and targeted
advertising.
BitCoen is the first blockchain-project on the market, the advertising of which is
targeted not only to the business community, but also to ordinary users who are
only interested in crypto-economics. Bounty campaign will support the project
in different communities and on different sites (from profile sites for cryptoexchange players to popular video blog channels) Link to Bounty campaign.
Within the framework of marketing activity, training video programs on the
use and possibilities of BitCoen will be implemented, both for individuals and
for businesses. One of the important marketing activities is the appearance of
the BitCoen token on exchanges, which is a separate large-scale channel for
obtaining new token-holders, which in turn will be users of the system, thereby
increasing its overall attractiveness.
Token sale period has active, but advertising potential of low capacity due to
limited time. Listing on the exchange allows you to constantly maintain the
interest of existing users and attract the attention of new users. Thus, even
without using classical advertising tools, a persistent and long-lasting advertising
effect is generated.
