WHITEPAPER

Nebula AI Team
January, 2018
V 2.8

Abstract
The blockchain technology provides a digital trust mechanism for human beings
which enhances the efficiency of exchange of an asset that is of value to someone
including but not limited to votes, IP etc. and reduces costs - the genuinely credible
and efficient Internet of Value is approaching. In recent years, many breakthroughs
have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and AI is now penetrating
every corner of society and will become an essential cornerstone of change in society.
Nebula AI Inc., (Nebula AI) is committed to building a decentralized artificial
intelligence computing blockchain (NBAI) that reduces the energy costs of traditional
Proof of Work by converting GPU mining machines into AI computing services. The
AI transactions recorded on NBAI will be irreversible. The distributed computing
network also ensures high concurrency and low latency computing power. The
conversion of GPU mining machines makes it possible to provide more cost-effective
artificial intelligence services.
Nebula AI will cooperate with large-scale third-party Internet data centers to
provide adequate computing power for AI computing. Nebula AI has established an
artificial intelligence training centre in Canada. System-based quantitative finance,
image identification and other blockchain applications are also in development.
The well-developed NBAI ecosystem integrates the top-level applications such as
DAI App, scientific research and application, university education, and the bottomlevel of NBAI blockchain, Artificial Intelligence Mining Machine and Artificial
Intelligence Data Center. The innovative economic model of the NBAI ecosystem is
the realization of a complete set of value-added economic systems.

Whitepaper is intended as a profit forecast and no statement in the Whitepaper should be
interpreted to mean that the earnings of the Distributor for the current or future years would be as
may be implied in this Whitepaper.
In addition, there are other risks in the process of development, maintenance and operation of
the NBAI ecosystem, many of them which are out of Nebula AI’s control. You acknowledge that
you understand and agree to the assumption of the following risks, including but not limited to the
following:

•

Uncertain laws relating to digital token offerings: The regulatory position of NBAI
tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear and/or unsettled in certain jurisdictions,
and there may be risks that the NBAI token may be considered to be a security, or that it
might be considered to be a security in the future, in these jurisdictions. Nebula AI may
cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or
regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to
obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

viii

•

Security issues: Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to
interfere with the NBAI tokens and/or the Platform in a variety of ways, including, but not
limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil
attacks, guerilla-style attacks, smurf attack and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a
third party or Nebula AI may unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core
infrastructure of the Platform and/or the NBAI tokens, which could negatively affect the
Platform and/or the NBAI tokens.

•

Ethereum-based protocols: As the NBAI token and the Platform are based on
Ethereum-based protocol and architecture, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of
the relevant Ethereum-based protocol or architecture may have a material adverse effect on
the NBAI tokens and/or the Platform. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical
advances (including, but not limited to, the development of quantum computing), could
present unknown risks to the NBAI tokens and/or the Platform by rendering ineffective the
cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum-based protocol.

•

Imperfect information disclosures: The Platform is at the stage of development as of
the date of these Terms and its algorithm, code, consensus mechanism and/or various other
technical specifications and parameters could be updated and changed frequently and
constantly. While the White Paper and other marketing materials (as the case may be)
released relating to the development of the Platform has been prepared with the then up-todate key information of the Platform, it is subject to adjustments and updates from time to
time following the growth and development of the Platform and/or the ecosystem on the
Platform. Due to the decentralized nature of the Platform, Nebula AI may not be able to,
and is not obliged to, update you on all details relating to the development of the Platform
(including, but not limited to, its progress and expected milestones). By purchasing,
holding and using the NBAI tokens, you accept that there may be an insufficiency of the
information disclosed.

ix

•

Early development risks: You understand and accept that the Platform is currently in a
development phase and requires substantial development. Due to unforeseeable material
conceptual, technical and commercial changes before the final release, you understand and
accept the risk that the development of the Platform may not be executed or implemented
as planned, for reasons including but not limited to, the event of a decline in the prices of
any digital asset, virtual currency or NBAI token, unforeseen technical difficulties, and the
shortage of funds for developing Nebula AI’s cryptocurrency project.

•

Illiquidity: There is no prior market for NBAI tokens and the NBAI token sale may not
result in an active or liquid market for NBAI tokens. The NBAI token is intended to be
used solely within the network of the Platform, hence there may be an illiquidity risk with
respect to any NBAI token held.

•

Uninsured losses: The NBAI token is uninsured unless you specifically obtain private
insurance to insure them. In the event of loss or loss of utility value of the NBAI token,
there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by Nebula AI to offer any recourse
to you.

•

Tax treatment: The tax characterization of the NBAI token is uncertain. You must seek
your own tax advice in connection with the purchase, holding and/or usage of the NBAI
tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding, taxes,
income taxes and tax reporting requirements.

•

Competitors: It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize
the same or similar code and protocol underlying the NBAI token and/or the Platform and
attempt to re-create similar facilities. The Platform may be required to compete with these
alternative networks, which could negatively impact the NBAI token and/or the Platform.

x

•

Risks arising from insufficient interest: It is possible that the Platform may not be
used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there may be
limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as
the Platform). Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of
the Platform and therefore the potential utility of the NBAI token.

•

Risks of dissolution: It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but
not limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies,
decrease in the utility of the NBAI token due to negative adoption of the Platform, the
failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the
Platform may no longer be viable to operate and Nebula AI may be dissolved.

•

Risks arising from lack of governance rights: As the NBAI token confers no
governance rights of any kind with respect to the Platform or Nebula AI, all decisions
involving the Platform or Nebula AI will be made by Nebula AI at its sole and absolute
discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the services and/or the
ecosystem on the Platform, to create and sell more NBAI tokens for use in the ecosystem
on the Platform, or to sell or liquidate Nebula AI. These corporate decisions could
adversely affect the Platform and the NBAI token that you hold.

•

Loss of talent: The development of the Platform depends on the continued cooperation of the existing technical team and expert consultants, who may have specialized
knowledge and expertise in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may adversely
affect the Platform or its future development.

•

Risks relating to “forking”: The Platform is based on certain open-source elements
and Nebula AI does not monopolize the development, marketing, operation or otherwise of
the Platform. Any entity may independently develop a patch or upgrade to the Platform and
the acceptance of these patches or upgrades by a sufficient percentage of NBAI token
xi

holders could result in two or more divergent networks. The community on the Platform
may split in support of the divergent networks respectively. The temporary or permanent
existence of forked networks could adversely affect the operation of the Platform and the
NBAI token that you hold.

•

No ownership and control rights: Ownership of the NBAI tokens does not grant you
the right of ownership or right to share in Nebula AI. The NBAI tokens do not give NBAI
token holders the right to participate in the decision making about the direction and
development of the Nebula AI business. However, the opinions of NBAI token holders and
the Platform users are very important to Nebula AI and may be taken into account by
Nebula AI when such decisions are being made.

•

Risk on the number and value of the NBAI tokens: The quantum and value of the
NBAI tokens may be affected by factors, within or outside Nebula AI’s control, including
but not limited to the supply and demand for NBAI tokens in the market. These factors
could adversely affect the quantum and value of the NBAI tokens.

1. Technology and Industry Overview
1.1 The Internet of Value
The traditional Internet is based on historical content (instead of creating new value) and is
known by the industry as the Internet of Information. The blockchain technology, on the other
hand, has evolved the Internet into a network infrastructure for building social trust systems
through the establishment of an efficient and reliable value exchange system, which will enable the
Internet to generate new value and realize the efficient exchange of value, otherwise known by
the industry as the Internet of Value.

1.1.1. B l o c k c h a i n Technology D e v e l o p m e n t
Blockchain technology is a comprehensive technology system based on distributed systems,
computer networks, cryptography, data structures and other research results in various fields. The
technology in blockchain records and maintains data in multiple ways, ensures data transmission
and access security by applying cryptography, and the data is stored in a chain structure and can
only be read or written so as to ensure its consistency, prevents tampering and cannot be denied.
Blockchain technology represented by Bitcoin and Ethereum implements peer-to-peer credit
transactions between distributed nodes by adding technologies such as data encryption, consensus
mechanisms, timestamps, and economic incentives. It has solved the problems of cumbersome and
inefficient transaction cycles, high costs and unsafe data storage, which have become
commonplace in traditional centralized systems, and became the nuclear technology of the modern
digital cryptocurrency system. This technology system enables information consensus, sharing,
and co-responsibility among all participants that can be entirely ported to the underlying
applications of most trust-based business models and organizations.
Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin Design Paper Bitcoins: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic
1 of 54

Cash System in 2008, where he indicated to create a new decentralized electronic payment system,
which “based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact
directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party [12]”. From then on, the
blockchain technology represented by Bitcoin began to be known to the world.
Blockchain technology is typically divided into two generations by industry and academia:
•

Bitcoin — solves the problem of encrypting ledger and decentralized payments.

•

Ethereum — enriches the application value of blockchain technology. The smart
contracts used by Ethereum can use virtual machines and contract programming to
provide new ideas for the development of cryptocurrencies. At the same time, a large
number of DApps and ICO financial innovations came into being, opening up new
territory for financial markets.

As the first application of the blockchain, Bitcoin realized the mode of the decentralized
cryptocurrency ledger system. Bitcoin relies on the completion of computational tasks based on a
particular algorithm and does not depend on any individual or organization, thereby ensuring
consistency with the distributed ledger system. Vitalik Buterin applied the concept of smart
contracts in his design of Ethereum [4], giving us a common framework for blockchain with
Turing completeness.
The application of blockchain technology establishes credible peer-to-peer transmission, which
provides us with a new social trust mechanism, supporting common decision-making whilst
protecting individual rights and interests, and both opening transaction information whilst
protecting node privacy. This mechanism enhances the efficiency of the value exchange and
reduces the cost, laying a new foundation for the development of the digital economy. It marks the
beginning that society evolves from the Internet of Information to building a genuinely credible
and efficient Internet of Value. At the same time, the application of blockchain innovation is
thriving, reflecting the new direction of public service development and industrial innovation
revolution.

1.1.2. DApp and Artificial Intelligence
DApp (Decentralized Application) is a kind of application that runs on the node of the
decentralized P2P network server. It mainly consists of front end presentation layer, background
server and smart contract. With the rapid development of Ethereum, a few millions DApps have
emerged in all walks of life, and the Internet of Value ecosystem is increasingly complete.
In recent years, many breakthroughs have been made in the field of artificial intelligence, and
there is a wave of research on artificial intelligence on a global scale. The research and application of
artificial intelligence have now penetrated every gap in human society, which has also been
integrated with the application of DApps. However, the research on artificial intelligence requires
strong computational power, which has been promoted from the early stage of CPU computation
to GPU computing. The large-scale application deployment has higher requirements on hardware
performance and system concurrent processing.
Nebula AI blockchain, as a new generation of AI blockchain, is dedicated to solving the
computing power needs of human beings in the process of artificial intelligence, expediting the
inter-regional transfer of resources and writing integrated and decentralized AI applications more
conveniently, so as to realize a seamless integration of blockchain micropayments, hyperledger,
decentralized features, and AI applications and achieve the transformation from DApp + AI to
DAI App.
Nebula AI is committed to building a decentralized artificial intelligence computing
blockchain (NBAI) that reduces the energy costs of traditional Proof of Work (PoW) by converting
GPU mining machines into AI computing services. On the Nebula AI blockchain, developers can
design their own DAI Apps based on Nebula AI’s generic programming interface, and gain rewards
as NBAI Tokens by publishing Apps. The AI transactions recorded on NBAI will be irreversible.
The distributed computing network also ensures high concurrency and low latency computing
power. The conversion of GPU mining machines makes it possible to provide more cost-effective
artificial intelligence services. Nebula AI has established an artificial intelligence training centre in
Canada and is dedicated to disseminating the latest applications and knowledge in the AI industry

3 of 54

and delivering talents to society. Also, Nebula AI will cooperate with large-scale third-party
Internet data centres to provide computing power for AI computing. System-based quantitative
finance, image identification and other related blockchain applications are also in development.
The NBAI blockchain will inject fresh blood into the Internet of Value and provide costeffective basic services for global artificial intelligence development.

1.2

Market Prospects
Blockchain technology has achieved global application deployment. All countries are closely

watching the development of the blockchain, and planning the application of the blockchain.
According to market research firm Gartner, the value of blockchain-based businesses will reach
100 billion U.S. dollars by 2020. In addition to the large-scale application of blockchain
technology to the financial sector, blockchain technology will create over one trillion US dollars in
value in the manufacturing and supply chain industries. Klaus Schwab pointed out that the
blockchain is the fourth industrial revolution after mechanization, electrification and digitization.
It is estimated that by 2025, 10% of the global GDP will use blockchain technology for data
storage [17]. Marketsand Markets forecasts that the average annual growth of global blockchain
applications and solution providers to improve business operations will reach its peak between
2016 and 2021 [9]. The market prospects of blockchain technology mainly lies in social public
services and economic models optimization.
At the level of social public service, blockchain technology is penetrating into areas of social
security, intellectual property and public administration, and mainly focuses on four areas: identity
verification, forensic authentication, information sharing, and transparent governance. The British
government released, for the first time, the report Distributed ledger technology: Beyond
Blockchain in 2016, which explores the critical application of distributed ledger in government
affairs [19]. Subsequently, the United States set up a “Congressional Blockchain Caucus” and the
governments of Russia, Singapore, Dubai, Japan and China all accelerated the social application
of blockchain technology [14]. Under the influence of the underlying philosophy of distributed
consensus, transparent open source and social collaboration of blockchain technology, the public
4 of 54

service realizes an overall change from data management process optimization to management
thinking, that helps to increase public participation, reduce social operating costs and improve the
quality and efficiency of social management, which plays an important role in promoting the level
of social management and governance.
At the level of economic optimization, the core philosophy of the blockchain economy lies in the
reconstruction of business logic, creating a new pattern of finance and economy in the future, not
just a technological revolution [6]. As early as 2015, the blockchain has become the highest-paid
sector in U.S. venture capital. The current global blockchain has more than 2,000 projects, and the
global value of cryptocurrency assets amounts to 90 billion US dollars. Blockchain has high
application value regarding finance, shared economy and Internet of Things, which has attracted the
wide layout of business groups such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Nasdaq, Deloitte and Airbnb.
User groups in the fields of blockchain/cryptocurrency assets are also growing rapidly: from 2 million
users worldwide in early 2013 to 20 million users in early 2017 [18]. In the blockchain system,
participants can trade without having to know each other’s basic information so as to achieve
“trustless trust” and change the third-party-based trust model in the traditional mode, and the
economic system can be out of the current system’s constraints or endorsement by third parties,
resulting in the situation whereby two sides realize the delivery of value. An economy based on
blockchain solutions can improve existing business rules, build a new industrial collaboration model
and improve the efficiency of collaborative logistics. Blockchain can provide systematic support for
economic and social transformation and upgrading [16]. The significant advantages are the
optimization of business processes, lower operating costs and synergy, and these advantages have
emerged in all areas of society, including financial services, supply chain management, smart
manufacturing, education and employment.
After 60 years of ups and downs, the artificial intelligence industry is finally recovering with
the rise of machine learning. As it has now formed a new round of development in the world,
countries have sounded the horn to explore the mysteries of human wisdom. The scale of the
global artificial intelligence market reached 168.39 billion US dollars in 2015. In 2016, the
research and development of artificial intelligence in all fields in the world have been
5 of 54

strengthened and emphasized, with the market scale of the industry increasing to more than 190
billion US dollars [11]. According to the market demand, the global market size of artificial
intelligence is expected to reach 270 billion US dollars by 2018.
DApp will form the backbone of the internet of value in the future. Artificial intelligence will
cover all application areas. Blockchain, as the infrastructure of the former two, will undoubtedly
become popular and will inevitably bring significant changes to the traditional Internet, society
and the natural environment.

1.3

Existing Challenges

1. Highly Centralized
Google and Amazon have started to provide cloud services of artificial intelligence computing.
However, as single-commerce companies, they could stop providing the service at any time, given
special circumstances, which are based on their own interests and the pressure of, for instance,
governments and other organizations. For example, Google was banned by the Chinese
government, leaving Chinese users unable to utilize their services.
The blockchain is a new decentralized protocol that securely stores data information through a
distributed ledger (a type of database distributed across multiple addresses, multiple regions, or
multiple participants) [3]. The blockchain is based on the architecture of “decentralization”. The
rights and obligations of any nodes are equal; the data blocks in the system are jointly maintained
by all nodes, and each node shares rights and obligations, is verified by node distribution in the
world, to ensure that the information cannot be forged and tampered with; and technically
guaranteeing the transaction, without the need for a third-party structure to provide a trust
mechanism. Corporations use decentralized distributed ledger technology to process, verify
transactions, or other types of data exchange, and the records are stored in the ledger. Once most
participants agree, each record is given a time stamp and a unique encrypted signature. The
distributed ledger provides verifiable and auditable information history, and all participants can
6 of 54

view suspicious records [10]. This technique guarantees that it is impossible to shut down the
entire network as long as more than one node is in operation. This makes it possible to design a
decentralized AI cloud service which cannot be blocked.

2. Data Privacy Security
Although centralized companies have various security agreements, it is still difficult for
companies to ensure data privacy when faced with internal leaks. Also, when the government
requests for data, the centralized company is limited to geographical restrictions of the host
country, leaving the only option to cooperate with the government and transfer ownership of the
data. As a result, users’ data security cannot be 100% guaranteed.
Based on the cryptography technology, blockchain is a kind of low cost, high security,
customizable and encapsulated decentralized trust solution tool based on encryption technology,
which relies on the encryption algorithm, peer-to-peer transaction and information stored in each
node without trusting a single centre [20]. Each node is involved in maintaining the security and
accuracy of the information by keeping a copy of a complete set of historical databases. The peerto-peer blockchain encryption technology can be used to ensure that only the owner of the private
key can access specific information, while other users cannot decrypt data. This is of great
significance for a variety of high-value training data and models. The advantages of blockchain in
terms of data security are as follows:
•

Use highly redundant databases to ensure the integrity of the information.

•

Verify data using cryptography-related principles to ensure that the data cannot be
tampered with.

•

Use multiple private keys for access control.

3. Maintenance Costs
The maintenance of a centralized computing center will cost heavily on the workforce. Thus,
the use of blockchain micropayments makes it easier to pay for maintenance and allows anyone to
lend their computing power. The shared economy model dramatically reduces maintenance
7 of 54

workforce costs as well as computing costs.

4. Hash Calculation Efficiency
Currently Ethereum, Zcash and other GPU PoW consume a lot of power and hash computing.
The computing power of these GPUs can be used for AI calculations, rather than simply being
used as PoW. A recent study shows that Bitcoin mining has consumed more electricity than the
average annual electricity consumption of 159 countries this year. Such a high level of power
consumption has become an urgent problem to be solved. Digiconomist estimates that Bitcoin
mining consumes about 30.14TWh annually, which is much higher than the average annual
electricity consumption of 25TWh in Ireland [8]. In fact, a recent ING study by ABN AMRO
shows that a Bitcoin transaction consumes enough power for a full week of average American
household use [21]. Digiconomist also found that mining the second most expensive
cryptocurrency, Ethereum, consumes more power than that of most countries [1].
5. Blockchain Application Development Environment
With the rapid growth of various applications (DApps) on the blockchain, a good state of the
ecosystem is at the heart of the user experience. This includes how

users can retrieve their

expected DApps in massive blockchain applications, how to motivate developers to provide more
DApps to users, and how to help developers develop better DApps in a faster manner. Take
Ethereum as an example, there are tens of thousands of DApps based on Ethereum. Imagine if the
scale of DApps in the blockchain world is close to that of the Apple App Store, it would be a
serious problem to discover and find a user’s expected DApps. With the popularity of blockchain
technology, more and more application scenarios of blockchain technology have been discovered.
Blockchain technology scenarios have been gradually expanded from the original cryptocurrency
to more scenarios and user groups. For example, the community represented by Ethereum
introduced the concept of smart contracts in blockchain technology, and Ripple used the
blockchain technology to implement the real-time gross settlement system. With the increasing
diversity of application scenarios, user demands for blockchain is also increasing, and we will
8 of 54

expect to face more challenges.

1.4

Project Objectives
In order to improve the status quo of the current centralized cloud computing ecosystem, we

intend to utilize the decentralization of blockchain technology to rent and distribute the computing
power of artificial intelligence machines globally. Blockchain encryption technology efficiently
avoids the problem of internal leakage and the maintenance of distributed AI calculation units is
handed over to the owners of various AI calculation units, which considerably reduces the
workload of maintenance. We split this overall goal into the following sub-goals:
1. Shared AI Computing Platform
The shared AI computing device platform will address the unbalanced demand between
consumers and suppliers of AI devices. Suppliers of AI computing devices are unable to use 100%
of their computing power, which leads to some computing resources being idle. On the other hand,
a large number of users who require the computing power of AI cannot obtain economical and
efficient AI computing resources. Peer-to-peer payment in blockchain technology, as well as
blockchain ledger technology, enable shared AI computing to be paid and shared in the most
convenient way.
2. AI Physical Computing Units
A large number of GPU computing mining machines can be converted into AI computing
units, from simple hash calculations into more meaningful AI task calculations. Due to the
particularity of AI calculations, it is necessary to pre-install the specified system and regularly
update the client, including the ledger system, in order to play hardware performance better and
share AI computing power.
3. Decentralized AI Applications
Decentralized AI Applications system requires a corresponding interface for DAI App

9 of 54

programmers to invoke conveniently and use the platform’s computing power. It includes the
payment API, computing capacity estimation API and work estimation API, etc., in order to speed
up the development of AI applications.
4. Integrated IPFS Distributed Storage
Decentralized applications require distributed file storage systems to store data. An option is
the IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) storage system to replace the traditional centralized cloud
storage or local file storage, in order to achieve better distributed storage.
IPFS is a protocol and eponymous network designed to create a content-addressable, peer-topeer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system. The nodes in the IPFS
network will form a distributed file system [2]. Most of the future IPFS will use cross-chain
service. Please read the section of Cross-chain Service Usage to learn more about cross-chain
technology.
5. AI Engineer Training Center
Nebula AI will establish a systematic artificial intelligence training center to provide practical
knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence. Engineers gradually create and train artificial
intelligence models in product design through system learning and project operations. We are
dedicated to disseminating the latest applications and knowledge in the AI industry and developing
and delivering outstanding AI talents. Our mission is to fill the talent gap, and to give full play to
the power of artificial intelligence in business.

2. NBAI Ecosystem

Figure 1: NBAI Ecosystem
The NBAI ecosystem consists of two major components, the NBAI foundation and the NBAI
system. The NBAI foundation supports the development, operation, and management of
blockchain development platforms, AI joint labs, and engineer training centers. The NBAI system
integrates the top-level applications such as DAI App, scientific research and application,
university education, and the bottom-level of NBAI blockchain, Artificial Intelligence Mining

11 of 54

Machine and Artificial Intelligence Data Center.

Figure 2: NBAI Economic Model
Figure 2 indicates the economic model of the NBAI ecosystem. Developers provide users with
DAI Apps, users pay for NBAI tokens or use Apps for free based on the rules set by the
developers. Developers submit artificial intelligence tasks to NBAI and pay for NBAI tokens
based on NBAI’s estimated costs. Thereafter, NBAI will open the tasks, and miners are free to
receive and handle the tasks from NBAI. NBAI will obtain the corresponding NBAI token as a
reward after completing the tasks. Clients and miners can trade NBAI tokens through the crosschain token exchange platforms, so as to achieve a complete set of value-added economic systems.

2.1

NBAI
In the NBAI ecosystem, there are many deep training models (such as RNN, CNN and LSTM)

to be trained, which requires large number of GPU computing to complete. In order to solve this
problem, we have to change the manner of mining blockchain. Instead of simply using PoW as the
solution, we intend to issue the NBAI tokens by PoW in early stages of roadmap (until 2018 Q3,
Helix chain) and Proof of Group (PoG) in later stages(2019 Q1 onwards, Orion chain). Existing

12 of 54

miners can perform artificial intelligence algorithms calculation to obtain token rewards. In the
early days, Ethereum protocol(Ethash) will still be used as PoW to ensure the stability of the block
of NBAI blockchain. However, after the release of main-net PoG will be enabled.

2.1.1. Helix (PoW)
At the same time that the White Paper is released, an artificial intelligence public blockchain
loaded with smart contracts will also be released. Therefore, the first phase of the project will be
implemented using an independent ether chain. The independent ether chain has the following
advantages:
• Less Traffic Delay.
• Customized Gas, which can help to motivate miners to get profits through smart
contracts instead of relying on gas profits from smart contracts.
• Customized Difficulty, which can increase the speed of generating the block, as well as
adjust the speed of NBAI token production.
According to varying computing abilities, each artificial intelligence node can obtain the tasks
in the task pool through smart contracts. Then, they calculate the task, and obtain the token
rewards after submitting the results. The hash of a smart contract is recorded in the block to
identify the address of the task. The contract will set out the task address, workload and work
costs.
However, as bitcoin has attracted most of the world’s computing power nowadays, other
blockchain applications using the PoW consensus mechanism have found it hard to obtain enough
hash power to protect their own safety. Mining causes a waste of a lot of resources, which will
inevitably lead to environmental destruction and energy shortage. It is difficult to shorten the
confirmation time of the block, and the cycle of reaching a consensus is longer, which is no longer
suitable for popular business applications. Also, the PoW consensus mechanism has no solution to

13 of 54

the 51% attack yet [7]. Therefore, we intend for the NBAI ecosystem to apply a new set of
consensus mechanisms to address the potential loopholes in PoW and the consensus mechanism
to optimize NBAI.

2.1.2. Orion(POG)
Due to the large training data of artificial intelligence, the time taken to acquire data in the
system becomes very crucial. The characteristic of cloud computing is the closer the distance
between nodes, the lower the cost of communication, and the higher the corresponding
computational efficiency. Based on this feature and the existing issues of the PoW consensus
mechanism, we will use a new consensus mechanism — Proof of Group (PoG). In PoG we will
use consensus systems and NBAI credit mechanisms to ensure efficiency and security. The
definitions are as follows:
1. Work Node and Ledger
A work node is a main artificial intelligence computing task execution node; whose main role
is to perform artificial intelligence computing tasks.
In addition to the normal calculation, the ledger can also be responsible for man- aging other
nodes and performing ledger functions. When an AI task needs to be executed, the ledger is
responsible for allocating subtasks to all work nodes in the area. The task results are then written
into the IPFS. The completed contract will finally be submitted through the Byzantine consensus
to the ledger for verification.
When a new work node joins the system, it will first broadcast the information and search for
nearby nodes.
• If it finds existing nodes within the response time (t), then it chooses to join the network
of designated nodes to become one of the worker.
• If no nodes respond within the response time (t), then it elects itself as a ledger.

14 of 54

2. How to Become a Ledger
Within a network, there are two ways for a work node to become a ledger:
•

After the disappearance of the original ledger in the network, the node with the highest
credit automatically becomes the ledger.

•

Assume that there are n work nodes in the network, denoted as P. The survival time of each
node is denoted as t. If ∃pi, the product of the sum of its response time to all the other
n −1

nodes in the network ∑
! i= 1

T

its survival time is the smallest, then this node becomes the

ledger.

3. Virtual Working Group

Figure 3: Virtual Working Group
Several work nodes will be combined into a working group. The backup factor in a working
group is defined as the number of nodes that can simultaneously process the ledger. Assuming a
total sum of n nodes, the backup factor can be 1 <k <n + 1; when k = n, it will convert into a Helix
system. A backup system is a way of keeping ledger within a group. However, miners may try to
15 of 54

increase the backup factor k artificially in order to obtain the NBAI tokens from mining. For this
reason, the system is mainly based on AI calculations and the mining output should be lower.
4. Communication Among Groups

Figure 4: Communication Among Groups
The working groups composes a ledger network. The network uses the Byzantine consensus
system for joint ledger, which fully guarantees the balance between preventing 51% attacks and
ledger efficiency.
In Nebula AI’s Proof of Group (PoG), each participant is denoted as Pi, needs to know other
people they think are important in the blockchain network, denoted as Pkj. A transaction
settlement, denoted as TS, requires waiting for the vast majority of other people in the group to
agree on any previous trade.
Assume Pi, Pkj ∈ group G, consensus algorithm Consensus(A, B), consensus verify algorithm
Verify(V, NL), then consensus for each node is calculated as

16 of 54

Furthermore, those who are considered important are confirmed only if they are confirmed by
their important participants. Thus, in the working group, the final consensus is calculated as:

Eventually, when there are enough network nodes, the system will accept the transaction, and
this series of hierarchical group consensus will make it impossible for an attacker to have complete
consensus information and thus be unable to attack. The PoG Consensus ensures the completeness
of AI tasks and transactional information.

2.1.3

Task I m p l e m e n t a t i o n

The task pool contains two kinds of tasks:
•

Generating tasks, such as Ethash and protein sequencing.

•

User tasks, where users submit tasks to solve certain problems, and the users will set

the number of NBAI tokens required for tasks. Either task comes with a small smart
contract system for submitting contracts and calculations. Mining will receive NBAI tokens
as rewards for tasks and ledgers at the same time.
A standard training task includes the following:
•

Training data used by tasks, where the dataset can come from the foundation or be

customized.
•

Training script used by tasks, where training methods come from standard RNN,

CNN, LSTM and other customized deep learning methods.
•

NBAI tokens utilized for training tasks, where training tasks will be completed by the
17 of 54

AI mining Machine, and the user must specify the amount of NBAI tokens that will be
utilized. The higher the number of NBAI tokens utilized, the higher the training priority.
The task system is stored on the integrated IPFS, which is stores the arithmetic encryption
algorithm and task code. When the miner receives the computational task, it returns its own
hardware parameters, downloads the computational task unit remotely, and trains the dataset. After
packaging the standard distributed TensorFlow, the appropriate redundancy calculation is added to
ensure the reliability of the calculation results.

2.1.4.

Cross-Chain Service Usage

As a decentralized artificial intelligence system, many components will be decentralized.
However, designing all these components on their own is very inefficient and the system should be
interoperable with other decentralized services and be used cross-chain. There are two types of
cross-chain: Value Cross-Chain and Technology Cross-Chain.
Value cross-chain is a cross-chain transaction regarding decentralized exchanges such as the
exchange in the EtherDelta through smart contracts to obtain the required service tokens. The
token is then used to drive the appropriate services. This technology is simple, yet it has a low
performance. If tokens can be redeemed in advance in the system, latency will be reduced. Under
the current conditions, USDT and Bitcoin will all be typical value cross-chain media.
Examples of technology cross-chain include cross-chain transactions between Bitcoin and
Litecoin, which uses Segwit isolation in order to realize the cross-chain transactions between
different currencies, as well as ongoing zero-knowledge verification transactions between Zcash
and Ethereum. Zero-knowledge proofs make Zcash tokens untraceable by creating private
transactions on the public Zcash blockchain. A bottom chain needs to be designed for cross-chain
transactions. Currently, a large number of ICO projects have attempted cross-chain.
For example, the Polkadot project of Ethcore in the field of cross-chain communications has
been designed with the core philosophy of addressing two main problems of blockchain
18 of 54

technology diffusion and acceptance: immediate scalability and extensibility. The project is
currently based on Ethereum to achieve its interconnection with the private chain, and treat other
public chain network as the upgrade target. After its technology matures, the integration will
dramatically enhance the scope and performance of the project [5].

Figure 5: Cross-Chain Service Usage

2.2. AI Data Center and Mining Machine

2.2.1. AI Data Center
To guarantee adequate AI power supply before large-scale users join, we will cooperate with
large-scale third-party Internet data centers in Quebec. Quebec has a very competitive global
electricity bill, a cold climate, abundant resources and 34 data centers. In addition, the world’s
leading companies, including IBM, Nokia, Amazon and Microsoft have built data centres in
Quebec.

19 of 54

The advantages of choosing Quebec as an artificial intelligence data center are as follows:
•

According to Ontario Hydro and Hydro Québec’s statistics in 2013, Canada has the world’s
lowest electricity rates. Among all provinces in Canada, Quebec has the lowest electricity
rates [15], and more than 90% of the electricity use hydropower energy.
•

Lower Temperature

Quebec has a winter of up to nine months and its average temperature in winter is below
minus 10 degrees Celsius, even below 20 degrees Celsius in summer. Low temperature
optimizes the heat dissipation of the equipment room.
•

Adequate AI Talents Pool

Google, Facebook and Microsoft have set up artificial intelligence centers in Montreal,
20 of 54

which brought together a large number of talents in the field of artificial intelligence. For
example, Yoshua Bengio, professor of computer science and operations research at the
University of Montreal, is the world’s top researcher of artificial intelligence. He is the head
of the Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms and one of the three founders of advanced
machine learning in the field of artificial intelligence. In addition, the Canadian government
also fully supports the research and development of artificial intelligence. The federal
government has given funds of 213 million Canadian Dollars to the University of Montreal,
while the provincial government plans to add 100 million Canadian dollars in the next five
years as investment.
•

University Research

Nebula AI has partnered with McGill University School of Medicine, to collaborate in joint
research and development for the innovative use of artificial intelligence in surgery.

2.2.2.

AI Mining Machine

A 1080Ti graphics card computing power is 7514 GFLOP/s. Using the Caffe framework to
train the GoogLeNet model of 1.3 million image data on the GTX 1080Ti, the computation time of
epoch 30 times is 19 hours and 43 minutes. The calculation time of six cards can be shortened to
3.5 hours.
Any mining machine that supports CUDA operations (mainly Nvidia series graphics cards) can
be installed in the AI mining system. AI mining machines pre-installed common AI algorithms,
such as CNN, RNN, reinforced learning, etc., as well as a large number of other commonly used
libraries, such as TensorFlow, etc. The upgraded client included with the system, can automatically
update the AI pre-installed support library. The first batch of computing miners will be preloaded
with python 3.6 support libraries. The ledger client that supports Ethash is also integrated into
the system.

21 of 54

There are three types of methods to obtain rewards as NBAI tokens that are available on AI
mining machines:
1. Rewards from Ledger.
The Equahash-based algorithm supports NBAI tokens from Ledger. However, the amount of
NBAI tokens obtained here would generally be less than that obtained from AI calculation.
2. Rewards from AI Calculation.
The NBAI tokens obtained from AI Calculation is the most important source of obtaining
NBAI tokens for miners.
3. Rewards from IPFS.
Mining machines can be turned duo-mining mode, support Sia and storj mining. IPFS can
also be used to pay for the data storage in AI calculations.

2.3. DAI App Development

Figure 6: AI DAI App
The Ethereum community calls smart-contract based applications as Decentralised
Applications. The goal of DApp is to create a friendlier interface for the smart contract, and to add

22 of 54

additional features such as IPFS. DApp can run on a centralized server that interacts with Ethereum
nodes. Examples include the famous EtherDelta, Ethercat, etc.
However, the current smart contracts are not enough for decentralised AI applications. The
reasons are as follows:
• Ethereum smart contracts do not come with AI calculations.
EVM is a Turing complete contract virtual machine, but its consensus computing system
can only perform simple tasks, and it is unable to perform complex artificial intelligence
calculations.
• Ethereum mining clients do not support the computational libraries required for AI
calculations.
The operation of artificial intelligence depends largely on the support of various
development kits, and distributed computing is its main task. The supporting libraries
required for the relevant computing tasks can be implemented with separate computing
clients.
However, as a commercial AI application, the blockchain hyperledger and payment function
remains at the core of the system. Due to the scarcity of artificial intelligence computing resources,
shared computing power will become a very useful function. Each user can link to the chain, and
use blockchain to rent or lend computing power to complete the calculation tasks. DAI App users
can also write standard, compliant smart contracts, according to their own needs.

23 of 54

Figure 7: Deep Learning

When training a deep learning model, two major operations are performed: forward
propagation and backward propagation. In forward propagation, the input is passed through the
neural network, and after processing the input, an output is generated. Whereas in backward
propagation, the weights of neural network are updated based on errors in forward propagation.
One of the most critical problems in neural network training is the training speed, especially for
deep learning, which will consume a lot of time. The computationally intensive part of a neural
network consists of multiple matrix algorithms, and the GPU has unique advantages regarding
matrix operations and numerical calculations. In particular, floating point and parallel
computations can outperform the CPU by tens to hundreds of times. While using GPU to train
deep learning models, it is also easier to classify and predict on the cloud, enabling far more data
and throughput with less power consumption and less infrastructure occupation. Therefore, getting
enough computing power through smart contracts for artificial intelligence calculations is an
effective method.
Let’s take a typical style transfer learning model (Gatys et al.) As an example to compare the
time that a GTX 1080 Ti GPU, K80 GPU (AWS P2), i5 7500 CPU, and CPU (AWS P2) use the
TensorFlow framework to calculate.

24 of 54

Figure 8: GPU vs CPU

The GTX 1080 Ti GPU performs nearly 50 times better than the i5 7500 CPU.
Nebula AI provides very elegant, cost-competitive computing power. Nebula AI artificial
intelligence mining machine uses Nvidia 1080 Ti GPU. Let’s take Amazon P2.xlarge (Nvidia Tesla
K80) as an example: In reference to market price in spring 2018, Nvidia 1080 Ti costs 803.85 US
dollars each, other supporting hardware costs 2,000USD, the electricity costs 0.12 US dollars per
hour, and assuming a 1080 Ti has a life span of two years, thus, equipment cost per minute is
(803.85+2000)/ (365 × 24 × 60 × 2) = 0.00267USD, its unit computing cost per hour is 0.00267 ×
60+ 0.12 = 0.28 USD/hour.
The above calculations give Nebula AI remarkable price advantages in comparison with
Amazon. The official test data shows that the Nvidia 1080 Ti’s Tensorflow GPU performance is
four times that of Amazon P2.xlarge instance [13]. According to published report by Amazon web
services [22], the price of P2.xlarge is 0.9 US dollars/hour, this means that even in depreciated
model, the cost/hour comparison between Nebula AI and Amazon is 0.28/0.9 = 31.1%. If we
consider electricity only, the cost difference is estimated to be 13.3%. Other than cost difference,
users who use Amazon or Google cloud platform need to upload their data to those servers for
calculation, in which condition data privacy is not guaranteed, but the decentralized NBAI
ecosystem can solve this problem.

2.4. Higher Education
NBAI provides rich interfaces for scientific research in major universities around the world,
which can significantly improve the work efficiency of researchers, reduce R&D costs, and break
the barriers between high-level programming needs and low-level configurations. The Platform as
a Service (PaaS) provided by the NBAI ecosystem enables university students to focus on research

25 of 54

instead of bottom configuration.

2.5. Nebula AI Foundation
The Nebula AI ecosystem is expected to become a partner community using NBAI
cryptocurrency. The Nebula Foundation aims to be an independent, non-profit, and democratic
governing body for this ecosystem.
A blockchain AI Foundation will be established for the promotion and education of foundational
artificial intelligence and fund venture activities. We encourage the participation of everyone in the
community, and the involvement in R&D interactive activities for DAI Apps to be integrated
onto Nebula AI platform.
Based on the principle of independence, the Foundation’s wallet address will be a secured
multi-signature wallet. Only 3 out of 4 signatures authorize a transaction. Increasing the signature
should be reviewed by the Finance and Management Committee. A large amount of tokens uses
cold storage, while a small amount of tokens use multiple signatures.

2.5.1.

AI Joint Laboratory

Nebula AI Foundation will extend broad cooperation in the field of AI, Blockchain,
Distributed Computing with Universities of Montreal, University of Toronto and McGill
University. Canada is going to create new center of super-artificial intelligence in Toronto,
Waterloo, Montreal, and Edmonton, in order to establish a sound financial, business and human
resources-ecological chain. In 2017, the federal government’s annual budget also indicated that the
government intends to place the development of the artificial intelligence industry as one of the
top priorities at national level.
The research conducted by Professor Yoshua Bengio and his team at the University of Montreal
over the past 10 years has laid the groundwork and places Montreal at the forefront of artificial

26 of 54

intelligence. Bengio also conducts academic research at the Institute of Algorithms (MILA) at the
University of Montreal. MILA is supported by The Institute for Data Valorisation (IVADO).
Nebula AI is actively communicating with MILA to promote collaborative research.
The Surgical Innovation program, Department of Surgery, McGill University School of
Medicine (North America s top medical school) and Nebula AI embarked on a research project
about AI medical imaging supported by Mitacs. The Mitacs Project is a collaborative project
initiated by the Canadian Information Technology and Integrated Systems Mathematics
Organization and has been in operation for more than ten years. Jake Barralet is the leader of the
program.
In February 2018, R & D laboratories are set up in Silicon Valley, and we cooperate extensively
with local universities and the industry on the application of artificial intelligence and the research
on blockchain.

2.5.2.

A I E n g i n e e r Training C e n t e r

Every successful project is inseparable from a large number of engineers. The current market
is in a shortage of AI talents. Nebula AI collaborates with educational institutions such as the local
ECV learning on funding and project platforms. AI scientists at Nebula AI will also serve as
project trainers and recruit a large number of AI intern trainees, continuing to provide high-calibre
talents for the AI industry. On January 27, 2018, the first group of students attended an AI
Engineer training class led by Dr. Tengke Xiong. These students will become a solid R&D team
reserve force for Nebula AI in the future. Blockchain training has also been scheduled in the
program, which will take place in mid-May 2018.

Figure 9: System Logic Diagram
The logical structure of NBAI is mainly composed of industry application requirements,
developers, DAI App, infrastructure and Nebula AI. Nebula AI provides PaaS (Platform as a
Service) and NBAI blockchain. A large number of artificial intelligence development needs in
industries such as finance, healthcare and biology have prompted developers to develop DAI Apps
for different industry applications, and provide solutions by deploying applications. Nebula AI will
provide a wealth of interfaces and applications for developers. The decentralized blockchain
provided by NBAI, in conjunction with the Nebula AI credit mechanism, will address the issue of
P2P trust and big data processing for sensitive data and models.

Nebula AI provides a shared AI cloud computing platform, and PaaS (Platform as a Service)
enables non-IT sector practitioners to achieve rapid development and deployment, and reduce
the dependence on the system environment and computing power.

3.3. API/SDK Support
Some common prepaid, retainage smart contracts can be generated programmatically using the
SDK, and the APIs provide interfaces in a centralized service. The first batch of supported SDKs
uses python as the main programming language, followed by java and .NET. With the support of
the SDK, users can programmatically drive AI calculations more conveniently and become an
interface point with the centralized system.

Data Security Encryption
Data will be saved using homomorphic encryption. The idea of homomorphic encryption

refers to the operation of encrypting several data and then deciphering the result, which is
consistent with the result of performing an operation when these data are not encrypted. The
current homomorphic encryption schemes can be divided into three types: partial homomorphism,
somewhat homomorphism and fully homomorphism. Partial homomorphism can only realize a
certain kind of algebra (or, multiply, add). The somewhat homomorphism can realize a finite
number of additions and multiplications simultaneously. Full homomorphism realizes any number
of additions and multiplications. Homomorphic encryption scheme can only realizes the
encryption function, but can also be used for cipher text data calculation.
Let < G, ∗ > < H, o > be two algebraic systems, f : G −
→ H is a mapping. If ∀a, b ∈ G, f
(a ∗ b) = f (a)of (b), then f is a homomorphic mapping from G to H. Encryption is a mapping from
plaintext to cipher text space. If the crypto map is a homomorphic map, we say that it is a
homomorphic encryption scheme. We give the following definitions:
Let E(K, x) denote the encryption of x using the encryption algorithm E and the encryption key
K. F represents an operation. For E and F, there exists an efficient algorithm G:
E = (K, F (x1, ..., xn)) = G(K, F, (E(x1, ..., xn)))
Then the encryption algorithm E is said to be homomorphic for F.
If the definition of the equation only holds for

Then the encryption scheme is an additive homomorphic encryption scheme.
If the definition of the equation only holds for

31 of 54

(3)

Then the encryption scheme is an multiplication homomorphic encryption scheme.
An encryption scheme is a fully homomorphic encryption scheme if the equality in the
definition holds for F (x1, ..., xn), which contains a mixture of addition and multiplication
operations.
The homomorphic encryption scheme that only holds for one kind of operation is called the
partially homomorphic encryption scheme.
The homomorphic encryption scheme ε of the public key system consists of 3 random
algorithms KeyGenε, Encryptε and Decryptε.
• KeyGenε: Receive the safety factor λ as input, output the private key sk and the public key
pk, pk defines the plaintext space P and ciphertext space X.
• Encryptε: Receive input pk and plaintext π ∈ P , and output cipher text ψ ∈ X, encrypted
with plaintext π with public key pk, denoted as ψ = Encryptε(pk, π).
• Decryptε: Receive the input sk and ψ, output the plaintext π.
The computational complexity of the above three random algorithms is determined by the
polynomial of λ, and the encryption system should satisfy the correctness condition:
⃖ KeyGenε(λ),
if (sk, pk) R

⃖ Encryptε(pk,π), then Decryptε(sk, φ) = π.
and π ∈ P, φ R

In addition, the Evaluateε algorithm is interpreted as: Entering a public key pk, a circuit C from
the circuit set Cε and a set of ciphertext Y =< ψ1, ..., ψt >, output the ciphertext ψ ∈ C. If
ψi = Evaluateε(pk, πi), i = 1, ..., t,
Then:
Evaluateε(pk, Y, C) = Evaluateε(pk, C(π1, ..., πt)

(4)

Once the algorithm is preserved, the data structure is preserved. Therefore, in the process of machine
learning, we only need the data structure, we can decrypt the encrypted information and machine learning.

4.2

Distributed System Optimization
Data transmission can be sped up by the equal segmentation of big data processing. The

worker node on NBAI receives the task for concurrent processing, after which each node returns
the result to the selected aggregation node for the task’s consolidation, and finally returns the task
owner. In these transmissions and processing, we optimize NBAI by node election, data access,
load balancing, network security and the research of redundancy mechanisms.
When NBAI receives AI tasks with large datasets from developers, single miners cannot
handle the tasks on their own. We will need to split the tasks and deliver them to multiple miners
for calculation, and eventually return the aggregated task results to the developer. This series of
operations needs to rely on a complete and optimized distributed system. NBAI will also be
optimized to meet the performance demands of high throughput, low latency and high
concurrency.
Although the traditional distributed system structure has only three layers, according to
business demands, it will often be designed to more levels. A multi-tier structure often has a wide
range of proxy processing and routing. Most of these proxy processes are connected via TCP to
both ends. However, in order to avoid the high failure rate and high maintenance cost of TCP,
NBAI will apply message queuing mechanisms to realize inter-process communications.
NBAI uses NoSQL to provide a solution to the distribution of data storage tiers, In addition to
the advantages of high-volume and high-speed access, NoSQL can only retrieve and write using an
index. This constraint brings the advantages of distributed implementation, the system can press
this main index to define the data stored in the process. Such a big data-level task, can be safely
sent to different nodes.

33 of 54

Figure 12: Future/Promise Model

Because distributed systems involve a great deal of network communications and the system
relies on asynchronous, non-blocking programming models, developers generate a large number
of callback functions in the programming of distributed systems. Task instructions will be
distributed to multiple processes, and completed through a combination of network
communications. However, this asynchronous programming model callback is very detrimental to
code maintenance. In order to solve this problem, NBAI uses the Future/Promise model to
optimize the callback function.

5. NBAI Token
5.1 Token Plan
5.1.1

Use Value of Tokens

The NBAI token is used to purchase computing power. When the training data is relatively
small, the number of tokens consumed is less, and when the training data is large, the token
consumed increases accordingly. The number of NBAI tokens used depends on the training
costs(time and computing power consumed for specific task) and the value of the current token .
The current value of token is the hash power of each 1080Ti graphics card within one minute, that
is, 7514 GFLOP/s × 60.

5.1.2

Token a p p l i c a t i o n

Tokens will be used in the following three cases:
• Developers Test
34 of 54

Developers in the test will utilize some tokens for model training. Depending on how many
tokens are utilized, the training time required to train the model will be reduced by 50% to
90%.
• Use of DAI APPs
DAI APPs may be set as paid apps by developers; users must utilize the NBAI tokens in
exchange for these AI services, such as the trend prediction of cryptocurrencies app in this
White Paper.
• Purchase of DAI training services
When users utilize training services to obtain finer models, they are required to pay for
retraining the models.

5.1.3

User scenarios

1. Quantitative Trading
Quantitative trading has been using computers for assistance from many years ago. Analysts
use a variety of quantitative models to design metrics and observe data distribution, using the
computer as an operator. Until the rise of machine learning in recent years, the data can be rapidly
and quantitatively analyzed, fitted, and predicted, so that analysts can predict the market trend of
future financial products more accurately. However, the calculations of these models still require a
lot of artificial intelligence computing power. With the traditional approach, each trading section
needs to set up a data center on its own. However, sharing computing power can eliminate the need
for expensive maintenance, and allow financial trading firms to focus more on predicting itself.
2. AI Learners Program
Colleges and universities have increasingly set up artificial intelligence courses, which will
become more popular in the next few years. Students usually choose small tasks to run on their
computers, and run time-consuming tasks in the school computer labs. However, these fragmented
tasks can be solved with blockchain computing cloud. Low-cost AI computing services are ideal
for students to complete a variety of computing tasks, and to quickly modify their models.
35 of 54

3. Biomedical Artificial Intelligence

Figure 13: AI for Cancer Research
Early detection of tumours is of great significance. However, because of the small area of early
cancer lesions, the traditional method is difficult to judge whether the tumour is benign or
malignant, which makes it difficult for clinical diagnosis. Doctors often need to conduct tests
using the biopsy method, which not only increases the medical cost but also brings patients great
pain. The application of artificial intelligence in medical image recognition and multidisciplinary
collaborative diagnosis can effectively overcome this difficult point, enhance the ability of doctors
to diagnose, help to make quick decisions and promote the transformation of medical services to
one of individualization and precision.

5.2 DAI App Developer profit model
1. DAI App Task Types
• Class I — Require training model.
App users have to utilize tokens to drive calculations that consume a lot of resources. The
training time may take hours or even hundreds of hours.
• Class II — No need to train models or use existing models.
36 of 54

The Apps do not need to consume computing power, users only need to pay a certain NBAI
tokens for smart contract costs. It is also possible to invoke the computing results of Class I
DAI Apps to generate the application. This type of DAI Apps is less expensive.
2. Task Calculation
A standard computing contract contains the following basic elements:
• AI task data address
• AI task program script
• AI task execution result output address
• The number of NBAI tokens required for AI task
3. Task Release
When the task is posted on the chain, all AI miners can accept tasks from the system. The task
is identified as “in progress” when it is executed by the mining machine. The user can set several
different levels of redundancy calculations to ensure a more accurate result. Nounce can be set to
different levels such as 1, 2, 3 to correspond to different redundancy calculations. Larger numbers
mean more calculations are needed to ensure the accuracy of the results. The corresponding cost
will be higher.
4. Cost Calculation
AI calculation is generally divided into the training phase and the using phase. The
training phase will consume a lot of training resources, a n d most of the computational power
will be used here. In the using phase, due to the end of the training, less power will be
consumed. At the start of the task, the smart contracts will pre-charge a portion of the NBAI
tokens as pre-payment and, at the end of the calculation, will re-calculate the total NBAI
tokens utilized and require the customer to pay the balance of NBAI tokens to obtain the data.
The users need a certain amount of NBAI tokens to start booking service, multi-signature
automatic contracts will lock the NBAI tokens to ensure the transaction being operated
37 of 54

normally.
5. Task Execution
The mining machine clients read the task plans from the chain and parse them into executable
AI code. Artificial intelligence and training data can be stored in external links when tasks start
being executed. The code will be executed in the following steps:
• Parse the encryption task.
• Download data remotely.
• Set the task to execute state.
• Write the progress and result of the operation.
• Mining machine binds address for rewards.
6. Calculation Ends
DApp users download the results of the implementation, which can be used directly for the
web demo or offline use. Execution results can be obtained by API method, and be used after
decrypting.

5.3. NBAI AI Application Case
Hedge funds, banks and large international companies like Goldman Sachs are benefiting from
smart-technology-based foreign exchange and stock trading. These companies predict the shortterm and long-term effects of various financial markets through “deep learning” —
mathematically-based predictive and probabilistic models which evolve continuously.
Cryptocurrency players such as Pantera Capital, and financial institutions including Santander and
Citibank, are also looking at making money from cryptocurrencies. Designing an artificial
intelligence model requires a large amount of computing power. Each user must compute the
model each time when the parameters are adjusted. At this point, getting enough computing power
through smart contracts for artificial intelligence computing is an effective method. The standard

system goes through the following steps:

8. ICO Plan
The initial release is 6.7 NBAI billion tokens. Each year, it is intended for a certain amount of
tokens to be produced, with the amount decreasing in six years from 2% to 0.2% of the total initial
number of NBAI tokens released(6.7 billions). Tokens are consumed when users use customized
predictive features of artificial intelligence, and the amount of tokens consumed depends on the
amount of computation. The demand of tokens will increase along with the increasing complexity
40 of 54

or better performance for AI tasks, in which condition higher computation power will be
consumed.
Miners obtain tokens through mining, and AI mining machines are the main sources of mining
returns. Any application based on the NBAI’s blockchain (such as quantitative trading, Biomedical
AI) can only be paid by NBAI tokens.
Tokens are ERC 20 tokens, and will be replaced by Nebula AI main chain tokens in the ratio of
1:1 in the future.

10. Conclusion
As the world’s first AI blockchain system, Nebula AI is dedicated to driving the advancement
of artificial intelligence technologies, building a credible trust-based blockchain, creating social
value and serving all of humanity. NBAI builds the next generation of AI blockchain infrastructure
platform that enables developers in many industries to truly develop, compute and deploy artificial
intelligence with high efficiency, low cost, safely and reliably, without worrying about the
underlying development, system configuration and environment setup.
NBAI can be considered as a consensus system for decentralized data. As the value carrier,
NBAI tokens realize the value flow of artificial intelligence in the NBAI ecosystem. Whilst the
traditional Internet connection can solve the problem of data communication, NBAI further
solves the problem of data consensus on the basis of traditional Internet. Compared to a large,
centralized platform, NBAI can avoid data being stored or stolen by service providers and realize
the public processing tasks while ensuring data privacy.
The rapid development of blockchain technology has made it possible to realize the digital
credit society. NBAI will inject more fresh and vibrant blood into the development of global
blockchain technology and look forward to pushing artificial intelligence, an important area where
society can change, to new heights.
