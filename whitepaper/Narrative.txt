INTRODUCTION
It’s time for content creators to get rewarded for their hard work. Narrative is a
self-sustaining content ecosystem where members are in charge, users get paid,
and the world’s best content, on every subject imaginable, is easy to find.
Narrative is a Content Economy,
generating rewards for content
creators, moderators, and others who
positively contribute to the quality of
content on the network.
Narrative is autonomous, transparent,
and completely user-centric.
Reputation scores and content ratings
ensure that “bad eggs” have minimal
impact and that quality users and
content rise to the top (and are
rewarded the most).
The economic motive for Narrative
is to reward all users who add value
to the network.
Narrative is the world’s public journal.
There are three types of content
channels on Narrative: Personal
Journals, Niches (subject-based
collections), and Brands.
Users can follow specific Narrative
channels and view a stream of all
content they track. All content is
public, curated and managed by
elected moderators.

Best of all, 85% of all revenues
generated by the network flow
directly to the active participants (e.g.,
content creators, active participants,
moderators, and other positive
influencers).
The Narrative organization
(“Organization”) manages the
software development, technical
infrastructure and product marketing,
but has no role in moderating users or
content.
All revenue for the network is logged
and managed using blockchain
technology to ensure immutability
and transparency, but the network
itself may include off-chain functions
to ensure outstanding performance
and powerful search capabilities.
Narrative makes visible all actions by
moderators and leaders, so that the
community as a whole can ensure it is
properly represented.
It’s great content, by the people, for
the people.
!4

E·CON·O·MY
/ƏˈKÄNƏMĒ/
“An entire network of producers, distributors, and consumers of goods and
services in a local, regional, or national community.”1

As the first true Content Economy,
Narrative disrupts the traditional
business model for social media
networks.
For current social networks, there is
no economy; there is only
subjugation. The producers and
consumers of content on traditional
social networks do all of the work and
realize none of the income. The
economic motive for the corporation
running the network is to increase
profits through the sale of advertising.
Users have no control over whether
their personal data is shared with third
parties, no input on editorial
decisions, and their content can be
censored at any time for any reason
by a monolithic corporation that calls
all of the shots. They have no seat at
the table, and in fact their sole role is
to keep generating content so the
corporation can sell more ads.

With Narrative, however, the
participants in the network engage
symbiotically toward the common
goal of creating and maintaining a
reputable environment. Narrators are
essentially owners in the system,
because everyone has an equal
chance at prospering, based on the
quality of their own actions in the
network.
The value of the Narrative Network is
represented by the NRVE token, a
cryptocurrency that is used to pay for
items of value (channels, advertising,
etc.) and reward the users who
positively contribute to the network
(content creation, commenting, votes,
and more).
Revenue sources for the Network will
include:
• Niche and Brand Channel
Ownership Fees
• Advertising
• Issuance of NRVE Tokens
!5

Revenue collected by the Network is
held and disbursed in the following
manner:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Content Creators: 60%
Narrative Organization: 15%
Niche Owners: 10%
Activity Rewards: 8%
Niche Moderators: 6%
Tribunal: 1%

Let’s review the different types of
users/areas in the system, so that it is
easier to understand the payout
structure above.

Narrator

Any registered user of the network.
All users have their own (free) journal
that they can post to anytime.

Content Creator

A Narrator who posts content on the
network.

The Narrative Organization

The organization that manages the
network software, infrastructure and
marketing.

Tribunal

The Tribunal is like the “Supreme
Court” of Narrative. Tribunal
members are elected by the
community, have steep qualification

requirements, and serve time-limited
terms. The role of the Tribunal is to
be the final arbiter of disputes, and
the Tribunal has powers for taking
action when necessary.

Niche

A Niche is a subject-oriented channel
that any Narrator can post to. Niches
are created by Narrators, but each
must be unique and must be
approved by a vote of all Narrators
who are “Rep Pos” (have a positive
reputation). Every authorized niche
must have one owner and one or
more moderators. These owners and
moderators earn Network Rewards,
based on the overall popularity of
each Niche.

Brands

Brands can set up Brand channels in
Narrative, but Brand owners and
moderators do not participate in
Network Rewards.

Activity Rewards

Narrators earn activity points for
various activities, including
commenting, voting for nominated
Niches, voting in Tribunal elections,
up-voting/down-voting content, etc.
Users who have earned activity points
during a payout period are eligible for
Activity Rewards. Note that users may
!6

receive negative activity points, as
well, for behavior that is harmful to
the network.

Sale until the network is launched.
This will give them more insight into
the development progress before
launch.

Founders

Any person that contributes 60 NEO
or more in the Narrative Token Sale
will be classified as a “Founder” when
they register on the network using the
same email account they used for the
Token Sale. Founders will receive the
following special rewards:
Niche Ownership Advantage: when
we launch our early alpha, codenamed Chaucer, in March 2018, only
Founders will be allowed to reserve/
purchase new niches for the first two
weeks. This gives them a huge
competitive advantage in reserving
the most popular subject areas.
Activity Points Bonus: for each reward
period, Founders will receive a 10%
bonus for the number of Activity
Points they accumulate. Thus, if the
Founder generated 100 activity
points, we would add 10 bonus points
to his total. This will occur for the life
of the Founder’s account.
Exclusive Access: Founders will be
granted exclusive access to the
Narrative team via a dedicated Slack
channel from the end of the Token
!7

CENTRAL TENETS OF NARRATIVE
AUTONOMY
The community of users on the
network create their own Niche
channels, create the content, elect
their own leaders and moderators,
and even approve the ads that
appear. The Narrative organization
manages development of the
software and pays for the
infrastructure to keep things humming
along, but has no involvement in
managing the content posted to the
network.
TRANSPARENCY
To have true autonomy, the entire
system has to be as transparent as
possible. With Narrative, every
action taken by a moderator (or any
user with any authority) is displayed
for all to see. Every
revenue-related transaction is
cataloged in an immutable
blockchain. Anything of value or
impact is visible for all to see.

OWNERSHIP
All users truly own their content and
profile data in Narrative. They can
export their data anytime. Ownership
is also reflected in the role all users
have in governing the network as a
whole.
ECONOMIC BENEFIT
Users should be rewarded for
behavior that benefits the network.
Similarly, User Reputation should be
an important factor in determining the
impact of a user’s actions. 85% of all
revenue generated by the network
should be directed to its active users.
NO CRYPTO BARRIERS
Cryptocurrency is not highly adopted
yet. Thus, the network cannot thrive
and compete with other networks if it
requires its users to use
cryptocurrency. Thus, advertisers will
have the option to pay with fiat
currency and network rewards can
also be received in fiat currency
(through a crypto/fiat conversion
process).

!8

CONTENT IN NARRATIVE
Narrative is designed to be the
world’s journal- a place for individuals,
groups, and businesses to tell their
stories and post their thoughts. A
Narrative post might be a single
photo, a collection of photos, text
only, or a mixture of text and photos.
The idea is that users can use their
own Journals for personal
perspectives, and/or use Niches to
post about specific subjects. Brand
spaces give organizations a way to
have more controlled areas where
authorship is limited to authorized
users only.
Niches work similarly to tags during
the content creation process. The
author can associate his/her content
with up to three niches. Acceptance
into a niche is subject to approval by
niche moderators. The content
creator may also suggest new niches,

which would be subject to community
approval.
In general, we envision Narrative
being a home for long-form content,
but obviously Narrators will determine
how to best utilize it.
Narrators can follow Niches of
interest, other Narrator’s Journals, and
Brands. And they can view content via
an aggregated stream of everything
they follow or of course directly via
the channel’s stream.
The Reputation and Rating systems
are used by Narrative to automatically
bury low-rated content and feature
highly rated content, though
Narrators can customize their settings
to disable or minimize these
automations, if desired.

!9

PERSONAL JOURNALS
Every registered member in Narrative has a Personal Journal. This is their own
personal Narrative, and the only content on a Personal Journal is the content by
that journal owner. All journal content is always public and any registered
member may comment.
Personal Journals cannot have moderators. Personal Journals may be
suspended by the Tribunal for any reason. (And note that users may report
Personal Journal content to the Tribunal.)

NICHES
One of the three types of content
channels, a Niche is a subject area
into which any Narrator may publish
content. All Niches should be unique.
You should not find one Niche called
“New England Patriots” and another
called “NE Patriots”. The goal is to
create unified content streams around
singular subjects. This helps create
more focused content and allows
Narrators to subscribe knowing that
they are following all content on a
given subject.
That said, subjects may be quite
broad or very narrow. For instance, an
“NFL” niche is much broader than the
“New England Patriots”, but they
could coexist, since they are not
identical.

Each Niche that is created should
have value. And for that reason, the
creation of new Niches goes through
an approval process.
1. A Narrator suggests/nominates a
new Niche.
2. Narrators vote during a 48-hour
period. The Reputation of each
Narrator influences the impact of
each vote. The higher the Rep,
the more impactful the vote.
3. Once the voting period is
complete, if the Niche receives a
vote score greater than 50% it
becomes an authorized channel.

!10

Because Niches are essentially
communal posting areas, it is critical
that each one has an “owner” to act
as the overall manager, as well as
moderators for managing the content
in the Niche. Niche owners are
responsible for nominating
moderators in their channels, but Rep
Pos Narrators actually elect each
moderator that is nominated.
There is only one owner per Niche.
When a channel becomes authorized,
it is then open for any Rep Pos
Narrator to request to be the Niche
owner. Bids are accepted for a 48hour period for any new channel.
Reputation will influence a user’s
ability to bid and/or limit the number
of bids the user may place for a niche.
In addition, there will be a limit on the
number of niches any one member
may own.
Both Owners and Moderators of a
Niche are compensated for their
efforts by participating in Network
Rewards, based on the overall
popularity of their channel, compared
to others. This incentivizes Owners to
promote their channels and appoint
excellent Moderators. In fact, Owners

who do not have any Moderators for
their Niches do not qualify for
Network Rewards.
It is important to avoid duplicate
niches in Narrative. For that reason,
any Narrator may report that a
particular Niche is redundant. Such
reports will be reviewed by the
Tribunal. If more than 50% of Tribunal
members agree that is redundant, it
will be merged with the primary Niche
and all content from the channel will
be merged into the primary Niche.
Refunds are not given to owners of
redundant Niches. The user who
reports the redundant niche is
awarded Activity Points, once it is
determined to be redundant.
Owners must pay an annual fee to
purchase the Niche. If they fail to
renew the fee, the Niche is re-listed
for a new Owner. Annual fees are
paid in NRVE tokens (though a fiat
purchase option is available).
Because some Niches may prove to
be quite popular, we expect to see a
land grab of Niche ownership.
Maintaining ownership of Niches may
prove quite profitable over time.

!11

BRANDS
Narrative will support Brand channels.
These are intended for organizations
that wish to publish content on
Narrative but need to control who can
post the content on its channel. They
are also ideal for publishers. Brand
Owners appoint their own
Moderators, but, unlike Niches, their
Moderator choices do not have to be
approved by the vote of the
community. Brand channels also have
the option to exclude network ads (for
a fee).
Brands pay a premium ownership fee
for the special privileges they receive.
In addition, Brand Owners and
Moderators do not participate in
Network Rewards.
As with Niches, each new Brand
channel must be approved by the
community via a vote available for any
Rep Pos Narrator. This allows the
community to ensure that each
channel on the site reflects their
overall values. In addition, a Brand
can lose its rights to function by
Narrator petition to the Tribunal.
Brands have some other unique
qualities:

1. Moderator Payments
Unlike with Niches, Brand Moderators
do not qualify for Network Rewards.
The reason they do not is because the
brand has tighter control over the
selection of Moderators (there is no
community vote). Many brands will
want strict control over the
moderators they employ, so this
makes sense.
However, Narrative still provides a
mechanism for Brands to optionally
pay their Moderators. With the
Moderator Compensation feature, a
Brand can set a specific recurring
payment rate per moderator. These
payments can be in NRVE tokens, or
can be a fixed dollar amount that is
auto-converted to NRVE by the
system at the time of payment.
When enabled, the Brand will be able
to deposit fiat currency or NRVE
tokens that the system will draw upon
to auto- pay each moderator every
pay period. If depositing in fiat
currency, a 15% conversion fee is
applied, in order to encourage the
!12

Brand to deposit NRVE tokens
directly instead (as well as to account
for the exchange rate risk and
processing costs).
On pay day, if the Brand has
insufficient funds to cover the
moderator payments, the Brand will
be given 24 hours to deposit a
sufficient amount. After 24 hours, if
still short on funds, the Brand site will
be suspended (and will not be
reinstated until the balance is paid in
full).
2. Content Creator Reward
Overrides
Some Brands may wish to require that
the Brand Owner share in the Content
Reward for all content published in
the site.
For instance, imagine a use case
where a publication wishes to use
Narrative as a platform. The
publication Owner could require that
all of its published content is split
50/50 with the authors.
Another example: a company that is
already paying the salary for its
content authors may wish to have all
Content Creator revenue flow directly
to the Brand Owner.

With the optional Content Creator
Reward Override, the Brand Owner
can designate exactly how content
created in the Brand Site is credited in
terms of Content Creator rewards, by
setting a percentage allocation for the
Owner and a percentage for the
Creator.
3. Editors
Brands offer a unique role- Editors.
Editors are similar to moderators, but
their role is to serve as reviewers of
new content. The use of Editors is
optional; when enabled, the site can
set rules about how editors interact
with new content. For instance, a rule
could be set to force all content to be
reviewed by an Editor prior to
publication, or even to have two
different editors review content
before publication. Editors also may
edit the author’s content, as well as
set Child Rating, and set publication
date/time.
Brand Owners do not receive any
Network Rewards for their role;
however, just as with Moderator
Payments described above, Brand
Owners may designate specific
payments to Editors, as well, if
desired, on a recurring basis.

!13

TRANSPARENCY
One of the hallmarks of Narrative is
transparency. Because it is an
autonomous, user-run community, it is
important that as much information as
possible is available to all users,
including:

automatically hidden from users
under age 18 (and for users not
signed in). Moderators can modify
the status anytime, as well. Note
that there is an overall age limit of
13 for registering on Narrative.

• Actions Performed by
Moderators: users must be able to
see every action a moderator takes
so that performance can be
monitored and moderators are
accountable for their actions.
Narrators can evict problematic
Moderators by popular vote.

• Revenue: on every user profile,
Narrative will display the revenue
earned by that user currently and all
time (with graphs). In addition, each
content item will display how much
it has earned the creator. Network
rewards each month will also be
summarized (revenue per source
and how distributed). The platform
will also display how much
advertisers pay for each ad
(historical log). Fiat conversation
fees collected by the Organization
will also be made available for
anyone to see.

• Approval of New Niches: new
channels should not be added
without the community of users
reviewing them first. This ensures
that new “subjects” are not
introduced without general consent.
• Approval of Ads: Advertisements
must also be reviewed in advance to
ensure that they meet the standards
the community of users adheres to.
• Child Protection: content creators
can indicate whether the content
they posted is kid-friendly or not.
Content not rated kid-friendly is

• Niche and Brand VIPs: every Niche
and Brand will display its current
owner and all moderators and users
will be able to contact them via
private message. Private messages
will only be supported between
users and owners/moderators,
however. No user-to-user direct
messages will be supported initially.
!14

• Organization Financials: the
audited financials for the
organization will be reported online
every year.

• Tribunal Elections: all Tribunal
elections will be held online and a
list of all current Tribunal members
will also be posted.

!15

GOVERNANCE
While the Organization is responsible for all product development, marketing,
and infrastructure management for the network, it has no role in terms of
content policies or management, user management, or overall governance of
the day-to-day activities inside the network. The Terms of Service will clearly
stipulate this, as well as assert the Network Reward payouts.
Activity within the network is to be governed by the network users themselves.
In fact, the network users can also alter the network payout structure and the
activity point system. In order to ensure the continued operation of the
organization as the provider of the infrastructure. However, the Organization is
guaranteed to always receive at least 15% of all network revenue. The
Organization also controls the fee to charge for fiat conversion, as well as all
channel ownership fee rates.
A community-elected Tribunal is the governing body of the network, and it has
final say on issues within the community. Major policy changes must be
approved by the Tribunal, as well, and are also subject to approval by the
community at large. The Tribunal is compensated via Network Rewards.
The Narrative Committee serves as a bridge between the Organization and the
Network. Representatives from the Organization and the Network will serve on
the committee, which shall meet quarterly to review issues, plan for changes,
and consider amendments to operations. This Committee also has oversight of
Content Taxonomy for the Network. While the Network has no authority over
issues involving software, infrastructure, or marketing, it will have a voice.
Similarly, the Organization has no authority in terms of content or user
management on the Network, but it will have a seat at the table to understand
issues that may require software or infrastructure improvements. This will be a
small group, comprised of at least 4 but no more than 12 people (split evenly
between Network and Organization). The Network will elect its representatives
once per year, but only Tribunal members will qualify. The Committee will be
formed one year after the network officially launches. Until that time, the
Organization will oversee Content Taxonomy management.
!16

NETWORK REWARDS
The lifeblood of the network is the Network Rewards fund. All revenue
generated by the network, including new token generation (after the genesis
token generation event), advertising sales, and channel ownership fees, is always
included in the Network Rewards fund and the fund is distributed on a recurring
basis in the following manner:

!17

The only revenue not included in Network Rewards is Fiat Conversion Fees,
which are always paid 100% to the Organization, which processes all such
transactions. Note that payouts do not include gas fees (fees required to
process each transaction on the blockchain), which may reduce some payouts.
Reward recipients do not have to own any NRVE tokens to qualify for rewards.
Until advertising becomes a vital part of the system, the revenue generated from
minting of new tokens (retained by the network) will be a significant source of
revenue for the network, with the value predicated on the market value of the
tokens.
To better explain how the network will sustain itself via the proposed business
model, the following table provides an example (though none of the specific
dollar amounts should be construed as projections).

!18

Network Reward distributions are made each month (though a more frequent
distribution may be used), based on activity in the previous month. Let’s break
down how things are divvied up:
A. Content Creators
Narrative calculates all content that had activity in the month, with activity being
defined as comments and up or down votes. User reputation impacts each
assessed activity. Each content item is given a score for the month based on the
activity in that month (this is independent of its overall score, which reflects alltime activity).
Once all eligible content has been scored for the month, the content is ranked.
Only the top 90% of all content is eligible for Content Creator rewards. In
addition, content by users with very low Reputation Scores is not eligible. This is
done to prevent users from trying to game the system for recurring payments.
Each content item’s share of the Content Creators rewards is based on this
formula:
( Content Item Score / Aggregated Content Score For Eligible Content ) * Content
Creator Rewards Value

B. Narrative Organization
The organization receives 15% of the Network Rewards Fund value.
C. Niche Owners
The share paid to each Niche owner is based on the Content Rankings for the
previous month described above for the Content Creators reward. Once the
Content Creators rankings are completed, those content items posted in Niches
are correlated to each Niche. Each Niche is then given an aggregated score
based on the total Content Scores for all associated content items. Each Niche
then receives a pro rata share of the Niche Owners reward, based on this
formula:
( Niche Content Score / Content Score For All Niches ) * Niche Owner Rewards Value

!19

D. Niche Moderators
Payouts to Niche Moderators directly correlate to the payouts to Niche Owners.
Thus, the Niche Content Scores calculated in C above are used to calculate the
Niche Moderator payouts. Thus, this formula is used to calculate the payout for
each Niche Moderator:

( ( Niche Content Score / Content Score For All Niches ) * Niche Moderators Rewards
Value) / Number of Moderators In Niche

E. Activity Rewards Recipients
Anyone who received activity points in the previous month qualifies for Activity
rewards. There are number ways to earn activity points (including comments, up/
down voting, etc.), and each qualifying event has its own point formula.
Note that a bonus is applied to Activity Point totals for the period based on
each user’s month-end Reputation Rank, like so:
Reputation Rank

Bonus

90% and higher

30%

80% - 89%

20%

70%- 79%

10%

For Founders, the Reputation Rank bonus is applied after the Founder bonus
(10%) is applied.
The formula for calculating payout per Activity Points holder is:
(User Activity Point Total For Month / Total Activity Points Issued In Month) * Activity
Rewards Value

G. Tribunal
Tribunals split the Tribunal rewards equally, based on the number of Tribunal
members at the end of the previous month.

!20

REVENUE FLOWS AND THE FIAT
CONVERSION OPTION
Though Narrative uses a cryptocurrency to process all transactions, it is
important that the system is designed so that users do not have to have any
understanding of cryptocurrency, nor require that they set up cryptocurrency
wallets. After all, the process of establishing and maintaining crypto wallets is
fairly complicated currently.
To accomplish this, many payment and payout mechanisms in the system will
support fiat conversion into US Dollars. Note that Niche channel ownership fees
will not have a Fiat Conversion option, however. The Organization will manage
and process all such conversation between the NRVE tokens and fiat currency.
Any time a user pays or withdraws in fiat currency, however, a 15% fiat
conversion fee will be applied. The fiat conversion fees will be retained by the
Organization and are not included in Network Rewards.
To be clear, in all cases, NRVE tokens will be applied. With the fiat option,
entities and users have the option to pay or receive in fiat, but the underlying
transactions are all conducted using NRVE tokens.
For example:
1. Advertisers will be quoted in NRVE, but may alternatively pay in fiat.
2. Narrators who have earned NRVE tokens via Network Rewards may opt for
cashing out in fiat instead.
For revenue paid in fiat, the Organization will purchase NRVE tokens on the
open market using the fiat funds and then place the purchased tokens in the
Network Rewards fund. Similarly, for payouts to Narrators for Network Rewards
balances, the Organization will sell NRVE tokens on the open market and use
the proceeds to pay the Narrators in fiat. Because this process may be timeconsuming, Network Rewards payouts made in fiat also may take up to 15 days
to process.
!21

It’s possible that efficiencies may be developed, as well, for example, to
automatically swap tokens required for an advertisement purchase with tokens
sold for reward payouts, reducing the net market order transactions.
Let’s take a closer look at how revenue flows into and out of the network. In all
cases, tokens are the currency that powers all transactions.
Below, you will find a diagram that details the inflow of revenue. Fiat payments
are always converted to tokens for inclusion in the Reward Fund, which is
comprised only of tokens.

And here is a look at revenue outflows- payments to members who earn
rewards.

!22

!23

STAKING VALUE IN THE NETWORK
Niches and Brands are purchased by an “owner”. Each owner pays an annual
fee (in NRVE tokens) to maintain the Niche or Brand. For Niches, the annual fee
for new Niches will be set at the start of each month based on the following
formula (20% of average ownership payout per niche):
( ( (Previous Month Network Rewards Fund Value * 0.10) / Total Niches) * 12 ) * 0.20

The annual renewal fee for a specific Niche will be calculated using this formula
(20% of previous year’s revenue for channel):
Previous Year Total Ownership Payout In Tokens For That Niche * 0.2

For Niches, initial and renewal fees are subject to a minimum of US$75/year,
however. For Brands, the annual fees will be fixed (price TBD).
Niche ownership fees must be paid using NRVE tokens.
Note that when the network initially supports niches, Founders will be given at
least two-week head start in reserving/purchasing the first set of niches. During
this phase, only Founders will be able to reserve new niches.

!24

USER REPUTATION AND CONTENT
RATINGS
A critical component of a completely
community-run system is User
Reputation and Content Ratings.
Every Narrator has a Reputation Score
and Rank that is based on all of the
actions taken by the user. All content
is rated based on Narrator opinions.
Importantly, Narrator Reputation
always influences Content Ratings.
And how a Narrator’s content is rated
impacts his/her Reputation.
In this manner, Reputation reflects the
actions of a user, as well as how
others perceive the user. Reputation
is also tracked over time, so a
Narrator’s Reputation is graphed and
is easily followed by any user in the
system. An improving Reputation
over time can be rewarded
systematically via Activity Points, for
instance, providing economic
incentives to users who improve their
stand in the overall community.
Importantly Reputation and Content
Ratings also impact Network Rewards.
For instance, every Content Creator is
eligible to receive Network Rewards,
but the user’s Reputation and the
Content Ratings for the content

posted impact the reward payout
(and, in some cases, low ranking/
ratings may preclude the Narrator
from receiving rewards).
Reputation
The Reputation Score is based on a
formula that considers the following
factors, among others:
• Age of Account (how long since
registered)
• Average Content Rating (based on
posts and comments made by
user)
• Correlation between a user’s votes
and overall content scores (as well
as user’s votes and other
outcomes). In other words, do the
user’s votes correlate to general
community voting results.
• Activity Points received in the past
month (and recent months) (more
is better)
Reputation Scores and Rankings are
updated once per day. Rankings are
based on how the user’s score ranks
compared to all other scores, using
the standard competition ranking
!25

method. These rankings are
important in that they are the
multipliers used for most voting
mechanisms in the system.
Content Ratings
Every piece of content has a rating/
score based on the up and down
votes by the audience. Each vote is
weighted based on the Reputation
Score of the voter, as well. Thus, a
user with a higher Reputation Rank
will have more impact on the content
rating than a user with a lower
Reputation Rank.

Ratings system is a primary
component for ensuring community
harmony and rewarding the Narrators
who are the most positive influence.
Machine learning may aid with
assessments over time, but will never
replace ongoing assessments by
Narrators.

Note that a “kid-friendly” flag is
available for each piece of content
and comment. If unchecked, the
content/comment will not be
displayed for users under the age of
18. When a user creates content or
comments, he can determine whether
this is checked or not. Moderators can
also change this setting. (Note the
network will require all users be 13 or
older.)
Content flagged as “not kid-friendly”
will never be displayed to users under
18 years old.
While the formulas used to assess
Reputation and Content Ratings may
change over time, the Reputation and
!26

CONTENT MODERATION
Without oversight, an ecosystem of
content created by a large number of
users may degrade, overrun by
spammers and other ne’er-do-wells.
Narrative supports moderation in two
ways:
1. Automated Rules and Machine
Learning
Numerous automated rules are in
place to reduce the effort required by
the human moderators. Examples:
Niches
a. New content and comments
posted by users who have
registered within the past week is
always moderated (not published
until approved by an elected
moderator), except within the first
month of a niche start date.
b. Content or comments posted by
users with negative Reputation
Scores are always moderated.
c. Content or comments by users
with low Reputation Ranks are
buried.
d. Content or comments posted by
users with extremely low

Reputation Ranks are not
permitted.
Personal Journals
a. Users with low Reputation Scores
are prevented from posting to
their own personal journals.
When scores move above the
minimum threshold, though,
permission is granted.
b. Comments on Personal Journals
are not permitted by users with
negative Reputation Scores.
c. Personal Journals with content
with an average rating that is very
low may have its content buried
and may be subject to review by
The Tribunal (and may receive a
temporary/permanent ban).
Brands
a. Comments on Brand channels are
not permitted by users with
negative Reputation Scores.
b. Brands that consistently post
content by users with low
Reputation Ranks or with Content
Ratings that are low are subject to
review by The Tribunal and may
have their brand channels
revoked.
!27

2. Human Moderation
All Niche and Brand channels have
their own moderators, responsible for
policing and curating the content
within their channels. Each Narrator
also acts as personal moderator for
their own Journal, allowing them to
remove or disable comments.
For Niches, moderators are
nominated by their Owners, but must
be elected by a vote of all followers of
the Niche. The influence of each vote
depends on the Reputation Rank of
the voter. All actions performed by
Moderators are logged and viewable
by all users. If the Niche users are
unhappy with a particular moderator,
they can petition the Owner to
remove the Moderator. (Note:
Owners can also be removed by
petition to The Tribunal.)
For Brands, moderators are selected
by the Owner. There is no community
vote. However, all moderator actions
are also logged and viewable by all
users. Users may petition The
Tribunal to request removal of a Brand
channel.
The Tribunal serve as the top-level
decision-makers to make final

decisions concerning content and
users.
The Moderator Pool
Because moderators are so vital to
the success of the community,
Narrative will also support a
Moderator Pool, where channels can
advertise openings and moderators
can list their availability.
Niche Owners will not qualify for
Network Rewards unless they have
moderators in place, so this area may
be crucial to help channels recruit and
place moderators.
Owners will be able to see the
Reputation Score/Rank for each
potential moderator, as well as any
channels the moderator is or has
moderated. Moderators soliciting for
jobs can indicate whether they prefer
Niche and/or Brand gigs, as well as
subjects of interest.
There is no limit to the number of
channels a user can moderate. We
see the moderation role being a vital
part of the system’s health, and
envision talented, dedicated
moderators taking on multiple
moderator gigs in the content
economy, generating significant
revenue for themselves in the process.
!28

USER MODERATION
The Tribunal will be granted authority to ban/remove any registered member of
the network. Tribunal members will have access to reports that identify
potentially problematic users and may take proactive measures.
A member may be banned from specific channels. For Personal Journals, the
journal owner may ban any other user from participating on his/her site. For
Niches and Brands, moderators may ban users. For Personal Journals, the
ability to ban only conveys if the banner is Reputation Positive. All ban actions
will appear in the Channel Logs (for all channel types), just like any other
moderator actions.
Channel bans may be temporary or permanent. All channel-specific banning will
be listed on the person’s profile (transparent for everyone) and will impact the
user’s reputation score.
If a member feels he has been improperly banned, he may appeal to the banner
and, if not resolved, may appeal to the Tribunal, which has final authority.
If a member is found to be improperly banning people (for instance to harm
their reputation), the Tribunal may take punitive action against the banner.

!29

DECENTRALIZATION
The goal of the project is to be as
decentralized as possible, while still
offering blazingly fast performance,
powerful search capabilities, and
support for user control over content
(including the ability to edit and
delete your own content anytime).
Thus, due to current limitations with
blockchain technology, the initial
implementation will likely begin as a
hybrid application that combines a
centralized content management
system with decentralized blockchain
systems. Over time, though, the goal
is to be as decentralized as possible,
while still offering outstanding
performance.
The system will likely use
decentralized identity management
services for users, as well.

is not achieved initially. It is equally
important, however, that users be
able to edit and delete their content.
Privacy regulations like the GDPR
must be adhered to; members of the
system must have control over their
data. Such regulations in many ways
fly in the face of an immutable ledger,
and must be considered when
considering which elements are
stored in a blockchain.
While NEO will be utilized for the
NRVE cryptocurrency, the system will
likely utilize another blockchain/
distributed ledger system to manage
a broader scope of transactions
(including the recording of fiat
payments). Various systems will be
considered for that, including IOTA,
Hyperledger, and others.

Storing the content in a decentralized
manner is an important goal, even if it

!30

TOKEN SALE
The NRVE token will be the utility currency for the network and the genesis
block of those tokens for the system will be created at the conclusion of a Token
Sale. This will set the initial value of the network and provide the resources to
launch the Organization.
100 million NRVE coins will be minted during the Token Sale and distributed in
the following manner:

!31

Tokens reserved for the Company Reserves will be used for content creator
enticements, marketing, corporate operations, other incentives designed to
increase the branding and influence of the network, and other purposes
required by the Organization.
The Token Sale schedule will be listed on our Token Sale site at http://
tokensale.narrative.network. Up to 50 million tokens will be sold in the
crowdsale.
Whitelist
Users will be required to register to participate in the Token Sale (at any stage).
The registration process will include collection of KYC information, as well as
AML checks to ensure that funds from illegal sources are not used. The
registrants will supply the NEO account to be used for contributions. Those
authorized accounts will serve as a whitelist for the Token Sale. The only
accepted form of payment will be NEO.
New registrations may be capped at times, or permanently, depending on
overall demand. Users from certain countries may also be prevented from
participating; currently, only citizens of China are prohibited, but this list of
countries may change at any time.
Caps and Unsold Tokens
If the Token Sale fails to sell more than 30,000 NEO, the Organization will cancel
the Token Sale and refund all proceeds to users. The hard cap is approximately
166,667 NEO. Unsold tokens will be burned.
Vesting
Tokens granted to the Team will be subject to a 3-year vesting period that
begins only when the network actually launches. Tokens granted to the
Company Reserves will be vested over a 2-year period.

!32

USE OF FUNDS
An early alpha of the platform focusing on niches will be available on the last
day of the Token Sale (March 22, 2018). The money raised from the sale of
tokens will be used to help fund operations of the Organization for the first 3 - 5
years, or until the revenue from the network is able to fully fund operations. As
such, it will be used for human resources, infrastructure costs (legal, licensing,
contractors, office space, data centers, etc.), and marketing.

!33

TOKEN SUPPLY
100 million tokens will be issued as part of the Token Sale, with a maximum of
197.5 million tokens issued lifetime. Once Narrative is released as a service,
new NRVE tokens will be minted (and released directly into the Network
Rewards fund) over a period of 30 years, with a maximum of 5 million issued in
each of the first 10 years and then a decreasing amount for the remainder until
the 197.5 million maximum limit is reached.

!34

LANGUAGE
Narrative will focus on the English language only, initially. However, the plan is to
support unique communities per language. Thus, we anticipate launching
Spanish, French, German, Korean, Japanese, Italian, and other languages on the
platform. Each language will be a separate Narrative site that does not share
members or content with other Narrative sites, but that still use the same NRVE
token system.
In some cases, however, if a language primarily serves one market (like China
and India), we will roll out customized versions of the platform that use their own
cryptographic token. These specialized networks may also utilize a different
network name. Note that some countries, like China, have their own laws
regarding blockchain technology, so taking this approach will allow us to serve
markets that may have unique requirements.
Each language will have its own unique set of channels (niches, brands, etc.),
significantly increasing the overall value of the network through additional
channel ownership fees and advertising.
The relative market sized by country is listed below.

!36

THE TRIBUNAL
The Tribunal is the ultimate governing authority of the network. This elected
group of people can make final decisions regarding content and users. One of
the primary day-to-day tasks of the Tribunal is oversight of the taxonomy of the
network. The Tribunal has final say over whether a particular niche is unique, for
example, and reviews/manages community input about niche appropriateness
and content in general.
The Organization decides the maximum number of Tribunal members, and that
number will scale as the size of the network increases over time.
If less than three Tribunal elected members are active, the Organization will
appoint temporary Tribunal members (from amongst the Narrative community)
until such time as at least three community-elected Tribunal members are in
place.
To become a Tribunal member, a network user can apply for an open position
(via the Tribunal Openings page), but the user must meet the following
requirement at time of election:
• Have a Reputation Rank Greater Than 75%
The term of a Tribunal member is one year. After one year, the position goes up
for re-election. The Tribunal member is free to apply again, but has no
advantage compared to any other qualified users. A Tribunal Member may not
serve more than 10 terms.

!37

THE ORGANIZATION
The Organization manages the
software development, infrastructure,
and marketing for the platform. All
infrastructure costs are borne by the
Organization.
The Organization has no authority to
manage content or users on the
network. Its overall goals for the
network however, are:
1. Provide a frictionless system for
rewarding the contributors to the
network.
2. Provide automated tools to ease
the moderation burden for
moderators.
3. Allow users to manage their
profile and delete their accounts
and content any time.
4. Protect all users’ privacy. Users
must consent to allowing any
profile information from being
shared with any third parties,
including advertisers (and be
rewarded if they do).
5. Provide outstanding software that
works well on all devices.
6. Strive for as much decentralization
as possible, while still providing an
outstanding experience.

All costs in operating the system will
be borne by the Organization, so that
usage is always free for users. Users
should only ever pay “gas” fees (for
blockchain transactions) when they
buy or sell NRVE tokens (perform a
financial transaction).
The Organization will only be
retaining 15% of network revenue*,
but by operating as a lean
organization we are confident the
model will succeed. In addition,
revenue for the Organization will be
substantially supplemented in the
early years by the revenue from the
Token Sale.

* Note that fiat conversion fees will also be
received by the Organization.

!38

ADVERTISING
An advertising system will be added
to Narrative, to be completed within 6
months of the beta launch of the
platform. This system will be an
important cornerstone of the network.
Importantly, advertisers will never
have access to any personally
identifiable information for network
users (unless specifically authorized by
each user) and no data about users
will ever be sold by Narrative.

1. Advertiser chooses one or more
channels/tags/demos to advertise
to. Ads are sold in units of time
(one week, for example, not pay
per click or pay per view). The ad
can be targeted for a time period
in the future, as well. Advertiser
posts ad content when bidding.
Dynamic pricing will be used to
set proper price points per ad,
based on historical traffic data.

Advertisers will bid on ad space for
specific niches/keywords/
demographics. Auctions will be
automated and based on specific
time periods (one week or one
month).

2. When Advertiser submits new ad,
he pays associated fee, but ad is
still subject to approval by the
community at large (over a 48hour period). This ensures that
ads meet the community’s
standards. Users who vote on ads
are rewarded with Activity Points.

Ads based on demographics (user
location, age, gender) will only be
targeted at users that have authorized
sharing their demographic info to
advertisers. Such users will also be
compensated by receiving Activity
Points for each month that they
authorize targeted demographicbased ads.
Here’s how the advertising bidding
process will work:

3. If ad is not approved in public
vote, the advertising fee paid is
refunded to advertiser. If ad is
approved, it is scheduled for
display on schedule supplied by
advertiser.
4. Brands have option to disable ads
(for additional fee).

!39

100% of all advertising revenue will be contributed to the Network Rewards
fund. Advertisers can pay with NRVE tokens or with US Dollars, though a Fiat
Conversion Fee of 15% is added, if paying with fiat currency.

HOW USERS COLLECT NETWORK
REWARDS
Each payout period, Narrative
distributes the payouts for the
Network Rewards and updates each
user’s profile with the amounts to be
credited based on the prior period’s
activity. Users may collect multiple
rewards (based on being Content
Creator, Niche Moderator, Activity
Points, etc.).
Narrators will see the current credit
(as well as total credit available, if
previous credits were not claimed).
The credits must be formally claimed
by the user via their control panel.
The credits will be shown as both
NRVE tokens and US Dollar
equivalent (based on exchange rate at
that time). If the user prefers fiat
payment (US Dollars), payment is
made via a third party (such as PayPal)
and there is a Fiat Conversion Fee.
The Fiat Conversion Option also

requires up to 15 days to process.
There is no handling fee if receiving
NRVE tokens instead and, in that
scenario, the payout is instant via a
standard NEO transaction. The user
simply provides his/her wallet address
and the tokens are transferred to
them. The user can also store wallet
addresses (or PayPal addresses) on
their profile for easy transfer in the
future (and once set up, the user can
have auto-claiming turned on).
Importantly, if user has not claimed
any rewards in over one year, all
tokens will be reclaimed by the
system in this manner: 100% returned
to the Network Rewards fund for
redistribution. Users have no
recourse once tokens are reclaimed;
rewards will not be reissued.
Reminders will be sent to users two
weeks before tokens expire.

!40

TIPS
While the Network Rewards are the primary economic engine of Narrative, the
system also allows users to send each other “tips” using their existing token
balances, for any reason. Common use cases would be to send a tip to a
Content Creator who created great content, or perhaps an Owner tipping a
Moderator for handling a difficult situation.
Basically, any Narrative member can tip any other member, using any portion of
their personal Narrative balance, including balances that they have not yet
claimed. There is no limit to the amount that can be tipped, other than the
available balance on the tipper’s account, but all tips are non refundable.
When received, tips are added to a member’s overall token balance and thus are
eligible for conversion to fiat, as well, if desired.
The tips mechanism may be extended in the future for supporting things like
crowdfunding to encourage someone to create content on a certain subject.

TIMELINE
An early alpha of the platform focused solely on niches, will be available in
March 2018, with the complete network scheduled to launch (as beta) in Q4
2018. We have set the following timeline for the first two years:

!41

MARKET SIZE
The market size for social media is obviously already proven and massive. Per
Statista, the number of people using social media in 2017 is 2.46 billion and that
number is projected to reach 3.02 billion by 2021.

Per Statista, Social media marketing spending is expected to reach nearly $17.5
billion by 2019.

!42

However, we view Narrative as much more than a social media disruptor. We
see it disrupting the publishing industry, especially traditional magazine and
newspaper models, because content creators will have less reliance on
publishers, who reap most of the profits from the content they create. In the
Narrative ecosystem, writers, photographers, and other creatives can publish
their work directly and reap significant rewards without a middleman.

!43

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
The goal of Narrative is to give users
control over their content by not
allowing anyone (not even
moderators) to edit their content in
any way and by allowing users to
remove their content from the
network at any time. That last point
will be an important consideration
when designing the platform,
because a traditional feature of
decentralized applications that use
blockchain is that the content is
immutable (cannot be deleted). Thus,
the platform will need to ensure that
user control (including editing/
deleting) is supported, regardless of
the technology put in place.
Another consideration, especially
since the system is being managed by
the network users, is how to deal with
things like copyright infringement,
illegal activities, and government
take-down notices.
If and when the content is
decentralized, the location of the
content becomes ambiguous.
Furthermore, the Organization will
have no authority over the

management or the content, but it
will have to comply with legal
government take-down notices.
The overall goal of the platform is to
allow the community to determine
what content is appropriate and
displayed through the Reputation and
Content Rating system, as well as via
the Moderators and the elected
Tribunal. But Narrative needs to limit
the legal exposure that those
individuals have, since they are simply
making best efforts to take actions
that reflect the desires of the
community at large.
To what extent can a community of
users, spanning many cultures and
governments, impose its own
publication guidelines (decide what
stays and what goes) without being
superseded by any one government’s
edicts, especially if the content itself is
only controlled by the user that
created it?

!44

These are fairly profound questions that must be accounted for in the Terms of
Service. The Organization will seek to protect the rights of the network users,
but acknowledges that compliance with government directives will be necessary.

MARKET COMPARISON
There is strong evidence that the
model proposed by Narrative will
thrive.
Steemit is a blockchain-powered
social network modeled after Reddit.
It uses complicated cryptocurrency
models (multiple crypto token types)
to reward content creators based on
the number of up-votes received. It
currently has a market valuation of
over $1.4 billion million (as of Jan 26,
2018, per CoinMarketCap.com) and
has seen steady adoption over time,
albeit mainly by users who are familiar
with the cryptocurrency space, due to
its overall design.

moderation, governance, and
transparency; by providing a more
flexible and deeper rewards system;
by supporting powerful search
features; and by developing a more
complete, structured content system.
In addition, Narrative has tangible
revenue sources (advertising, channel
ownership fees, etc.) in its economic
model and does not require crypto in
order to use/benefit from the
network.

Authors on the Steemit network have
realized significant income by posting
quality content.

It’s also being developed by a team
with over 20 years’ experience
building online community platforms.
In fact, the development of the
Narrative platform will be jumpstarted
by licensing core technology from
Social Strata.

Narrative significantly enhances upon
the nascent model developed by
Steemit by incorporating reputation,

TEAM
Narrative was founded by Ted O’Neill, who is also founder and CEO of Social
Strata, Inc. Social Strata’s flagship product is Hoop.la, a SaaS online community
platform, with customers that include Pepsi, Bose, Dun & Bradstreet and
Monster. Hoop.la is a highly scalable platform for user generated content and
much of the technology developed for that platform will be licensed by
Narrative in order to jumpstart development.
A few of the executives from Social Strata will be joining Ted on the Narrative
team, including Brian Lenz, CTO, and Rosemary O’Neill, the marketing officer
for the company. Dr. Michael Farris, will also join the management team.
Michael has extensive technology experience, much of it focusing on community
development and management.
With nearly twenty years of experience developing enterprise-class applications,
all focused on user-generated content management, the Narrative team is
uniquely qualified to deliver on its promises.
Advisors for the project include:
Christopher S. Penn: Vice President of Marketing at SHIFT Communications,
best-selling author, and noted keynote speaker.
Michael B. Moore: former Coca Cola brand manager and current CEO of the
International African American Museum.
Chris Pirilllo: noted content creator (the Locker Gnome) and influencer.
Paul B. Allen: founder of Ancestry.com, keynote speaker, tech entrepreneur.
Sergey Vasin: COO, BlackmoonCrypto.

!47

THE FUTURE
While the initial focus is on blog content, Narrative’s ultimate goal is to be the
Amazon of content, eventually offering support for podcasts, video, and
potentially even original programming/films. The content economy created and
maintained by Narrative can be extended to support brand-controlled
advertising (for organizations with large audiences of their own) and premium
memberships.
The goal is to be the home for content of all types, whether created by
“amateurs” or professionals. The ratings and reputation systems baked into
Narrative only enhance the content marketplace as it extends. The transparency
of the system ensures fairness for all participants.
By focusing on the economic benefit for participants in the network, Narrative is
uniquely positioned to create a true land of opportunity for creators and a fertile
ground of discovery for consumers of content of all types.

!48

SUMMARY
It’s time to disrupt the business models for social media networks and traditional
publishing. Narrative’s content economy will revolutionize social media
networks and content publications. Its mandate is to put users first and to
provide an economic motive for success by compensating members based on
the quality and popularity of their content, and any positive contributions to the
network’s ecosystem as a whole.
With a completely user-run governance system and a transparent approach to
data, Narrative truly gives the power to the people and completely cuts out the
middleman.
Content will live or die based on its popularity and the morals and opinions of
the community at large. There will be no censorship by a monolithic
organization, and the moderation that does occur will be enacted by users
elected by the people.
While Narrative utilizes blockchain and crypto to maintain its value, it is not a
“crypto network”. Any user, no matter their experience or comfort-level with
crypto can use and reap rewards from the network.
Competing with established social networks will not be easy, but with a reward
system that is clear and demonstrated, there will be plenty of incentives for
content creators (and those seeking great content) to find a new home. And
while the powerful, proven technology of the blockchain will power the
transactions, that same technology will not need to be understood for the
average person to use the system.
The Organization will have three purposes- develop the software, provide and
manage the infrastructure, and market the network. While the technology and
business model will be revolutionary, the team recognizes that a major
marketing effort will be required to reach consumers and it is prepared to
execute on that. In addition, the Organization will be actively recruiting leading
content creators to join the network.
!49

The Narrative platform will be developed by one of the most experienced teams
in the online community space, with core technology available from Day One via
a licensing deal with Social Strata, in order to jumpstart software development.
The underlying technology will no doubt change and adapt over the years, but
the central tenets of the system will remain- user autonomy, transparency,
content ownership, and economic rewards, with the fundamental goal of putting
users first in terms of management of the content and reaping the rewards of the
system.

APPENDIX A
TOKEN SALE BACKGROUND
An important early milestone in the
development of Narrative will be the
usage of a Token Sale to help fund
the initial development of the project.
The Token Sale involves selling a
certain percentage of “coins” (aka
tokens) from the minting of the initial
block of cryptocurrency tokens (called
NRVE) for the platform. Those tokens
will function as a utility for the system,
allowing funds in and out of the
system to be tracked in a transparent
manner.
Token Sales are a relatively recent
method of crowdfunding, but one
that has become quite popular within
the blockchain space. The first token
sale may have been by Mastercoin in
2013. So far in 2017, however, over
$1.3 billion has been raised via the
Token Sale process. In fact, in July
alone, Token Sales raised over $300
million, while traditional VS/angel
investments amounted to just over
$200 million2.
Many governments throughout the
world have yet to determine whether
Token Sales should be regulated in
some way. In the U.S., for instance,

the SEC announced in July 2017 that
that it may have authority to apply
federal security laws to Token Sales,
on a case-by-case basis. Because of
the uncertainty about U.S. imposing
regulations in the future, many Token
Sales exclude U.S. citizens from
participating.
Many companies choosing to offer
Token Sales set up their operations in
countries like Switzerland and
Singapore, however Singapore has
recently announced that it to will be
considering some sort of regulation
on Token Sales.
In the U.S., it is important the Token
Sale pass the “Howey Test”, which
determines whether something
should be classified as a security. If
the underlying token of an Token Sale
is considered a security, then
government regulation should be
expected.
Some companies are looking to make
Token Sales more regulation-proof by
limiting investments to accredited
investors only. For instance, Filecoin,
which recently raised over $250
!51

million in its Token Sale, limited its
Token Sale participants to those who
met the requirements for being an
accredited investor3.

Here is a listing of some significant
Token Sales so far in 2017 (as of
August 2017):

APPENDIX C
RISK FACTORS FOR TOKEN SALE
You should carefully consider and evaluate each of the following risk factors and all other information
contained in the Terms of Token Sale Documents (the “Terms”) before deciding to participate in the
Narrative Token Sale (the “NTS”).
To the best of Narrative’s (the “Company”) knowledge and belief, all risk factors which are material to
you in making an informed decision to participate in the NTS have been set out below. If any of the
following considerations, uncertainties or material risks develops into actual events, the business,
financial position and/or results of operations of the Company and the maintenance and level of usage
of the Narrative platform and the NRVE Tokens could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases,
the trading price of NRVE Tokens (in the case where they are listed on a cryptocurrency exchange) could
decline due to any of these considerations, uncertainties or material risks, and you may lose all or part of
your NTS Tokens.
RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN GENERATION EVENT
There is no prior market for NRVE Tokens and the NTS may not result in an active or liquid market for the
NRVE Tokens Prior to the NTS, there has been no public market for the NRVE Tokens. Although the
Company will use reasonable endeavors to seek the approval for availability of the NRVE Tokens for
trading on a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that such approval will be obtained.
Furthermore, even if such approval is granted by a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that
an active or liquid trading market for the NRVE Tokens will develop or if developed, be sustained after
the NRVE Tokens have been made available for trading on such cryptocurrency exchange. There is also
no assurance that the market price of the NRVE Tokens will not decline below the original purchase price
(the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price may not be indicative of the market price of the NRVE Tokens
after they have been made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.
A NRVE Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national or quasi-national
organization, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit. The Company is not responsible for nor
does it pursue the circulation and trading of NRVE Tokens on the market.
Trading of NRVE Tokens will merely depend on the consensus on its value between the relevant market
participants, and no one is obliged to purchase any NRVE Token from any holder of the NRVE Token,
including the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of NRVE Tokens to any
extent at any time.
Furthermore, NRVE Tokens may not be resold to purchasers where the purchase of NRVE Tokens may be
in violation of applicable laws. Accordingly, the Company cannot ensure that there will be any demand
or market for NRVE Tokens, or that the Purchase Price is indicative of the market price of NRVE Tokens
after they have been made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.

!55

Future issuance of the NRVE Tokens could materially and adversely affect the market price of NRVE
Tokens. Any future issuance of the NRVE Tokens would increase the supply of NRVE Tokens in the market
and this may result in a downward price pressure on the NRVE Token. The sale or distribution of a
significant number of NRVE Tokens outside of the NTS (including but not limited to the sales of NRVE
Tokens undertaken after the completion of the initial token sale, issuance of NRVE Tokens to persons
other than purchasers for purposes of community and employee initiatives, affiliate (or bounty) program
development, academic research, education and market expansion and issuance of NRVE Tokens as a
reward to employees and/or users of the Narrative platform), or the mere perception that such further
sales or issuance may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the NRVE Tokens.
Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the NRVE Tokens. Negative publicity
involving the Company, the Narrative platform, the NRVE Tokens or any of the key personnel of the
Company, may materially and adversely affect the market perception or market price of the NRVE
Tokens, whether or not it is justified.
We may not be able to pay any anticipated rewards in the future. There is no assurance that there will be
any transaction volume such that you will receive any rewards anticipated to be distributed to active
users of the Narrative platform. Further, even in the event there is substantial transaction volume and
interactions among the users and the Narrative platform, there is no assurance you personally will
receive any part of the rewards. This is because the ability of the Company to pay any reward to you will
depend on the future results of operations and the future business and financial condition of the
Company and there is no assurance of the future results of operations and the future business and
financial condition of the Company.
There is no assurance of any success of Narrative Platform or any Future Business Line. The value of, and
demand for, the NRVE Tokens hinges heavily on the performance of the Narrative platform. There is no
assurance that the Narrative platform will gain traction after its launch and achieve any commercial
success. Although the Company will perform testing, including QA-testing of the Narrative platform, the
Narrative platform has not been fully developed and finalized and is subject to further changes, updates
and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its
projected appeal to users, possibly due to the failure to meet users’ preconceived expectations based
on the beta version, and hence impact its success. Limited usage of the Narrative platform could impact
the public demand for the NRVE Tokens and correspondingly the trading price of the NRVE Tokens.
The trading price of the NRVE Tokens may fluctuate following the Token Generation Event. The prices of
cryptographic tokens in general tend to be relatively volatile, and can fluctuate significantly over short
periods of time. The demand for, and corresponding the market price of, the NRVE Tokens may fluctuate
significantly and rapidly in response to, among others, the following factors, some of which are beyond
the control of the Company:
(a) new technical innovations;
(b) analysts’ speculations, recommendations, perceptions or estimates of the NRVE Token’s market price
or the Company’s financial and business performance;
(c) changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with businesses similar to that of the
Company that may be listed on the same cryptocurrency exchanges as the NRVE Tokens;

!56

(d) announcements by the Company of significant events, for example partnerships, sponsorships, new
product developments;
(e) fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies on cryptocurrency exchanges;
(f) additions or departures of key personnel of the Company;
(h) success or failure of the Company’s management in implementing business, development and growth
strategies;
(i) changes in conditions affecting the blockchain industry, the general economic conditions or market
sentiments, or other events or factors.
The funds raised in the Token Generation Event are exposed to risks of theft. Further, upon receipt of
the funds, the Company will make every effort to ensure that the funds received will be securely held
through the implementation of security measures. Notwithstanding such security measures, there is no
assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, sophisticated cyberattacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the NTS website, in the smart
contract(s), if used, on which the escrow wallet and the NTS may rely, on NEO or any other blockchain, or
otherwise. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to
exploitation or abuse thereof. In such event, even if the NTS is completed, the Company may not be
able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and may not be able to use such funds for the development
of the Narrative platform and/or for launching the Narrative platform, including but not limited to the
structuring and through developing of the Narrative platform. In such case, the launch of the Narrative
platform might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, distributed NRVE Tokens may hold
little worth or value, and this would impact its trading price.
RISKS RELATING TO NARRATIVE
The Narrative platform is developed, operated and maintained by the Company. Any events or
circumstances which adversely affect Narrative or any of its successor operating entities (collectively
referred to herein as “Narrative”) may have a corresponding adverse effect on the Narrative platform.
Such adverse effects would correspondingly have an impact on the utility, liquidity, and the trading price
of the NRVE Tokens.
Narrative may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effectively manage its operations as its
business develops and evolves, which would have a direct impact on its ability to maintain the Narrative
platform. The social media technology and cryptocurrency industries, and the markets in which Narrative
competes have grown rapidly over the past years and continue to evolve in response to new
technological advances, changing business models and other factors. As a result of this constantly
changing environment, Narrative may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes, and the
sustainability of Narrative will depend on its ability to manage its operations and ensure that it hires
qualified and competent employees, and provides proper training for its personnel. As its business
evolves, Narrative must also expand and adapt its operational infrastructure. Narrative’s business relies
on its software systems, cryptocurrency wallets or other related token storage mechanisms, blockchain
technology and smart contract technology. All of these systems and tools represent complex, costly, and
rapidly changing technical infrastructure. In order to demonstrate continued ability to effectively manage
technical support infrastructure for the Narrative platform, Narrative will need to continue to upgrade
and improve its data systems and other operational systems, procedures and controls.

!57

These upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources, are likely to be complex and
increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties that Narrative does not control. If
Narrative is unable to adapt its systems and organization in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner
to accommodate changing circumstances, its business, financial condition and results of operations may
be adversely affected. If the third parties whom Narrative relies on are subject to a security breach or
otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services Narrative uses, the integrity and availability of its
internal information could be compromised, which may consequently cause the loss of confidential or
proprietary information, and economic loss. The loss of financial, labor or other resources, and any other
adverse effect on Narrative’s business, financial condition and operations, would have a direct adverse
effect on Narrative’s ability to maintain the Narrative platform. Any adverse effects affecting Narrative’s
business or technology are likely to also adversely impact the utility, liquidity, and trading price of the
NRVE Tokens.
Narrative may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in its network or services, hardware or
software defects, security breaches or other causes that could adversely affect Narrative’s infrastructure
network, and/or the Narrative platform. Narrative is not able to anticipate when there would be
occurrences of hacks, cyber- attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in
the Narrative platform, in the smart contracts, if used, or on NEO or any other blockchain technology.
Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or
abuse thereof. Narrative may not be able to detect such hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed denials of
service errors vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner, and may not have sufficient resources to
efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession.
Narrative’s network or services, which would include the Narrative platform, could be disrupted by
numerous events, including natural disasters, equipment breakdown, network connectivity downtime,
power losses, or even intentional disruptions of its services, such as disruptions caused by software
viruses or attacks by unauthorized users, some of which are beyond Narrative’s control. Although
Narrative has taken steps against malicious attacks on its platform or its infrastructure, which are critical
for the maintenance of the Narrative platform, there can be no assurance that cyber-attacks, such as
distributed denials of service, will not be attempted in the future, that Company’s enhanced security
measures will be effective. Narrative may be prone to attacks on its infrastructure intended to steal
information about its technology, financial data or user information or take other actions that would be
damaging to the Company and/or holders of the NRVE Tokens. Any significant breach of the Company’s
security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability, stability and security of
the Narrative platform may adversely affect the utility, liquidity and/or trading price of the NRVE Tokens.
The Company is dependent in part on the location and data center facilities of third parties. Narrative
current infrastructure network is in part established through servers which it owns and houses at the
location facilities of third parties, and servers that it rents at data center facilities of third parties. If the
Company is unable to renew its data facility lease on commercially reasonable terms or at all, Narrative
may be required to transfer its servers to a new data center facility, and may incur significant costs and
possible service interruption in connection with the relocation.
These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, natural disasters,
arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures. Additionally, the third party
providers of such facilities may suffer a breach of security as a result of third party action, employee error,
malfeasance or otherwise, and a third party may obtain unauthorized access to the data in such servers.

!58

As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage systems change frequently and
generally are not recognized until launched against a target, Narrative and the providers of such facilities
may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Any such
security breaches or damages which occur which impact upon the Company’s infrastructure network and/
or the Narrative platform may adversely impact the utility, liquidity, and/or trading price of the NRVE
Tokens.
General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on Narrative. Operating
performance, results of operations and cash flows Narrative has been and could continue to be affected
by general global economic and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have
from time to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the information
technology industry at large.
Weakness in the economy could have a negative effect on the Company’s business, operations and
financial condition, including decreases in revenue and operating cash flows, and inability to attract
future equity and/or debt financing on commercially reasonable terms. Additionally, in a down-cycle
economic environment, Narrative may experience the negative effects of a slowdown in trading and
usage of the Narrative platform. Suppliers on which Narrative relies for servers, bandwidth, location and
other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in turn, could have a
negative impact on the Company’s operations or expenses. There can be no assurance, therefore, that
current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession
will not have a significant adverse impact on Narrative’s business, financial condition and results of
operations and hence the Narrative platform. Any such circumstances would then correspondingly
negatively impact the utility, liquidity, and/or trading price of the NRVE Tokens.
The Company or the NRVE Tokens may be affected by newly implemented regulations. Cryptocurrency
trading and NTS are generally unregulated worldwide, but numerous regulatory authorities across
jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering the implementation of regulatory regimes which
govern cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency markets. The Company or the NRVE Tokens may be affected
by newly implemented regulations relating to cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency markets, including
having to take measures to comply with such regulations, or having to deal with queries, notices,
requests or enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, which may come at a substantial cost and may
also require substantial modifications to the Narrative platform. This may impact the appeal of the
Narrative platform for users and result in decreased usage of the Narrative platform and the NRVE
Tokens. Further, should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented
regulations exceed a certain threshold, maintaining the Narrative platform may no longer be
commercially viable and the Company may opt to discontinue the Narrative platform and/or the NRVE
Tokens. Further, it is difficult to predict how or whether governments or regulatory authorities may
implement any changes to laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its
applications, including the Narrative platform and the NRVE Tokens. Narrative may also have to cease
operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or make it commercially
unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) or license(s) to operate in such
jurisdiction. In scenarios such as the foregoing, the utility, liquidating, and/or trading price of NRVE
Tokens will be adversely affected or NRVE Tokens may cease to be traded.

!59

There may be unanticipated risks arising from the NRVE Tokens. Cryptographic tokens such as the NRVE
Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic technology. In addition to the risks included in the above
discussion of Risk Factors, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding and use of the
NRVE Tokens, including those that Narrative cannot anticipate. Such risks may further appear as
unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed above.
