PROJECT
BACKGROUND

2017 is destined to be the year of Bitcoin, the year of cryptocurrency. The price of Bitcoin has accomplished almost a 2,000% rise
from less than 1,000 USD at the beginning of 2017, to 20,000 USD recently. The rise is underpinned by the market’s strong approval
and need for its functions and nature. 10% of the Russian billionaires are investing cryptocurrency. Venezuela is issuing the national
cryptocurrency
Petro. Apple and Google have supported Bitcoin’s API in their browsers. Japan, Korea and Philippines have established the laws for
cryptocurrency. The U.S Congress has established the blockchain policy-making committee and opened the future market for
Bitcoin.
From “10,000 Bitcoin for a pizza” to a Bitcoin worth more than 10,000 USD, Bitcoin has risen 22 million times in the past 8 years.
Numerous people have invested in the cryptocurrency, and most of them have earned a lot. Under such a frenzy market, the
investors have developed a huge need for market analysis, research reports and projects’ background information. But there is no
truly professional cross-platform information system in the market.
With the development in big data and AI this year, 70% of the trade volume in the US stock market was operated through
program trading.
The characteristics of cryptocurrency, such as its 7*24 trading hour, T+0 trading rules and significant short-term turmoil, also
bring huge opportunities for program trading. For the future cryptocurrency market, just like the mature stock market, institutions
will dominant the trade, so the first market player who owns automated trading programs and smartest trading model will stand
out. STOCKCHAIN’s program trading sharing platform provides all sorts of programmed tools and trading models for all traders.

1.1 Our Goal
We aim to build a cryptocurrency quotation analysis platform for professional investors. Meanwhile, we
strive to make the program trading strategies, traditional financial investment models and AI
investmentstrategies applied by investors widely, so that every investor can choose desired strategy models to
conduct program trading.

1.2 Our Vision
SCC aims to facilitate ordinary people to utilize the most professional automated trade system from Wall
Street and let the successful and experienced investors lead others to share the benefits of the new world. The
open, fair and impartial high-frequency trading interface ensures the automated programs can support the
investors’ operations in milliseconds.
Our team members have working experiences in Wall Street, famous securities companies and institutions as
well as the big data and AI fields. We devote ourselves in the cryptocurrency market because we believe that we
can achieve the most sharing and fair programmed software for the blockchain residents.

PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
With the popularization and application of blockchain, cryptocurrency trading has expanded. Numerous
cryptocurrency trading platforms in the global market appear to be unsystematic and disconnected. Our project
aims to build a quotation exchange platform for cryptocurrencies that connect the whole network, thus fill the gap
of trading global currencies through one Client. STOCKCHAIN team does not only strive to provide accurate and
comprehensive quotation data and news timely, but also conduct researches and practices in advanced program
trading and mathematical trade models, so as to serve the global cryptocurrency traders.

MARKET
PAIN POINTS
Isolated Island Problem
As the cryptocurrencies are normally based on the ERC20 standard and can be traded in any exchange, it has
brought with us the isolated island problem. There are thousands of exchanges all around the world. But due to
the centralization of each exchange, their data cannot be connected to each other. This could be a huge pain point
to the traders. Our platform can make use of the big data and our deep understanding of the blockchain to solve
the isolated island problem with the spirit of sharing. We will promote the development of the industry by
decentralizing the originally centralized exchanges’ data. We have designed a perfect data structure and owned
related patents. The data structure can be plug into the STOCKCHAIN quotation system at any time in the future.
Our team have all of the rights to provide value-added services based on the useful data.

High requirements for market access
Now the requirements for market access are higher than normal securities trading. In China, most trade are
conducted between virtual currency and USDT which is exchanged by legal tender. But most platforms set
requirements for USDT trading, so the price of USDT is unstable and the quantity is restricted. The market needs a
more stable USDT supply and lower requirements.

Low quality of current quotation software
The quotation software on the market are poor at interface layout, not user-friendly, and in lack of
comprehensive function, quotation information and necessary data. The web-clients also have problems at slow
page refresh and too many bugs. These problems increase the understanding costs for new investors.

Difficulties in choosing quality virtual currency to conduct value investing
The varieties of virtual currencies are already large and are expected to expand in the future. While the current
quotation exchange platform can’t provide sufficient information for investors to evaluate its value rationally.

6th

STOCKCHAIN

WHITEPAPER

Incomplete varieties and information of virtual currencies
Now the varieties of virtual currency trading provided by domestic exchanges are very scarce compared with
the large number varieties of virtual currencies, so the market needs an integrator which can introduce other
currencies into the domestic trading market. Currently, the virtual currency markets vary in their quality. The
investors have to acquire information of currencies through research reports, news and while papers.

Deep exploration of blockchain
Blockchain is a newly-emerging technology application. Now the market only utilizes virtual currency
application such as Bitcoin. But the real futuristic technology here is the blockchain technology to be applied in the
real-world, especially in finance and medical sectors. Their derivatives are the future trend for development.

Lack of integrated quotation presentation
Now most quotation software on the market are provided by trading platforms. Since every exchange only
provides the quotations of its own trading currencies, a third-party software which integrate the quotations of
various currencies is in need.

Complicated cross-platform trading
Now global investors have to choose a single platform to trade, while the platforms lack cross-market
quotations. Cross-platform trading requires investors opening various quotation page to acquire comprehensive
information, which is very inconvenient.

Lack of program trading
Cryptocurrency can be consecutively traded for 7*24 hours without restrictions from the price limiting
mechanism. In the future, most trade will be program-based automated trading. So, excelling at program trading
will enable market players to take control of the cryptocurrency trading market.

PRODUCT
INTRODUCTION
6.1 Cryptocurrency Quotation Exchange System
Centralized Exchange
STOCKCHAIN team has cooperated with the domestic and overseas mainstream exchange platforms in an indepth manner. We have access to all mainstream platforms’ quotation and exchange interfaces, and integrate
these interfaces to enable a cross-platform centralized trading for the investors. Investors can trade digital assets
in real time, seamlessly through our system no matter where their assets are.

Quotation System with Special Features
Based on the currency type, the location, sectoral distribution, market influence, risk level and trading volume,
etc. of the ICO issuers[companies], we will select a group of representative cryptocurrency samples and get the
weighted average price. And then we will use effective algorithms to calculate various cryptocurrency indexes that
can serve as valuable references for investments. Our calculation methods will adjust the index values with
reference to the quotation fluctuations, which makes the indexes highly sensitive to the changing market. With
these indexes, the investors can keep abreast of current market trends and thus come up with more detailed and
well-designed investment strategies.

Information and Media
STOCKCHAIN digital quotation platform can provide the users with various kinds of the information including
unexpected bad news, technical analyses, urgent notices and rolling information, etc. And STOCKCHAIN’s
homegrown media monitoring system will notify investors of the first-hand cryptocurrency updates, fresh-issued
currency information and exchange news.

Index Collection
The system has preset about 100 classic technical indexes. For users with more complex needs, it
alsoprovides the index formula editor which can help to edit and refine all kinds of formula indexes and early
warning conditions.

10th

STOCKCHAIN

WHITEPAPER

Integrated interfaces
The system provides a wide range of integrated interfaces which flexibly combine quotation, information,
platform, currency types and technique analysis. For instance, both the interfaces for “one currency in different
exchanges” and “multiple currencies in one exchange” can offer comprehensive observations and analysis from
different perspectives.

Comprehensive analysis of different currencies
New currencies in blockchain market often feature short listing cycle and high trading frequency and the illinformed investors are likely to lose money if they buy these currencies hastily. This is one of the big headache for
investors in the blockchain currency market. We offer the function of analyzing different currencies and place the
most comprehensive and accurate currency information conspicuously on the quotation page. Moreover, we have
researched on and offer various indicators and graphics to help investors identify the features of certain currency
quickly.

Trading Analysis Assistance
The system presents complex exchange data in the form of graphics and tables so that the users can easily
grasp the frequency, relative strength, feature of the currency trading. And detailed illustrations on the comparison
between different currencies and calculations enable investors to master the powerful trading analysis tools on our
platform.

6.2 Financial Derivatives
At present, most exchange platforms only support single form of currency trading. There are huge gaps in the
research and applications of the financial derivatives. With many years’ experience in the traditional financial
industry and a professional team, STOCKCHAIN team boasts various cryptocurrency derivatives for the investors to
choose from. The investors can also use SCCs to trade the derivatives.

Bitcoin, Ethereum and other ICO Token’s Options
We will offer different types of option contracts to investors. Meanwhile, we’ll provide a customer-tocustomer (C2C) option exchange platform for them to participate in the option creation and trading, and to trade
options directly with other investors (P2P).
Option is a contract, which gives the holder the right to buy or sell a good at a specific price on a certain date.
There are mainly two kinds of options: call option and put option. After paying a certain amount of premium to the
seller, the buyer will own the right to buy certain amount of specific goods at an agreed-upon price any time before
the contract expires.
For example, call option: Bitcoin’s market price is 10,000 USD on January 1th. A thinks Bitcoin price is likely to
rocket in the short term. But B thinks 10,000 USD is already the mid-term cap. Suppose A and B are brought together
and a deal is negotiated: A buys a call option of Bitcoins at a 10,000 USD strike price by paying 500 SCCs premium
and the call is set to expire after 2 months. On Feb. 1th, the price of Bitcoin rises to 20,000 USD. Now A has the right
to buy Bitcoin at the strike price of 10,000 USD from B. At this moment, even if B doesn’t have any Bitcoin, he will
have to buy the Bitcoins from the market at 20,000 USD and then sell to A at the price of 10,000 USD as agreed. If
the price of Bitcoin drops below 10,000 USD when the option is expired, A can choose to give up exercising the
option and he will only lose his premium, a total of 500 SCCs. Put option: On Jan. 1th, Bitcoin’s market price is
10,000 USD. A buys a put option from B at 10,000 USD by paying him 500 SCCs and the put is set to expire after 2
months. On Feb. 1th, the price of Bitcoin drops to 5000 USD. Then A can buy Bitcoins from the market at the price
of 5000 USD and sell it to B at the price of 10,000 USD.
Therefore, Option is like a valuation adjustment mechanism (VAM). The profit of the buyer is determined by
the gap between the market price and the contracted price; the profit of the seller is the premium paid by the buyer
when the market trends are not as expected and he gives up exercising the option. As such, option is a super
leverage without risk for a margin call or a bust account. It is also a perfect hedge tool, by which the participants
can customize and choose the deal by themselves.

C2C margin trading platform

STOCKCHAIN will launch a token margin trading platform with effective and consistent interest algorithms and
a margin management system for all kinds of ICO tokens, which will make the token margin financing and loan
process safe, fair and transparent. The investors can use SCC to pay for the margin and the interests and can also
loan out the tokens to earn the interests. Margin trading, i.e., loaning out the cryptocurrency, means that the short
sellers borrow the tokens with margins as collateral. They then sell the loaned tokens to the market, and when the
market price is lower, they repurchase the same amount and type of tokens from the market to repay the lender
on the expiration date; they can also pay the interest on their loan with SCC. For example, an ICO token’s market
price now stands at 1 USD. A thinks the price
will drop drastically in the short term whereas B thinks the price will rise and is willing to hold the token for
the long term. Through STOCKCHAIN C2C margin trading platform, A pledges 10,000 as the collateral to borrow a
certain number of tokens from B and agrees to pay 1000 SCC as interest one month later when the deal expires. A
then sells the loaned tokens on the market at the price of 1 USD. After one month, token’s price drops to 0.5 USD,
and A repurchases them from the market at 0.5 USD to pay B back.
16th

STOCKCHAIN

WHITEPAPER

So basically, A profits from the price gap or in this case, the price drop and redeem the margin collateral.
Conversely, if the token’s price ends up higher than 1 USD a month later, A will suffer losses: he has to buy
back the same number of tokens at the higher price and return them to B.

ETF index fund portfolio
STOCKCHAIN platform will launch a series of index funds based on the blockchain cryptocurrency index. ETF
(exchange-traded fund) index fund owns the ownership of a basket of cryptocurrencies and divides it into shares,
which means its exchange price and the net asset value (NAV) per share basically mirror the tracked benchmark
index. Therefore, if the investors want to buy a number of related cryptocurrencies, they can buy or sell an ETF
with SCC, which has the same effect of buying or selling the index it tracks and the basket of the cryptocurrencies
included in the index, and thus yields basically the same returns of the index.

6.3 Program Trading and Data Service
Program Trading System
The system automates trading strategies by using programs developed by strategy designers. All of the
strategies have gone through long-term trials, and the program trading has proven to be a truly effective and
efficient way of investment. Our program trading system aims to provide professional “Wall-Street level” trading
strategies for non-professionals. The strategies are accessible to all registered users. Our platform will categorize
strategies by their features and highlight and recommend the well-performingstrategies to investors. When
investors profit from using the trading strategies, a certain percentage of their earnings will be collected by the
Platform in the form of SCC as a commission.

Tool Module
Understanding the significant role of program trading tools in cryptocurrency trading, we developed practical
program trading tools based on classic financial models and the 7*24 non-stopping feature of cryptocurrency
trading. Our tools include the grid trading model and the calendar spread model etc. The former one has fully
automated the trading process to save the investors’ time, enhance efficiency and gain more profits.

WHITEPAPER

Strategy sharing
The program trading system offers official strategies, and also allows its users to customize their own trading
strategies using all kinds of pointers, functions and scripting languages. Users can upload their strategies and share
with others. Uploaded strategies will be back tested by the system and later, be examined by firm offers. Strategies
that prove to be high-yield with low drawdown will be recommended to other users of the platform. Strategy
providers will be awarded SCCs based on the popularity of their strategies.

Data Service
The system’s big data center stores massive historical data of currency trading, including line charts,
candlestick charts and settlements data of all major currencies traded in exchanges. Users who have higher
requirements for program trading can use these data whenever they need. Based on big data computers, the big
data center traces transaction history and examines the performance of program trading strategies, so as to provide
guidance for investors.

WHITEPAPER

7.1 System Structure
Cloud engine for quotation and other services: the service will push quotations of all exchanges to crossplatform clients and support high concurrency, load balancing and hot backup switching. The service has wide
applicability and high availability, laying a solid foundation for STOCKCHAIN’s business expansion and its fast launch.
Storage and uploading data to the blockchain module: The module is responsible for uploading the data
generated from the client and the global exchanges to the STOCKCHAIN storage system and also to the blockchain.
Then STOCKCHAIN will normalize the global quotation data formats to decentralize the data and store it
permanently, and share with the whole blockchain industry to promote the development of blockchain and the
cryptocurrency market.
Analysis module: The module uses open source technology of Hbase and Hadoop for analysis of collected data,
including but not limited to the quotations, users’ comments, news etc. Through data analysis, STOCKCHAIN will
launch a public opinion analysis system for the cryptocurrency world and in-depth analysis on the quotations as
well as other services to continuously inject new vitality into the Platform.
Third-party API: Based on the IPFS network storage, we provide historical quotation data API of all exchanges,
real-time quotation subscription API, public opinion analysis API for third-party developers. Files and demo are also
provided on the Github for developers.

7.2 About the Blockchain
Since the 2008 financial crisis when appalling events like the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and
Iceland’s sovereign debt default happened, the financial industry has been exploring ways of decentralization. But
the progress is quite slow.
The birth of bitcoin finally showed possibilities for decentralization. Blockchain, the underlying technology of
bitcoin, has been developed and improved. Based on the decentralization, data transparency and immutability
enabled by blockchain, STOCKCHAIN Platform uses this technology in providing value-added services (level2
quotation service, short-term investments) and derivatives, thus avoiding defaults or under-the-table deals in
traditional finance.

Uploading data to the blockchain:
The module is composed of Uploader, Adapter, Stored and IPFS. Using the PipeLine idea, the global exchange
quotations are collected via Uploader to the STOCKCHAIN System Storage Cluster (k-v storage) for fast quotation
distribution. The data are imported into the IPFS file system to enable data to be uploaded to the blockchain in a
real sense. In this way, the historical quotations of the cryptocurrency world will be broadcast to the whole industry
through our platform. Through data normalization, we can ensure practitioners read the data in a unified format
easily.

IPFS:
The IPFS project developers, following the similar idea with Ethereum developers, intend to decentralize the
Internet (http) and have files stored on all machines in the form of sharding. The file sharding model is already
widely used in traditional Internet and its can serve as a stable and permanently sustainable file system in the
blockchain.

Smart contract:
A smart contract comprises codes and data, occupying an address on the blockchain. Like an automatic agent
on the blockchain, it has its own account and is able to perform some functions under certain conditions, such as
automatically exercising an option contract on the STOCKCHAIN platform at the given point in time, providing the
level2 quotation service and the short-term investment function for users for one month and charging them SCCs,
and being Turing complete (meaning it can do everything that a Turing machine can do).
An example of smart contracts:
Code example for buying level2 service in SCCs

//financial service data structure struct
f_srv_info {
string name; //service name uint32

WHITEPAPER

Token: STOCKCHAIN Platform’s token follows the ERC20 standard which was published in November, 2015. ERC20
Tokens are universal and predictable. That is to say, all ERC20 tokens are compatible with ethereum wallets (wallets
like Jaxx, MEW and imToken all support ERC20 tokens). And exchanges have already known how to trade these
tokens so they can easily integrate them, meaning the tokens can be directly traded in many cases. The ER20
standard enables tokens to be connected. ERC20 tokens are only subsets of ethereum tokens. To ensure the
compatibility with ERC20 standard, developers should include a set of functions (interfaces) in the smart contracts,
so as to perform the following functions in higher layers:
•

Obtain the total amount of tokens

•

Obtain the account balance

•

Transfer the tokens

•

Approve token spending

Regarding the wide applicability feature of IPFS, in terms of storage and performance, IPFS is a double-edged
sword. That’s why it is just an expedient plan for our transition period. We are planning to develop a blockchain
STOCKCHAIN especially designed for financial use and will transfer the existing tokens and on-chain data smoothly
to the STOCKCHAIN.

7.3 Cloud engine



The client sends a login request by sending an XOR-encrypted format string to the server; (the key used here
is fixed); after the server verifies the legitimacy of the login request, it will send an XOR-decrypted string back
to the client and bring the key to gateway; the gateway will record skey information on this connection;



The client encrypts a sconf request with the asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, and at the same time, uses
the skey returned from the server to encrypt the encrypted data with the XOR algorithm,and sends it to the
server; (mainly to prevent public key disclosure and increase the complexity of connection replay requests);
after receiving the request, the server will first decrypt it with the XOR algorithm and then decrypt the data
with the asymmetric cryptographic algorithm; after the server verifies the legitimacy of the sconf request, it
will generate private keys for communication, encrypt the response using a temporary private key string
created by the client and send it back to the client. The client will thus communicate with the server using the
private keys created by the server.



To prevent slow connections, we have defined on the server: 1. time interval between establishing
connection and the first login request 2. time interval between successful login and sconf; the connection
will be closed if time is out to avoid handle waste.

The gateway is equipped with retry mechanism to avoid failures caused by back-end server update or
restarts etc.

The persistent connection-based quotation service is our existing service. It supports both http interface and
udp interface. When developing the quotation system, we fully used the conformity of the interface layer to make
other services support the above requests as well.
Therefore, we can interface the quotation service and the TCP engine without rewriting the service’s code
(few adjustments of statistical information may be needed). Meanwhile, other services, including option, futures
and VAMs, can also be connected to the engine by converting requests on the libxxxxx layer.
This idea has wide applicability.

To connect services that only have the http surface to the persistent connection, we developed the broker;
also, to converge the connections with the back-end server (which can also be achieved by lvs)

7.4 Cross-platform and High-performance Client
Terminal
Currently, cryptocurrency quotation and exchange software on the market are all cross-platform integrated
systems with the B/S architecture, developed by html, CSS or JavaScript. Their communication mode is timed pulling
over http. In this way, the development cycle is relatively short and the system is easy to maintain. But due to
limitations of screen compatibility, data processing ability and communication mode, these applications may
present pages in disorder and incomplete data, or encounter lags and update failures etc. when operating in
different systems and devices. These problems can result in users’ wrong judgments and revenue losses.
Quotations are rapidly changing and it’s not easy to seize trading opportunities. A good quotation and
exchange software should therefore provide real-time and comprehensive quotations for its users in a userfriendly way, so that the users can make quick and right decisions. Thus, we offer personalized systems on different
platforms based on the C/S architecture: the server, with the Cloud Engine as its carrier, collects, analyzes and
disseminates real-time quotations and forwards users’ orders; for the client which is responsible for presenting
quotations and sending orders, we choose native development technologies with the best performance and the
greatest stability for different operating systems, based onthe system’s visual, performance and communication
features. Real-time data interaction links are established between the server and the client using the socket
communication and the async non-blocking I/O mode. In this way, our platform has covered almost all operating
systems and devices on the market. Users can check real-time quotations and conduct transactions at any time
and any place, with no concern for data latency.

7.5 Optimized network components
The network components have been optimized in three aspects: we developed the ZeroCopy network
communication module with large volume and low latency; optimized communication protocols between clients
and exchanges; deployed proxy servers for transactions in major IDCs of the core cities.
The optimized network components enable the quotation and exchange platform to provide real-time
quotations and in-depth analysis for users and forward their orders in a quick and steady way.

 Develop the ZeroCopy network communication module with large volume and
low latency

The traditional network communication module transfers data from the network card to the kernel buffer,
analyzes the data according to the service model and returns the data back to the buffer to be sent by the
network card. In this data transmission process, the data is copies for at least 4 times, and there are also multiple
context switches between the user mode and kernel mode. The operating system firstly copies the data to the
buffer of kernel space using DMA; after the kernel network protocol stack resolves it, the data will be copied to
the buffer of user zone by the CPU; the CPU will copy the data which has been analyzed based on the service
model to the kernel buffer, and finally send it to the network card using DMA.

WHITEPAPER

The data flow diagram of the whole process is shown below:

Data copy using the CPU is low-efficient, accounting for nearly 80% of the total time cost. The application of
the Linux-based ZeroCopy technology can remove the data transfer tasks undertaken by the CPU, enabling the CPU
to focus on model analysis in order to achieve the efficient use of system resources and low latency.
First, we use MMap to share the kernel buffer with the application, so that the content in the kernel buffer does
not have to be copied to the user space. Second, we put the service model-based analysis before the kernel network
protocol stack resolution, to reduce unnecessary copies. Finally, we use the self-developed card driver to work with
the Intel NIC to achieve page cache and DMA collect copy. With the three steps of optimization, we do not only
reduce data copy tasks, but also reduce context switches between the user mode and kernel mode. The whole data
transmission and processing process only happens in the system’s kernel space, taking only 25% of the time spent
in the traditional communication model.

The data flow diagram of the optimized ZeroCopy-based network communication
module is shown below:

Based on network communications module supported by ZeroCopy, a single server can process data at 40Gbps
with a transmission delay of less than 10ms, or at 10Gbps and with a transmission delay of less than 1ms.



Optimize communications protocols between clients and exchanges

Currently, the worldwide exchanges offer interactions based on the WEB access communications through the
clients’ browsers. However, as an open and shared framework, the browser cannot be restricted to interacting with
the exchanges. These ways of transaction are susceptible to changes in the users’ browsers, which could cause lengthy
delays in communications or even failure of the trade.

7.6 Big Data
In the era of Big Data, STOCKCHAIN also starts to develop the big data industry. It has developed a series of
big data-based smart business applications, such as DMP (an enterprise-tailored database), DSP (a precisely
targeted platform), PAS (a user profile analysis system). It also collaborates with several large enterprises to
marketize and cash profits in data mining.

7.6.1 Big Data Coverage
STOCKCHAIN has developed distributed, high-concurrency, large-scale data acquisition engines on its own.
These engines collect data from clusters at home and abroad. They cover more than 80 million websites and 1
million APP. Acquisition engines are equipped with pattern recognition modules so as to acquire data from images.
With resources accumulated in the past few years, STOCKCHAIN has established good partnerships with several
large enterprises, and realized data coverage over the whole network.

7.8 Quantitative Trading Strategy of Financial
Artificial Intelligence
After acquisition of financial data, the platform can input massive data concerning financial transactions
through machine learning. Via the deep learning technology, the platform can automatically identify transaction
models among billions of data and find the changing Eigen factors during transactions, so as to predict trends and
design successful strategies. We can establish and improve trading models by using trading algorithms based on
the history of regression analysis and statistical probability. The platform acquires data regarding all the important
financial indicators and leverages deep reinforcement learning technology and multi neural networks to learn about
changes in the market and predict rules and trends in the market, so as to produce new parameters, and further
optimize transaction models. Based on machine learning, the platform builds the financial knowledge graph. It
leverages the public opinion analysis system and integrate data (both structured and unstructured) from multiple
sources. The platform will also check the data inconsistency, add the targeted market’s risk coefficient to the Eigen
factors, so as to maximize benefits (or minimize losses) in the transactions.
