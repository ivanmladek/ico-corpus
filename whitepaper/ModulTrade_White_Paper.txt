Abstract
1

There is no one place where 400 mln micro, small and medium enterprises (​MSME​) can meet
each other, commit trade agreements easily and trustfully and get help with trade-related
services​ ​in​ ​a​ ​cost-effective​ ​way.
Blockchain technology can be used to build a user’s platform which can add a ​module of trust
2
into the B2B ​trade ​cycle, while simplifying the execution of transactions and decreasing their
costs. ModulTrade ​has laid the foundations for creating a value ecosystem for global trade:
a digital blockchain networked value structure that is real-time, global, connected, digital and
cost-effective,​ ​with​ ​features​ ​to​ ​support​ ​further​ ​fintech​ ​solutions​ ​developed​ ​by​ ​third​ ​parties.
ModulTrade​ ​Value​ ​Ecosystem​ ​(MVE).
This white paper describes how ​MVE will democratize global trade by connecting the heart
of Blockchain functionalities (i.e. trust and democracy) to real life trade transactions
within​ ​the​ ​enterprises’​ ​supply​ ​chains​ ​globally.
MVE​ ​will​ ​leverage​ ​on​​ ​two​ ​innovative​ ​technological​ ​implementations​:
●

●

A Smart-contract platform​: this replicates traditional trade finance instruments (such
3
as letters of credit and bank guarantees) and allows MSME to establish trust into their
trade​ ​agreements
The MTRc (ERC-20 Ethereum-based ModulTrade token)​: will be a new ​trade enabler
(every enterprise with access to a smartphone will be able to execute trade real-time,
globally and in a cost-effective way) and ​3rd party application enabler (it will be used
for charging usage fees for third parties’ solution built on ModulTrade’s smart-contract
platform).

As MVE is a multi-sided platform, requiring to reach a certain number of users to achieve a
network​ ​effect​​ ​(please​ ​see​ ​further​ ​below​ ​for​ ​more​ ​details)​,​ ​this​ ​document​ ​also​ ​explains:
4
● the​ ​rationale​ ​of​ c​ ritical​ ​mass ​ ​which​ ​is​ ​needed​ ​to​ ​trigger​ ​the​ ​network​ ​effect​ ​in​ ​MVE
● the​ ​approach​ ​to​ ​reach​ ​this​ ​critical​ ​mass
By combining together the development of a value ecosystem and a new crypto token for
B2B trade, ModulTrade is one of the few pioneers able to improve the trade finance
industry by connecting millions of enterprises (underserved by today’s banking system) to
the​ ​global​ ​trade​ ​in​ ​an​ ​easier,​ ​trustful​ ​and​ ​more​ ​efficient​ ​way​.

Value​​
proposition
ModulTrade is a smart-contract blockchain-based ecosystem where MSMEs can meet, commit
and​ ​execute​ ​trade​ ​globally,​ ​easily,​ ​trustfully​ ​and​ ​efficiently.
5

ModulTrade’s Value Ecosystem (​MVE​) is based on ​MSP (multi-sided platform) , which aims to
create​ ​value​ ​through​ ​the​ ​network​ ​effect​ ​for​ ​the​ ​following​ ​three​ ​main​ ​constituents:

MVE​ ​is​ ​an​ ​economic​ ​catalyst ​ ​which​ ​also​ ​aims​ ​to​ ​create​ ​value​ ​by

●

reducing transactions costs faced by multiple distinct economic agents that would
benefit​ ​from​ ​coming​ ​together;​ ​and

●

reduce search efforts, facilitate matching, and making it easier for the different groups of
economic​ ​agents​ ​to​ ​exchange​ ​value​ ​between​ ​them..

The MTRc​, the instrument for value exchange in MVE, is a prime enabler of the ecosystem
growth,​ ​allowing​ ​it​ ​to​ ​capitalize​ ​on​ ​(albeit​ ​indirectly):
● the tremendous growth of global B2B e-commerce (estimated to increase over 5 times
to​ ​be​ ​$6,7tn​ ​by​ ​2020);
● the potential of 400 mln MSMEs globally which execute trade in their day to day activity
and​ ​steadily​ ​increase​ ​its​ ​footprint​ ​in​ ​global​ ​trade;
● the​ ​future​ ​developments​ ​in​ ​blockchain​ ​technology​ ​for​ ​the​ ​global​ ​B2B​ ​trade​ ​activity.
The MTRc token will be issued on Ethereum and will comply with the most common and widely
accepted ERC-20 token standard. This will ensure that MTRc is compatible with all the ether
wallets​ ​and​ ​can​ ​be​ ​easily​ ​added​ ​into​ ​most​ ​common​ ​crypto-exchanges​ ​for​ ​trading.

transformation
A whole new approach, informed by blockchain logic, could bring the very transformation an
established yet restricted business is crying out for. Placing the end-to-end trade finance process
on a new platform would have a very clear objective: to offer all exporters and importers fast
and easy access to credit issuance and advisory services. This is a radical but obtainable shift. An
open, automated, and transparent trade finance platform, which replaces cumbersome trust
mechanisms​ ​with​ ​automatic​ ​checks​ ​and​ ​assurances,​ ​is​ ​now​ ​a​ ​technical​ ​possibility.

The opportunities for MSMEs in the global marketplace and value chains are enormous : it
exposes them to a large customer/buyer base, as well as opportunities to learn from large firms
and​ ​from​ ​engaging​ ​and​ ​surviving​ ​in​ ​up​ ​and​ ​coming​ ​sectors​ ​of​ ​the​ ​global​ ​marketplace.
“The development of e-commerce promises to expand export opportunities for SMEs and give
them a global presence that was once reserved for large multinational firms.“ - ​WORLD TRADE

Institute​ ​(2013)​ ​has​ ​estimated​ ​at​ ​between​ ​6​ ​and​ ​15​ ​per​ ​cent.
ModulTrade will aim to help MSMEs prosper in the global marketplace by facilitating such
trade​ ​as​ ​described​ ​in​ ​this​ ​White​ ​Paper.

Technology and regulations are democratizing banking industry towards
Fintech
11

Another catalyst for this kind of disruption is the Second EEA Payment Services Directive (​PSD2​)
whereby Fintech providers will become Account Information Service Providers (​AISPs​)
themselves which makes it easier, faster and less costly to handle customer's' payment
transactions​ ​and​ ​account​ ​related​ ​data.
PSD2 will allow the MTP (ModulTrade Platform) to interact with customers’ accounts
within secure processes without banking intermediaries thus increasing efficiency and
lowering​ ​transactions​ ​costs.

Problem
MSMEs face many barriers and capacity constraints due to their relatively small size. Globally, it
is estimated that approximately 56% of MSME trade finance proposals are rejected, compared to
12
only​ ​7%​ ​for​ ​multinational​ ​corporations.
ModulTrade addresses the needs of MSMEs by eliminating the main barriers for entry into
global​ ​trade:
● Lack​ ​of​ ​trust.
● High​ ​entry​ ​costs.
● Complexity​ ​of​ ​trade-related​ ​operations.

Trust
Lack of trust remains a significant problem for MSMEs and prevents them from being active
players in the global trade network. The economical meaning of this trust issue could be
summarized​ ​in​ ​the​ ​following​ ​question:
●

Will​ ​the​ ​Buyer​ ​pay​ ​upon​ ​the​ ​Seller​ ​sends​ ​goods​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Buyer?

This question was answered by ​existing banking system which created Trade finance
instruments​,​ ​like​​ ​Letters​ ​of​ ​Credit​​ ​and​ ​Bank​ ​Guarantees.

High​​
entry​​costs​​and​​complexity​​
of​​
trade​​
related​​
operations
Traditionally, the trade finance business has targeted exporters and importers of a
certain size, with only mid-range to larger players being able to afford trade finance
13
services​.
Today’s​ ​trade​ ​finance​ ​business​ ​has​ ​to​ ​face​ ​the​ ​following​ ​key​ ​challenges:
● Increasing cost pressure: Letters of Credits (​LCs​) are associated with high costs for both
the bank and clients, while dispute resolution and limited scale create additional
pressures due to a relatively high fraction of manual processing and a yet untapped
customer base. ​Trade finance providers can gain strategic advantages if they
succeed in finding fundamentally new approaches to delivering the service to their
clients.
● Poor customer experience​: from a bank’s point of view, the key customers, exporters,
and importers often suffer from a poor end-to-end customer experience. Not only does
the issuance of LC-backed trade finance transactions require high coordination efforts
among exporters, importers, and issuing and advising banks, often represented by
individual legal counsel, the settlement of the transaction follows overly complicated and
manual processes, long waiting times with low transparency, and a relatively high
residual settlement uncertainty. For example, importers still face the delivery risk of
fraudulent shipments, even if the transaction is backed by an LC, and have to proactively
and​ ​manually​ ​track​ ​all​ ​stages​ ​of​ ​the​ ​agreed​ ​delivery​ ​terms.

The​​
solution​​proposed​​by​​ModulTrade
ModulTrade​ ​aims​ ​to​ ​eliminate​ ​the​ ​main​ ​barriers​ ​for​ ​entry​ ​into​ ​global​ ​trade​ ​as​ ​well​ ​as:
●
●
●

bringing​ ​together​ ​a​ ​comprehensive​ ​range​ ​of​ ​services​ ​for​ ​the​ ​full​ ​B2B​ ​trade​ ​cycle;
helping MSMEs meet, commit and execute trade globally easily, in a trustful and
efficiently​ ​manner;​ ​and
Introducing the MTRc (​ModulTrade token​) as an efficient instrument of value exchange
in​ ​ModulTrade​ ​ecosystem.

MVE also aspires to be an innovative global platform that will easily facilitate
participants’ access to 3rd parties providing some or more of the following trade related
services:
● Logistics
● Trade​ ​Financing
● Tax​ ​and​ ​bookkeeping
● Insurance
● Custom​ ​brokerage
MVE aims to be the place to easily develop new digital solutions for global trade​, the most
obvious​ ​use​ ​cases​ ​being:
● Supply​ ​chain​ ​tracking​ ​on​ ​ModulTrade’s​ ​Platform
●

Digital​ ​Thread​ ​for​ ​Additive​ ​Manufacturing​ ​(DTAM)

●

IoT​ ​solutions​ ​for​ ​invoice​ ​factoring.

ModulTrade’s​​Value​​Ecosystem​​
(“MVE”)​​
—​​
the​​
economic​​
catalyst
for​​
democracy​​in​​global​​trade
Leveraging on smart-contract blockchain-based technology, ModulTrade will build a value
ecosystem for global trade, i.e. a digital networked value structure that is real-time,
global, connected, digital and cost-effective, with features to support further fintech
solutions developed by third parties. This solution will enable MSMEs to increase their
revenues whilst reducing the costs of global trading. It will also enable third party
developers / service providers to gain access to a wider target of users / clients, while
reducing development and user acquisition costs. In this framework, the MTRc will be
used as a key for the users to connect to the global trade network and to transact in
ModulTrade​ ​ecosystem.
MVE​ ​aims​ ​to​ ​connect​ ​participants​ ​to​ ​trade​ ​globally​ ​via​ f​ our​ ​main​ ​components:

1.

2.

Blockchain based Smart-contract multi-sided platform (MTP)​: to replicate banks’
trade finance instruments (Letter of Credit and Guarantee) and to offer MVE participants
this service in a trustful and cost-effective way while also connecting them to other
services​ ​like​ ​logistic​ ​and​ ​insurance;
Trade related services platform​: to simplify trade execution via 3rd party service
providers​ ​(e.g.​ ​payments,​ ​logistic,​ ​financing,​ ​tax,​ ​bookkeeping);

7

3.
4.

Trade & Reputation network​: to facilitate monetary transactions of MVE participants
within their reputation capital being a function of users reputable collaboration within
the​ ​ecosystem;
Marketplaces​: to find reliable counterparties globally and to make optimal choices of
goods​ ​&​ ​prices.

The main function of MTP will be to replicate banks’ trade finance instruments such as Letters of
Credit​ ​(​LC​)​ ​and​ ​Bank​ ​Guarantees.
MTP will provide this functionality to MSMEs at a negligible price (cost of smart-contract
execution on blockchain) if compared to 4-15% of the transaction amount charged by banks at
the​ ​moment.

The​​
MTRc
The ModulTrade Crypto Token (MTRc), an ERC-20 token issued on Ethereum, is a key
element of the new ModulTrade’s B2B multi-sided platform, that enables its users to
connect​ ​to​ ​the​ ​ModulTrade​ ​platform​ ​and​ ​its​ ​ecosystem​ ​and​ ​to​ ​effect​ ​transactions​.
MTRc shall be a premined token that will be distributed only during the pre-sale and Tokens sale
campaigns. Therefore, the number of MTRc tokens will be fixed starting end of November, 2017
which​ ​will​ ​be​ ​guaranteed​ ​by​ ​the​ ​token​ ​smart​ ​contract.
Demand for MTRc is expected to be driven by ​MVE and by ModulTrade network growth. ​The
more trade transactions are carried out through the ModulTrade network, the more MTRc
demand​ ​will​ ​increase,​ ​thus​ ​ ​improving​ ​the​ ​trade​ ​flows​ ​served​ ​within​ ​MVE

Reputation​​Network​​&​​Reputation​​
Capital
A Reputational Network will be formed within MVE on the basis of a network aggregating
reputation capital of users across multiple forms of collaborative consumption within
MVE.
●

●

●

Reputation Capital is a quantitative measure of a user’s reputational value in MVE
delivered by ModulTrade’s Reputation System, which represents a form of remuneration
for​ ​the​ ​user’s​ ​efforts,​ ​generating​ ​trust​ ​and​ ​respect​ ​within​ ​MVE.
Users’ Reputation Capital will drive the value of trade guarantee & financing line available
in MTRc for each user provided by Reputational Network to the user to guarantee its
obligations​ ​within​ ​trade​ ​transactions.
Reputational Network will be initially formed and supported by ModulTrade and MTRc
holders​ ​and​ ​users​ ​at​ ​a​ ​later​ ​stage.

11

Trade​​
guarantee​​&​​financing​​
in​​
MTRc
One of the main obstacles to participate in trade is the need for financing, both on sell and buy
side. Globally, 56% of MSME trade finance proposals are rejected, compared to only 7% for
15
multinational​ ​corporations.
To facilitate trade transaction within MVE ModulTrade addresses the existing need of
small enterprises’ via Reputational Network. Funds and guarantees will be granted to
MSMEs​ ​in​ ​MTRc​ ​on​ ​the​ ​base​ ​of​ ​their​ ​Reputational​ ​Capital​ ​for​ ​the​ ​period​ ​of​ ​up​ ​to​ ​30​ ​days.
Credit lines and related fees will be established on the reputation capital built by the enterprises
(which in its turn is function of the network recommendations, as assessed by ModulTrade’s
Reputation​ ​System).
● every​ ​new​ ​user​ ​which​ ​got​ ​recommendations​ ​from​ ​7​ ​reputable​ ​established​ ​MVE
participants.
The​ ​amount​ ​of​ ​credit​ ​lines​ ​will​ ​be​ ​a​ ​function​ ​of
● application​ ​order​ ​(according​ ​to​ ​the​ ​“first​ ​comers​ ​get​ ​more”​ ​principle)
● user’s​ ​Reputation​ ​Capital
Every​ ​MTRc​ ​holder​ ​will​ ​be​ ​able​ ​to​ ​use​ ​Reputational​ ​Network​ ​infrastructure​ ​to​ ​provide​ ​MTRc​ ​for​ ​a
fee​ ​to​ ​guarantee​ ​and​ ​finance​ ​the​ ​trade​ ​in​ ​MVE.

MTRc​​
liquidity
To support MTRc liquidity and turnover within MVE ModulTrade will establish several levels
infrastructure​ ​which​ ​will​ ​include
● Bancor​ ​protocol​ ​mechanism16
● MTRc​ ​exchange​ ​by​ ​ModulTrade
● MTRc​ ​placement​ ​with​ ​existing​ ​crypto-exchanges
Use of Bancor protocol will establish MTRc liquidity in advance to its appearance on
crypto-exchanges.

Technical​​description
Technical​​concept​​of​​ModulTrade​​
solution
A​ ​simplified​ ​Letter​ ​of​ ​Credit​ ​protocol
The purpose of a ModulTrade smart contract is to lock funds from a Buyer and release them to a
Seller​ ​upon​ ​delivery​ ​of​ ​a​ ​Product​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Buyer.
The​ ​simplified​ ​workflow​ ​of​ ​the​ ​contract​ ​is​ ​as​ ​follows.
1) The​ ​Buyer​ ​deposits​ ​funds​ ​into​ ​the​ ​smart​ ​contract​ ​which​ ​acts​ ​as​ ​an​ ​escrow​ ​agent.
2) Funds​ ​are​ ​locked​ ​in​ ​the​ ​smart​ ​contract​ ​until​ ​release​ ​conditions​ ​are​ ​met.
3) Funds​ ​are​ ​released​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Seller​ ​upon​ ​successful​ ​delivery​ ​in​ ​a​ ​specified​ ​time​ ​horizon.
4) Funds​ ​are​ ​released​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Buyer​ ​if​ ​no​ ​delivery​ ​occurs​ ​in​ ​a​ ​specified​ ​time​ ​horizon.

In conditions when funds are blocked in a smart contract which acts as an escrow agent, the
ultimate goal of the parties becomes to release the blocked funds from the contract to
themselves as soon as they both agree that the trade has been successful. In this case, the
ModulTrade smart contract plays a role of trusted middleman helping to eliminate a costly trust
counterparty, traditionally, a bank or a marketplace agent. However, in the absence of a
middleman, it is only the counterparties themselves who know if their interests have been
respected. This brings a number of counterparty risks which should be handled accordingly. For
example,

1) Deposit​ ​from​ ​the​ ​Buyer​ ​was​ ​received,​ ​the​ ​Shipping​ ​Agent​ ​received​ ​the​ ​product,​ ​but​ ​failed
to​ ​deliver​ ​it​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Buyer​ ​on​ ​time​ ​or​ ​at​ ​all.
2) Deposit​ ​from​ ​the​ ​Buyer​ ​was​ ​received,​ ​but​ ​the​ ​Seller​ ​didn’t​ ​send​ ​the​ ​product​ ​on​ ​time,
didn’t​ ​send​ ​it​ ​at​ ​all​ ​or​ ​sent​ ​a​ ​wrong​ ​product.
3) The​ ​Buyer​ ​claims​ ​that​ ​he​ ​or​ ​she​ ​received​ ​wrong/improper​ ​product​ ​while​ ​the​ ​Seller
shipped​ ​the​ ​proper​ ​product.

13

Who should receive what if one of the above cases takes place due to an unintentional error or
intentional​ ​fraud?​ ​Who​ ​decides​ ​on​ ​the​ ​fair​ ​outcome?
Initially, ModulTrade is going to mimic the logic of a letter of credit and its original trade contract
will ensure that sellers are getting paid unless they continuously misbehave and their reputation
slumps.​ ​Further,​ ​elaborate​ ​protocols​ ​based​ ​on​ ​mutual​ ​consensus​ ​outlined​ ​below​ ​will​ ​be​ ​added.
A​ ​family​ ​of​ ​consensus-based​ ​protocols
Generally speaking, it is only possible for the parties to withdraw funds from the contract when
consensus about the fair payouts has been reached. Since only parties themselves know if their
interests have been respected, it is them who should reach consensus. This process can
naturally happen off-chain or on-chain, but the resolution always happens on-chain when both
parties submit non-contradictory payout claims to the contract. If all parties behave honestly,
they all will approve correct withdrawals to each other and the contract will terminate correctly
and with zero balance. If one of the parties does not approve the fair withdrawal, applicable
funds shall be locked until they reach an agreement. The parties are motivated to reach an
agreement as they will lose more otherwise, because of the reputational deposits pledged as
described​ ​below.
Such protocol acts both as incentive to behave honestly and as a deterrent for behaving unjustly.
This protocol, however, does not resolve all potential misbehaviours and abuses. ModulTrade
aims to resolve such cases by extending the protocol with reputational deposits which parties
have to place depending on their reputation score. This will further incentivize fair behaviour of
the​ ​parties.
With reputational deposit, the parties risk losing more if they behave dishonestly, while losing
nothing otherwise. It is logical that some may regard reputational deposit as an unwanted,
though temporary, burden. Specifically to mitigate this perception, on early stages, ModulTrade
and its ecosystem partners are going to act as guarantors of trusted trade by offering parties an
option​ ​to​ ​make​ ​reputation​ ​deposit​ ​for​ ​them​ ​for​ ​an​ ​agreed​ ​fee.

Technological​​scalability
ModulTrade solution is technologically scalable. Long-term platform scalability due to
current technological constraints of Ethereum is an issue that can be addressed in several
ways each of which is feasible, secure and realistic. In the event, the most appropriate
method will be decided depending on the tests to be carried out together with pilot
customers and first partners, as well as depending on the user growth rate after the first
release.
One of the major current technological constraints of every Ethereum-based solution is
scalability: at the moment (June 2017), Ethereum can handle from 7 to 13 transactions per
17
second in case of relatively light smart contracts . This is clearly a bottleneck for any application
that aims at growing to a considerable number of transactions. There are certain approaches
that ModulTrade can employ to handle this issue and we believe that scalability should not be
regarded​ ​as​ ​a​ ​serious​ ​obstacle.​ ​Further​ ​we​ ​explain​ ​why.
In case of ModulTrade, two metrics matter most: a) the average number of transactions per
second​ ​and​ ​b)​ ​the​ ​maximum​ ​reasonable​ ​latency​ ​between​ ​transactions​ ​of​ ​the​ ​same​ ​contract.

Transaction latency is not an issue for ModulTrade. The types of contracts that the platform is
going to support typically allow up to 1 day latency. In future, when ModulTrade taps into
markets and processes that require faster execution, latency requirements can potentially be
raised to several hours, but unlikely to single minutes. This allows us to ease up platform
requirements​ ​on​ ​the​ ​number​ ​of​ ​simultaneous​ ​transactions.
If we disregard for the moment MTRc trading on crypto-exchanges as this activity is external to
the platform, we can use the following formula to estimate the average number of transaction
per​ ​second.
Average​ ​TPS​ ​=​ ​users​ ​*​ ​contracts-per-user​ ​*​ ​transactions-per-contract​ ​/​ ​contract-life-time
Assuming:
● A target of 10mln users by year 10 that use ModulTrade platform on a regular basis (i.e.
executing​ ​1​ ​contract​ ​per​ ​week​ ​on​ ​average).
● About 10 transactions (initiation, funds transfers, delivery status checks, insurance
conditions​ ​check​ ​and​ ​so​ ​on)​ ​required​ ​per​ ​each​ ​contract​ ​on​ ​ModulTrade.
● Contract​ ​lifetime​ ​can​ ​be​ ​from​ ​1​ ​day​ ​to​ ​2​ ​weeks,​ ​i.e.​ ​roughly​ ​1​ ​week​ ​on​ ​average.
● Transactions​ ​uniformly​ ​distributed​ ​over​ ​time.
Then:
Average​ ​TPS​ ​=​ ​users​ ​*​ ​contracts-per-user​ ​*​ ​transactions-per-contract​ ​/​ ​contract-life-time
=​ ​10mln​ ​*​ ​1​ ​contract​ ​per​ ​week​ ​*​ ​10​ ​transaction​ ​per​ ​contract​ ​/​ ​1​ ​week​ ​lifetime
=​ ​10mln​ ​*​ ​0.143​ ​contracts​ ​per​ ​day​ ​*​ ​10​ ​transactions​ ​per​ ​contract​ ​/​ ​7​ ​days​ ​=
=​ ​ca​ ​2mln​ ​transactions​ ​per​ ​day​ ​=​ ​ca​ ​24​ ​transactions​ ​per​ ​second
This TPS, estimated for a target of 10 mln active ModulTrade users in year 10, is more than what
Ethereum supports today, although this current scalability bottleneck is expected to be resolved
by Ethereum Community with a reasonable advance. Be it an increase in gas limit, migration to
proof-of-stake or another improvement, it is vital for the mere existence of Ethereum as a smart
contract​ ​platform.
Nevertheless, there are a couple of alternatives that ModulTrade is able to employ in case of
exponential growth and without reliance on Ethereum. They are migration to another blockchain
or,​ ​alternatively,​ ​bringing​ ​some​ ​less​ ​trust-critical​ ​parts​ ​of​ ​the​ ​smart​ ​contract​ ​execution​ ​off​ ​chain.
Migrating​ ​to​ ​another​ ​blockchain
The other blockchain could be either a more traditional private or public permissioned
blockchain (e.g. Hyperledger) or blockchain-inspired technology such as Corda, or a new
blockchain​ ​architecture​ ​with​ ​vertical​ ​and​ ​horizontal​ ​scaling​ ​such​ ​as​ ​EOS.
Depending on the chosen method, MTRc tokens might remain on Ethereum and a cross-chain
gateway can be developed for interoperability. No hard fork of MTRc contract would be needed.
However, if the chosen method would require transfer of MTRc funds from Ethereum to another
blockchain (unlikely but theoretically possible event), a carefully defined, open and verifiable
process will be used to transfer the funds and MTRc funds will continue belonging to their
owners.
Bringing​ ​some​ ​parts​ ​of​ ​the​ ​smart​ ​contract​ ​off​ ​chain
Another alternative of addressing scalability problem is bringing certain less trust-critical parts of
smart contract work flow off chain. For example, contract negotiation is the primary candidate to
be off chain. Third party services such as insurance or risk hedging can be partially or completely
off​ ​chain,​ ​or​ ​on​ ​another​ ​blockchain.

Critical​​mass​​of​​users​​will​​create​​
a​​
network​​
effect​​
in​​
MVE
18

The priority goal of MVE network development for 2018-20 is to reach a ​critical mass of
users (figure “MVE critical mass” below) ​to create a network effect which will provide MVE
a​ ​self-maintained​ ​ ​growth​ ​to​ ​its​ ​profit-maximizing​ ​potential.

On​ ​this​ ​way​ ​MVE​ ​evolution​ ​will​ ​pass​ ​two​ ​implementation​ ​stages

First​​
implementation​​stage​​during​​
Y2018-20
MT will target the most “network” connected and value adding elements (​VE — Value elements)
of MSMEs supply chains. Such element was identified in EU (initial ModulTrade market) being a
construction​ ​ ​and​ ​related​ ​industry.
MVE will onboard ​70-100k constructors (Side B) i​n 3 geographies (total number 1-1,5m
construction enterprises) from top 5 constructions countries in EU. And 2-3k suppliers (Side A)
to have an equilibrium of critical mass. That will represent 7-10% penetration in selected industry
which is enough for a critical mass. These numbers are based on the ​analysis detailed in
ModulTrade​ ​Yellow​ ​paper​ ​.
Two​ ​main​ ​clients​ ​approaches​ ​will​ ​be​ ​used​ ​to​ ​achieve​ ​the​ ​goals​ ​mentioned​ ​above
● direct​ ​client​ ​onboarding​ ​in​ ​VE
● indirect​ ​client​ ​onboarding​ ​through​ ​partnership​ ​with​ ​3rd​ ​party​ ​B2B​ ​marketplaces

According to the ​Catalytic Ignition and Critical Mass concept shown on Figure “MVE critical
​
mass”, there is a range of minimal number of customers in each group that, if achieved, provides
a thick enough market or a sufficiently liquid market to permit sustainable growth. Once a
catalyst achieves critical mass on C’-C’’, for example, it can grow to its profit-maximizing potential
of​ ​D*​ ​in​ ​the​ ​long​ ​run.

MVE will connect them to MTP functionality and MVE cross-border trade enablers such as
logistic or financing. ​Domestic ​3rd party marketplace represents the target audience

This number of active clients will allow ModulTrade to generate positive cash-flow starting
from​ ​the​ ​second​ ​year​ ​of​ ​its​ ​operations​ ​and​ ​to​ ​break-even​ ​during​ ​2019-20.

Second​​
implementation​​stage​​
—​​
Y2020+
Upon a critical mass at VE is achieved MVE will trigger expansion to other
elements​ ​of​ ​Global​ ​Value​ ​Chains​ ​(GVC)
Network effect will allow to reduce CAC (Customer acquisition costs) as users will start to join
MVE driven by the value they receive from the network when they join MVE. CAC at this stage will
be mainly related to the technical scalability of MVE thus decreasing for each new client. While
we​ ​expect​ ​ ​ARPU​ ​(average​ ​return​ ​peruser)​ ​to​ ​be​ ​stable​ ​or​ ​increasing.

5. Easy access to trade related services — (logistics will be among the first ones) through
connecting​ ​to​ ​integrated​ ​in​ ​MVE​ ​3rd​ ​party​ ​service​ ​providers​ ​platform​ ​(DHL,​ ​UPS,​ ​…)

MVE​​
product​​value​​for​​3rd​​party​​
marketplaces
MVE will provide new value adding enablers which intensify users trade transactions thus leading
to value increase of the marketplace. Customers of marketplaces will access full MTP
functionalities​ ​including​ ​financing​ ​in​ ​MTRc,​ ​trade-related​ ​services​ ​and​ ​a​ ​Reputation​ ​Bank.
The proposal for partnering with B2B marketplaces is based on one of the examples of the
transformation strategy of the leading european DIY chain – Kingfisher. It's proposed that largest
construction​ ​supply​ ​chains​ ​undergo​ ​the​ ​same​ ​issues​ ​and​ ​face​ ​similar​ ​challenges.

18

Extra​​
use​​cases
A value ecosystem will be built around the MTRc and ModulTrade’s blockchain-based
platform, enabling third parties to connect and integrate their own fintech solutions into
it,​ ​thus​ ​dramatically​ ​reducing​ ​their​ ​development​ ​and​ ​customer​ ​acquisition​ ​costs.
Examples of possible use cases include DTAM (i.e. a blockchain-based Digital Thread for Additive
Manufacturing underpinning all the transactions occurring throughout the digital and physical
life cycle for additive manufacturing), trade finance solutions based on IoT-generated data,
supply​ ​chain​ ​digital​ ​tracking​ ​and​ ​food​ ​safety.

Digital​​
Thread​​for​​Additive​​Manufacturing​​
(DTAM)​​
on​​
MTP
Currently, organizations are looking to Additive Manufacturing (​AM​) in order to respond to their
supply chain and manufacturing constraints. However, for AM processes to scale at the industrial
level, a series of complex, connected, and data-driven events need to occur. A possible solution
would be to build a digital thread of the AM process (​DTAM​), a single seamless strand of data
that stretches from the initial design to the finished part, to optimize AM production capability,
driving insights for continuous process and product optimization. Such a solution could be
supported by ModulTrade’s platform, which could easily fulfill the purposes of validating data for
traceability and certification, protecting intellectual property assets and design files throughout
all​ ​the​ ​phases​ ​of​ ​the​ ​AM​ ​process,​ ​which​ ​are:
● inception​ ​design​ ​&​ ​analysis​ ​of​ ​the​ ​digital​ ​model;
● building & monitoring (build simulation, part fabrication and per-part post-processing
and​ ​finishing);
● test​ ​&​ ​validation​ ​(part​ ​inspection,​ ​data​ ​verification​ ​&​ ​twining);​ ​&
● delivery​ ​and​ ​management.
The DTAM service would be charged by ModulTrade as a fee in MTRc to the buyers of goods
requiring the DTAM certification. The fees would then be accredited to the third party developer,
minus​ ​a​ ​commission​ ​for​ ​the​ ​use​ ​of​ ​ModulTrade’s​ ​platform.

An​​
IoT​​
solution​​for​​invoice​​factoring​​
on​​
MTP
ModulTrade’s platform could enable the exchange in real time of IoT data related to the physical
status of a commodity or a good between buyers, suppliers and other parties throughout the
value chain. In this case, the blockchain-based platform could help infuse trust into the data
exchange, ensuring the authenticity of the exchanged data, and it could also provide an audit
trail,​ ​facilitating​ ​the​ ​resolution​ ​of​ ​disputes​ ​that​ ​may​ ​arise​ ​much​ ​more​ ​efficiently.
For instance, a third party could develop on ModulTrade’s platform an IoT-based invoice
factoring​ ​solution​ ​aimed​ ​at​ ​determining​ ​whether​ ​the​ ​funds​ ​for​ ​a​ ​transaction​ ​should​ ​be​ ​released.
In the front end, the solution could take the shape of an extension and be integrated in
ModulTrade’s platform. In this way, sellers on ModulTrade platform could conveniently select the
most appropriate invoice financing and insurance options, simulating in advance their economic
effects​ ​under​ ​several​ ​scenarios.
In the proposed example, the IoT invoice financing service would be charged by ModulTrade as a
fee in MTRc to the factoring and/or insurance company upon the seller’s request of such
services. The fees would then be accredited to the third party developer, minus a commission
for​ ​the​ ​use​ ​of​ ​ModulTrade’s​ ​platform.

Roadmap
Modultrade is the result of a team collaboration. The 4 MIT team mate founders decided to
move forward on the original idea of trade finance. This decision gave birth to Modultrade in
April 2017. In the meantime, a team of talented and highly skilled professionals joined the
startup and contributed, with the founders, in shaping the vision and putting together founding
documents​ ​and​ ​prototype​ ​to​ ​move​ ​ahead​ ​with​ ​the​ ​idea.

23

Governance​​&​​Safeguarding
The ModulTrade team takes the safeguarding of all participant contributions seriously and has
taken the following steps in order to ensure the best possible governance of its Token Sale and
business​ ​going​ ​forward.

Professional​​Consulting​​and​​
Legal​​
support​​
of​​
the​​
Token​​
sale
From the outset, ModulTrade engaged ​Ramparts European Law Firm, an independent law
firm based in Gibraltar and ITIRIV, consultants in The Token Sale space in order to ensure
that​ ​the​ ​concept​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Token​ ​Sale​ ​was​ ​performed​ ​under​ ​the​ ​best​ ​possible​ ​governance.

An audit of the Token sale process by independent audit organization will be
carried out prior to the Token sale. This independent audit organization will also review
the​ ​ ​process​ ​during​ ​the​ ​Token​ ​sale​ ​and​ ​validate​ ​it.
An independent supervisor will be appointed to validate that development
expenses linked to Token sale funds ​are in line with the plan​. The quarterly reporting
issued on Modultrade.com will include a status on expenses based on Token sale funds
and​ ​a​ ​status​ ​on​ ​technical​ ​and​ ​geographical​ ​Modultrade​ ​development.

MTRc

No​​more​​MTRc​​token​​will​​be​​created​​after​​Token​​sale.
An MTRc committee will analyze the MTRc utilization and will provide
recommendations to the community for further MTRc development​. As the MTRc is
needed​ ​to​ ​trade​ ​on​ ​MT​ ​platform,​ ​its​ ​usage​ ​on​ ​the​ ​platform​ ​will​ ​be​ ​closely​ ​monitored.
A ​quarterly reporting on MTRc rate and MTRc utilization will be published on MT

Jurisdiction​​&​​The​​Gibraltar​​Token​​
Sale​​
Company​​
(TSC)
Working with Ramparts European Law Firm ModulTrade team has determined that Gibraltar is
the ideal jurisdiction for it’s Token Sale. Gibraltar was selected due to its international reputation
as a rock solid place in order to protect the funds of both participants and Token Sale
distributors in addition to the jurisdictions’ progressive stance on cryptocurrency and its
regulation​ ​(Gibraltar​ ​plans​ ​to​ ​regulate​ ​Distributable​ ​Ledger​ ​Technology​ ​as​ ​of​ ​1​ ​January​ ​2018)
ModulTrade has formed a special purpose vehicle for the purpose of the token sale - The Token
Sale​ ​Company​ ​(TSC)​ ​ ​which​ ​will​ ​be​ ​the​ ​holder​ ​of​ ​the​ ​funds​ ​raised​ ​in​ ​pre-sale​ ​and​ ​Token​ ​sale.

Multi​​
Signature​​Wallet
Participants in The MTRc token sale will send their funds to a secure, audited multi signature
wallet, which shall be controlled by a suitably qualified entity that shall ensure that funds are
only​ ​drawn​ ​down​ ​in​ ​accordance​ ​with​ ​the​ ​procedure​ ​agreed​ ​prior​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Token​ ​sale.

Cyber​​
Security
The ModulTrade Token Sale Page and all other pages owned by ModulTrade or its partner

Conclusion
The blockchain has laid the foundations for disrupting the trade finance industry, streamlining a
daunting process and providing MSMEs access to global trade in an easier and trustful way.
ModulTrade is seizing this opportunity by ​eliminating the traditional barriers for entry in the
global​ ​trade​​ w
​ ith​ ​the​ ​creation​ ​of​ ​a​ ​value​ ​ecosystem​.
Leveraging​ ​on​ ​a​ ​smart-contract​ ​blockchain-based​ ​B2B​ ​multi-sided​ ​platform​ ​(MSP):
● 400 mln micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) will be able to meet, commit and
execute trade globally easily, trustfully and efficiently, thus increasing their revenues and
reducing​ ​the​ ​costs​ ​of​ ​global​ ​trading;
● third-party developers / service providers will be able to gain access to a wide target of
users​ ​/​ ​clients,​ ​while​ ​reducing​ ​development​ ​and​ ​user​ ​acquisition​ ​costs.
One of the key elements of the new MSP is the ModulTrade Crypto Token (MTRc), a token
based on Ethereum, which will be used as a key for the users to connect to the global trade
network​ ​and​ ​to​ ​transact​ ​in​ ​the​ ​ModulTrade’s​ ​Value​ ​Ecosystem​ ​(MVE).​​ ​The​ ​MTRc​ ​will:
● enable​ ​its​ ​participants​ ​to​ ​exchange​ ​value​ ​real-time,​ ​globally​ ​and​ ​in​ ​a​ ​cost-effective​ ​way;
● help support third parties’ applications, thus releasing the full potential of MVE and
ultimately​ ​democratizing​ ​global​ ​commerce.
ModulTrade will contribute to the growth of this value ecosystem by acting as a fully
integrated end-to-end B2B marketplace, by increasing the presence of third-party
developers and service providers and by reaching a critical mass of users for the most
relevant​ ​market​ ​segments​.
ModulTrade aspires to access a huge potential market (400m MSMEs & ≈$6.7 Tn turnover
by​ ​2020)​ ​through​ ​the​ ​network​ ​and​ ​technology,​ ​which​ ​will​ ​help​ ​to​ ​reinvent​ ​the​ ​global​ ​trade.
● MSMEs will find new and easy ways to transfer goods and services, reshaping their value
chains, thus increasing revenues and saving time, transaction costs, replacement costs
and​ ​the​ ​cost​ ​of​ ​risk​ ​in​ ​an​ ​unprecedented​ ​way.
● When​ ​adopted​ ​the​ ​MTRc​ ​will​ ​serve​ ​the​ ​unbanked​ ​in​ ​the​ ​emerging​ ​markets.

Joining​ ​ModulTrade​ ​and​ ​the​ ​MTRc​ ​will
democratize​ ​global​ ​trade!
