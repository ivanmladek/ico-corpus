1. Abstract
Insurance is an essential part of the finance system and a huge market in every economy. However,
issues like stereotype policies, lack of efficiency and lack of transparency are still seriously impeding
the development of insurance. All these issues are in dire need to be addressed.
Insurance and blockchain have natural consistency in essence. The fundamental purpose of
insurance is to transfer risks and it is featured with sociality, uniqueness, security and long-time
existence. Blockchain, on the other hand, is based on consensus of P2P networks with features like
traceable, immutable, unforgeable and timestamps. So insurance and blockchain are highly
compatible with each other. We believe blockchain will become an essential part of insurance and
disrupt the industry completely in the future.
On basis of this belief, we are going to build a blockchain ecosystem for insurance and it is going to
be named – InsurChain. InsurChain includes InsurChain Blockchain, InsurChain applications
(SelfGuard, BizGuard and PalsGuard) and open interface to allow every use to design, purchase,
invest insurance and file claims which can be automatically processed. In InsurChain, no
intermediaries are needed, every step is pre-programed based on certain rules and the ecosystem
can be fully operating on its own. This will be a brand new insurance blockchain ecosystem.
Founding members of InsurChain have ample experience in insurance operating and investing with
deep understanding of the industry. We are also enthusiasts of blockchain who believe blockchain
will re-shape the old industry in the near future and we will be in the front seat to see it coming.

2. Insurance Market
2.1 Potentials
Insurance is a huge yet fast growing industry with unlimited market potentials. Global premium
income is 4.8 trillion USD.
With the development of economy, insurance demands are growing rapidly all over the world.
According to Global insurance review 2017, and outlook in 2018 from Swiss Re, the world economy
will grow on a steady rate in 2018 and so will insurance premium. Global non-life premium will
grow at 2.2% and 3.0% 2017 and 2018 respectively. Global life premium will grow 4.8% and 4.2%
in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Emerging markets, especially those in Asia, will be the boost for
premium growth. Premium income in China reached 2.31 trillion RMB (360 million USD) in the first
half of 2017, a 23% increase compared with the same time last year.

2.2 Challenges
Although insurance is still developing rapidly on a global scale, its development has encountered
numerous challenges. The major challenges insurance are facing are as follows:
A) Too many intermediaries. Traditional insurance is highly reliant on intermediaries. Most of the
premium has been used to cover channel cost and customers couldn’t be properly insured.
B) Lack of data protection. Insurers are in possess of huge amount of customer data including
private data such as policy information, family members and phone number. Insurers are not
serious on protecting customers’ privacy and caused customers troubles.
C) Misleading in marketing. Insurance agents or salesmen are lying or withholding information
when trying to convince consumers to buy their policy. This has damaged the rights of consumers
as well as the reputation of insurance.
D) Lack of innovation. Most of the policies insurers offering are similar in every aspect. It can
address certain problems consumers are facing, but it can’t suit all personalized demands.
E) Moral hazard. Will consumers be less careful when they know they can get covered? Probably
yes, and it placed insurers in a difficult position. Moral hazard brings losses to insurers while brings
no benefit for consumers.

2.3 Opportunities
All these challenges can be addressed with the help of blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed ledger
technology with features such as transparency, immutability and unforgeability. All these features
are perfectly matching the nature of insurance. By leveraging blockchain, insurers will be able to
collect consumers’ data on chains rather than asking them to provide materials repeatedly, smart
contract can replace human labor in claims and all the fraudulent behaviors can be prevented. All

the transactions on blockchain will be immutably recorded and traceable, so it can help insurers to
accurately profile each customer and offer personalized pricings.
Blockchain will be the underlying technology for the next-generation insurance and the engine to
boost insurance development. Blockchain-based insurance will be a vital part of the industry and
maybe even redefine insurance.
We are planning to build a blockchain-based insurance ecosystem, where every user can design,
purchase and invest in insurance. This ecosystem will be able to satisfy customer needs, reward
those who contribute ideas and innovations, and eliminate intermediaries in traditional insurance,
lowering operation costs. Take health policy as an example, InsurChain ecosystem can save up to
70% cost for insurers.

3. Solutions
3.1. Products and processes
We will build a decentralized, peer to peer insurance marketplace based on InsurChain platform
and keep it functioning properly by making a series of rules.

Innovations InsurChain will provide include:
A) Users can directly purchase insurance products designed by professionals and insurers by
spending InsurChain tokens. They can also post their own personalized demands in the system
with a certain token cost.
B) When a new demand releases, InsurChain system will match it with underwriter(s).
Underwriter(s) can be insurers or investors.
C) Users pay with tokens and underwriter also pays certain number of tokens as margin. And an
electronic policy will be signed with smart contract.
D) When an agreed event triggers a claim, the smart contract will automatically process payment
and reimbursement.
E) If either party has doubts regarding to the result, a voting process will be automatically
launched and the disputes will be settled through a poll.

3.2. Structures and features

A) Policy design
Everyone on the InsurChain platform can issue an insurance policy. Ordinary users can do this by
filling out a pre-set form. For advanced users, such as actuaries, they will have higher authority to
design a more complicated policy. InsurChain will launch a tool to test every new product and make

sure it is applicable and compliant.
B) Policy rating
We will record all the data of each policy on InsurChain, including policy details, sales and claims
and all the data is immutable. And we will design a rating system to rate each policy from various
angles and conditions. So, consumers will be able to find the most suitable one.
And the rating is dynamic, changing from time to time based on customer feedbacks.
C) Distribution
All the policies on InsurChain is signed through smart contract. It is safe, verifiable and can be
launched by anyone. All the trades are encrypted and happen in real time. Third party platforms
can help with the distribution of each policy and when they successfully distributed a policy, they
will be rewarded with InsurChainCoin tokens.
D) Claims
Simple claims can be settle with the help of smart contract. InsurChain will introduce third party
adjusters to handle more complicated claims. Users will be able to upload relevant materials for
his claims and the materials will be cross checked and recorded on the chain.
E) A voting system
InsurChain will introduce a voting system in the future. The voting system is designed to resolve
disputes in claims. If either policyholder or underwriter is unsatisfied with a smart contract
settlement, they can spend InsurChainCoin tokens to file a vote. The vote will invite credible users
to make the vote. Algorithm will make sure those with most credible behaviors will be invited.

4. Applications
Insurance will be covering every moment of people’s life and so will InsurChain providing services
for every scenario. For now, we have made plans to develop three applications and they are
BizGuard, SelfGuard and PalsGuard. All the developers around the world are welcome to join in
the InsurChain ecosystem and deliver more apps for users.

4.1. BizGuard – smart contract based insurance solution for enterprises
BizGuard will be the first application of InsurChain.
Scenario-based on-demand insurance has been gaining popularity in recent years. It usually
works this way, a company needs a customized insurance solution to cover a specific business
scenario, and an on-demand InsurTech startup will collect data from them and find out the
insurance demand that has not been satisfied by insurers. Then, the startup will design a
customized solution to address this demand and seek underwriting from insurers. This approach
has helped to improve the experience of on-demand insurance, but it is still not simple enough.

Actually, most of the scenario-based insurance can be put in the form of a smart contract. And
that is what BizGuard will achieve.
Take house sharing business as an example, Companies like Airbnb can launch an accident policy
on InsurChain, all terms will be predetermined into a smart contract. If an accident occurs, tenant
can upload photos of the scene and a qualified third party will exam them and process claims.
The timestamps on the chain can be used to verify the validity of accidents.

4.2. PalsGuard – insurance solution for communities
PalsGuard works in P2P insurance models, just like Friendsurance from Germany. We will build a
community to let people with same demands to share risks and it will cover property, liability and
health demands.
The essential part of PalsGuard is to build a trust-based community. The best way to do it is to build
it among friends and relatives. Everyone in the community shall pay a certain tokens as premium.
The premium will be divided into two parts, one is to purchase cover from insurers, and the other
will be used as a cover pool. Small claims will be paid from the cover pool and when the cover pool
runs out, insurers will provide coverage. The remaining tokens in the cover pool will be returned
to every community member.
The traditional P2P insurance still requires a centralized management and it may bring risks. In
PalsGuard, we will build a decentralized P2P community and make the cover pool more secure.
With the help of smart contract, we can also achieve automatic claim payment.

4.3. SelfGuard – marketplace for personalized insurance

As InsurChain ecosystem evolves, we will launch a marketplace for personalized insurance to
satisfy individual insurance demands. Users can post their own needs, no matter in structured
form or unstructured form. Insurers on the chain will provide an estimation of the demand,
including prices, expected profits and potential risks. Then every service provider on the chain
can bid to become the underwriter for this demand. When a deal is made between user with
needs and underwriter, InsurChain will record the deal and provide a smart contract to bind the
deal. Insurers can also be an authoritative third party judge and provide opinions when disputes
happen.

For example, meteorological index insurance is a policy that reimburses policyholders when a
certain meteorological parameter, such as temperature, rainfall and snowfall. It is easy to
implement, but insurers usually don’t want to spend too many resources for this kind of policy.
However, SelfGuard can implement this policy on InsurChain and satisfy the needs for such
policies. Users can spend InsurChainCoin tokens to purchase meteorological index policies such
as high temperature insurance, smart contract oracles will monitor official temperature releases
and when the predetermined temperature is reached, the claim will be automatically paid.

4.4. Blockchain-based insurance cards

Insurance card is an invention on InsurChain, all the transactions can be traced on the chain and
customers can use blockchain-based insurance cards to exchange policies. Therefore, everyone
can be a distribution channel of a certain policy.
For example, insurers can put a flight policy on InsurChain, anyone who has purchased it can send
it to other users on chain as a gift or at a certain price. Since all the transactions are recorded,
when a claim is filed, insurers can easily verify the validity of the policy and process the claim
payment quickly.

4.5. Insurance blockchain points

Traditionally, insurers will issue bonus points when customer sign a new policy or renewal. Those
bonus points can be used to buy things in their own platform or from a cooperated third party
platform. However, most of the bonus points can only be used in a certain insurer’s platform.
InsurChain has designed a solution to solve this issue and make bonus points from different
insurers exchangeable, therefore improving the liquidity of bonus points.
For example, an insurer wants to attract customers by offering bonus points, but they don’t have
enough manpower to operate online markets, they can register on InsurChain and make their
bonus points exchangeable with points from other insurers which can be used in many ecommercial stores. So, this insurer can attract more customers without extra cost to build an
online markets.

5. Technical Structures
5.1. Basics
We will become the service provider of a business-level blockchain infrastructure and develop a
series of blockchain-related products and services. On one hand, we will build an enterprise-level
blockchain platform, on the other hand, we will develop high-scalable applications along with
users.
Technical details will be released in technical whitepaper in the recent future.

5.2. BaaS platform
We will develop a BaaS platform which will be a major advantage over other blockchain projects.
BaaS is going to modularize each process of the blockchain system, including blockchain system,
operating system and underlying hardware. User can participate in developing as well.

5.3 Application structure

6. InsurChainCoin
6.1. Purpose
InsurChainCoin(INSUR) is the crypto token within the InsurChain system. Users can spend a certain
number of InsurChainCoins to get InsurChain services and products. The rate will be determined
and charged by block recorder.
Other than that, InsurChainCoin is also a digital asset for users. They can spend it in claims,
distribution and voting to get a better service. For example, when an insurers want to promote its
policies, they can offer InsurChainCoin as reward for distribution channels.
InsurChainCoin’s functions will be increasingly enriched when the whole InsurChain system grows.
InsurChain team will raise Ethereum and spend the Ethereum on the development, marketing and
global operation of InsurChain. In early stages we will generate InsurChainCoin based on ERC20
protocol and put them into application. When the InsurChain blockchain is developed, we will
migrate the whole system to our public blockchain.

6.2. Distribution of InsurChainCoin
We will issue 20 billion InsurChainCoin tokens. And the distribution plan is as follows:
8 billion InsurChainCoin tokens (40%) for investors;
2 billion InsurChainCoin tokens (10%) for cornerstone investors;
3 billion InsurChainCoin tokens (15%) for operation funds to support the community;
3 billion InsurChainCoin tokens (15%) for developers of InsurChain as rewards;
4 billion InsurChainCoin tokens (20%) for founding and developing team.

6.3. Administration of InsurChainCoin
Operation funds of InsurChain will be administered by a financial management team from
InsurChain team. The financial management team will be in charge of operation expense and
crypto currency management.
Operation expenses include salaries, travel expenses, rents and daily expenses.
Crypto currency management includes wallet management, transfers and exchange of digital
assets.

7. Ecosystem
7.1. Global Ecosystem Development Initiative
We will build an International team to operate both in China and overseas. The initiative will
encourage blockchain enthusiasts and developers to participate in InsurChain and work together
to boost its development. Those who have made remarkable contributions to InsurChain will be
rewarded with InsurChainCoin.

7.2. Synergetic development of insurance industry
Operation funds will continuously encouraging industry partners to join and operate in
InsurChain ecosystem. When InsurChain is filled with outstanding developers, major insurers and
high quality users, we believe this decentralized network can help make insurance great once
again.
In this ecosystem, everyone in the insurance can find its place. No matter it is insurers, users,
data providers or other third party service providers.

8. Governance

distribution and claims will be put in action.

11. Risk disclosure and disclaimer
11.1 Risk disclosure
Systematic risk
Systematic risk means those might cause fluctuations to all global markets. For example, policy
risks, the regulations on blockchain projects and financings are not clear in most countries. So there
is a chance investors and participants of the program being impacted by new regulations.
The blockchain markets also has potential risks. The digital assets may have been overvalued,
investors may lose money or miss their expectations.
Systematic risks also include force majeure such as natural catastrophes, cyber-attacks and political
turbulences.
Compliance risks
Digital assets have experienced and will continue to experience drastic fluctuations. Individual
investors may suffer significant losses due to lack of experience. And since there is no regulation
on this yet, investors may need to bear this risk.
Regulation risks
InsurChain is aiming to connect every one globally with insurance. However, since insurance
regulations are different from country to country, the project might encounter hindrance in some
areas. InsurChain will do its best to cooperate with local authorities, but the risks shall be
recognized.
Competition risks
With an increasing number of players entering blockchain, the market is getting competitive.
InsurChain need to stay the best to survive this competition. But the trend of future competition
is still unclear.
Team risks
InsurChain team is comprised of senior investors, insurance officers and developers. Stability of the
team is the cornerstone for InsurChain development. If a core staff leaves the team, it may impede
the development of InsurChain.
Security risks

Cryptocurrencies is an anonymous digital asset. It can be attacked by hackers, be used in money
laundering and be involved in criminal activities. InsurChain may face uncertainties in the future.
Investors should be fully aware of that before participating.
