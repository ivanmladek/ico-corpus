1. ABSTRACT
LALA means being happy and that is truly what we want to achieve – financial
freedom, financial happiness, and financial accessibility to over 2 billion
unbanked and underserved.
The migrant and their unbanked families in emerging and frontier markets have been
suppressed for the longest time without any access to basic services, financial or
otherwise. About 2.4 billion poor people worldwide are often excluded from free
movement, basic rights which often leads them to corruption, crime, including slavery,
human trafficking and in extreme cases, death.
Banks, financial institutions and even local financiers do not participate in these markets
because they are not able to adequately assess price risks. Lack of reliable identification
systems, financial data, unreliable intermediaries, zero credit history and unpredictable
legal systems further limit the capital available for financial inclusion at grassroots. This
uncertainty and severely limited access to financing and other financial products
cripples’ individuals, micro entrepreneurs, small businesses, stymies growth and
entrenches poverty. LALA World is all set to change that.
For decades, the current financial system has been controlled and centralised.
Numerous attempts to create a central clearing system like SWIFT, CHIPS, various
clearing houses, for domestic and international payments systems etc. are largely
contractual arrangements between two parties with greater influence by geopolitical
factors.

blockchain space continues to
take place at a faster pace than ever before. Several corporate, governments and
developers are working on different aspects to improve this technology but there are
three major aspects of Blockchain being implemented over the next few months which
we believe will work wonders for LALA World and the unbanked. These are:
1. True and immune decentralization: Most people on the planet do not have the
capability to own large computers, servers or any of the existing sophisticated
machinery to operate a node in the system, but they do have smartphones.With
decentralised projects and beginnings of Atomic Swaps, this could truly create a
decentralised world in the coming years and decades.

2. Scalability and efﬁciency on-Chain: These two go hand in
hand. Scalability needs to have a throughput of millions of
transactions per second, on-chain. And the efficiency must be
increased by a factor of 80 to 90 in order to be considered
disruptive while run secure by design. Many solutions are
being proposed which will further help our cause.

3. Privacy, open and unrestricted access: People work for
their money and must have full, uncensored and unrestricted
access to their own money. Banks, capital markets and the
centralised controls continue to suppress the unbanked. LALA
is creating that ecosystem to truly revolutionise the way peer
to peer markets works for this population

With over 2 billion people suffering for so long, financial inclusion is the top agenda
everywhere today: financial institutions, governments, central banks, NGOs, large
corporations, and technology companies. So far, various solutions have been tried and
tested, with or without the involvement of banks, attaining some levels of success.
According to the World Bank, 700 million of the previously unbanked became account
holders from 2011 to 2014. However, 2 billion adults globally still remain without an
account with a bank or even with an authorized non-bank service provider.

BLOCKCHAIN + FINANCIAL INCLUSION = LALA WORLD ECOSYSTEM

2. INTRODUCTION TO LALA WORLD
LALA World is an Ecosystem of real life partnerships with governments, NGO’s, local
communities and an integration of biometrics, blockchain and distributed ledger
technology that aims towards financial inclusion.
LALA World (“LALA”) is a wholesome ecosystem for the unbanked, starting with the
migrants and their families back home. The ecosystem not only revolves around
financial inclusion, but also bringing together communities at grassroots level, solving
real life issues faced by this population and using the most advanced technology to
bring everyone together.

The base of this Ecosystem is the LALA Wallet platform. By creating a whole new peer to
peer infrastructure, LALA aims to revolutionize the way individuals, small businesses and
micro entrepreneurs transact, make domestic and cross border payments, borrow
money and associated products like insurances, cards, wealth and other general
banking products.
The key to LALA’s success is in its experienced team and their global network and
partnerships. We believe it is all about execution in the end. With relevant experience
running such projects, monumental partnerships already in place, great technology
team behind us and ground level support, we believe we are blessed to have all come
together for LALA.
To accomplish this herculean task, we need partners. We are aware of our migrant and
network strength, but also at the same time, aware of our weaknesses. We cannot build
everything alone. Therefore, LALA has struck various partnerships across Asia, Africa,
Middle East and CIS. That means real customers, real people and use cases. A fiat
prototype is being tested across users in Malaysia and India. This will provide us with
valuable feedback and make the system more robust. An Ethereum and Hyperledger
based domestic and cross border financial system (LALA Transfer) Proof of Concept
(PoC) as well as a peer to peer lending platform (LALA Lends) is being developed by our
highly qualified blockchain developers. That should be complete just before LALA
Tokens hit the exchanges.

The current financial system is broken for this suppressed population. Several papers,
articles and theories have been written on this. It has been a herculean task to bring them
into the mainstream. From a controlled and centralised financial system, LALA is truly
bringing a whole new ecosystem (financial and grassroots community levels) to
eliminate the need for intermediaries which drastically reduces costs and creates
efficiencies. Storing transactions on Blockchain eliminates complicated procedures and
clearinghouses, saving time, money and the risk of error. The allowance of frictionless
savings and investments gives people more control over their financial destiny. LALA
uses Smart Contracts embedded into transactions that further simplify complex
procurement, negotiation and verification processes.

“We’re going to focus on accelerating investments in human capital, in health, education, social protection, so that Africa can prepare itself for the next phase in economic development,” – Jim Yong Kim, President World Bank

THE UNDERSERVED & UNBANKED
For more than 2 billion individuals without a
bank account, LALA World provides immediate
access to microfinancing services and cheap,
global remittance services

TOURISTS AND EXPATS
Insteads of obtaining traveler checks, or
paying excessive conversion fees, visitors
in foreign countries can buy and use any
currency, anywhere in the world

MIGRANT WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES
LALA World provides the fastest, cheapest, and
easiest way for migrant workers to send
money home and sustain their families

AID ORGANIZATIONS, NGOS AND GOVERNMENTS
By streamlining, LALA World allows for the easy
and publicly auditable distribution of funds to
developing countries

1. LALA WALLET
LALA Wallet is your single point access to all financial services in the LALA World
ecosystem. You have multiple top up and cash out options, hold fiat or multiple
cryptocurrencies, with a host of financial services like money transfer, lending, bill
payments, cards and other normal banking products at your fingertips. LALA Wallet also
allows you to share your micro projects globally, allows you to raise issues which are
suppressing the unbanked and build your own communities, thereby creating a true
Ecosystem benefiting everyone.
Topup options

When you download for the first time, one of the most secure multi-currency wallets is
automatically created, which the user can then fund with fiat or cryptocurrencies. We are
also working with various banks and payment processors across geographies to
enhance the acceptance globally.
Central to this Wallet platform will be our LALA Tokens that will allow seamless transfers
and payments for various transactions and services. LALA Wallet also includes an API for
third-party developers so they can interact with the Wallet, access balances, send
transactions, invoices, and build other third-party applications on top. This will further
enhance the LALA Wallet acceptability and usage. Third Party API business model will
create more partners who can distribute LALA Services globally to strengthen this
network.
The user can conveniently convert a wide range of Blockchain assets such as LALA, BTC,
ETH and DASH by simply using his LALA Wallet which has an inbuilt exchange
mechanism. If the user is not crypto savvy, they can also choose to store the currency in
local Fiat and not use crypto at all, giving ultimate freedom to the user and truly bridging
the old world to the new.
The more you use your LALA Wallet, the more you are rewarded economically, not only
by cheaper transactions, but also via LALA Tokens for activities like sending new
remittances, topping up user’s balances, or cashing out other users balances at other
ends, along with number of other LALA referral products and services as described
below.

For mass acceptance of LALA Wallet, we have teamed up with various employers,
NGO’s, contractors, support groups who bring these migrants to new countries. Along
with their initial training, we will be conducting LALA Camps not only to educate them
about new countries, but also adapt to their new LALA Wallet and how it can help them
in a strange new country. Newer ways of interacting between themselves, support
groups and any other issues they face can be all reached out via one single platform
- LALA Wallet
2. LALA ID – One Global ID, on Blockchain and under your control

“Digital Identity is a must for the millions of migrant labour
population that visits through our platform every year and we
are excited to take the first step with LALA for a truly global
experience”
- Dato Ratha Vellai, Bestinet Sdn Bhd
Malaysia

Premise of your LALA Wallet starts by creating a single digital identity that you can carry
globally – LALA ID. The team at LALA had a vision – to provide a digital identity to every
person on the planet, starting with migrants and their unbanked families. We are also
certain that if we have to create a truly global ecosystem, then we need a base
identification system that is far superior than existing ID systems. That should be global
in nature, but yet secure, private and available on demand.
This unbanked population is often excluded from basic rights like property ownership,
banking accounts and any social protection just because they don’t have rights identity
documents. Proof of identity is where it all starts.
LALA World and its partners have worked tirelessly to build a single global identity
system which includes KYC/AML, biometrics, verification, digitisation of records, cards,
national ID systems etc. This protects your security on blockchain and gives you freedom
to conduct various financial services, all in one single Wallet. Primarily, your single LALA
ID will be able to consolidate all physical and digital identity into a single secure &
private ambient identity, pointing to a secure trusted dataset about the individual,
thereby enabling easily individualised interactions in the physical and digital world
across multiple vertical applications and compliment existing identity solutions.
Eventually LALA ID and its association with partners globally becomes your one single
access point at various multiple applications and physical locations. The prototype and
MVP are in place already and being tested at various locations.

There are also immediate cash incentives in LALA Tokens via referral programs, KYC
/AML updates, transaction volumes not only for users but for all “Partners” in the
ecosystem like money transfer operators (MTO), agents, franchises, LALA Force (own
employees), contractors, vendors suppliers etc. LALA Tokens continue to increase in
value and strength as 20% of NET transaction fees is used to buyback LALA Tokens
thereby providing upward pressure on the price creating a positive feedback loop
between network expansion and Token value.
LALA World and its Partners facilitate deposits and withdrawals in fiat as well as other
cryptocurrencies. Partners get their own dashboards including transactional analytics,
customer historical information, KYC data and top up functionality which will facilitate the
advent of LALA Franchise.
Migrant labour market, is our strength and a classic example of the suppressed and
unbanked population. With about US$500 million flowing through South East Asia alone,
every year, this population is exploited. With lack of banking facilities, working in a
strange new country and culture, high exchange fees, number of intermediaries and
brokers, no insurance, etc. they have been suppressed at every junction.
At LALA World, our vision is to uplift these people. This is simply what is driving us today
to achieve this global task of bridging the numerous problems they face with diversified
solutions using technology and our networks.

A SELF SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEM HAS TO BE CREATED. JUST TECHNOLOGY,
SOFTWARE, FINANCIAL SERVICES CANNOT SERVE THIS PURPOSE, THERE HAS TO
BE A NETWORK EFFECT.

LALA Transfer is all about changing that with very little fee on transfers. We are in
discussion with various partners – governments, employment agencies, transfer agents,
remittance services etc. to empower these migrants with LALA Wallets even before they
board the plane. More detailed roadmap and partnerships are in following sections. We
are in several discussions and are connected with multiple banks, for liquidity and low
spreads.
As a part of LALA Transfer, our technology team is also working on an internal order book
system on Blockchain that will allow us to match cross border remittances flowing from
one country to another. A truly, secure, decentralised order matching where one could
transfer money at domestic rates and at negligible costs. A true disruption focussing on
not only the unbanked and migrant community but a service that all of us can use
anytime, anywhere.
4. LALA LENDS
Peer to peer and micro-lending has been on a steep rise over the last five years. But if
one looks around, its primarily the developed nations and companies who have blossomed into unicorns while the industry has promised to eliminate poverty, offering
low-barrier loans to those historically unbanked financially.
So-called “bottom-of-the-pyramid” solutions have led to strategies that many claim
simply do not work and actually make poverty worse. This is where the Ecosystem
approach comes handy. LALA team has extensive experience of mitigating this. LALA
World supports individuals and small and medium sized businesses by offering them
1. Micro loans, backed by LALA Token investors (and investors are rewarded). We are
also working with some large funds & government partnerships to provide us
underwriting capability to fund some loans
2. P2P loans inside the LALA Wallet from LALA Community – both in Fiat as well as
Crypto

CRYPTO ASSET BACKED LOANS

• Get immediate Cash against your Crypto assets
• No need to sell them
• Competitive interest rates
• Prepayment penalties
• Get it back when you want
INSTALLMENT BASED CRYPTO BUYING - EMI

• Your choice of Crypto asset to buy

P2P LENDING FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES

• LALA ID generates LALA Score for users
• Working on decentralised credit scoring
• Powered by smart contracts & IPFS
• Peer to Peer lending
• Peer to Peer Credit Vouching ( Like
guarantees without guarantors)

Most of the problems in micro
lending arises due to mistrust and
corruption. Also, to operate in
these remote areas, one needs
large overhead and operating
costs, slow movement of funds due
to centralisation.
By lowering the costs of cash
transfer and doing business,
blockchain could solve some of
the
main
problems
with
microlending, allowing the new
financial inclusion industry to
blossom and start lifting people
out of poverty at a world-changing
rate.

MICRO LENDING FOR SMALL COMMUNITY PROJECTS

• Competitive interest rates
• No collateral
• Immediate cash for predetermined time period

5. LALA CARD
Within the LALA Wallet, user can choose to order a LALA Card, a virtual and/or physical
debit (and in time to come credit card). As a security measure, we allow a user to lock and
unlock his card through the LALA Wallet App. Furthermore, the user can also set limits for
his family members and sync all the cards to the same Wallet. This makes our system
more secure than traditional credit and debit card systems.
Blockchain and LALA Tokens become very central to this as users can sync multiple
cards to the same LALA Wallet, which can then be used as both Fiat and Crypto medium
of exchange without incurring any high fees for such transfer at any time. Further, we will
also be coming up with a loyalty mechanism tied to the LALA Card, so that more you use
the wallet, the more you are rewarded as a LALA Token holder.
Not only are the fees, much cheaper than traditional
Wallets, but also payback rewards are massive, leading to
almost nil fee when used globally. Customers will be
allowed to top-up their LALA Card with ETH/BTC/LALA
Tokens, bank transfer, credit card, debit card or via a
pre-approved credit limit. Other third party partners
like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay will
be integrated in time to come.

6. LALA KIT
LALA has a unique proposition, especially for the unbanked areas where we have
already developed a MVP hardware Kit for greater penetration. This will also be sold at
at local corner stores, shops and partner locations in the future.
Software cannot solve all problems and hardware has to be a part to create a truly
globalised platform – Steve Jobs
LALA Kit is for everyone. A small business, grocery store, unbanked or a migrant labour.
Buy LALA Kit from your nearest store or partner locations and be plugged in to the
financial system instantaneously. No bank integrations, no filling of forms, no long
queues, just activate your ID and sync with the phone inside, start using, get paid,
receive money. LALA kit can also be pre-ordered online and delivered straight to you at
a very affordable cost. A migrant labour, for example, can even get LALA Kit before he
boards the plane from Bangladesh to Malaysia.
We are in discussion with several players to put this together. Initially we will have four
items in there –
1. A cheap android phone currently prices at
USD 50 (we are bringing this down via local
subsidies and local partnerships, advertising
revenue etc). The phone is ready and is being
arranged to be shipped to Malaysia
2. Embedded in the Kit, will be a SIM card
(already started in Malaysia & Bangladesh)
3. LALA Insurance on top of the existing “So
called” insurance we will be providing a real
insurance
4. Carrying unique QR codes.
5. In future we will also bring in a pre-synced
LALA Card, LALA PoS etc
7. OTHER LALA PRODUCTS
We are focussed and the vision of our management is very clear. Therefore we want to
start with products and partnerships that we have built with over a decade of experience.
We do not claim to know everything and clearly realise our strengths and weaknesses.
Also, there are things that are best left to experts who are good at doing that. Therefore,
we believe in stronger partnerships. We are good at creating this ecosystem, working
hard, willing to learn but as we expand and grow, we need partners. Please feel free to
reach out to us at hello@lalaworld.io if you would like to partner with us.
Above-mentioned products, in some shape or form are already being launched in
various jurisdictions. MOU’s and definitive agreements are being signed across Asia,
Africa and Middle East. Products like LALA Insurance, LALA Wealth, LALA ATM’s, LALA
Force, LALA Franchise etc are all planned after 12 months. Right now we are on track to
create a global Wallet for the unbanked. Roadmap and further plans are detailed in
sections below.

4. LALA TECHNOLOGY AND MVP
Blockchain is a really good, resilient system. The interesting thing about bitcoin is
since its inception, no one’s cracked it. Yet it’s completely in the open.

-Alex Batlin

To implement a seamless Blockchain technology, LALA team has been constantly
sticking to some core principles and the real pain it is trying to solve for the unbanked.
We have come to certain basic conclusions based on the geographies we intend to cover
and the products we want to offer. There are some rudimentary issues in financial
inclusion of these underprivileged populace that has to be solved by a mix of traditional
cash, existing agent networks and advanced but seamless technology.
Few key areas that we have considered while building the tech:
1. Cash is still the dominant medium of exchange in these areas
2. Third party intermediaries and brokers are expensive
3. Peer to Peer is the road we want to eventually take for all LALA products
4. Smart contracts can be used to automate and create trust between participants
5. Exchange of value should be fast and efficient
6. There has to be a medium for store of value as well
7. Most of this population do not understand crypto, how it works and think it is agnostic
1. DESIGN AND APPROACH
Most LALA Wallet users have smartphones but cannot afford expensive machines.
Blockchain is maturing and reaching to a stage where there is currently a need for a
single class, secure strong governance (decentralized) value exchange that uses
maximum distributed computing so it is efficient and scales to millions of transactions per
second when powered/powering billions of devices (single class of machines) while
maximizing security and minimizing transaction fees (to almost zero). To achieve this, we
are focussing on the following stack of technologies:

To achieve this, our base technology has to be very strong and we have studied various
Blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Hyperledger and Bitshares, To make LALA World
scalable we are looking at various off-chain solutions like raiden, Ethereum’s Lightning
Network and Plasma, but they are all still in nascent stages and still testing.
We have tested and used Bitshares in the past. It’s a great technology pegged to all 180+
countries via USD, but uses Graphene and Graphene was hard to stabilise and continued
freezing. For several other reasons we are staying clear for now.
At the moment a mix of Ethereum for ERC20 compliant LALA Token and Hyperledger
fabric for transactional basis, is the best Blockchain solution available to build LALA
World platform.
Copyright 2017 @ LALA WORLD PTE LTD
hello@lalaworld.io

16

Our MVP and PoC will be based on that primarily because Ethereum already has good
adaptation in the market, including exchanges and other corporations, will be released
before the ICO. Eventually we may opt for our own decentralised public Blockchain but
for now we are building ERC20 compliant LALA Token and also looking at ERC223 on
Ethereum main net.
However, we constantly track evolution of other blockchain platforms and technologies,
in case any other platform would provide higher smart contract flexibility or security for
peer to peer financial smart contracts and scalability, such platform could also be used.
Cross-Border Payment & Transfer Wallet - LALA Transfer Cross-border payment wallet
will utilize 2 Blockchains – Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. Once listed, LALA Token
exchange rate can be controlled by the market fundamentals of supply and demand but
with this LALA Token can be easily implemented into 3rd party exchanges supporting this
standard.
KYC will be handled by LALA ID systems and KYC data will be stored in Hyperledger and
decentralized storage. After KYC/AML is passed, users can transfer money from UAE to
India or for example from Malaysia to Bangladesh for negligible fee. Currency control
can be involved with API, to block any transaction in real time. Transactions will also be
checked against sanction lists and blocked if required.
Peer-2-Peer Internal Exchange - To minimize the exchange cost for the end users
Peer-2-Peer Internal Exchange will be implemented. Users top up their accounts and put
funds in a distributed escrow for secure trade orders. There will be BID and ASK order
books for certain trade pairs. When a user creates an order, his order is added to order
book on the blockchain and when another user who matches his trade order becomes
the market taker. Small system transaction fee can be applied. Exchange processed will
be handled by Blockchain and will be fully automated.
Peer-2-Peer Lending – LALA Lends P2P lending business logic will be based on Ethereum Smart Contracts and Hyperledger Fabric Chaincodes. Users will have profiles and
credit score in Hyperledger, more the user is involved the better credit score he gains.
User’s credit history is transparent and can be shared with others upon his approval or
can become public.
Lenders and borrowers can open new offers. The offer conditions are stored in a Smart
Contract. It includes name, interest rate, etc. These offers will make lending / borrow
order book – market makers. Lenders and borrowers can match the offers they like –
market takers. The same offer can be matched by one or multiple user. Borrowers can be
individuals or companies. Interest rate can be negotiable.
All transactions can happen over LALA Tokens as central currency and create value for
the network and the Token itself. Partnering with communities, governments, NGO’s and
corporate for CSR activities enhances the acceptance of LALA Token further as a single
Token to transact in the real world and not only just crypto exchanges.
A separate technical paper and its details will be available on the LALA World website
within this week.

2. DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP
We have a clear path to our vision and we have prepared a development roadmap for
our technology. Our team prefers a staged approach which means that each stage will
have its deliverables:
Stage 1. We are launching a basic version of LALA Wallet in Malaysia and India by first
week of November. An initial POC with two products will be released by November as
well, just in time for this Pre-ICO. The System will be working on Ethereum Testnet
blockchain with real user data. This will help us prepare smart contracts and get
feedback from the community, real users and make sure that this solution is viable.
Stage 2. LALA Alpha platform will be deployed on Ethereum Mainnet blockchain. Client
onboarding via LALA ID, feedback gathering and improvement. Preparation for beta. This
should happen by January 2018 in India, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Turkey & UAE.
Stage 3. A full working product will be ready by February 2018 with a fully functioning
backend server with telematics integrations for real customer data gathering and
prediction. This will include a Fiat Wallet, Cross border remittance and P2P lending to
begin with.
Stage 4. LALA Beta. Fully functioning platform with key features in place to be released
by March 2018 and open to selected group of geographies and customers. We are
looking at over 10 Countries right now as depicted on the partnership page.
Stage 5. LALA 1.0. Opening system for public usage and enabling massive adoption
across geographies will happen by April 2018
Stage 6. Further development to increase amount of transactions usability and
throughput of the platform.

6. USE OF FUNDS
A detailed breakdown of Use of Funds is described here. Essentially the funds will be
spent on:
A. Blockchain integration- with Ethereum network and research other upcoming
protocols like Raiden υRaiden, Bitshares, Hyperledger, Qtum, OmiseGo etc to build most
efficient, transparent and fast network. We believe in atomic cross-chain trading aka
atomic swap, which is looking to revolutionize the way in which users transact with each
other. It will greatly benefit our customers, will decrease fees, improve the speed of
transactions and make our ecosystem more accessible for the underbanked. Our goal
here is to have niche partners who excel in their field than build everything ourselves. We
are creating an ecosystem, a network, and we should be building that with partners, not
competition. This will consume a big chunk of funds including other technical
advancements, partnerships, wallet development in every country, API integrations, AI
and ML elements, support and related activities
B. Marketing- We intend to use the best marketing teams on a very cost-efficient budget.
Prime aim for marketing is to be transparent and keep the LALA and Crypto community
updated. This budget will also be used for local awareness and community activities in
countries we go to. Again, the aim of marketing is to create awareness that you have
LALA, when things are not gala
C. Business Development- As we expand products and geographies, newer teams and
country managers would be hired. Out of the box thinkers with local grassroots
connections will be preferred
D. LALA Fund- A separate fund will be put aside to invest in local communities and also
in start-up projects where we strongly believe that the product can be a good fit for us in
the future as well as the community
E. Joint Activities- with other companies, crypto communities, R&D, joint marketing etc.
We will always be looking to integrate established and well researched teams and
products rather than always building our own
F. Admin, HR, Legal, Finance- With such a huge project, comes greater responsibility to
be transparent. That is possible via
highest standards of transparency
not only for external investors but
also our own teams. To that effect,
there are some operational costs
associated with accounting and
administrative overheads to take
care of the business processes
needed for a growing international
business
G. Legal- Not many ICO’s are
stressing upon the importance of
legal structures and legal teams. We
are blessed to have put a strong
legal team around us. We are, and
will continue to be in direct contact
with regulators

10. CONCLUSION
The vision was always to bring the unbanked together for a purpose and connect them
via an ecosystem. LALA World is that Ethos
-Sankalp Shangari
LALA’s vision is very simple – financially include the unbanked into the system who have
been suppressed for the longest time. Access to basic financial services is a must in
today’s day and age. Blockchain has come in as a blessing by creating a truly peer to
peer ecosystem on a distributed network.
We are aware that to change from the old Fiat system to this new decentralised
ecosystem, will take time. That is why we are taking this journey to start with best of both
worlds and eventually move to a truly decentralised network.
Engaging everyone, especially the unbanked population in the electronic finance
system via Blockchain will raise incomes of the poor and also improve health care and
education systems. LALA is working with grassroot communities via NGO’s, Local JLG
(Joint Liability Groups), Local governments and exploring numerous partnerships. We
cannot do this alone. But we can give the tools and incentives to our partners to all come
together, transact via one LALA Token, One LALA ID and bring financial services to your
doorstep (aka Smartphone).
