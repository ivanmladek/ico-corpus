Abstract
Lunyr (pronounced “lunar”) is an Ethereum­based decentralized crowdsourced
encyclopedia which rewards users with app tokens for peer­reviewing and contributing
information. We aim to be the starting point of the internet for finding reliable, accurate
information. Our long­term vision is to develop a knowledge base API that developers
can use to create next generation decentralized applications in Artificial Intelligence,
Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and more.

Market
A strategic component of the Lunyr platform is its advertising system, which allows for
the purchase of advertising on the platform using Lunyr tokens (“LUN”). Although
the Lunyr platform is unique in its design, decentralization, and vision, it can be
compared to Wikipedia.
Wikipedia today ranks as the sixth most visited site in the world according to Alexa
rankings1. It attracts 470 million unique visitors who view over 19 billion pages per
2
month . Estimating the amount of advertising revenue Wikipedia could generate if
it allowed advertising on its pages provides clues to the potential demand for
LUN:

AOL, published an article about Wikipedia estimating an annual advertising

revenue potential of $100MM .

● In 2008, BusinessInsider.com performed an analysis of Wikipedia and arrived at

an annual advertising revenue potential of $350MM .
● In 2011, Vincent Juhel published a thesis about Wikipedia for HEC Paris, and
5
arrived at an annual advertising revenue potential of $1.6 billion dollars .

Vision
We will initially focus on fine­tuning the system to improve accuracy, increase content,
and grow readership. Once the knowledge base matures, we will attract a wider
audience by encouraging contributions of near real­time data on world events and
translations in multiple languages. Ultimately, Lunyr intends to establish its brand
globally as a reliable, accurate decentralized knowledge base.
Taking it a step further, we will grow the ecosystem by developing an API that will attract
developers. This Lunyr API will allow developers to use the knowledge base as a
backbone for creating next generation decentralized applications in Artificial
Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and more.

Lunyr API
The Lunyr API holds promise for significantly changing existing business models and
creating new ones. The Ethereum blockchain currently has no knowledge of the real
world, yet most useful applications require real world information. Through the Lunyr
API, decentralized applications will be able to tap into the knowledge base and grab
accurate data on real world events and information. This leads to immediate benefits for

Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications.

Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence projects similar to Siri or Amazon Echo are enhanced with the
Lunyr API. When users ask fact­based questions, the decentralized application can dig
through the Lunyr knowledge base and provide users with reliable, accurate answers.

Virtual Reality
The Lunyr API will enhance the intimate and visceral experience of interactive virtual
worlds. Imagine putting on a virtual reality headset that lets you experience walking on
the surface of Mars. As you walk along the cold, red­dusted ground, information about
key landmarks and giant dust storms appear. All of this information is drawn from the
knowledge base.

Augmented Reality
The Lunyr API can be the foundation for learning­based applications in Augmented
Reality. Imagine you are at the beach on a sunny day and you see beautiful flowers by
the seashore. You want to know what they are so you put on augmented reality glasses,
which will identify the flowers, tap into the knowledge base, and give you all the
information you need to satisfy your curiosity.

Problem
Current crowdsourced knowledge bases face problems with centralization, censorship,
and inaccuracy.

Centralization
Centralized systems represent single points of failure controlled by central authorities.
Individuals relying on these systems must trust that authorities will not abuse their
power to forward self­serving agendas. Yet, resisting the temptation to abuse power is
difficult in practice for even the most respected authorities. In 2012, Wikipedia
deliberately shut down for 24 hours to protest against internet piracy laws, preventing
individuals worldwide from accessing any information6.

Censorship
Centralized systems are vulnerable to censorship. Governments ruling through
oppression exert control over citizens by prohibiting access to free knowledge. Syria
ranks among the governments where internet censorship is pervasive. Syria blocks

7

websites for political reasons and arrests those who access them7. Previously, Syria
blocked the Arabic Wikipedia from all Internet Service Providers in the country,
prohibiting even university students from accessing Wikipedia8.

Inaccuracy
On Wikipedia, many articles can be edited by anyone with an internet connection.
Therefore, users can easily falsify information. Although popular articles with
inaccuracies are likely to be quickly corrected, less popular articles can go uncorrected
for months. For example, John Seigenthaler, a former assistant to U.S. Senator Robert
Kennedy, was falsely implicated in the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers on his
Wikipedia biography for over four months9.

Solution
Lunyr’s innovative platform solves the problems of centralization, censorship, and
inaccuracy seen in current knowledge bases.

Decentralization
The Lunyr platform is built on top of Ethereum and is therefore decentralized,
censorship­resistant, and autonomous. No single point of failure exists. No central
authority or middle man owns or can corrupt the information. The rules in which people
interact with the knowledge base and with one another are mutually agreed upon and
enforced through smart contracts, which are publicly verifiable on the blockchain.

Token Incentive System
Ethereum enables the creation of app tokens, which can be used in an incentive system
to replace intermediaries. In Lunyr’s system, tokens play a key role in providing
economic incentives so that the rational behavior of individuals results in common good.
Unlike in Wikipedia where volunteers must donate their time to contribute and validate
information, in Lunyr’s platform, contributors are rewarded for their work and are
incentivized to continue increasing the value of the ecosystem.

Mandatory Peer Review
Drive­by vandalism and corruption are eliminated in the Lunyr platform. All content
submissions go through a mandatory peer review process and are not committed to the
knowledge base until validated for reliability and accuracy. A powerful incentive system
enabled by app tokens ensures that peer reviewers act in the best interest of the

ecosystem.

Platform Design
Lunyr’s innovative platform design aligns each individual’s rational economic behavior
with benefitting the whole ecosystem.

Peer Review
The contributor’s workflow begins with adding or editing information in the knowledge
base in hopes of receiving rewards. Each contributor’s submission costs gas, so
flooding the system with junk has its economic limits, just as in Ethereum. All
submissions go through a mandatory peer review process and are not committed
to the knowledge base unless approved. Every submission requires sources for
reviewers to validate the submission’s reliability and accuracy. Hence, spam, fake, or
malicious content will be filtered out.
Every user who submits a contribution is also required to peer review other
9

submissions. We use Machine Learning to match peer reviewers with topics with which
they will likely be familiar. Submissions are not committed unless they pass the
judgment of multiple peer reviewers.
It is crucial that peer reviewers are also contributors to ensure that only individuals who
are economically aligned with the well being of the ecosystem are able to peer review
submissions. Bad actors who try to attack the system will be fighting against legions of
good actors driven by a powerful incentive system.

App Tokens
Once the submission passes peer review, the contributor is rewarded Contribution
(CBN) and Honor (HNR) tokens. Neither CBN nor HNR can be transferred to other
individuals, which ensures that only users who have committed to the well­being of the
ecosystem hold CBN and HNR.
CBN are used to calculate how many LUN an individual will be rewarded for the current
reward period. CBN are automatically consumed after LUN rewards are distributed for
the two­week reward period. LUN are used to purchase advertising on the platform.
HNR is used to propose and vote on issues in the Dispute and Resolution system. It is
consumed upon use.

Dispute and Resolution
The dispute and resolution system exists to solve any content and quality issues that
slipped through the peer review system. Issues such as malicious content, vandalism,
and content reorganization are dealt with here. Proposals and votes cost HNR. It is
important that HNR is only held by users who have committed to the ecosystem to align
their proposal and voting behavior with increasing the value of the ecosystem.

LUN Pool
LUN rewards come from a pool of LUN that accumulates and is distributed to
contributors at the end of every two­week reward period. The number of LUN that an
individual contributor is rewarded is based on the percent of total CBN they hold by the
end of each two­week period. Smart contracts ensure that the distribution will be
handled with transparency and fairness.
The LUN Pool comes from two sources:
● New LUN that are created and distributed periodically at two­week intervals
● LUN that are used to purchase advertising
The supply of LUN grows at an annual rate of 3% of the initial token supply. This growth
10

will not start until the Beta release on the Mainnet. These additional LUN provide fuel for
the ecosystem to grow in the beginning. At the same time, the effective inflation
decreases over time towards zero, also known as disinflation.
Lunyr receives 15% of the LUN pool each two­week period. This allocation aligns
Lunyr’s incentive with growing the ecosystem. Since Lunyr’s primary source of value is
in LUN, Lunyr’s well­being is tied to the well­being of the ecosystem. Therefore, the
rational behavior of Lunyr is to continually upgrade and improve the ecosystem so that it
grows in value for all participants.
Outside the LUN pool, Lunyr may sell additional LUN to purchasers in the future. It may
do so through exchanges, the blockchain or in other ways.
Lunyr may make changes to the size of the LUN pool, LUN distribution and other
related matters that it believes, in its reasonable judgment, are beneficial to the LUN
platform growth and development, or it considers reasonable under the circumstances.
Keep in mind that any corrupt behavior would be irrational for Lunyr to do. Lunyr will be
holding onto LUN and any decisions that dilute the value of LUN and devalue the
knowledge base would be harmful to Lunyr.

Advertising
LUN are used to place advertisements on the platform. The ads are text­based such as
those seen in Quora. We use Machine Learning to make ads content­aware. Ads are
not committed to the platform until they pass through the mandatory peer review
system.
Ads are a crucial component of the Lunyr ecosystem. They create a powerful demand
for LUN from those with financial resources. Ads provide the economic force that drives
network effects as more contributors and readers join the ecosystem.

Roadmap
Lunyr is committed to completing each milestone on the roadmap. In addition to
remaining open and transparent on communication channels, we intend to also provide
progress updates.
We will make the following materials available:
● Development newsletters
● Blog posts of research and development

Crowdsale
The initial distribution of LUN will be determined through a Crowdsale. LUN may be
purchased during the Crowdsale pursuant to a Presale Purchase Agreement at an
expected distribution of 44 LUN per Ether. LUN are purchased by sending Ether to the
13

Crowdsale token contract according to our instructions.
The Crowdsale will aim to begin March 29, 2017 at 16:00 UTC and continue for four
weeks, or until the maximum number of LUN are purchased. The actual start and end
time will depend on Ethereum block numbers, which will be announced on the Lunyr
community channels. If the Crowdsale fails to result in a minimum number of LUN, then
Ether sent to purchase LUN will be returned.
The Crowdsale token contract address to which Ether will be sent to purchase LUN
according to our instructions and start and end block numbers will be announced on the
following channels:

Initial LUN Supply Distribution

The overall initial distribution of LUN will be as follows:
○ 78% for Crowdsale purchasers.
○ 15% for Lunyr founders, employees, and advisors distributed to a time­locked
vault that prohibits LUN transfers for 180 days.
○ 5% for marketing and promotion distributed to the Lunyr multisig wallet.
○ 2% for Bug Bounty distributed to the Lunyr multisig wallet.

Crowdsale Token Contract Guidelines
Before the Crowdsale:
○ Any Ether sent to the token contract will be rejected.
During the Crowdsale:
○ Any Ether sent to the token contract according to our instructions will result in an
allocation of LUN to the purchaser at a distribution of 44 LUN per Ether.
○ LUN cannot be transferred during the Crowdsale period.
15

After the Crowdsale:
○ Users may transfer LUN to another address.
○ The crowdsale token contract creates additional tokens to arrive at the token
supply distribution.
○ The Lunyr Token contract is now finalized, however, upgraded releases of the
token contract adding core features and improvements are to be expected.

Security Audit
Lunyr is committed to ensuring the security of its platform. With each product release on
the Mainnet, Lunyr commits to performing a security audit with both internal and
external reviewers. Additionally, there will be a Bug Bounty program that rewards
developers for finding security and other related issues.

DISCLAIMER
NOT AN OFFER TO SOLICIT SECURITIES AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LUN
AND THE LUNYR APPLICATION
Last Updated March 7, 2017
This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an
offer or solicitation to sell shares or securities in Lunyr Inc. or any related or
associated company. Any such offer or solicitation would only be made by a
confidential offering memorandum and in accordance with applicable securities
and other laws. None of the information or analyses presented are intended to
form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are
intended. Accordingly, this document does not constitute investment advice or
counsel or solicitation for investment in any security. This document does not
constitute or form part of, and should not be construed as, any offer for sale or
subscription of, or any invitation to offer to buy or subscribe for, any securities,
nor should it or any part of it form the basis of, or be relied on in any connection
with, any contract or commitment whatsoever. Lunyr expressly disclaims any and
all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind
whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information
contained in this document, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such
information or (iii) any action resulting therefrom.
The Lunyr token, or “LUN”, is a cryptographic token used by the Lunyr application.
LUN is not a cryptocurrency.
At the time of this writing, (i) with the exception of being used to place ads on the Lunyr
platform, LUN cannot be exchanged for goods or services, (ii) LUN has no known uses
outside the Lunyr application, and (iii) LUN cannot be traded on any known exchanges.
LUN is not an investment.
There is no guarantee – indeed there is no reason to believe – that the LUN you
purchase will increase in value. It may – and probably will at some point – decrease in
value. Those who do not actually use their LUN honestly and fairly may lose their right
to use LUN and may lose their LUN to those that do use LUN honestly and fairly.

17

LUN is not evidence of ownership or right to control.
Controlling LUN does not grant its controller ownership or equity in Lunyr, or the Lunyr
application. LUN does not grant any right to participate in the control, direction or
decision making of Lunyr or the Lunyr application.

RISK DISCLOSURES
1) Risk of Losing Access to LUN Due to Loss of Credentials
The purchaser’s LUN may be associated with a Lunyr account until they are distributed
to the purchaser. The Lunyr account can only be accessed with login credentials
selected by the purchaser. The loss of these credentials will result in the loss of LUN.
Best practices dictate that purchasers safely store credentials in one or more backup
locations geographically separated from the working location.
2) Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol
LUN and the Lunyr application are based on the Ethereum protocol. As such, any
malfunction, unintended function, unexpected functioning of or attack on the Ethereum
protocol may cause the Lunyr application or LUN to malfunction or function in an
unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum
protocol may itself lose value in ways similar to LUN, and also other ways. More
information about the Ethereum protocol is available at http://www.ethereum.org.
3) Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials
Any third party that gains access to or learns of the purchaser’s login credentials or
private keys may be able to dispose of the purchaser’s LUN. To minimize this risk, the
purchaser should guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices.
4) Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions
Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies
around the world. The functioning of the Lunyr application and LUN could be impacted
by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including the licensing of or restrictions
on the use, sale, or possession of digital tokens like LUN, which could impede, limit or
end the development of the Lunyr application.
5) Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Lunyr Application
Following the Crowdsale and the development of the initial version of the LUN platform,
it is possible that alternative applications could be established, which use the same
open source code and protocol underlying the Lunyr application. The official Lunyr
application may compete with these alternative, unofficial LUN­based applications,
18

which could potentially negatively impact the Lunyr application and LUN, including its
value.
6) Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Lunyr Application or Distributed Applications
It is possible that the Lunyr application will not be used by a large number of
businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public
interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of
interest could negatively impact LUN and the Lunyr application.
7) Risk that the Lunyr Application, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations
of Lunyr or the Purchaser
The Lunyr application is presently under development and may undergo significant
changes before release. Any expectations or assumptions regarding the form and
functionality of the Lunyr application or LUN (including participant behavior) held by
Lunyr or the purchaser may not be met upon release, for any number of reasons
including mistaken assumptions or analysis, a change in the design and implementation
plans and execution of the Lunyr application.
8) Risk of Theft and Hacking
Hackers or other groups or organizations or countries may attempt to interfere with the
Lunyr application or the availability of LUN in any number of ways, including service
attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus based
attacks.
9) Risk of Security Weaknesses in the LUN Application Core Infrastructure
Software
The Lunyr application consists of open source software that is based on other open
source software. There is a risk that the Lunyr team, or other third parties may
intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core
infrastructural elements of the Lunyr application interfering with the use of or causing
the loss of LUN.
10) Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of
Cryptography
Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum
computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Lunyr platform, which could
result in the theft or loss of LUN.
11) Risk of LUN Mining Attacks
19

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies, the blockchain
used for the Lunyr application is susceptible to mining attacks, including double­spend
attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish­mining” attacks, and race condition
attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Lunyr application, LUN, and
expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract computations. Despite
the efforts of the Lunyr team, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists.
12) Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the Lunyr Application
While LUN should not be viewed as an investment, it may have value over time. That
value may be limited if the Lunyr application lacks use and adoption. If this becomes the
case, there may be few or no markets following the launch of the platform, potentially
having an adverse impact on LUN.
13) Risk of an Illiquid Market for LUN
There very well may never be a secondary market for LUN. There are currently no
exchanges upon which LUN would trade. If ever exchanges do develop, they will likely
be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They may
therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges
for other products and have a negative impact on LUN.
14) Risk of Uninsured Losses
Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using
the Lunyr application or Ethereum network are generally uninsured. In the event of any
loss, there is no public insurer, such as the FDIC, or private insurer, to offer recourse to
the purchaser.
15) Risk of Dissolution of the Lunyr Project
It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including an unfavorable fluctuation in
the value of Ether, development issues with the Lunyr application, the failure of
business relationships, or competing intellectual property claims, the Lunyr project may
no longer be viable as a business or otherwise and may dissolve or fail to launch.
16) Risk of Malfunction in the Lunyr Application
It is possible that the Lunyr application malfunctions in an unfavorable way, including
one that results in the loss of LUN.
17) Unanticipated Risks
Cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks
discussed in this White Paper, there are risks that the Lunyr team cannot anticipate.
20

Further risks may materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the
discussed risks or the emergence of new risks.
