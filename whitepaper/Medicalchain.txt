Dear Reader,
Thank you for taking the time to research Medicalchain and read our Whitepaper.
This has been a culmination of hard work and dedication from all of the team here
at Medicalchain and we would like to proudly share our vision with you all.
As a medical doctor, I have worked long hours whilst managing expectations and
multitasking in order to satisfy tight deadlines. Despite such experiences, nothing
had prepared me for the challenge of growing Medicalchain from the ground
up. I could not have done this without the support of my Co-Founder and COO;
Mo Tayeb. Working side by side, we have selected the finest individuals to join our
team to become, what we now know as Medicalchain.
Our team is a unique one: a perfect blend of clinicians, engineers, developers and
visionaries from the world over. We have nine different nationalities representing us,
each bringing with them their own personal views and experiences of healthcare in
their respective countries.
The Medicalchain team have the drive and commitment to improve healthcare for
those who need it most - the patients.

Our mission is to improve care for people by placing
the patient at the centre of the digital transformation
of healthcare.
We enact this mission by empowering patients with the tools to engage in a more
comprehensive healthcare experience, such as accessing their own records on their
mobile device, or conducting a consultation via webcam with a doctor anywhere in
the world, and by doing so, we can improve people’s lives.
It has been an amazing journey so far, and we are fortunate to have such strong
support from the community who has helped to drive us onwards in developing this
platform. We are only at the beginning and I truly believe the most exciting times lie

3.0 Executive summary

Medicalchain is a decentralised
platform that enables secure, fast
and transparent exchange and
usage of medical data. We use
blockchain technology to create
a user-focused electronic health
record and maintain a single true
version of the user’s data.
Medicalchain will enable users to give conditional
access to different healthcare agents such as
doctors, hospitals, laboratories, pharmacists and
insurers to interact as they see fit.
Each interaction with their medical data is auditable,
transparent and secure, and will be recorded
as a transaction on Medicalchain’s distributed
ledger. During this process, the patient’s privacy is
protected at all times. Medicalchain is built on the
permission-based Hyperledger Fabric architecture
which allows varying access levels; users control
who can view their records, how much they see and
for what length of time.
By empowering users, we can build the future of
healthcare together. Medicalchain will be a platform
for other digital health applications to develop on;
users will be able to sign for these applications and
services which are powered by their health data and
secured by smart contracts. Medicalchain is currently
developing two applications to work alongside
the platform: a doctor-to-patient telemedicine
application and a health data marketplace.

The Marketplace enables Medicalchain users to
negotiate commercial terms with third parties for
alternative uses or applications of their personal
health data. For example, putting forward their data
to be used in medical research. It is intended that
Medicalchain and others will contribute many more
applications to the platform - helping bring value to
all stakeholders.
Medicalchain’s platform will be powered by
“MedTokens”. We are issuing 500 million tokens,
which will be distributed at a rate up to 1 token to
$0.25 USD in ETH and/or BTC. These will be offered
in a crowd selling process commonly known as
an “ICO” or “Initial Coin Offering.”
The contribution period will follow our pre-sale and
begin on February 1st 2018. More details on our ICO
can be found below on page 31.

The telemedicine application will enable users to
consult a real doctor remotely (for example, on their
phone) for a small fee payable directly to the doctor.

4.0 Introduction to the
Healthcare of Today
4.1 Expectations of Healthcare Users
In today’s world, users expect an instantaneous and seamless
flow of data. Many industries have adopted, or are beginning
to adopt necessary technologies to guarantee their users’
expectation for instant information. Unfortunately, the healthcare
industry has lagged behind. Legacy systems are burdensome,
slow, often vulnerable and have little role for the patient.

4.2 Fragmented Health Services
Health data contained in legacy systems is siloed and difficult to
share with others because of varying formats and standards. In
short, the current healthcare data landscape is fragmented and
ill-suited to the instantaneous needs of modern users. As a result
of this, stakeholders are incentivised to keep their own records,
and no single version of the truth exists.

4.3 Lack of Patient Centricity (passive user)
The relationship between healthcare professionals and patients
has long been a paternalistic one. In recent times, however, there
has been a significant shift of authority.

Medicine is being democratised and
patients are more empowered.
It is now considered reasonable to seek a second opinion and
patients are expected to contribute to decisions made about
their treatment choices.
Even in single-payer system like the UK’s National Health Service
(NHS), patients have the right to choose where and when they
receive their care. Thus, with patient mobility comes the need for
information mobility. In order to be provided with the best care
patients not only can, but must have control over their own data.

4.0 Introduction to the Healthcare of Today

4.5 Security Risks to Patient Data
At present, electronic health records (EHR) are stored on centralised databases in which medical data remains largely nonportable. Centralization increases the security risk footprint,
and requires trust in a single authority. Moreover, centralised
databases cannot ensure security and data integrity, regardless
of de-identification and controlled access requirements. Centralised health databases are legally a requirement and necessity
in most countries worldwide and therefore require an added layer
of technology to improve their portability and security.
As cybercrime around the world is on the rise, healthcare systems
are no exception as shown by recent high profile ransomware
hacking. In fact, the healthcare industry has more data breaches
than any other sector and medical records are being stolen and
passed on.

“Your medical information is worth
10 times more than your credit card
number on the black market.”

Figure 2: Technology News, Reuters, September 24th 2014

Data security is paramount due to the increased sensitivity of
medical data. This was highlighted in early 2017 when a cyber
attack struck healthcare institutions around the globe. This
highlighted to the public the vulnerability of our healthcare
systems to potential threats and a sober warning regarding the
inadequacies of the current infrastructure.
Many have tried to overcome this issue, and it is high on the
agenda of governments and a source of frustration for both
doctors and patients. A significant component of the challenge
focuses on data security.

4.0 Introduction to the Healthcare of Today

4.6 Lack of Transparency
4.61 Increasing Costs
For patients and professionals, the present system
is incredibly slow, inflexible and woefully opaque.
These problems are equally visible throughout the
claims process. When a patient needs services
(from a provider such as a general practice,
a pharmacy or nursing home), health plans are
used to determine how much of the cost they will
pay. In order to determine this cost, the health plan
must validate services received from the provider
against the agreement the patient and health plan
have, and then share their findings with the provider.
This only occurs if the provider is “in-network”
with a health plan. For a provider to be considered
in-network, a complex agreement needs to be
negotiated which adds a significant expense to
the provider’s administration costs. One part of
these costs are Billing and Insurance Related (BIR)
costs which include activities such as maintaining
benefits databases and keeping records of services
delivered. BIR costs are projected to reach $315
billion dollars by 2018 and take up to 3.8 hours for
the average physician to navigate.
On average, this whole process takes between one
to two weeks if done electronically and takes three
to five weeks by paper. Moreover, this process
is rife with places for miscommunication and
misunderstanding to occur. For care to actually
take place, multiple people need to check multiple
archaic agreements against multiple records. The
result is an inefficient and opaque process that
leaves stakeholders and, ultimately patients feeling
confused and sceptical.

4.62 Insurance Fraud
Whether you have employer-sponsored health
insurance or you purchase your own insurance
policy, health care fraud inevitably translates into
higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses
for consumers, as well as reduced benefits and
coverage. For employers, this increases the cost of
providing insurance benefits to employees, which
then increases the overall cost of doing business.
Moreover, the reality for many patients is that the
increased expense as a result of fraud, could mean
the difference between affording health insurance
or not.
Fraud by design dictates that false information
be represented as fact. A common healthcare
fraud involves perpetrators who take advantage of
patients, by entering into their health record false
diagnoses of conditions they do not have, or of
exaggerating conditions they actually do have. This
is done so that fraudulent insurance claims can be
submitted for payment.

“The total cost of insurance fraud is
estimated to be more than $40 billion
per year.”
FBI.gov
Unless this discovery is made early on, these false or
exaggerated diagnoses become part of the patient’s
documented medical history within the health
insurer’s records if not in other databases as well.

4.0 Introduction to the Healthcare of Today

4.63 Record Tampering
Medical records are to be considered not only as
medical documents, but also as legal documents.
To pass off a rewritten record as contemporaneous
is a criminal offence and any retrospective changes
have to be clearly marked, dated and signed, and the
reason for such changes clearly documented.
Altering existing medical records, removing records,
or adding false records puts a healthcare professional at risk of medicolegal repercussions.
Disclosure of authentic and original clinical notes is
essential when a claim is brought up, and failure to
do so can make a claim indefensible.

4.7 Telemedicine Market
Healthcare costs are on the rise around the globe
as societies struggle to deal with ageing populations and the rising chronic disease burden.
Current models of care delivery, particularly in
places like the US and UK, are unsustainable. One
trend combating increased costs has been the rise
in digital health services. The value of the global
digital health market was valued at $80 billion US
dollars in 2015 and is expected to increase to over
$200 billion by 2020 with a CAGR of 21%.
Digital health solutions such as Telemedicine will
be critical for driving efficiency and reducing costs.
The scope of Telemedicine covers referrals, second
opinions, education, follow-up care, monitoring, diagnostics and treatments across numerous specialities.

Examples include Telecardiology, Teleradiology,
Telepathology, Telepsychiatry, Teledermatology and
others. Clearly there is a large market, and benefits
include:

•
•
•
•

Improved quality of care
More time for doctor-patient interactions
Improved access to consultation
Reduced costs

The market is currently dominated by North America
and Europe though highest growth is expected in
India, China, and Japan in the next few years.
There are several challenges to full implementation:

In 2017, the global telemedicine
market was estimated to be worth
$23.8 Billion and is projected to
exceed $55 Billion by 2021.
Unfortunately, most modern Telehealth systems are
not integrated with the core financial and clinical
systems used by healthcare organisations. Data
remains within the Telehealth application and
requires manual entry later into health records.
Digitisation promises much potential, but adding
an additional silo without incorporating the information does not add value. In order to succeed,
systems, devices, and data need to be seamlessly
integrated.
Privacy and security law issues must consider the
management of data in non-traditional formats (for
example, audio and/or video) and the sharing of
data responsibilities encountered.
To minimize the privacy/security risk of Telehealth
encounters, providers require reliable methods for
verifying and authenticating the identities of the
patient and practitioners. Blockchain solutions are a
great tool to overcome these issues.

5.0 Medicalchain Solutions:
The Healthcare of Tomorrow
5.1 Medicalchain Dual
Blockchain

5.3 Ethereum and Smart
Contracts

5.4 Medicalchain as a
Healthcare Platform

Medicalchain is built using a dual
blockchain structure. The first
blockchain controls access to
health records and is built using
Hyperledger Fabric. The second
blockchain is powered by an
ERC20 token on Ethereum and
underlies all the applications and
services for our platform.

Ethereum is a digital platform
where thousands of powerful
computers around the world work
in harmony to host the Ethereum
network. Ethereum’s blockchain
represents all accounts and
transactions made by its users.
Every time you send an Ether, the
currency of Ethereum, to another user, those computers act as
accountants by verifying the validity of the transaction. Once the
verification is approved by those
“accountants” the money is then
transferred to the other user, making transfers secure, transparent
and conflict-free.

Using blockchain technology,
Smart Contracts, and our cryptocurrency, Medicalchain provides the infrastructure for digital
health applications and services
to be built. These applications
and services will be seamlessly
powered by user’s health data.
Anyone will be able to develop on
Medicalchain’s platform and we
hope to foster a thriving ecosystem to provide value, reduce
costs, and ultimately improve
people’s lives.

5.2 Hyperledger Fabric
The Hyperledger blockchain network is permission-based and
requires users to sign up to use
it. Permissioning on the network
is controlled using Hyperledger
modelling and access control
languages. Hyperledger Fabric is
a platform for distributed ledger
solutions underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high
degrees of confidentiality, resilience, flexibility and scalability.
Medical information is often highly sensitive, in both a social and
legal sense, so a closed blockchain such as Hyperledger Fabric
helps to retain the necessary privacy required for such an application.
Hyperledger Fabric is a better
solution for managing access to
health records, as it accommodates for multiple layers of permission, meaning the owner of
a set of data can control which
parts of their data is accessed.

Smart Contracts are code held
and executed on the Ethereum
blockchain. Anything that can
be programmed normally can be
programmed within the Ethereum
network.
Processes that normally require
a professional or notary can
be automated and validated by
Smart Contracts in a wholly transparent and secure way. For example, the average physician spends
3.8 hours weekly on billing and
insurance related activity. Imagine the cost savings if these processes were conducted on Smart
Contracts and validated by the
Ethereum network.

5.5 Identity management
using Civic

Identity fraud is a
massive problem in
the world.
Hackers steal identities and impersonate users to incur huge
costs on both users and businesses. To combat this, Medicalchain
has partnered with Civic and will
use Civic’s user authentication
services to easily and securely
manage the identities of users in
a decentralised way. Civic identifies and verifies users using biometrics, which provides a simple
and safe way of ensuring user’s
privacy.

6.0 Technical Explanation
6.1 Participants Definitions and Permissions
With a plethora of different actors, identity management and access to data is key
to Medicalchain’s solution. A dynamic system has been developed that identifies
actors and gives them the appropriate scope over a health record, contingent on
the patient’s permission. Below are some examples of read/write permission:

6.3 Encryption Cryptography
To ensure privacy, health records are encrypted
using symmetric key cryptography. The record

will be encrypted and stored in a data store within
the appropriate regulatory jurisdiction. The symmetric key will be encrypted with the public key of
a 2048-bit RSA key pair. Each time an entity is given
permission to access the patient’s record:
1. The record is decrypted with the owner’s private
key
2. The symmetric key is encrypted with the public
key of the authorised user
If a user is authorised to access a health
record and requests access then the following
process takes place:

In the case that a participant’s access is removed
from a health record:
1. The symmetric key is decrypted with the private
key of the owner of the EHR
2. The EHR is decrypted using the symmetric key
3. The record is re-encrypted with a new
symmetric key
4. The symmetric key is encrypted with all the
remaining authorised users’ public keys

6.6 Permission Definitions

Hyperledger Fabric includes an access control language (ACL), which defines access
over the elements of the .CTO domain model above. By defining ACL rules we are
able to control which resources participants have access to on the network’s domain
model. Some examples of these access rules are shown below:

6.7 Medicalchain API Platform

Medicalchain will offer an API that will permit third parties to obtain and interact with
EHRs with the user’s permission. All endpoints available in the UI will be available to
developers. We hope to cultivate a robust ecosystem of applications and services.

7.0 A Better System for Care
7.1 User Control
In the current healthcare system,
patients have their health information spread over multiple
systems, hospitals, networks and
potentially countries.
There are multiple fragmented
records from the same patient,
held at different institutions
all with their own snapshot of
the patient’s health at the point
of their interaction with them,
such as blood tests, imaging
and clinic letters. Medicalchain
will chronologically arrange all
of these records and filter them
into the specific categories
above to aid data handling. Such
a categorisation would make the
records more accessible and understandable for patients and it
will also facilitate researchers
in searching for the information
relevant to them.

Medicalchain provides the
user, being the owner of their
own medical records, full
access and control over their
data.

Approved clinicians on the
Medicalchain platform will have
the ability to ‘read and write’ on
the patient’s records. Moreover,
the Medicalchain platform will
provide the users with a full log of
who has access to their medical
data, the time of access and the
particular types of data that can
be accessed.

7.2 Data Security
The Medicalchain system uses
a double encryption mechanism
on a closed, permission-based
blockchain.
The security of health records is
secured beyond any centralised
data system currently in use.
Patient data is not accessible
directly on the blockchain.
The blockchain acts as a pointer
to where patient data is held in an
encrypted format, meaning that
anyone attempting to intercept
patient data will be unable to
with the ease that is required
to access data existing in any
central location.

7.0 A Better System for Care

7.3 User Centric Model
In the current healthcare system, patients have their health information spread over multiple systems, hospitals, networks
and potentially countries. There are multiple fragmented records
of the same patient, held at different institutions with their own
snapshot of the patient’s health during their interaction with them
such as blood tests, imaging, and clinic letters. Medicalchain will
order and filter all of these records into a chronological order and
the specific categories above to aid data handling. Such categorisation would make the records more accessible and understandable for patients, and also facilitate researchers in seeking
out the information important to them.

7.4 Health Data Revolution
Bold companies like 23 and Me, Fitbit, Apple, Nest, and Qardio
are rapidly innovating to expand the frontier of the data that is
collectable. We already have remarkable access to anatomic,
biological, environmental, genomic, phenomic and physiological data. New ideas and technologies will only move this frontier further. If we can connect these disparate data sources, then
caregivers and researchers will have unprecedented insight into
patient’s lives. Ultimately this will lead to lowered costs, better
patient outcomes and better research.

Medicalchain wants to be at the forefront
of this revolution and will seek to integrate
as many sources of health data to its
platform as possible.
Medicalchain will start by integrating with Apple HealthKit and
common wearables, before moving to add support for diagnostic
tests, IoT, and other digital health. Patients and their doctors will
have the ability to view this data along with their electronic health
record.

7.0 A Better System for Care

7.5 Patient Safety

Medicalchain has also developed a backup access
system for emergency situations, ensuring patient
safety at all times.
A patient can generally grant or decline healthcare
professionals access to their records. However, in the
event of an emergency and with the patient incapacitated, there must be an ability to view certain information
in order to provide the best possible care.
The most vital information needed in an emergency
would be the patient’s name, their next of kin, medications, allergies and any advanced decisions they may
have made. Patients using the Medicalchain platform
will have the ability to select in advance which areas of
their records can be viewed in an emergency situation.
In the case that the patient is incapacitated or unconscious and unable to grant access to their records, the emergency bracelet the patient is wearing would be scanned to unlock
this information. Two clinicians would have to agree that given
the situation, access to this information without the patient’s explicit consent was clinically in the patient’s best interest. To be
clear, a patient’s entire record would not be unlocked, but only
information that would be vital in an emergency situation and the
patient had prior agreed to sharing in such a situation.
To unlock this information, two doctors would need to scan the
emergency bracelet the patient is wearing, or their wearable device which would unlock access to these key parts of their medical records.
This would enable clinicians to provide the best care possible to
a patient in an emergency situation based on their pre-authorised
sample of relevant data.

7.6 Clinical Application

7.61 Clinical Communication
Along with increased access to emergency
information, Medicalchain allows clinicians
to communicate with each other with ease.
When an authorised healthcare professional
updates a patient health record, the system
will update that record on Medicalchain.
Any clinician with authorised access to that
record will see the update in real time.
As
health
records
are
updated
via
Medicalchain for all authorised parties, there is no
need for patient data to be manually transferred
from system to system. Medicalchain will be
usable in any browser on any computer.
As a result, any doctor with a browser and an internet connection
will be able to access the users’ documents shared with them.
Issues currently associated with interoperability are resolved
this way and costs that are associated with the transportation of
notes currently undertaken by junior clinicians or administrative
staff are cut down on.

7.62 Borderless Health and Social Care
With the utilisation of data compliant storage nodes alongside
borderless blockchain technology, the user will be able to
transport their records with them as they travel. Healthcare
services become borderless as telemedicine services allow
users to interact with clinicians in other countries. This will be
particularly beneficial for frequent travellers and those moving
abroad who want to avoid the inconvenience of transferring their
health records to their new provider.
Medicalchain has the vision of one day bringing its platform to
developing nations around the world where there is less access
to quality care. We believe the ability to carry your health information with you on a mobile phone is powerful.

7.7 Transparency

7.71 Patients / Users
In present-day healthcare, there is a lack of transparency between
all parties involved. Patients have no immediate access to health
records written by medical professionals. Medical professionals
are only able to share data quickly within their own organisation
or with other health professionals using the same EHR system.
Insurance companies are kept in the dark, unless they request
patient data which is required for a claim. Researchers are forced
to seek anonymised data from multiple intermediaries, which is
both costly and timely. The lack of transparency on how patient
data is handled also leaves the user unaware of how their data is
currently being used.

7.72 Health Insurance
& Transparency Cost Benefits
Patients are unknowingly and in some instances, knowingly
not disclosing their health conditions to insurance companies.
As a result of this incorrect information, patients can pay
incorrect premiums for years, only to discover that their claims
are declined in the scenario they need to make one.
The verifiability and immutability of health records on
Medicalchain’s platform allows insurance companies to make
a more accurate assessment of an individual’s health and health
premiums should reflect this.

By allowing health insurers access to their
health records, patients could be rewarded
for their transparency in the form of lower
premiums.
Moreover, patients could pledge to a set of health goals with their
insurer and be rewarded as they reach milestones associated
with those goals. As in turn, a healthier lifestyle works in favour
of both the insurer and the patient.

8.0 Token Utilities
8.1 MedToken

8.21 Patient Benefits

Once the patient has access to their own EHR this
will enable the following key features to be used in
conjunction with the Medicalchain platform:

From the patient’s perspective, the time for seeking
a consultation is massively reduced by removing
the need to physically attend the doctor’s practice.
There are many simple ailments that are currently
managed over the telephone, but by providing
a Telemedicine component we can improve the
patient’s experience by facilitating a visual consultation which would be more in-depth and
beneficial to both the doctor and the patient.

8.2 Telemedicine Consultations
Telemedicine, an online consultation with a doctor
and patient using a webcam interface, is set to be
the future of consultations.

Patient controls access of records to doctors when
conducting telemedicine consultation and pays the
doctor for the consultation with MedTokens.

Medicalchain not only provides this established
and successful format of consultation, but will accommodate the doctor by enabling them to interact
live with the patient’s records during the consultation.
Patients would grant access to their records during
the Telemedicine consultations, allowing for a more
in-depth, informative, and valuable experience for
both the patient and doctor.
There are also further benefits from the telemedicine
experience which Medicalchain delivers.
Telemedicine platforms available today offer online
visual consultations but do not have access to longitudinal health records. Medicalchain offers this
unique value and provides patients with privacy
controls. Patients will be able to choose the level
of detail visible and allocate viewing rights to their
chosen doctor for as long as they feel necessary.

Copyright © 2018 Medicalchain. All rights reserved

8.22 Clinician Benefits
To attend a doctor’s appointment requires a patient
to cancel their work in advance or take their child
out of school for the appointment. There is then the
waiting time at the clinic in order to see the doctor,
often times for a simple request. Telemedicine
provides the patient with the opportunity to select
a specific time to conduct the consultation at their
convenience, encouraging patient choice and
freedom. Further, patients are able to choose which
doctor they would like to conduct their consultation
with offering greater choice and building a relationship between that doctor and patient, whereas
perhaps logistically it would not have been possible
beforehand if they were based in different cities.

25

8.0 Token Utilities

The doctor also reaps many benefits from utilising
telemedicine by providing the clinician with
a flexible working pattern allowing them to conduct
consultations from any location with adequate
internet connectivity. Medicalchain will provide the
doctor access to the patient’s health record (with
the patient’s permission) during the telemedicine
consultation. This will also give the clinician the
added confidence during the consultation that they
are being provided with all of the information they
require to suggest appropriate investigations and
organise a treatment plan.

8.3 Health Data Marketplace Control
As with the founding principal of Medicalchain,
patients should have control over their health records,
and they should also benefit from the potential
value that they possess. Medicalchain will connect
research institutions with users who are willing to
have their health data used in studies in a health data
marketplace. Users will be given clear information as
to how their data is being used and what data will be
required. In many cases anonymised data will be permissible, ensuring the privacy of everyone involved.

Patient grants access of personal
health data to researchers in return for
incentivisation with MedTokens

In return, participants will be compensated in
MedTokens. Patients will be given the ability to
unlock the monetary value that their health data
holds, they will be more engaged with their health
conditions and the next generation of cutting-edge
medicine will be empowered.

Copyright © 2018 Medicalchain. All rights reserved

Pharmaceutical and research companies will
also benefit from the changes brought in by
Medicalchain. They will be able to seek out patients
who have opted into being contacted by researchers
so that these institutions can interact directly with
the patient. By doing so, companies will no longer
need to approach a hospital or clinic and can go
straight to the people whose information will be
used. Not only will this increase efficiency, but it is
a more transparent process that strikes a relationship which is symbiotic and sustainable.
There would be a few broad categories of data
leasing agreements though more are likely to evolve
over time. Here are a few we envision:
•

One time leasing. Institutions will use APIs
provided by Medicalchain to pull relevant data
from participants from our servers.

•

Longitudinal studies. Institutions that need to
see data over a period of time will be able to ask
users to stream their data. Example: how many
steps users have walked per day or what their
heart rate looked like today.

•

Collated data. Medicalchain would combine
normally disparate data sources and provide
easy access to these data sources with user
consent.

•

Ongoing anonymised data offerings. Users
could opt in to have their data anonymised and
labelled as accessible to research institutions
interested in it. Institutions would have
the ability to filter by broad categories
(e.g. 40-50 year old, 25+ BMI, male) and users
would be paid every time their data is accessed.

8.4 Potential Insurance Integration
Users could allow health insurers access to their health records.
In turn, insurers could rest assured that the information they are
making decisions upon is trusted, verifiable and patients could be
rewarded for their transparency in the form of lower premiums.
Moreover, patients could pledge to a set of health goals with their

insurer and be rewarded as they hit milestones associated with
those goals. Regular weight and blood pressure measurement
uploads, proof of therapy compliance and attendance at
a gym might incentivise rewards from health insurers with lower
premiums or rewarding users with MedTokens.

8.5 Powering Medicalchain’s Platform
Users will be able to pay for a variety of other applications and
services that have been developed on Medicalchain’s platform.
Integrations with a plethora of different healthcare sectors are
possible and the above is only the beginning of the revolution
that is coming.

9.0 Cost Impact Analysis
9.1 Users

9.2 Clinicians

Whereas typically for a patient to gain access to
their medical records, they would need to apply to
their service provider and pay all associated administrative fees to have these released to them, with
Medicalchain, the user would provide consent to
have their data retrieved on their behalf, and stored
free of charge on Medicalchain’s nodes. Once this
has been carried out, the patient would then use the
Medicalchain application to have a standardised,
single point of access to those records at their
discretion, eliminating the need for additional administration fees. Should they lose this data, or need
to send original, physical copies at any time, they
would grant access to any requesting parties.

Clinicians using the Medicalchain platform would
have immediate access to conduct Teleconsultations. This will provide an additional revenue
stream, meaning they could practice without any
overheads other than a computer with internet
connection.
This availability would decrease the chance of
cancellations due to patients being unable to
physically attend a consultation. Cutting this variable
out saves on facility expenses, administration costs
and the need for additional staff.

With transportable personal data, the risk is significantly reduced if medical assistance is required
away from a users healthcare provider.
Utilising Medicalchain’s Teleconsultation platform,
users would have dramatically decreased waiting
times and costs associated with travel.

9.0 Cost Impact Analysis

9.3 Healthcare Providers
There are a plethora of benefits to healthcare providers. First
of all, they will benefit from having a more complete picture of
a patient’s health condition. Medicalchain’s single true record will
be the sole place providers would need to look for patient data,
providing peace of mind and reducing time spent on gathering records. Moreover, providers would benefit from not having to constantly invest to upgrade or upkeep their health record systems.

9.4 Researchers
Researchers would have the ability to reach a global audience
of patients through Medicalchain’s health data Marketplace.
This would increase the potential sample size used in research
and improve the accuracy of the results. Costs would be reduced
by simply pulling the relevant information from a participant’s
health record, with their consent, instead of the burdensome process of forming research groups and going through health providers for access to health data.

9.5 Insurers
Verifiable, immutable data, means that insurance companies will
need to spend fewer man-hours checking data, that they can trust
the data presented to them, both from the patient granting them
access and likewise from the medical professional’s notation.
Similarly, if an insurance company wanted the patient to be completely transparent with them, in order to offer them an accurate
premium based on their medical records. They would offer the
patient MedTokens and/or offer a cheaper premium as an incentive for their transparency.

11.0 Timelines
11.1 Medicalchain to date
The Story So Far
Work on Medicalchain started in 2016 when founder
Dr. Albeyatti identified an issue with writing clinical
notes on patients being discharged out of the
hospital and having their care transferred back to
their family doctor (general practitioner). These
notes, known as “Discharge Summaries” contain
a substantial volume of mandatory information
that is often written in freeform text by the doctors.
The notes are subject to errors. For example, doctors
may forget to include vital medical information, such
as the correct dosage or course of drug prescription.
These errors put the patients’ wellbeing at risk, incur
raised costs, and represent a liability for the hospital.
To address this, Dr. Albeyatti co-founded Discharge
Summary with Bara Mustafa.
First deployed in Leeds Teaching Hospital Trust,
UK, the tool was designed to generate accurate
and timely notes when patients are sent home.
Discharge Summary received a positive welcome
and was adopted by junior doctors as well as consultants and other healthcare practitioners.
Discharge Summary, by improving communication
and standardising data, demonstrated to Dr. Albeyatti
the power of digital health to lower costs and
improve outcomes. He sought to apply this insight to
a broader problem: disparate health systems.
In short, documents are transferred, often on paper,
to other organisations where the exchange of data
results in no single version of the truth. Moreover,
oftentimes IT systems are not interoperable; they
cannot talk to each other let alone use each other’s
vital data.

Copyright © 2018 Medicalchain. All rights reserved

Dr. Albeyatti expanded the team by bringing
Mo Tayeb, Jay Povey, Robert Miller as well as
a combination of medical doctors, allied health
professionals, and experts from the blockchain
community. Together, the team has developed Medicalchain – complementing Discharge Summary and
helping to build Dr. Albeyatti’s vision.
Over the past few months, a flurry of work has been
completed and Medicalchain has been featured
at world-renowned forums such as the Financial
Times Digital Health Summit, Blockchain Labo, and
the Technology Innovation. The work to date has
resulted in a public Beta, which will be released in
February, as well as several key partnerships. One
thing is for sure: Medicalchain is leading the way
in blockchain applications in healthcare and digital
health’s role in our daily lives.

11.2 Current Developments
The proof of concept is in its final phase and
the development is now focused on design and
UX/UI experience.The core of the application,
Medicalchain’s secure API and blockchain, is ready for
the release of the Beta. The nodes setup and operated
during the Beta are run by Medicalchain, but over time
Medicalchain will include other nodes onto its
network. Several of these conversations are
underway already with hospitals, universities and
non-profit organisations.

11.3 Collaborative Design
To enhance the user experience of Medicalchain
a range of global advisors have been selected to
work on specific use cases. Expert patients, doctors,
health professionals, health providers, insurance and
pharmaceutical companies will take part in system
design consultation with blockchain developers.
The Beta release will enable testing of each use case,
with the trialling community providing feedback via
the platform.

Patients / Service Users
Clinicians
Non-Profit Node Services
Research Institutes / Pharma

Expert patients have expressed great interest in
the benefits of owning and managing their own
health records. We are working with several disease-specific organisations to onboard experienced
healthcare users to test the collation of data
processes, alongside the user interface.

Medicalchain has several
community campaigns running,
on a variety of platforms to
raise awareness of the project
and the benefits of blockchain
for healthcare users.

Communication to users is focused on safety and
security of patient data. Education on blockchain
technology is seen as a priority, to raise awareness,
gain trust and influence adoption of Medicalchain.
Innovators and early adopters will be the primary
target market for system trials. Influential users that
witness the benefits of Medicalchain will be the main
catalysts for further patient onboarding.
As we continue with awareness and onboarding
campaigns, Medicalchain will offer a service where it
will request healthcare records for consenting users.
Our legal team are working with system developers
to build API integration compliant with various international regulations. We acknowledge that some
countries may have barriers to the decentralization
of data and we are working with others to negotiate
these barriers.
The data migration process would require a user to
complete a short form of consent, highlighting the
providers they wish to obtain records from who they
had previously visited.
Physical documents will be scanned and mined
for information which will then be encrypted and
uploaded to data lakes. Electronic records will be
standardised, encrypted and uploaded.
Medicalchain is approaching clinicians individually
and at an organisational level. This multilevel
approach will allow for forward-thinking health
providers to test the Medicalchain platform
throughout their service but does not exclude innovative autonomous healthcare professionals. We
will work alongside clinicians to test the pilot with
consenting patients and assist providers with patient-targeted marketing material to improve user
adoption.

34

11.5 Route to market

The key incentives for clinical onboarding include:
Cost savings: Decreased need for repeat diagnostics,
decreased administrative costs for record retrieval/
transportation, decreased risk of errors associated
with inaccurate or unobtainable medical records.
Increased revenue: Access to global patients when
completing chargeable telemedicine consultations
complete with simultaneous up-to-date healthcare
records.
Non-profit organisations with the required
compliance documents and experience in handling
sensitive data, will have the opportunity to partner
with Medicalchain. Organisations will be incentivised
to act as secure nodes for holding encrypted health
data.
The key incentives for node onboarding include:
Financial incentivisation: MedTokens will be used
to support the maintenance of the node as well as
incentivise the hospital, university and/or non-profit
organisation to continue acting as a node.
Public relations opportunity: To be a node for
Medicalchain and part of an international community
of healthcare providers. An opportunity to be a leader
in the future of healthcare and become involved in
blockchain technology.

Research Institutes / Pharma
Medicalchain is currently in discussion with
several large pharmaceutical and health research
organisations. These organisations will have the
ability to request data from cohorts of users on
Medicalchain’s platform, and with their consent, use
their health records for research.

operation.
The token distribution mechanism will be controlled by a
Smart Contract; this involves a computer program that can be
executed on the Ethereum network or on a blockchain network
that is compatible with Smart Contract programming language.
They acknowledge and understand therefore that Medicalchain SA
(incl. its bodies and employees) assumes no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage that would result from or relate to
the incapacity to use MedTokens, except in case of intentional
misconduct or gross negligence.
MedTokens is based on the Ethereum protocol. Therefore, any
malfunction, unplanned function or unexpected operation of
the Ethereum protocol may cause the Medicalchain SA network
or Medicalchain SAs to malfunction or operate in a way that is
not expected. Ether, the native Ethereum Protocol account unit
may itself lose value in a similar way to MedTokens, and also
in other ways.
