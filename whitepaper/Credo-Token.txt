Blockchain Based Spam & Email Access Solution

Abstract
Email is broken. Spam costs the global economy $20 billion per year and still accounts for 70% of
all email. Existing regulatory and technological solutions have failed to eliminate the significant
monetary cost and negative externalities of unsolicited email and spam. Email access outside of
known contacts is difficult. Email access via cold emails is not good for either senders or
recipients; such messages are not responded to reliably and consume recipients’ valuable time.
Email access via introduction operates inefficiently through unreliable exchanges of social capital
and requires senders to have a maintained social path in their network to the recipient. These
problems with email present significant negative externalities and an inefficient mechanism of
exchange for email access. The solution is to establish a new market for email access in which
email senders contacting unknown recipients pay a fee for the email to either go through or be
responded to. The fee prices in and compensates recipients for the attention or action they
provide the email, and improves senders’ likelihood of attaining the attention or response of
recipients. The solution is implemented in two components: BitBounce and credo. BitBounce
implements filtering of emails from unknown contacts and the payment mechanism for email
receipt or response. The credo token is the primary unit of exchange that recipients are
compensated with, though Bitcoin and Tezzies will also be supported for convenience. Credo
serves the additional purpose of incentivizing adoption and continued use of the BitBounce
solution via distributions based on proof of usage.

Value Proposition

We propose the credo (pl. credos) as a token of exchange in a market for email access
that seamlessly integrates with existing email accounts and infrastructure. The Credo
plus BitBounce[1] solution provides:

2.

•

Recipients: reduced spam in inbox, restored productivity, compensation for
engagement with emails from unknown senders.

•

Senders: more reliable acquisition of recipient attention and response, improved
access to recipients who are currently difficult and valuable to contact (see 3.1 for
discussion of the value of email access corresponding to sender-recipient pairings).

State Change

The purpose of credo and BitBounce is to solve the problems of spam and email access.
Given that email usage is fast becoming global with 3.7 billion email users already [2],
solving these problems would create tremendous good through positively impacting a
large number of people.

2.1

Starting State

The starting state is a world with free email and many negative externalities. We can
discretize free email access into three separate classes, and then assess each class in turn:
2.1.1 Email between known contacts
Email between known contacts is generally fine. This case only becomes problematic if a
known sender abuses email access to a recipient (e.g. sending an excessively long series of
emails until a response is received).
2.1.2 Cold/unsolicited email
Cold emails take up time and cause loss of productivity. Specifically, they cause a
number of negative externalities including but not limited to: lost attention and
productivity, overload, difficulty finding the right information, lost time spent on
archiving and deleting cold emails, and other general negative effects associated with
spam and unsolicited email. These negative externalities have been estimated to cost the
global economy $20 billion per year[3] and US businesses $712 per employee each year in
lost worker productivity [4].

3

Cold emails constitute a significant portion of emails, with research finding 66 percent of
email reaching user inboxes is spam despite aggressive spam filters [4]. Other recent
estimates from experts at Microsoft and Google indicate that 70% of all global email is
still spam [3]. Existing regulations, such as the CAN-SPAM Act, and technology
solutions such as spam filters have been found to be largely ineffective at solving the
problem [5].
2.1.3 Email via introduction
Using a social-exchange theory model [6] of email communication, introductions operate
via exchanges of social capital. Such email access depends on the network of the sender
and the state of relationships in that network, which is much less efficient and reliable
than a financial market with clear pricing. Moreover, such introductions conflate email
access and referrals, which can be decoupled with email access and referral checking
happening via separate processes.

2.2

Goal State

The goal state is a world in which a market for email access has been established and
participation in the market for email access is pervasive and global. With that market
established, recipients will be sufficiently compensated for any cold/unsolicited emails
they receive. Moreover, it will be easy, efficient, and reliable to contact VIPs and other
recipients of sender-specific value via monetary rather than social exchanges.

2.3

Path

2.3.1 Components
There are two components to the path between the starting and goal states:
1. BitBounce technology solution: use the BitBounce service and technology to
solve the problems and facilitate the market for email access. This component of
the solution is closed source and is being patented.
2. Credo incentivized distribution: use credos to incentivize the adoption and
continued use of BitBounce.
2.3.2 Justification
There are two choices that require justification: 1) using a cryptographic token, and 2)
creating and using the credo token. For 1), the primary justifying reason to use a

4

cryptographic token rather than a conventional currency is that token transactions can
be confirmed in seconds or minutes rather than days which is necessary for timely
delivery of emails; there is a secondary, non-technological reason which is the marketing
benefit of using cryptographic tokens. For 2), the justifying reason for creating the credo
token is the need for more control over the proof of usage distribution of tokens (see 3.6).
Redistributing Bitcoin or some other token to correspond to use of BitBounce seems
infeasible. By creating a new token, we can distribute a much larger portion of the
token’s total supply in a way that corresponds to usage of BitBounce (see 3.4). Another
justifying reason to create our own token is that we can raise funds for BitBounce
through selling a portion of the tokens.
2.3.3 Timing
The idea of using payments to solve spam has been around for a while [7], but it has
only recently become feasible through the innovation of faster transaction confirmation
times found in cryptographic tokens. That innovation combined with the emergence of
Blockchain technology to facilitate token creation makes now the right time to finally
solve the spam and email access problems using this approach.
2.3.4 Spam Filter Use Case
The first use case for BitBounce is to act as a more effective spam filter, which solves the
spam problem. This works as follows:
1. A new user signs up and adds an email account.
2. The user then syncs and/or manually adds contacts to a whitelist.
3. Incoming emails received from addresses that are not on the whitelist are filtered
to an email folder called unpaid, and an auto-response is then sent to the original
email sender as illustrated in Figure 1.
4. The auto-response asks the sender to do one of the following:
a. Request to be on the whitelist, which puts their email address on the
recipient’s whitelist with a button to approve their membership.
b. Enter a recipient-generated promo code that will allow the email to go
through for free.
c. Pay a small fee for the email to go through.
5. If the sender does nothing, the email remains in the unpaid folder.

5

Figure 1. Auto-response Email

2.3.5 Incentivized Response Use Case
The second use case for BitBounce is to incentivize a response from a recipient, which
solves the email access problem. This works as follows:
1. A user composes an email to a listed VIP or arbitrary recipient (see Figure 2).
2. The user then specifies the fee to pay an arbitrary recipient or accepts the listed
price for VIPs.
3. The user sends the email.
4. The user is asked to pay the fee or pays automatically depending on their
account setup.
5. If the user pays, the email is sent to the recipient and another email is sent on
the email thread informing the recipient that an amount of cryptocurrency is
being held in escrow for them until they respond.
6. If the original recipient responds to the email thread then the response is then
automatically detected and the amount held in escrow is released.

6

Figure 2. Incentivized Response Feature

One challenge with this use case is ensuring responder authenticity. This is important
because senders would not want to pay for a response from some delegate such as a
secretary. Our initial approach will be to vet VIPs listed on our platform and have them
agree to terms and conditions that require them to personally respond in order to receive
the cryptocurrency incentive payment. At a later date, we can implement a more robust
and automated method by using one of the emerging user-device identity platforms to
automatically prove the identity of the responder.
2.3.6 Autopilot Use Case
The third use case for BitBounce is to automatically pay in Credo for emails to go
through to recipients. This reduces payment friction and still ensures the problems are
solved because the inbox only contains emails from people you know or those you’ve
been paid in Credo to receive.
We have developed a consumer and enterprise version of BitBounce Autopilot. The
enterprise version works by checking the from-address of incoming emails against the
company’s domain and then sending a Credo to the recipient user when there’s a match.
We are currently running a proof of concept with one enterprise for this and it is
generating non-trivial transaction volume (98 Credo transactions in the last 24 hours).
Given this enterprise is participating in the first pilot, we are subsidizing the proof of
concept by providing them with Credo and Ether for their transactions.

7

2.3.7 Existing Email Accounts
One of our primary design goals is to improve the state of email with minimal disruption
to users’ existing email experience. Users already have significant data in and habits
formed around specific email services, and so we want them to be able to continue using
their email setup of choice. This goal is accomplished through seamless integration of
BitBounce with existing email accounts. As soon as a user adds an email account,
BitBounce can sync their contacts to their whitelist and begin filtering spam (see 3.3 for
early usage data). The user can then continue using their existing email client (e.g.
Gmail, Outlook, etc.) with BitBounce operating in the background. In fact, we expect
that many users will only rarely directly access the BitBounce dashboard (see Figure 3),
especially as the plugins mature.
Figure 3. BitBounce Dashboard.

2.3.8 Plugins
In order to further accomplish the goal of improving users email experience with what
they are currently using, we intend to develop plugins for Gmail (see Figure 3 for design)
and Outlook that allow for the attaching of credos to an email message (as per 2.3.4).
These plugins will also facilitate easier adding of addresses to a whitelist via an Add to
BitBounce Whitelist button. Plugins for these services have already been developed for

8

Turing Cloud[8], and the experience from developing them will now be applied to
BitBounce plugins.
Figure 4. Design: BitBounce plugin for Gmail.

2.3.9 Scaling
There are two main systems to scale: BitBounce email processing and Credo
transactions.
Scaling BitBounce email processing: much of the initial scaling of BitBounce
can be done using experience the team gained from developing Turing Cloud. At
some point, BitBounce can be switched to a new architecture that shards
accounts across multiple databases, which would facilitate near infinite
scalability.

9

Scaling Credo transactions: some amount of improved scalability will come
from improvements in the scalability of Ethereum’s underlying blockchain by the
core developers (e.g. blockchain sharding). We also intend to conduct some
portion of transactions off the blockchain that will be settled when a wallet owner
wants to withdraw Credo; this will also help us avoid disproportionately large
transaction fees on micropayments.
2.3.10 Success
We will measure the success of our solution to the spam problem by the percentage of all
email accounts that have BitBounce active on them. We will consider our solution to the
spam problem to be more successful as this percentage increases.
We will measure the success of our solution to the email access problem by the volume of
Credo transactions sent via BitBounce, which will indicate the level of activity within
the market for email access that we have established. We will consider our solution to
the email access problem to be more successful as this transaction volume increases.

Distribution

3.1

Psychology Behind Adoption

Here is a look at the economic rationale for each party in using BitBounce:
•

•

Recipients who sign up to use BitBounce will have to specify or accept a default
price at which unknown senders can email them. Given that recipients have
specified or accepted such a price, they have determined a value for their
attention and a corresponding price at which they are willing to receive or
respond to such emails.
Senders will be able to see the price at which someone is willing to read or
respond to their email. If a sender decides to send an email for a given price, then
they have judged the value of the recipient’s attention or response to be worth
the cost.

Several types of sender-recipient pairing may find greater value in initiating
communication with each other via BitBounce. Some examples include entrepreneurs
contacting investors, salespeople contacting CXOs, and recruiters contacting candidates
(e.g. engineers).

3.2

Viral Marketing Effect
10

BitBounce has a viral marketing effect via auto-responses, whitelist notifications, and
Guaranteed Response emails. In data from early adoption, this effect has been nontrivial.

3.3

Growth in Fundamentals

We define an active user (AU or DAU) of BitBounce to be a user account that meets the
following conditions:
1) The user has at least one email account.
2) The BitBounce spam filter is enabled on the user’s email account(s).
3) Access to the user’s email account has not been revoked.
As of July 8th 2017, we can disclose that BitBounce currently has a user base of 7,832
active users that is growing at a rate of 41.4% WoW and 293% MoM. Active users have
added 654,950 whitelist members and we are now processing over 42,000 emails per day
on their behalf. The metric we place highest priority on is active user growth because we
expect this growth in fundamentals to be the primary cause of increased transaction
volume and the success of our solution in bringing about the goal state.
Figure 5. Chart and Metrics are as of July 8th 2017

3.4

Transaction Volume

The Autopilot Use Case (see 2.3.6) has started generating growing transaction volume.
As of the time of writing, 98 Credo transactions were sent in the last 24 hours with 151
attempted Credo transactions (logic to retry failed transactions – such as failures from

11

insufficient gas - will be implemented soon). These early indicators suggest that the
enterprise Autopilot version of BitBounce could be the largest driver of increasing Credo
transaction volume.
The total volume of transactions from other use cases remains low yet promising.

3.5

Reward Mechanisms

BitBounce stakeholders (contributors and shareholders in Turing Technology, Inc) will
be issued an allocation of credos in proportion to their contribution and/or ownership of
the parent company. Participants in the token pre-sale and sale will be rewarded with
credos in exchange for financial contributions in ether (ETH). The early adopter and
mainstream groups will be rewarded for usage of BitBounce. See 4.4 for a more detailed
breakdown.

3.6

Proof of Usage

Given that credos are implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain, a consensus algorithm
is not needed. However, consensus algorithms usually serve a secondary purpose as a
reward function. With this in mind, we will be introducing a new reward function called
Proof of Usage [9]. This function will reward actions that constitute usage of the
BitBounce technology. The following uses of BitBounce will be rewarded:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Enable BitBounce on an email account for a specific length of time.
BitBounce an unsolicited email.
Send a Guaranteed Response email.
Respond to a Guaranteed Response email.
Add more than one email account.
Get friends, colleagues, or associates to adopt BitBounce.

Actions will be rewarded according to varied weightings that are set for specific
promotional waves (see 3.6). We will additionally look into developing an algorithmic
usage score based on the credo transaction graph, though this unfortunately cannot
power a purely technical credo distribution mechanism because of reasons that we’ll now
address.

3.7

Fraud Prevention

One problem with proof of usage is that it’s susceptible to attack. Two significant attack
vectors are 1) automating usage that is supposed to be performed by a human, and 2)
having one entity create multiple identities in order to receive multiple rewards. Various

12

reputation and identity systems [10] have been developed to deal with this kind of
problem, yet they remain sufficiently inadequate that a purely technical solution does
not seem sufficient here.
Given this, our solution will be to iterate via a series of promotional waves to a proof of
usage reward scheme that maximizes the likelihood that rewarded actions have the
following properties:
1. A human performed the rewarded actions.
2. The human rewarded for the actions was not previously rewarded for taking such
actions.
In order to achieve these properties, we will utilize a combination of data science to
detect potential fraud, know your customer (KYC) for certain waves, varied weighting of
rewards to actions, and rewards for combinations or patterns of actions that would be
difficult to automate.

3.8

A New Email Standard

Ultimately, we aim to distribute credo by establishing the token as a new standard in
email. We will work to establish this new standard technologically through developing
extensions to existing email protocols such as SMTP and IMAP. Our non-technological
standardization efforts will focus on developing global recognition and trust in credo
through transparency, accountability, and continued innovation leadership.

3.9

A New Tradition-Based Norm

Gift giving is an ancient, cross-cultural tradition to demonstrate respect for an elder or
superior. This custom has been lost with digital relationships, but now Credo is the
modern revival of the honorable custom. We aim to establish a new norm grounded in
ancient tradition in which you send Credo to respect and honor your recipient’s time.
We will seek to establish this new norm through a marketing campaign that brands
Credo as the Token of Respect™ and encourages people to Send the Token of Respect™
[11].

Token Dynamics & Launch

4.1

Blockchain Implementation

Credo is implemented as an Ethereum-based token [12] on the Ethereum blockchain.
Credo complies with the ERC20 token standard [13].
The Credo team will closely monitor developments in public blockchains. There is a
possibility that if development of Ethereum stagnates or the Ethereum blockchain
becomes a less hospitable environment and other alternative blockchains such as Tezos
become more robust, we may choose to migrate Credo to another blockchain; in such a
case, all ownership positions would be preserved 1-to-1. If all public blockchains become
infertile grounds for Credo, we will develop/fork and operate our own blockchain.

4.2

Total Supply

14

The total supply of credos was determined during the Credo pre-sale. 1.37 billion credos
were created in total. To be precise, 1374729257.2286 credos exist.
Credo account totals are stored on the blockchain to 18 decimal places, so the smallest
unit of account for Credo is 0.000000000000000001 CREDO.

4.3

Non-inflation

There will be no inflation in credos. The Credo smart contract does not permit any new
tokens to be created.

4.4

Division of Tokens

The total supply for Credo tokens will be divided into four portions. These portions are
as follows:
Allocation: 40% of the supply will be sold to the public.
Justification: this allocation is needed in order to generate funds necessary for further
development and marketing of Credo and BitBounce. The allocation size gives token
purchasers a meaningful ownership stake in the token, and ensures a more decentralized
distribution of Credo. A portion of this supply was sold in presale, so 27.29% of the total
supply will be available for sale in the main public ICO.
Allocation: 30% reserved for a user growth pool.
Justification: this allocation is needed to perform the Proof of Usage distribution of
Credo and bootstrap the BitBounce network.
Allocation: 15% reserved for general company expenses.
Justification: this allocation is needed to cover expenses that the company may incur
beyond what can be covered with the token sale proceeds. For instance, salaries for
engineers brought onto the team could be paid for in Credo or with fiat purchased with
Credo from this allocation.
Allocation: 15% allocated to team members/shareholders in BitBounce’s parent
company.
Justification: this allocation is needed to a) reward team members and shareholders for
their significant contributions made to the development of BitBounce and Credo, and b)
to keep team member’s personal incentivizes aligned with the success of Credo, which is
important since the continued contributions of key persons on the team will remain
necessary for the foreseeable future.

15

4.5

Pricing

The price of Credo at the token sale will be set based on valuing 40% of the supply of
the tokens at $20 million US dollars. Following the token sale, the market will set the
price based on the price traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.

4.6

Team
•

•
•

4.7

Stewart Dennis is the founder and CEO of BitBounce. He has a degree in
Computer Science from Stanford University and leads all engineering for
BitBounce. He is also the lead engineer for Turing Cloud (owned and operated by
the same parent company as BitBounce), through which he has gained significant
expertise in email.
Alexis Roizen-Dennis leads design and branding for BitBounce.
Tim Draper is an investor in BitBounce and originator of the concept. He is the
founding partner of Draper Associates and DFJ.

Community

The team will seek to foster a strong community around Credo, and attract community
members who can give feedback and evangelize usage of the token and product.
A Credo Owners Facebook group has been set up to foster discussion and keep owners
informed of updates. Our partners in China have set up a WeChat group for Chinese
Credo owners. We will also set up a sub-Reddit for Credo. We will not have a Slack
group/channel because numerous other token Slack groups have been subject to phishing
attacks.

4.8

Compliance

The team behind Credo is working with outside legal counsel to ensure full compliance.
However, the emerging cryptographic token space is sparsely regulated right now. Our
goal is to be as compliant as possible within such a regulatory environment, and some
have raised the possibility that US securities regulations could apply. For the question of
whether they apply, the appropriate framework is the Howey Test established in SEC v.
Howey [14]. Our understanding and interpretation of this test is that credos do not pass
it because 1) ownership of Credo does not provide any ownership or related rights in a
company, 2) Credos are deployed in production and have real utility via the BitBounce
service, and 3) credos serve a distinct function more akin to application credits than a
financial instrument. That said, the contents of this document do not constitute legal
advice and we encourage prospective purchasers with concerns to consult with an

16

attorney. We expect the regulatory environment to evolve as the cryptocurrency space
matures and we will do everything we can to maintain compliance.

4.9

Risks

As with any cryptographic token, significant risks exist. These risks include potential
failures in the still new Ethereum platform and with BitBounce technology. Prospective
token purchasers ought to thoroughly assess the involved risks and know that
possibilities involving a catastrophic failure in underlying technology that wipe out token
value could happen. These risks will be further covered in the terms and conditions for
the sale.
We will endeavor to mitigate risks relating to BitBounce technology through rigorous
testing and through using Credo bounties for identification of security vulnerabilities.
We will mitigate risks relating to the Ethereum platform by monitoring other options for
public blockchains (see 4.1).

4.10 Smart Contract
The smart contract for Credo is available on GitHub [15]. In order to ensure security,
the token is based on the ERC20 standard with minimal deviations coupled with
inspiration from other ERC20 tokens such as the Ethereum token tutorial, the
FirstBlood token, and the BAT [16].

4.11 Token Pre-Sale
The Credo pre-sale took place from June 2nd to June 12th 2017. Over 26 million credos
were sold for 260.79 ETH. As of the time of writing, approximately 60% of the token
pre-sale proceeds have been liquidated and primarily used to build additional momentum
ahead of the token sale with a smaller portion used for general company expenses.

4.12 Token Sale
The Credo token sale is taking place on July 26th 2017. Approximately 40% of the total
supply of credos will be sold in the token sale. Instructions on how to participate will be
released on the BitBounce website, emailed to BitBounce users, and broadcast through
various media channels.

4.13 Use of Proceeds
The token sale proceeds will primarily be used on three areas:

17

•
•
•

Improving the BitBounce service through product improvements, recruiting
VIPs for email access, customer support, partnerships, etc.
Acquiring market share through additional viral growth mechanisms, paid
marketing, advertising, PR, etc.
Defending against threats via security enhancements, use of encryption,
proactive defense against any advanced persistent threats, protecting our
trademarks and the IP of our inventions, etc.

In executing on the above, we will expand the team. We will build out a small yet elite
engineering team to join Stewart along with a number of other hires for areas such as
marketing, business development, and customer service. A detailed budget has been
developed, yet some flexibility will be factored into the planned expenditures based on
evolving needs.
