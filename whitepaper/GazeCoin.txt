Introduction
A brief history of AR/VR content
The hype surrounding VR in 2015 and 2016 led many content producers, from small, independent
creators to major gaming/movie studios and established media companies, to jump into virtual
reality production with a voracity unseen since perhaps the dot-com explosion of the 1990s.
Major brands and advertisers, too, dove in headfirst for fear of being left behind on one of the
most promising leaps in mass media since the advent of the Internet. Because of the rush, many
of these brands (and the agencies that consulted them), didn’t take time to consider how these
VR campaigns, nearly all expensive, one-off branded content activations, would actually impact
important KPIs like brand awareness, social sentiment, website traffic and, most importantly, sales.
These branded VR (and in some cases, AR) content pieces, while certainly having “cool factor”
and temporary PR value, inevitably ended up existing in silos. Further, the content proved difficult
to reuse as evergreen content as VR just was not supported on many platforms, resulting in very
limited reach and low viewership (to be fair, this improved considerably by late-2016). Direct ability
to impact sales or drive viewer traffic to an actual purchase was way off the table. Predictably, by
early-2017, there were marketer rumblings of VR being a “bust”: ineffective, too expensive and
worst of all, impossible to measure. As with all nascent tech, the dreaded “gap of disappointment”
had arrived in full force.
Yet…
Today, VR and AR technology is still gaining tremendous momentum. According to IDC, the VR/AR
market is expected to reach $215B by 2021 (doubling every year for the next 3 years) with a
VR/AR device population greater than 100M units. Other analysts suggest a similar trajectory, with
some estimates even exceeding IDC’s. Facebook has acquired a total of twelve AR/VR companies
(most notably Oculus for $2B in 2014) and Google and Apple have also both invested heavily
in immersive media, highlighted most recently by their respective announcements of ARCore
and ARKit augmented reality dev kits available globally making AR a new standard for both the
Android and IOS mobile operating systems from now on. Hardware players are in, too: Microsoft,
Intel, Qualcomm, practically every player in consumer and enterprise tech as well as every major
Hollywood and gaming studio are significantly investing, staffing and preparing for this imminent
next wave.
Still, VR/AR will not grow on forecasts, staffing and hope alone. This medium will not grow without
monetization. That can’t happen without advertisers. Gaze Coin exists to bridge the gap between
the promise of VR/AR and the ability for brands and content owners to capitalize on it.

Gaze Coin is the solution for advertisers, content makers and
audiences in VR/AR.

5

The Problem
VR/AR monetization attempts to date:
20 th century models for 21st century technology
Presently, there is no universal ad-based, ad-driven mechanic for driving content inside VR
and AR. As a result, essentially, only two business models have been attempted in VR/AR —
people either pay up front, a la carte, for content downloads/streams or they pay via a content
subscription. This presents several issues:
1. Credit cards are a barrier to accessing premium content (in VR, you can’t get your card out / trying
to fill in credit card forms while immersed is difficult!).
2. There is no incentive other than curiosity for users to experience new and varied immersive content.
3. The ingenuity of user-driven content (customization, remixing, sharing of others’ content) remains
stifled until inherent copyright issues are solved. This is a legacy Internet media dilemma that
should not be imported into the new media of VR/AR.
4. Game currencies are still in their infancy in terms of portability across virtual worlds.
5. Perhaps most ominously, as we have learned through the contraction of the music business and
disruption of all media businesses over the past fifteen years, consumers are generally adverse to
paying for content and have forced prices downward. The plethora of free content across social
media exacerbates this.
Ad-supported models are very promising in VR/AR considering the wide breadth of potential
options (virtual signage, objects, storefronts, product placement, video/audio content, virtual
search), but have struggled to gain traction yet, due to hurdles like:
1. Applying traditional advertising models of the 2D web to VR/AR that require users to stop and
watch an ad makes immersion unworkable.
2. The current lack of an ad metric/data layer while creating and interacting with virtual assets.
The metaverse-in-progress needs to evolve.
3. Advertisers are reluctant to adopt VR/AR (beyond concerns of market penetration) because of
a fundamental problem with monetization VR/ AR consumption: how do you measure it (and
therefore determine ROI)?
Advertisers considered VR/AR as their number-two focus in 2017 for digital marketing technologies,
according to AdMaster Mobile.1 Yet, business models that work in web/mobile do not work in VR/AR as VR and AR are fundamentally different mediums because literally everywhere you go, look or touch
in VR and AR can be monetized.

The Solution
Gaze Coin fixes the main problem with monetizing VR/AR:
How do you measure it (and therefore calculate ROI)?
Using patent-registered technology, Gaze Coin is the only VR/AR blockchain token (unit of exchange)
measured by gaze control/eye tracking. By measuring “gaze”, Gaze Coin creates a model for
advertising in VR/AR environments (from short-form experiences and simple digital objects all the
way to fully-rendered virtual worlds) at the heart of how mixed reality is created and consumed
through the eyes of the beholder. Brands can use eye-tracking in a myriad of ways: to evaluate their
packaging designs, advertising, and online shopping behavior, in order to optimize the customer
experience. Metrics include engagement (number of fixations, dwell time, % of time in an area), ease
of processing (fixation duration), findability (time to first fixation and number of fixations prior to first
fixation), order of processing (gaze path), comprehension (repeat fixations) and excitement (pupil
dilation). All of those analytics metrics are built into the Gaze Coin development roadmap.

Benefits
1. I mmutable (once a transaction is recorded, cannot be changed - only updated with another
transaction; record visible to all stakeholders)
2. M
 easurable (specific and quantitatively verifiable)
3. V
 alidates Engagement (stakeholders have visibility into exactly what assets users are engaging
with, interacting with, viewing, etc.)
4. C
 ustomizable, Expandable (content creators/owners can mint their own token)
5. U
 seful for all things VR/AR (token has a wide variety of uses and can measure content, objects,
spaces, avatars and more)
6. N
 on-Disruptive (operates seamlessly in the background without programming intervention)
7. S
 calable (distributed and decentralized using Ethereum and later scalable through Plasma. The
blockchain will be able to scale alongside the metaverse.)

7

What is Gaze Control?
Gaze control is a tool used by VR and AR creators allowing audiences to trigger content by looking
in the direction of the content (oftentimes cued by spatial audio). This ensures the content launches
only when a user is ready to experience it, similar to a user “clicking through” on traditional web/
mobile media. Empowered to engage in their own time according to their true interests, gaze control
gives audiences agency while immersed.

How Gaze Control Works in VR

1 ) USER / FAN shows
interest in content

2) Gaze triggers an
immersive environment

3) USER / FAN disolves into
an immersive environment

Gaze Coin Defined
Introducing a unit of exchange measured by Gaze:
A win-win-win for content owners, advertisers and users.
Gaze Coin uses the concept of “gaze” to create a business model for VR and AR by creating a unit
of exchange between content owners, advertisers and users measured initially by gaze and then,
more specifically, through eye tracking. By charging advertisers for the time users spend genuinely
engaged, content owners are incentivized to provide the most engaging content. Further, the model
rewards users for consuming that content, allowing it to be offered for free.

The economics and token flow in the Gaze Coin ecosystem
is as follows:
Using eye tracking, Gaze Coin calculates the exact amount of time users spend either looking at
specific content (including objects) and/or the specific amount of time they spend immersed inside
content. It then creates a micro-transaction that:
• charges the advertiser for that time,
• pays the content owner, and
• rewards the user for consuming the content.

8

Gaze Coin is the killer app for immersive advertising, allowing
brands to:
• calculate precise ROI on VR/AR advertising and other VR/AR activations,
• collect meaningful data on consumer behavior in VR/AR, and
• evolve the ad format from interruptive ads that obstruct VR/AR experiences to more native,
engaging formats including even becoming the entire experience.
Gaze Coin also includes a mechanism that calculates and tracks content as it is changed and/or
added to inside VR/AR - storing that information in its proprietary blockchain.

Gaze Coin is the killer app for tracking copyright in VR/AR,
allowing rights holders to:
• track content as it is created and changed in VR/ AR (remixed, versioned, addended, transferred,
licensed, sold, discontinued, etc.) as well as track its consumption,
• collect meaningful data on content usage, lifecycle and audience engagement, and
• manage correct, appropriate payments to respective parties.
The Gaze Coin blockchain ensures that advertisers, content owners and users receive payments
and data calculated precisely from user engagement and allows that data to be scrutinized openly
without any hidden factors.
Accurately calculated and accessible engagement-based transactional data, together with precise
monetization calculations, is the VR/AR business model holy grail; an engine that funds the
expansion of content and elevates the synergy between stakeholders.
• Advertiser is incentivized to place ads/branded content by growing user reach/engagement,
•C
 ontent owners are incentivized to provide quality content by advertiser patronage and growing
user reach/engagement,
•U
 sers are incentivized by content owner rewards and quality content, resulting in larger reach and
engagement that advertiser wants.

Incentives are aligned in a symbiotic way that encourages
ecosystem growth = win-win-win

9

GazeCoin Token (GZE)
Technical Specifications
The patent-registered Gaze Coin (GZE) blockchain accomplishes two main functions:
1. Auditability of gaze payments
2. Provenance of virtual content
Mechanics: First, Gaze Coin securely stores ownership data about content assets in VR and AR
(objects, experiences, environments, worlds). Then, it embeds transactional metadata (linked to
telemetry data of the user action that triggered the transaction: gaze) across all micro transactions
involving those assets. This information is directly available to the advertiser and content owner and
cannot be forged. As content is added and remixed in the virtual world, the blockchain creates an
indelible audit trail of these changes, enabling long-tail royalty payments to content owners.
Token Specifications: Initially, GZE will be an ERC20 token with smart contracts on the Ethereum
network. GZE will migrate to its own ‘proof of stake’ blockchain when the Plasma or OmiseGO
blockchain becomes available.
Platform Compatibility: GZE will be open sourced and interoperable with both Ethereum and
Bitcoin. Content owners and advertisers alike will be able to create their own native tokens on the
Gaze Coin blockchain, providing a platform for VR/AR developers (content owners, brands, artists,
creators) to launch their own coins unique to their brand. These tokens are able to be traded within
the Gaze Coin decentralized exchange by users, increasing liquidity and utility of the token.
Other Requirements: Transactions on the Gaze Coin blockchain must be paid in GZE and GZE is
required to create and forge new tokens.
The Gaze Coin blockchain gives all stakeholders the freedom, security and material incentive needed
while at the same time building value in the GazeCoin token itself.

Gaze Coin API Can Be Used Anywhere
The Gaze Coin API and wallet allow gaze to be measured and monetized in any VR or AR content
(experiences, environments, worlds). Further, all stakeholders (content owners, advertisers, users) are
incentivized to integrate the Gaze Coin API into content that they are either creating or recommending.
Consider the following examples:

Gaze Coin in a virtual world (with-advertiser example)
Front-End Action: Suppose there is a DJ who is sponsored by Red Bull, Vans and Quiksilver.
A fan of the DJ enters the VR world and is drawn to the DJ’s virtual nightclub by spatial audio
(akin to how music lures fans to where the DJ is in real life). By ‘gazing’ at the nightclub for long
enough to show interest, the fan dissolves into the nightclub interior.
Backend Gaze Coin Action: Gaze Coin makes a ‘gaze’ calculation based on how long the fan
remains immersed within the nightclub and facilitates the following transactions across our key
three stakeholders:
The advertiser payment to the DJ (content owner) based on how long the fan remains immersed
within the music (inside the nightclub) includes two portions:
• One for the DJ to keep, and
• One for the DJ to reward the fan (user) for participating/consuming. The reward (in the form of a
blockchain contract) in this example can take the form of merchandise, tickets to gigs or any other
item of value from DJ to fan.

1 ) USER / FAN shows interest in
a DJ (CONTENT OWNER)

2) USER / FAN gaze triggers an immersive environment,
USER / FAN disolves into the nighclub interior

4) DJ (CONTENT OWNER) rewards GazeCoin to
USER / FAN based on engagement (gaze)

3) ADVERTISER pays GazeCoin to DJ (CONTENT OWNER)
based on duration of USER / FAN engagement (gaze)

11

Gaze Coin in an AR app (no advertiser example)
Front-End Action: Walking down a real-world street, an augmented-reality digital doorway appears overlaid
over a common public place in the real world. When gazing at the doorway for long enough to show
interest, the doorway is opened and the user is transported to another augmented-reality environment.
Backed Gaze Coin Action: Gaze Coin makes a gaze calculation based on how long the user looks at
the doorway and how long the user remains in the augmented-reality environment. It then facilitates
the following transactions across our key two stakeholders:
• The User Growth Pool (explained on pg. 12) pays the content owner of the AR environment.
• The User Growth Pool pays the user a reward for the time spent consuming the AR content.
A GazeCoin payout simulation/calculator containing Engagement, Gaze Path, Fixation Duration,
Hang Time, Repeat Fixation, and Pupil Dilation variables is available at https://gazecoin.io.

Gaze Coin for Tracking Digital
Copyright in VR/AR
Particularly relevant use cases for tracking copyright in VR/AR include 3D objects (gaming weapons/
skins, hologram characters/avatars or branded virtual items, for example), music (which is often
remixed), and user-generated content (UGC) based on copyrighted material. Gaze Coin calculates
how each asset fragment is consumed and creates a micropayment payable to content owners
accordingly. Consider the following example whereby users change a digital asset (in this case,
players adding new capabilities to an avatar in a game):
When the avatar is originally added to the game, the blockchain generates a unique ‘trackable’ token
for that avatar. Although players may purchase the same avatar at first, whenever each player buys
different moves for the character, the avatar is then considered altered and unique to that player. Gaze
Coin uses a process called ‘forging’ to track and monetize both the avatar fragment and the move
fragment. Thus, as new moves are created, they, too, have their own token. When the two are brought
together, a new ‘forged’ token is generated made up of the fragments of content (the character plus
the unique moves) that make up that character. If the character earns money, the revenues flow back
via the tracking token to the rights holders/creators of the fragments accordingly.

A unique trackable token
is created when a PLAYER
AVATAR is added to game

PLAYER AVATAR
uses GazeCoin to
purchase moves

After purchase, the PLAYER
AVATAR becomes an ALTERED
PLAYER AVATAR with new
moves added as fragments

GazeCoin

If the ALTERED PLAYER AVATAR earns GazeCoin, the revenue flows back to the
RIGHTS HOLDER / CREATOR according to respective content fragments

12

Ecosystem Kickstart
User Growth Pool Makes Content Free / Rewards Content Makers
in Near-Term
Because content first needs an audience to attract advertisers,
Gaze Coin will launch with a model that incentivizes audiences
to experience content - by paying them in GazeCoin - to build
near-term audience reach. The “User Growth Pool” provides an
egg to solve the proverbial chicken-and-egg dilemma affecting all
new technology.
Specifically, the Gaze Coin ICO allocates 10% of tokens to the User Growth Pool. As such, when no
advertiser is yet in place, content owners and users earn a micropayment based on the amount of
time users are immersed inside content.
Gaze Coin will continue to reward content owners/creators and users for providing premium content
experiences. 1% of total transactions involving Gaze Coin across all networks, content and worlds
flows in replenishing the User Growth Pool.

What crypto-currencies are accepted in the crowdsale?
ETH will be accepted in the crowd sale. You will be required to have an Ethereum wallet of which
you control the private key pointed at the token/ crowdsale address to participate in the crowd
sale. GZE are Ethereum-derived tokens. If you hold BTC, or some other crypto-currency, it can be
exchanged for ETH and used to participate in the crowd sale.
Technology Demo
Gaze Coin will deliver a fully immersive VR experience/environment using Gaze Coin technology
prior to the start of the ICO. The demo will be built upon the Dream Channel virtual world created
by Gaze Coin founder Jonny Peters as showcased at the Cannes Film Festival May 2017. The app
and world will demonstrate key elements of immersive technology, including spatial audio cues and
gaze-triggered content, and it will output user engagement telemetry.

14

Gaze Bounty (GB)
1% of the total supply of GZE has been set aside for community bounties. The community is invited to
earn a proportion of this bounty by participating in the ICO process. As a special incentive, Gaze Bounty
has been created as a reward to participants who experience and/or promote Gaze Coin prior to the sale.
Participants will be allocated a specific amount of GB for promoting Gaze Coin on blogs, tweets and
other social media as well as for participating in the aforementioned tech demo. They will share
1% of tokens pro rata based on the sum total of GB they have earned. Participants can access the
Dream Channel virtual world through the Dream Channel VR apps on Steam, Vive, or Samsung
GearVR. More details regarding the bounty GB can be found at https://gazecoin.io.
What Amount is Being Raised? What is the Token Cap?
There is a hard cap of $35 million. Tokens will be sold at a fixed rate equivalent to 35 US cents per
GZE in ETH, until the ICO period ends or the hard cap is reached. The exact ETH to GZE conversion
rate will be announced shortly before the ICO start date.
If the minimum funding amount of $2 million isn’t reached, all ETH will be refunded.
Irrespective of whether the minimum $2 million or $35 million is raised, the total amount of tokens
sold during the presale summed with the total of tokens sold in the public sale will represent 70% of
the supply of all GZE. These will be sold in the crowd sale at a price that is the equivalent of US$0.35
each. The exact price is TBA closer to the ICO date.
Reward for Content Owners Who Provide Premium Content Experiences
A 1% licensing fee will accrue on all Gaze Coin transactions. This is paid as a reward to content
providers who provide premium content experiences (allocated pro rata to the most popular content
once initial user growth pool exhausted). Content providers earn from this pool proportional to the
total gaze time that was generated on the platform each day.
How will Gaze Coin use ETH Raised During Token Launch?
The ETH received in the crowd sale will be used by Gaze Coin to build a mixed reality (MR) platform
integrated with the Gaze Coin blockchain that provides developer tools allowing advertisers and
content producers to create the immersive entertainment worlds of the future. The platform/API
features, detailed in Appendices A and B, are demonstrated in a functional proof-of-concept: “Dream
Channel VR” (Dream Channel). Dream Channel is a first-person, open-universe, open-source
survival MMORPG (accessible via the Dream Channel VR app on Vive, Steam and GearVR). The
game rewards any content creator, advertiser or user in Gaze Coin to integrate Gaze Coin API into
their respective VR/AR content - allowing monetization through gaze.
Tokens Linked to Virtual-Land Bonuses
As further incentive, all participants in the token sale who spend more than US$5,000 receive a
virtual-land bonus. As virtual real estate zones become where high-profile content owners, advertisers
and users cluster (VR/AR content “hotbeds”), the prices of virtual-land in those areas will increase.
These virtual-land bonuses are already built and can be viewed inside the Dream Channel VR app.
Funding Milestones & Deliverables / Road Map
The Gaze Coin team has seven clear milestones as targets for the token sale proceeds, outlined in
Funding Milestones / Roadmap.

Gaze Coin Summary
Finally, We Can All Make Money in VR/AR
Blockchain technology is an essential component in a new
model for the VR/AR ecosystem. A user might easily engage
with ten pieces of content during a brief visit to a virtual world or
experience, meaning there could effectively be tens of thousands
of transactions to record, track and make micropayments against.
Moreover, in a world where content is frequently augmented or
altered, it is challenging to accurately attribute exposure and credit
to owners/creators. Further adding to the complexity is the massive
amount of participants in the transactions - advertisers, content
owners/creators and individual consumers.
The Gaze Coin platform was specifically designed to solve the monetization challenges of VR/AR
content, indeed the monetization challenges of the metaverse itself. A blockchain-enabled solution
that securely stores ownership and transaction data about content assets in VR/AR, tracking and
managing micropayments associated with content consumption, Gaze Coin empowers content
owners, advertisers and users to create, build and experience the VR/AR ecosystem with stability
and trust.
The platform’s unit of currency is Gaze Coin’s own Ethereum-based token, GZE. This token will be
available for content owners/creators, advertisers, and users to buy and sell in-experience, and to
exchange for Ethereum tokens.
As consumers increasingly embrace VR and AR, they expect content producers and brands to
be there with engaging content to capture their attention. Gaze Coin provides the infrastructural
backbone of the VR/AR creative economy, delivering the fairness, trust, security and exchange
mechanism required to ensure creativity can flourish. With Gaze Coin handling ownership data,
transaction tracking and micropayments, content owner, advertiser and user stakeholders alike
can focus on their core competencies: providing the next generation of amazing experiences,
worlds and universes.

16

Funding Milestones/Roadmap
Gaze Coin is building a mixed-reality platform (already initiated,
as featured at the Cannes Film Festival May 2017) in tandem
with and powered by the Gaze Coin blockchain. This provides
developers with the functional tools to create the virtual worlds
of the future - taking audiences from the real world to the virtual
world and back again. The platform roadmap includes:
(I)

US$2 Million
Gaze Coin API / WALLET

	The Gaze Coin wallet powers immersive interactions by measuring, conducting and
then storing any associated transactions and/or token coins. The Gaze Coin API is able
to integrate with any VR/AR content (experience, environment, world) and features a
developer toolkit allowing monetization through advertising and gaze-triggered
audience engagement.

(II) US$5 Million
	
VIRTUAL/AUGMENTED REAL ESTATE (CONNECTED 3D VR/AR WORLDS) + SOCIAL
NETWORK ENGINE
	Gaze Coin is developing a powerful virtual real estate and social network toolkit to function
throughout the decentralized platform. Developed from the first use case of Dream
Channel VR, an environment already built containing virtual cities connected through an
overarching story narrative, the Gaze Coin API will progress to allow unique, custom and
connected virtual worlds.

(III) US$12 Million
	
PROCEDURAL ENGINE DRIVING AUTOMATED VIRTUAL WORLD GENERATION
	Gaze Coin will build a procedural engine allowing developers to build theoretically infinite
immersive worlds created through random procedural generation and deterministic
algorithms. A single seed number will be used to create world features via mathematical
computation, eliminating the need to create each feature by hand. Content creators
(developers) will create a base level design for the look and feel of a singular element (a
street, structure or block, for example) and then let the code replicate this for an entire city.

(IV) US$20 Million
	
NAVIGATION SYSTEMS / TOLLWAYS BETWEEN WORLDS:
THE WORMHOLE TRANSPORT SYSTEM
	Gaze Coin will build a transport system within the platform that allows users to teleport
themselves from one virtual world to another: the Wormhole Transport System (WTS).

For the metaverse to reach its full potential, users need both a means and incentive

17

to navigate between worlds and world builders also need an incentive to create these
connections. Gaze Coin is the incentive, the Wormhole Transport System is the means.

(V)

US$ 25 Million
CHOOSE-YOUR-OWN-ADVENTURE STORY ENGINE

	Gaze Coin will develop the choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) story engine. Stories are
the true drivers of VR/AR worlds. Story is what keeps audiences engaged and immersed.
Content creators (developers, world builders) will be able to use the Gaze Coin CYOA story
engine to create the immersive narratives of the future.

(VI)

US$30 Million
MIXED REALITY PLATFORM

	
Gaze Coin will develop the fully-functional Gaze Coin mixed-reality (MR) platform that
will employ the AR cloud to power persistent VR/AR worlds. The vision is to connect the
real world and the immersive world as seamless environments where all interactions are
measured and monetized through gaze.

(VII) US$35 Million
EPIC MIXED REALITY GAME
	Gaze Coin will develop a fully developed epic eSports MR game that puts the entire
Gaze Coin platform into action - an R&D test bed for all stakeholders (content creators/
developers, advertisers and users). All revenues generated from the game will flow through
to fund the User Growth Pool. The game will test and prove every aspect of the Gaze Coin
ecosystem and will be the means of marketing and promoting itself. eSports teams can
compete in a winner-take-all matchup for GazeCoin token.

18

Team
The Gaze Coin team is made up of entrepreneurs, scientists,
blockchain and financial experts, entertainment execs and
VR/AR producers/world builders. Possessing several decades
of experience, an eye on the future and an ideal mix of diverse
expertise, this team is poised to win.

APPENDIX A
Gaze Coin Roadmap
Although there has been considerable disillusionment among advertisers with VR/AR after the
growing pains of 2015-2016, the medium continues to gain impressive momentum. A market
expected to double every year for the next three years, reaching $215B by 2021, immersive media
represents one of the greatest technological leaps in the modern age, a tremendous opportunity for
advertisers and content producers alike. Despite analyst optimism, there is still a glaring deficiency
in the VR/AR ecosystem; one that threatens to undermine all its potential until solved: it remains
astonishingly difficult to monetize VR and AR. Business models that work in web/mobile do not
work in VR/AR - as VR/AR is a fundamentally different medium because literally everywhere you go,
look or touch in VR and AR can be monetized.
Gaze Coin is specifically designed to solve the challenges of monetizing VR/AR. Using patented
technology, Gaze Coin is a VR/AR blockchain token (unit of exchange) measured by gaze control/
eye tracking. By measuring “gaze”, the token creates a model for advertising in VR/AR environments
(from short-form experiences and simple digital objects all the way to fully-rendered virtual worlds)
at the heart of how mixed reality is created and consumed: gaze control.
A seamless, scalable and secure solution providing advertisers, content owners and users the engine
to measure and monetize true engagement inside VR and AR, Gaze Coin even allows stakeholders
to launch their own branded tokens to power their unique, respective content (experiences,
environments, worlds) in turn. Gaze Coin exists to bridge the gap between the promise of VR/AR
and the ability for brands and content owners to capitalize on it.
Gaze Coin is both the killer app for VR/AR advertising and tracking copyright (DRM) in VR/AR.
The Gaze Coin ecosystem is delivered through a mixed-reality platform with developer toolkit
that allows the community to build blockchain tracked worlds where every audience action is
incentivized and monetized.

This Appendix provides a detailed road map for the development
of the ecosystem.

24

Gaze Coin Functional Lab:
The Dream Channel VR Virtual World
Gaze Coin is building a mixed-reality (MR) platform powered by
the Gaze Coin blockchain. To kick off this platform, the Gaze Coin
team has launched the Dream Channel VR (Dream Channel)
“open-universe” game.
Dream Channel is the first version of the larger MR platform and will serve as a functional proof of
concept, critical first use case and working demonstration of the Gaze Coin blockchain. Gaze Coin
will make all the tools created for this available for the entire Gaze Coin ecosystem (including the MR
platform) and it will be these same tools developers can use to create the virtual worlds of the future.

Funding Milestones /
Development Roadmap
The following serves as a detailed roadmap of Gaze Coin platform development, containing
milestones that will be unlocked with each funding target met.

(I)

US$2 Million
Gaze Coin API/WALLET
Timeline: 6 months

Phase 1 of Gaze Coin development is the completion of the Gaze Coin wallet and API. The
wallet powers immersive interactions by measuring, conducting and then storing any associated
transactions and/or token coins. The API able to be integrated with any VR/AR content (experience,
environment, world) and feature a developer toolkit that allows monetization through advertising
and audience engagement.
Wallet/API Key Features:
1. Visual interface that allows users to better understand, view and trade their token coins.
2. Ability for users to exchange Gaze Coin across any VR/AR experience, environment or world
using the Gaze Coin API.
3. Ability for users to launch their own branded token coins, exchange branded token coins between
VR/AR experiences, environments and worlds, and participate in a wholly secondary market for
branded token coins.
4. Seamlessly allows value transfer from the virtual world to the real world and back again.

25

Example In Practice:
A user’s actions in VR/AR, such as spending over a certain threshold of time inside a specific
experience, finding a specific virtual object/”easter egg”, completing a game level or sharing content,
can be programmed to generate a VIP token sent to their wallet. The token may provide the user
with access to real-world rewards: discounts, event access, exclusive content, etc. This can also
work for transferring ownership of real-world assets: money, physical property, etc.

NIGHT CLUB (real world) <<<< WALLET <<<< VIP TOKEN <<<< VR WORLD EXPERIENCE

(II)

US$5 Million

		VIRTUAL/AUGMENTED REAL ESTATE (CUSTOM CONNECTED 3D VR/AR
ENVIRONMENTS) & SOCIAL NETWORK ENGINE
		

Timeline: 12 months

Phase 2 of Gaze Coin development involves a toolkit empowering virtual real estate growth and
social network functions throughout the decentralized ecosystem of the MR platform. Developed
from Dream Channel, where the team has already built virtual cities connected through an
overarching story narrative, the Gaze Coin API will progress to allow unique, custom virtual worlds.
Virtual Real Estate/Environment Key Features:
1. Ability to calculate and collect rent payments on virtual-land.
2. Ability to launch custom (branded) VR/AR experiences, environments, storefronts and worlds (and
use branded token there if desired).
3. Integration with Gaze Coin to track and manage ownership and financial transactions.
4. Property value appreciation via premium content (the more users engage with content, virtual
areas become recognized as “premium content generation zones” driving up property value).
Social Network Key Features:
1. Integrated content/user ranking and reward systems (monetized using Gaze Coin).
2. User-generated content channels Dream Channel Virtual-Land Bonus with Gaze Coin ICO.
As part of the Gaze Coin token sale, participants who spend more than US$5,000 receive virtual
land packages.

26

Token Sale / Land Packages:

(i) US$ 5,000
		

VIRTUAL APARTMENT

		Virtual apartments are located in city hot spots and are used by VR/AR talent, content
rights holders and advertisers to broadcast immersive experiences to their global audience.
Don’t miss out on this limited offer. Visit www.gazecoin.io for offer details.

(ii)	US$ 10,000
		

VIRTUAL PENTHOUSES WITH ADDED WORMHOLE FUNCTIONALITY

		Virtual penthouses will feature connected wormholes lined with immersive content, linking
into any number of chosen connected worlds. They also create an entry/exit point at a
random location in the real world creating a doorway accessible using AR. Wormholes to
and from penthouses also function as ‘toll-ways’ in between virtual worlds, measured in
gaze coin - paid to toll-way owners.

(iii) US$ 50,000
		

VIRTUAL STREET

		A virtual street comprises of 15 x Virtual apartments and 4 x Virtual Penthouses. As an
owner you can choose to have a street inside one of the themed Dream Channel sectors or
you can choose to locate your street separate or located anywhere else in the metaverse that
you choose. The Gaze Coin API provides the street with all existing functionality including
content / talent rankings etc.

27

(iv) US$ 100,000
		

VIRTUAL SUBURB

		A virtual suburb comprises of 4 x city blocks which includes 12 Virtual Penthouses and 40
Virtual Apartments. As an owner you can choose to link the suburb to any one of the themed
Dream Channel sectors or you can choose to locate your suburb separately located anywhere
else in the meta-verse. The Gaze Coin API provides the suburb with all existing functionality
including talent ranking system that the apartments on the main street according to popularity.

(v) US$ 250,000
		

VIRTUAL CITY

		A Virtual City consists of 8 City Sectors that add virtual apartments on the fly as residents
join. Cities come complete with an integrated social network that allows messaging between
residents, an AR app that allows the community to access the VR world from the real world
- and of course a full monetization model using ‘gaze’ and Gaze Coin. The city is designed
and branded to your needs.

28

(III)

US$12 Million

		

PROCEDURAL ENGINE DRIVING AUTOMATED VIRTUAL WORLD GENERATION

		

Timeline: 12 months

Phase 3 of Gaze Coin development is the build of a procedural engine allowing developers to
build theoretically infinite immersive worlds created through random procedural generation
and deterministic algorithms. A single seed number will be used to create world features via
mathematical computation, eliminating the need to create each feature by hand. Content creators
(developers) will create a base level design for the look and feel of a singular element (a street,
structure or block, for example) and then let the code replicate this for an entire city.

		

Proof of Concept - Dream Channel Game

		Gaze Coin plans to develop the potential of this engine and create an effective research and
development lab for all Gaze Coin developers through an epic ‘open-universe’ survival game using
the engine: Dream Channel. Dream Channel is outlined in detail in Appendix B: Game Outline.
		

Procedural Engine Key Features:

		

1. Deterministic algorithm generates unique configurations of virtual assets (virtual
elements, spaces, time/era constructs, etc.),

		

2. Allows the same content to be experienced by different people differently (with certain
attributes - imagery or POV for example - slightly altered) or by the same person
differently every time they consume it.

29

(IV)	US $20 Million
		NAVIGATION SYSTEMS/TOLLWAYS BETWEEN WORLDS: THE WORMHOLE
TRANSPORT SYSTEM
		

Timeline: 18 months

Phase 4 of Gaze Coin development is building a transport system within the MR platform that
allows users to teleport themselves from one virtual world to another: the Wormhole Transport
System (WTS). For the metaverse to reach its full potential, users need both a means and incentive
to navigate between worlds. Likewise, VR/AR content owners/creators (world builders) also need
an incentive to create these connections. The WTS accomplishes both aims with the key features
outlined below.
Wormhole Transport System Key Features:
Wormholes are lined with immersive content to entertain “along the ride.” Wormholes serve as
tollways between worlds where Gaze Coins and other custom token coins are exchanged. Wormhole
travel creates a micropayment that rewards user for going on the journey and pays content owner/
creator for providing the immersive content lining the wormhole (paid from the User Growth Pool.
The navigation system uses the Procedural Engine to replicate on the fly and can be used for both
intraworld and interworld travel.
a)

WTS Internal (Intraworld) Navigation System (Simple Wormholes)
Audiences can engage a simple navigation system allowing them to teleport between
sectors of a world; each one a different chapter of the story, level of a game, separate
content piece, etc.

30

b)

WTS External (Interworld) Navigation System (Tollway Wormholes)
Tollway wormholes are where tokens are exchanged from one world’s to another - we
expect mini exchanges to emerge at important junctions, where this can take place.

		

Proof of Concept - VR Radio

		The foundations of the WTS have been built as a concept called VR Radio. VR Radio allows
users to visit a music-driven virtual world, choose an artist, then travel on a wormhole
ride through their favorite music track where, powered by the Procedural Engine, shapes,
landscapes and objects morph and bend to the beat of the music in a unique way (no two
journeys are ever the same).
		The immersive experience is measured in ‘gaze’ with microtransactions flowing back to the
rights holders of the music. This experience is part of the tech demos accompanying the
Gaze Coin ICO. Users can download the VR Radio app, go on a series of wormhole rides,
and then receive a sample Gaze calculation.

31

(V)	US$25 Million
		

CHOOSE-YOUR-OWN-ADVENTURE STORY ENGINE

		

Timeline: 18 months

Phase 5 of Gaze Coin development is the choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) story engine. Stories
are the true drivers of VR/AR worlds and what keep audiences engaged and immersed. Content
creators (developers, world builders) will be able to use the Gaze Coin CYOA story engine to create
the immersive narratives of the future.
The success and failure of any virtual world depends upon the narrative and resultant ability for the
audience to engage with the story. The Gaze Coin MR platform tools will allow creators to create a
set of complex interactions with story characters and allow users to change the outcome of the story
based on their actions. The complexity required to make the engine work for a VR/AR story narrative
is considerable. The engine specifications also include a cross-platform developer tool for traditional
filmmakers to integrate VR/AR elements with feature films that have a ‘virtual reality’ bend (such as
Steven Spielberg’s “Ready Player One”). Today, traditional filmmakers struggle with a means to add
virtual worlds to their cinema-focused narratives. In this way, the Gaze Coin platform creates not
only a monetized solution for traditional filmmakers but a mechanism for crossing platforms, pulling
audiences into the immersive ecosystem.
		

Proof of Concept - CYOA

		Dream Channel features a CYOA VR game experience showcased at the Cannes Film
Festival May 2017. In this experience, audiences can play multiple characters and the
decisions they make change the outcome. Audiences must earn enough Gaze Coin to pay
gatekeepers, to purchase weapons and to buy moves that they will need in battle with
other players.

MIXED REALITY PLATFORM

		

Timeline: 24 months

Phase 6 of Gaze Coin development is the fully-functional Gaze Coin MR platform that will employ
the AR cloud to power persistent VR/AR worlds. The vision is to connect the real world and the
immersive world as seamless environments where all interactions are measured and monetized
through gaze.
The Gaze Coin team is relentlessly committed to a strong focus:
• To build and advance the cohesion between the real world and the metaverse.
• To build and advance the cohesion between virtual worlds in the metaverse.
AR Applications
As the MR platform will track a user’s gaze through any device, the applications of such a platform
are virtually endless (pun intended). From ordering clothes worn by others in the real world, to
adding building blocks to location-based AR worlds with every object monetized, the applications are
theoretically as vast as the human imagination.

(VII) US$35 Million
		

EPIC MIXED REALITY GAME

		

Timeline: 24 months

Stage 7 of Gaze Coin development is a fully-developed epic eSports MR game that puts the entire
Gaze Coin platform into action - an R&D test bed for all stakeholders (content creators/developers,
advertisers and users). All revenues generated from the game will flow through to fund the User
Growth Pool. The game will test and prove every aspect of the Gaze Coin ecosystem and will be the
means of marketing and promoting itself. eSports teams can compete in a winner-take-all match-up
for Gaze Coins. A full outline of the game is available in Appendix B.

33

APPENDIX B
Game Outline | Gaze Coin’s Epic Mixed-Reality Game: Dream Channel
The Gaze Coin development roadmap (detailed in Appendix A) covers fundamental milestones as
development targets from the proceeds of the Gaze Coin ICO. Throughout the roadmap, including
work completed pre-ICO, the Gaze Coin team develops a first-person open-universe mixed-reality
(MR) survival MMORPG, called Dream Channel VR (Dream Channel), that is the first version of a
larger MR platform the team is building. Dream Channel will serve as a functional proof of concept,
critical first use case and working demonstration of the Gaze Coin blockchain and developer API/
toolkit. All revenues generated from the game will flow back into the User Growth Pool (more
details on the pool in the ICO Summary doc). Dream Channel is an eSports game where teams can
compete in a winner-take-all matchup for GazeCoin (virtual currency).

Overview
An Epic Game that Unites & Monetizes the Metaverse
Dream Channel is an epic mixed reality game that rewards players in Gaze Coin for monetizing
the metaverse - the connected VR/AR space. ‘Dream Channel’ is a subconscious entertainment
precinct that pays players in Gaze Coin to search the metaverse for talent that could rate on Dream
Channel TV - an immersive ‘shared’ TV channel. Players purchase a ‘wormhole blaster’ - a weapon
that captures talent inside their content, blasting a wormhole between their location, through
Dream Channel to an entry/exit (portal) location on planet Earth. Wormholes are lined with the
talent’s immersive content and provide players with a toll road/transport system between virtual
worlds - shared by the talent and the player who captured them. The highest-rated show on Dream
Channel TV is a eSports game featuring the most popular talent (called Dreamers) uploaded to
the precinct. Tribes use GazeCoin to bid for their favorite dreamers, who are then pitted against
each other in a deadly dream ‘game show’ in the streets of the precinct. Dreamers are locked into
playing the game until they have won enough GazeCoin to pay their audience back.
The Dream Channel environment is a procedurally generated open universe. The city builds
new apartments, streets and sectors each time a new person joins the city. Dream Channel is
a living, breathing city that grows and adapts organically.

34

Gameplay
Players play the role of a bounty hunter exploring the entirety of the metaverse, which includes
billions of dreams (immersive content) that can rate on The Dream Channel – an immersive
‘shared’ TV channel. Players earn GazeCoin by finding lucid dreamers (content creators), capturing
them with a wormhole blaster and blasting their profile from their location to The Dream Channel
– lining it with their immersive content. The game includes deep space missions to other colonies
including an AI Planet where a hologram version of the player uses the community to learn the
moves of the player, sells itself to friends, and can be traded. A transport system allows players to
travel to other games through connected wormholes where players pay GazeCoin toll to wormhole
owners. The more content players acquire, the more they will become targets of rival lucid
dreamers who are looking to take ownership of their dreams.
Receiving payment in GazeCoin, players are able pay wormholes owners for transportation,
weapons and the lucrative mineral ‘Dice’ – a sleeping pill that allows them to access The Dream
Channel itself. 360-degree content is valuable, but the most lucrative content are ‘dreams’ (3D
fully-immersive virtual reality) – as these allow Dream Channel subscribers to fully immerse
themselves inside and feel real emotions and danger.
The ability for the player to explore the galaxy is only limited by the amount of GazeCoin they have
to buy weapons, fly through wormholes and their personal supply of Dice. With wormholes linked
to the planetary location of the talent/dreamer that it originated from, players use The Dream
Channel to plot courses – to find other colonies and worlds. In between worlds, players may come
across other wormhole travelers - many of whom are aligned to one of eight different dream tribes
who are fighting each other for control of The Dream Channel. The players’ actions towards each
tribe will determine how they are treated in future encounters. At some point, they can choose
to join one of the tribes. Many of the tribes speak their own languages and the player may need
to learn this to gain favor. Deep space outposts exist for trading currency, weapons and Dice and
serve as ports for the upload/download of dreams. Many of the outposts are manned and aligned
with specific tribes (some friendly, some hostile). Each tribe has their own ‘base city’ existing deep
in different galaxies.

35

Players attract attention from other players based on their ranking. Players receive two rankings
– a ‘player’ ranking based on their wealth in GazeCoin and also a ‘contestant’ ranking based on
their content rating on The Dream Channel. Many tribes deal in people smuggling – transporting
and trading high-rating lucid dreamers. Players can come under attack in wormholes and also
while accessing The Dream Channel. If killed or captured, by they go into a coma and become the
property of a people smuggler. If they die in space, they are spawned at their last previous space
outpost check-in, minus any GazeCoins they have not yet cashed in and any wormholes not yet
uploaded to The Dream Channel (now the property of the killer).
Players can purchase a special ‘Super Dice’ currency to protect themselves from losing their dreams if
they are ever killed inside Dream Channel precinct (this is a deathmatch zone) . Living dreamers are
worth more to players in the game for trading purposes. Players are restricted to non firing weapons
(knives, axes, chains, spears) for hand-to-hand combat with each other inside The Dream Channel.
Talent uploaded to the game have a limited number of Talent Tokens that can be bought and
traded. Talent tokens provide token-holders with access to wormholes connected to the talent. The
price of the tokens change based on their Dream Channel ‘contestant’ ranking. If a brand wants to
sponsor, talent they must purchase Talent Tokens back from players to buy the rights to do so.

36

Wormhole Transport System
The starting infrastructure to the expansion of Gaze Coin across connected virtual worlds is via a
user-generated ‘wormhole’ transport system. The Wormhole Blaster is a camera device that captures
content and their coordinates and blasts a wormhole – lining the wormhole with the artist’s 360
degree content and storing it in The Dream Channel – the universal database of wormholes. If a
wormhole gains a following, its creator, the artist and those who recommend it receive payments in
Gaze Coin based on consumer time immersed inside that wormhole - or ‘Gaze’ – Players participate
in a shared universe with the ability to exchange wormhole co-ordinates with friends.
A wormhole initially creates a link between the location where the talent was discovered and another
location on the other side of Planet Earth , directed by The Dream Channel. These wormholes can
be random but are more likely to be directed towards locations where the talent will be well received
by other players. Players use a VR/AR camera in their Wormhole Blaster to look into the wormhole
and see the other side. Pulling the trigger shoots players through the wormhole where they become
fully immersed in 360/VR content. If the wormhole is empty, travelers can line it with their own
content. Traveling through wormholes can be dangerous as they can collapse at any time.
The ability for players to explore wormholes will be determined by buying talent tokens or by adding
360 content to the wormhole. Wormhole travel is not limited to points on Planet Earth and can
extend to other galaxies and even time travel. Wormholes can come under attack. Travelers can try
to change the immersive content that lines a wormhole by adding a new immersive experience/
content. If the attacker’s content achieves a quorum, the wormhole experience is changed and the
destination is rerouted to a new destination. It should be noted that creating worthless wormholes,
or attacking too many wormholes will attract the attention of ‘agents’ who patrol The Bridge. They
can collapse wormholes that are non existent or add no value to the database. This lowers a player’s
game ranking and makes his recommendations less attractive to other players.

37

Super AI Planet
An Epic Game that Unites & Monetizes the Metaverse
One of the wormholes stored in The Bridge connects players to
an AI planet - where ‘Super AI’ versions of all players are stored
and evolving. Here they discover a deadly fantasy sports game
that is fully immersive.
This level of the game includes an AR app where players communicate with each other by
sending personal hologram messages to each other, setting off a chain of events where the

VR Drama Series
An Epic Game that Unites & Monetizes the Metaverse
A VR drama series is broadcast across the galaxy and presents
players with an ongoing drama featuring dream channel
‘contestants’, which provides players with insights into game play,
the tribes, other players, and drives their quest for adventure
inside the game.
Contestants are aligned with one of the eight fighting tribes and participate in a death match
game show – called ‘Dream Time’ - taking place inside The Dream Channel. The game pits rival
tribe members against each other in a winner-take-all combat in the streets of a particular high
rating dream.
The winner takes the other contestants’ wealth and audience. The loser is banished to a distant tribe
colony and must start again. A future re-match allows the loser to win their dream world back.

Creative Ambassadors
VR Radio
Dream Channel has over 40 ‘creative’ team members who are ambassadors for Gaze Coin. To
create the Gaze Ecosystem, Dream Channel VR been recording and live streaming electronic music
artists in VR as part of an initiative called VR RADIO. The concept involves capturing artists as
a hologram creating a point cloud stream of the artist. This ‘stream’ is broadcast into a virtual
apartment inside Dream Channel. Audiences can access the stream live through their phones in
2D. They can then opt to enter the DJ’s virtual apartment in AR ‘live’ looking through their phones
screens, or in VR using their goggles. Each DJ has their own Talent Token. These are collectible,
can be swapped, and provide fans with access to VIP content.

Creative Ambassadors
VR Radio
To foster the initial growth of the Gaze Coin ecosystem, we have created virtual apartments for some
of the world’s fastest rising electronic music artists. As spokespeople for the platform, they are a
proof of concept for user / artist generated content, an essential requirement to fuel the growth of the
ecosystem. As audiences are incentivized to experience their immersive content, these artists will
grow into branded content opportunities. These artists are involved as part of the VR Radio initiative.

The combined audience reach of ambassadors alone is 5.5 million people
