Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 The Status Quo
With the advent of Web 2.0, social trends and consumption behavior have changed drastically. It
prompted a new wave of community-sharing driven by business-to-consumer (B2C), business-tobusiness (B2B) and peer-to-peer (P2P) needs in the pursuit of new and better experiences.
However, problems have also surfaced with the rapid growth of the sharing economy, limiting its full
potential. The key challenges that needs to be urgently addressed that are hindering the growth of the
global sharing economy are high intermediary costs, a trust gap, a monopolistic and fragmented
landscape and the lack of risk mitigation.
GSENetwork aims to tap on the huge potential of the sharing economy and champion the growth and
transformation of the global sharing economy to create an interdependent network of users and providers.

1.2 Our Mission
Our mission is to create a decentralized global sharing economy network for the sharing economy based
on blockchain technology.
By focusing on the global sharing economy as our launch pad, we aim to build a decentralized global
sharing economy network with trust woven into its core, forming a web of interdependent decentralized
marketplaces on blockchain, transforming the sharing economy to its next generation, offering greater
accessibility and equitability to its users.

Chapter 2: Problems and Potentials
2.1 Problems of the Current Sharing Economy
With the exponential increase in the rate of adoption of the Internet over the past two decades, it became
a platform that facilitated the genesis and rise of the sharing economy. Driven by a shift of emerging
trends, the quest for new experiences, economic benefits, increased environmental and social awareness,
the sharing economy has seen phenomenal growth.
For advocates of decentralization, the sharing economy is utopia made real - peers transact directly with
peers, avoiding governmental or corporate intermediaries. It has proven a boon to regular income earners,
allowing them to profit from under-utilized assets like extra apartment space or spare bikes and cars. It
has also transformed the employment market, opening up avenues for micro-entrepreneurs to better
utilize their skills, resources and services (for example being an instructor on Udemy or being a part-time
on-demand taxi driver). Overall, the sharing economy has been widely beneficial to it’s participants,
offering additional income, providing them with more flexibility and autonomy in the manners in which they
choose to work whilst enabling better coordination of underutilized assets in the economy.
However, as the sharing economy continues to grow in scale, so have the associated challenges and
obstacles. The urgent goal is to fix the key issues that have hindered the growth of the sharing economy.
High intermediary fees
At its core, the sharing economy encourages the efficient utilization of resources to build social capital.
The current structure of the sharing economy business model is made up of centralized platforms which
gather and package resources to cater to consumers and providers, charging both parties high
intermediary fees for this service. For instance, Uber now charges drivers an astounding 20 percent and
consumers 10 percent of the ride charges for every completed ride and Airbnb generally charges hosts a
3 percent service fee and guests a service fee of up to 20 percent. In addition, the increment of these
fees are also at the discretion of these intermediaries.
Trust Gap
Not even the unicorns of the sharing economy have escaped controversies that threatened trust in their
users, the platforms and the products (rides and rentals). Uber has made headlines over drivers’
dissatisfaction and Airbnb has had to deal with a myriad of complaints as well.
A survey done by a travel blog Asher & Lyric showed that in 2016, Airbnb recorded nearly 80 million stays,
out of which 3 to 7 percent of them became guest horror stories such as last minute cancellations by
hosts, mismatched expectations, scams and fake listings or reviews.
In fact, Goldman Sachs Research’s report “Blockchain: Putting Theory into Practice” has stated that the
adoption of P2P lodging sites like Airbnb are being hindered by concerns about safety and security
(guests) and property damage (hosts) and they have cited Blockchain technology as a solution to these
problems. It is evident that the key underlying challenge is ascertaining that the two transacting parties
are acting in good faith.

Monopolistic and fragmented landscape
When a company has conquered a significant market share, the lack of industry competition may lead to
complacency and a self-beneficial strategy which creates a disconnect between the brand and their
consumers.
In addition, the first-generation sharing economy landscape is largely fragmented with a lack of
transparency. There are a variety of platforms that share the same product offerings but a user would
have to visit each of them individually to assess the most suitable deals. For instance, booking the same
hotel room may yield different prices on Expedia and Hotelbooking.com.
On top of that, a user is required to register a new account for every platform he visits. This means every
platform will own a set of the user’s data and would have the potential to misuse the data without the
knowledge of the user.
Lack of risk mitigation
In the event of disputes between the provider or user, the intermediary should have a mediator role to
play. Yet often, the process to get assistance is not straightforward. Other factors such as human bias,
discrimination and poor judgement may come into play that could cloud a central arbitration process.

2.2 Unleashing the Potentials of the Sharing Economy
PWC forecasted the global revenue of the sharing economy to hit $350 billion by 2025, expecting factors
like trust, convenience and a sense of community to push the adoption of the sharing economy. Juniper
Research identified 3 industries in the sharing economy that they have termed as “ripe for disruption”,
forecasted significant growth specifically in shared transport, shared space and shared logistics.
In 2016, The Yano Research Institute estimated that transactions on Japan’s sharing platforms would
grow from 29 billion yen ($260 million) to around 60 billion yen ($540 million) by 2020 (Takeo, 2017). In
China, the government promotes sharing to “improve efficiencies in resource usage” and “[make] people
more affluent”: its Sharing Economy Research Institute suggests the market value of China’s sharing
activity will grow at 40 percent per year and account for 10 percent of GDP by 2020 (Yan, 2017). In
essence, the 3 main factors that will continue to drive the advancement and evolution of the sharing
economy are:
●
●
●

Increased participation rates in the sharing economy resulting in increased demand and supply
Rise of integrated communications and transaction platforms such as WeChat Pay and Alipay to
enable greater user convenience
Deeper penetration of Internet of Things to make the sharing economy more user-friendly and
efficient

Our team strongly believes that the sharing economy is a powerful economic sector that will continue to
exhibit exponential growth and it has contributed some of the most impactful innovations that have
enhanced the consumer experience greatly since its advent in the last decade.
Hence, there is an urgent need to disrupt this first-generation sharing economy by plugging the gaps to
pave the way for the second-generation sharing economy.

Chapter 3: The Decentralized Sharing Economy
Network
3.1 Using Blockchain Technology as the Enabler
Blockchain facilitates the secure exchange of value in a decentralized manner, removing the need for a
central intermediary. The unique proposition of blockchain technology is its ability to run software
applications (smart contracts) in a secure and decentralized peer-to-peer network that is not controlled by
a central party. Fundamentally, blockchain-based applications are able to govern, allocate and coordinate
resources and activities, as well as facilitate interactions of all participants without central arbitration.
These features are perfectly aligned with our vision for the sharing economy - a decentralized structure
which encourages usage of the platform through distribution of rewards. By removing the intermediary,
the externality value produced will be redistributed to those who contributed to its value creation. We
believe that a decentralized sharing economy will truly bring out the concept of a true sharing economy,
facilitating the creation of more innovative and community-driven applications, while rewarding bona fide
participants.

3.2 The Evolution of the Sharing Economy

Diagram 1: The evolution of Sharing Economy
The sharing economy is entering the next phase of growth. The first generation sharing economy formed
many new behaviors and benefits to providers and consumers alike - lowering costs of ownership, greater
access to assets and services and opportunities for untapped markets.

9

The next-generation sharing economy that GSENetwork is sculpting can be outlined using a three-pillar
approach:

Diagram 2: Three - Pillar Infrastructure to enable the 2nd Generation Sharing Economy
1. Decentralized Service (DService) Platform
We aim to be the key enabler of sharing economy businesses on the blockchain by providing a robust
distributed service infrastructure for them to build on.
Enabled by a DPoS Consensus Mechanism; DService’s core components will be implemented as
distributed systems in the following areas:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Order Dispatching System
Anti-Fraud System
Multi-dimensional User Profile Rating System
Transparent Pricing System

By doing so, the sharing economies DApp built on our network can then focus on their core businesses
and GSENetwork will provide robust distributed infrastructure to support them.
Decentralized App (DApp)
The DService platform will facilitate developers to create their own decentralized app (DApp); which will
allow participants to create their own listings, browse through the product offerings and services available
as well as to make or accept payment. In essence, the DService platform permits a DApp ecosystem to
allow enterprises, third-party providers, users as well as mobile applications to interact and transact on.

10

2. Incentive Model
Through a revolutionary green-mining approach – transacting equates to mining, GSENetwork aims to
redistribute the externalities created by the ecosystem back to the ecosystem contributors. To build
GSENetwork, we intend to forge strategic partnerships with sharing economy players of all sizes, to
increase participation through integration of the sharing economy marketplace onto blockchain.
GSENetwork has forged a strategic partnership with ofo, the world’s largest bike-sharing platform to
introduce a revolutionary token distribution mechanism - Green-Mining on a global scale. Having
extensive global presence across 21 countries, ofo is a suitable launchpad for us to integrate this model
into real-world application, bringing blockchain closer to the everyday user. As part of this partnership, we
piloted the “Ride & Earn” Green-Mining campaign in Singapore to reward ofo users with GSE.
Using the “Ride & Earn” campaign as a case study, GSENetwork redistributed the externalities created by
the ecosystem back to its contributors - in this case, the ofo users. When users receive incentives in the
form of GSE tokens through their green mining activities as they ride, they will in turn be motivated to
increase their participation rate and be more engaged in the global sharing economy. Concurrently, the
user base will increase, thus scaling the GSENetwork ecosystem.
The implementation of the incentive model would result in the effective scalability of GSENetwork, due to
the following reasons:
1. GSENetwork rewards participants with GSE tokens when they “transact and share” instead of
having to “owning” an asset. This will ultimately scale the global sharing economy, truly
encouraging sharing behaviours.
2. Rewarding participants would increase participation rates, encouraging transactions within the
global sharing economy. This will bring about an exponential scaling of network effect that would
add value to the GSENetwork ecosystem.
With our revolutionary incentive model, GSENetwork is well-poised to be the blockchain platform for the
future global sharing economy.
3. Trust Framework
The incentive and tokenomics of the GSENetwork are set to increase user interactions, allowing
GSENetwork to document more user activities and behavior to create a holistic trust profile of each
individual user, forming the framework for the interdependency of the network and the users. With a
clearly structured tokenomics model, GSENetwork would return the locus of control to the user to
determine the quality and quantity of data provided to the network, and in return, receive the respective
incentivization.

11

Chapter 4: Decentralized Service (DService)
4.1 Introduction to DService
With the introduction of smart contracts, blockchain technology have evolved from simple transaction
ledgers to computation platforms. Blockchain veteran Fred Ehrsam once drawn this analogy: if Bitcoin is
a calculator, Ethereum is a computer. Today, blockchain is now able to handle the vast range of highly
complex interactions with applications. Smart contracts allow us to do more than send and receive tokens.
On-chain applications can make conditional decisions based upon on-chain data. Within the GSENetwork,
high-performance customizable smart contracts are deployed to enable various functions within the
community.
This chapter introduces GSENetwork's technical architecture to illustrate how the decentralized sharing
economy network contributes to multiple shared economic models with Diagram 3 showing the
GSENetwork technology stack. GSENetwork can be divided into 3 layers - the mainchain layer, DService
layer and application layer.

Diagram 3: GSENetwork Technical Architecture
Amongst them, the mainchain layer is the cornerstone of the decentralized trust framework. The
GSENetwork blockchain is maintained by thousands of nodes in the network. All nodes can store and

12

process user information autonomously under the premise of decentralized node control, and reach a
consensus on the consistency of processing results. The mainchain layer also provides a smart contract
system. With the help of a smart contract mechanism, the blockchain system can flexibly process data in
the network to meet specific business needs.
The DService layer is equivalent to the "middleware" between the blockchain and the upper-layer
applications. DService consists of several basic smart contracts running on blockchain nodes and
provides a variety of smart contract templates for higher level applications. Developers can have the
flexibility to develop based on these templates without being concerned about the implementation details
of smart contracts. User data from the upper-layer application is passed to the smart contract through
DService, which is then processed by numerous nodes in the blockchain network.
The DService layer would be equipped with four types of modules to cater to the seamless onboarding of
businesses:
1. Order Dispatching Module
2. Anti-Fraud Module
3. Multi-dimensional User Profile Rating Module
4. Pricing Module
With this infrastructure in place, higher level applications would be more equipped to deal with flexible
and complex business logic. In the subsequent stages, DService would provide richer features and
greater compatibility for the sharing economy.
The application layer would have a variety of shared economic applications, such as bike-sharing,
ridesharing and shared accommodation. With the increasing functionalities of GSENetwork, it would be
able to attract the future participation of more products to create a complete shared economic ecosystem.
Further elaborations would be in the subsequent sub-chapters.

4.2 Mainchain Layer
4.2.1 Introduction
Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger technology based on cryptographic algorithm to ensure the
secure transfer of value and information. It guarantees the traceability and tamper resistance of data
based on hash chain and timestamp mechanism. Consensus-based algorithms ensure data consistency
among nodes. Based on the above characteristics, the blockchain technically tackles the security problem
brought by the trust-based centralized model, and becomes the foundation of the construction of the
decentralized trust framework.
In GSENetwork, the blockchain will provide secure data logging. In the blockchain, signed by an external
user and broadcast to the entire blockchain network, the instructions processed by all nodes are called
transactions. In this system, data from applications such as shared bicycles and homestays are
encapsulated into transactions, processed by nodes in the network, and recorded in all nodes of the
entire network. For the data records stored in the node, its security can be guaranteed in two ways. Firstly,
the data structure and consensus algorithm of the blockchain itself can guarantee the immutability of the

13

data. Secondly, the numerous nodes in the network ensures that there is no single point of failure; hence
data records will never be lost even if some nodes are damaged.
GSENetwork would need to accommodate as many participating nodes as possible so as to increase the
security level of the data records. GSENetwork intends to adopt public chain technology. In the public
chain, any number of nodes can participate in the recording and processing of data. In combination with
economic incentives, GSENetwork has the potential to attract thousands of nodes to participate in the
maintenance of the blockchain, creating a highly secure data logging mechanism.
All nodes in the network would be required to process transactions and agree on the consistency of the
processing results. Therefore, as the number of blockchain nodes increases, the time consumed by
transaction processing and network resources may increase. In addition, for applications such as
ridesharing and bike-sharing, the frequency of transactions entering the blockchain network would
significantly increase during peak hours. Therefore, improving the efficiency of transaction processes of
the blockchain would be a key factor in the promotion of GSENetwork. Based on this, GSENetwork
intends to adopt the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) mechanism as the basis for processing and
consensus on transactions. Compared with the traditional consensus mechanisms such as PoW and
PBFT, DPoS would be able to maintain high transaction processing efficiency even when there is a large
number of nodes. As DPoS is one of the core technologies of GSENetwork, it would be further discussed
in-depth in the following chapters.
In the future, the GSENetwork blockchain would adopt the sidechain technology. At that time, through
interactions, affiliated blockchains known as “sidechains” would occur. Each side chain has varying
technical characteristics and would carry different types of applications. Transactions from an app will be
sent to a specific sidechain and each sidechain would process the transactions in parallel, thereby
improving the speed of transaction processing.
Another crucial feature provided by the GSENetwork blockchain is the "smart contract" mechanism. A
smart contract is a user-defined program that can be deployed on all blockchain nodes and has the ability
to host different applications and be bound to specific accounts. When the transaction recipient is marked
as the bound account, it triggers the program and the data carried by the transaction would be processed
in accordance to the user-defined logic. The nodes on the blockchain would agree on the results of the
operation to ensure consistent results. Since the same set of data would be processed by thousands of
nodes in the network, the results of the smart contract will be extremely credible. Smart contracts extend
the use of blockchains, enabling blockchains to support more applications. In the development of
GSENetwork, several smart contracts have been built as the foundation. Such smart contracts can be
combined into various basic service modules to form the basis for the operation of DService. Application
developers are also able to develop new smart contracts based on specific business needs.
In order to achieve on-chain and off-chain data collaboration, GSENetwork would introduce the Oracle
mechanism. The Oracle mechanism is a unique facility adopted for the interaction between smart
contracts and real world applications. On one hand, it collects external data through tools such as IoT
devices and GPS satellites. On the other hand, it encapsulates the collected data into transactions and
handles them through specific smart contracts. As a subsidiary module of the blockchain, the Oracle
mechanism is able to expand the data sources bridge communications between channels of data sources
and turns into a bridge for communicating the blockchain and real world applications.

14

4.2.2 DPoS Consensus Algorithm
The consensus mechanism is the core concept in blockchain technology, including Practical Byzantine
Fault Tolerance Algorithm (PBFT), Proof of Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake
(DPoS) and other algorithms and their variants; of which, DPoS is considered to be a relatively robust,
secure, highly distributed, flexible and efficient consensus algorithm.
PoW requires extensive computing power and time to reach consensus and block confirmation; whereas
PoS staking mechanism has been criticized because it gives unfair advantage to those with marginally
more tokens to mine a new block.
Adopting the DPoS consensus mechanism; GSENetwork is able to mitigate these issues through voting
processes; where token holders are able to vote for the chosen “validators” of transactions; these
“validators” are referred to as Delegates. Under this consensus mechanism, all GSE token holders are
able to exert a certain degree of impact in the future of the network. As such, the adoption of DPoS
mechanism encourages greater community participation and involvement. The voting power of token
holders are directly proportional to their vested tokens; and they can vote for a list of potential delegates.
The delegates shortlisted through community voting will be evaluated by the Foundation, and ultimately
appointed at the Foundation’s discretion. This election process ensures that only reliable nodes will be
involved in the consensus process, thereby ensuring the efficiency and vitality of the network.
Listed below is the block generation process detailed.
1. Registration of potential delegates: The nodes in the network that want to become block producers are
called delegates and their collections are recorded as{𝑁1,𝑁2,...𝑁𝑖 . . . }, the special transaction record sent
are recorded as 𝑇𝑁𝑖 , indicating that the node 𝑁𝑖 has sent the transaction T registered as a candidate
representative, and locked a certain amount of tokens recorded as 𝐶𝑁𝑖 in the smart contract (with the
minimum amount of restrictions), as a credit endorsement to promote and attract votes from other holders.
In general, the more tokens are locked, the more one can demonstrate his willingness to secure the
network, because the disruption of consensus and security of the network will cut off its locked tokens
proportionally.
2. Generate a delegate set: All the holders in the network are recorded as 𝐻. After H votes for delegates
{𝑁1,𝑁2 ,...𝑁𝑖 . . . }, they are labelled as 𝐻𝑖𝑗 , indicating the Jth holder who voted to the ith delegate. The tokens
𝐶𝐻𝑖 are locked to the corresponding delegates, and the total amount of tokens in which the holder is
𝑗

locked to the delegate 𝑁𝑖 is recorded as 𝐶𝐻𝑖 , and the delegate account 𝑁𝑖 is finally locked in the smart
contract 𝑺. 𝐶𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 is thereby calculated as: 𝐶𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝐶𝐻𝑖 + 𝐶𝑁𝑖 .
Finally, by comparing the number of locked tokens 𝐶𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 corresponding to all the delegates, the pre 𝑟
(the number of 𝑟 is set according to the specific business logic and requirements) delegates are selected
as the representative set of the participating consensus as {𝐷1 , 𝐷2 . .. 𝐷𝑟 }.
3. Block validation: Delegates set {𝐷1 , 𝐷2 . .. 𝐷𝑟 } validate blocks in the agreed order, each delegates 𝐷𝑖 can
only validate block within a specified period [𝑡𝑖 , 𝑡𝑖+1 ],, and blocks proposed at other time are invalid. If one
delegate doesn’t successfully validate blocks in predetermined period, this delegate will be skipped. For
example, when 𝐷𝑖 doesn’t validate block within [𝑡𝑖 , 𝑡𝑖+1 ], but 𝐷𝑖+1 validates 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖+1 in [𝑡𝑖+1 , 𝑡𝑖+2 ], then the
blockchain will be {. . . 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖−2 ← 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖−1 ← 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖+1 } . If a block was missed and no blocks were

15

produced in the past 24 hours, they will be removed from the delegates set, and will be penalized until
they are once again re-elected as a delegate. In this way, the stability of blockchain can be guaranteed,
and the influence caused by unreliable delegates can be minimized.
Since the DPoS consensus is a cooperative generation block rather than a competitive generation block,
the blockchain would not fork under normal circumstances. If the blockchain has forks, the forked chain
with more delegates would extend faster than the forked chain with fewer delegates, because the former
will encounter fewer missing blocks, so the longest chain represents the consensus amongst the majority
of the delegates. However; as the delegates are ultimately decided by the Foundation, we predict that the
chances of an unplanned fork happening would be very low.
4. Delegate-confirmed transaction: Other delegates would verify the block produced by the first delegate
and add it to the next block. In the blockchain, it would be assumed that less than one-third of the nodes
are malicious. If there exists more than two-thirds of different delegate behind a block, it would be
considered that the block is confirmed by the majority, resulting in the transaction being deemed
irreversible. For instance, if there are a total of 21 delegates, and there are 15 different proposed blocks
after the first, it would be irreversible.

4.3 DService Layer
Above the blockchain layer is the Decentralized Service (DService) Layer, which is the "middleware"
between the application layer and the blockchain layer. The DService Layer consists of a number of
smart contracts running on the blockchain nodes and faces the upper-level applications, providing many
foundational smart contract templates for the application. Developers can flexibly develop based on these
templates. According to the smart contract template provided by DService, it can be defined into 5
modules: foundational contract module, order dispatch module, anti-fraud module, multi-dimensional user
profile rating system, and pricing module. The foundational contract module mainly includes Asset
Management Contract and Transaction Management Contracts.

4.3.1 Foundational Contract Module
The foundational contract module is the basis for DService to provide services to users and is a
necessary component for all other modules to implement functions. The foundational contract module
utilizes the smart contract template provided by DService, and it mainly includes Asset Management
Contracts and Transaction Management Contracts.
Asset management contracts primarily deal with operations related to asset registration and revocation.
When a user registers an asset on GSENetwork, the Asset Management Contract would be invoked to
register the asset, and the user would be required to stake an amount of GSE. Inversely, when there is a
cancellation of a booked asset, the Asset Management Contract would proceed to deregister the asset.
The transaction contract facilitates the transaction between two contracting parties by managing and
monitoring the process. If a breach of contract occurs, the transaction contract would automatically
deduct the credit of the defaulting party (the credit rating of the user account is based on the information
from behavior credit and credit rating) and the deposit. If there is no breach of contract, the transaction
contract would automatically increase the credit rating of both parties and transaction is completed.

16

4.3.2 Multi-Dimensional User Profile Rating System
The multi-dimensional user profile rating system provides user credit references for other modules,
denoted as𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒 (𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 , 𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒 ), 𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 = {𝑇𝑟𝑎, 𝐸𝑣𝑎, . . . }. The objective is to determine the
user's credit status based on the user interaction information such as the immutable transaction
information 𝑇𝑟𝑎 and the evaluation information 𝐸𝑣𝑎 recorded on the blockchain. The module only
provides a template for obtaining transaction data, the specific data mining algorithm 𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒 and the
user transaction information 𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 that needs to be queried is customizable based on the user
requirements.
The factors in the algorithm that DiDi, Uber and other ridesharing companies use to evaluate the credit
status of both driver and passenger is mainly based on their misbehaviors such as order cancellations. In
the homesharing model such as Airbnb, the credit rating is evaluated mainly by mining the evaluation
information of both parties. In the shared IoT system such as ofo, the credit status of the equipment is
evaluated by mining the user's evaluation of the equipment, whether the equipment is damaged, etc.

4.3.3 Order Dispatch Module
The dispatch module provides the application with dynamic matching transaction services, denoted as
𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟(𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑥 , 𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑦 , 𝑂, 𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 ) , where 𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑥,𝑦 = 𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒 (. . . ) . The core is to match the
transaction based on the credit 𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑥,𝑦 , and the specific application scenarios 𝑂 of the two parties. This
module guarantees that under the same conditions, users with higher credit ratings will be given the
priority to obtain services, so as to encourage users to maintain a good credit rating, namely 𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ∝
𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑥,𝑦 . The module only provides a template for obtaining user credits from the Target User Profiling
and the Credit Rating module. The priority order corresponding to the specific rating and the rule 𝑂 of the
specific application scenario can be customized according to the user requirements.
The dispatch module is currently mainly applicable for ride sharing services such as DiDi, Uber, Grab, etc.
The specific variable rules that the software needs to consider include rules that preferentially selects
drivers in closer in proximity to the passengers’ pick up points and judging the feasibility of a carpooling
destination based on the drivers’ current location and passengers’ destinations.

4.3.4 Anti-Fraud Module
The anti-fraud module provides stability and security for the application and is documented as Security().
It exists to identify fake users and the false information released according to the credits of the two parties
and the specific transaction information S, to feedback to the target user profile and credit rating module
to perfect the user mapping. The module provides a template for obtaining user credits from the Target
User Profiling and Credit Rating Module, a template for obtaining transaction data, and a template for
feedback information. This allows users to create user and information identification filters according to
their needs to reject dealing with fake users.
In all shared economic systems, a credit threshold can be set. When the credit score of the user is lower
than the threshold, the user is deemed as a fake user, and the service would be denied. In DiDi, Uber and
other ridesharing system, it is possible to preliminarily judge whether the information published by the
user is authentic. It can refuse to respond to the fake messages by comparing the ride request initiated by
the user as well as the corresponding location.

17

4.3.5 Pricing Module
The pricing module provides a dynamic price adjustment service for the app, denoted price({old_price},
{price_parameter}, alg_price). Its objective is to allow users to set the price adjustment rule alg_price to
achieve smart pricing and asset binding. The module provides the template for quoting a transaction
contract and a set of templates for price setting conditions. The specific price setting alg_price can be
designed by the user according to their needs. When the two parties transact, the transaction processing
contract calls the relevant module in the pricing module to obtain the price information of the
corresponding asset.
In a home-sharing service such as Airbnb, users can design a series of dynamic price rules based on
factors such as the low and peak rental seasons and rental durations. In a transportation-related shared
economy system, users can design a set of dynamic price rules based on information such as traffic
conditions and travel time.

4.4 Application Layer
Above the DService layer is the Application layer, which carries a variety of shared economic applications,
such as ofo bike-sharing applications, DiDi, Uber and other ridesharing and home-sharing services such
as Airbnb. These applications can be ported and expanded with the help of modules provided by the
DService layer.
Take the ridesharing system as an example. When a user submits their vehicle information in the system,
the Asset Management Contract is called to register the vehicle as an asset and the user would have to
stake an amount of GSE tokens. The user is then recognized as the asset owner in the blockchain.
The transaction is initiated when a passenger enters the departure point and the destination. The system
calls the anti-fraud module to review the passenger’s user information and the order information issued by
the passenger to determine whether to provide services. In the case of normal service provision, the
system calls the dispatcher to provide the vehicle owner for the passenger with dynamic matching. At the
beginning, according to the starting point and destination of the order, as well as the passenger profile
obtained by the user profile and credit scoring module, the order is ranked; then the passenger is
searched among a certain range of vehicle owners. The range can be set according to the specific scene,
and request from the user profiling and credit scoring module to obtain the credit status of the owner.
Under the same conditions, users with higher order scores are more likely to receive the service, while
owners with higher credits are more likely to earn high-scoring orders.
After the owner receive the order, both sides will reach a trade consensus. The system will call pricing
module automatically to obtain the corresponding price of the asset. At the same time, the transaction
contract is called to process the transaction. According to the behavior of both parties, the transaction
contract can automatically handle the credit evaluation and the deposit of both parties. During the
operation of the system, the user profile and credit scoring module pushes the transaction information
onto the blockchain to profile the user and analyze the corresponding credit status. Upon the completion
of the transaction, GSENetwork will grant a certain amount of GSE reward. The reward is based on the
“Green-Mining” mechanism rules as well as the contribution of the user to the overall external system
workload during this period of time (system usage and information uploading).

18

Chapter 5: Incentive Model
5.1 Getting Incentives Right
Through a revolutionary green-mining approach – transacting equates to mining, GSENetwork wishes to
redistribute the externalities created by the ecosystem back to the ecosystem contributors. Users will be
incentivized to participate in the network which will grow GSENetwork. GSENetwork has leveraged on our
strategic partnership with ofo as the pilot platform to trial the incentive model.

5.2 Incentives in Sharing Economy
Both GSENetwork and partner platforms would share directly or indirectly incurred costs since both would
benefit from user transactions on GSENetwork.
GSENetwork benefits from more trust in circulation when there are increased user transactions and
varied platforms from externalities which is illustrated as follows.
The sharing economy is realized by platforms in the likes of ofo, Uber and Airbnb. The key to the
business models of these platforms is to internalize the externality generated by all participating entities,
such as riders, drivers, travelers and hosts. The externality refers to the behavior of individuals that will
bring about consequences (positive or negative) to the system and such externality is neither priced nor
traded.
The externalities are absorbed by the online platforms, which is referred to as the ‘internalization of
externality’. The platforms gain additional revenue from the externalities and all participants do not get a
share out of it. In addition, the platforms may want to utilize such revenue to incentivise users. However,
as reflected in the current market, it is very complicated to execute in a systematic and optimized way.
Implementing blockchain technology would address the issue. The bike-sharing platform as a launch pad
is an excellent real-world application for the mechanism. Relying on the decentralized recording function
and issuance of token, the externality of consumers’ contribution to the bike-sharing platform can be
distributed in the network to achieve the optimal overall equilibrium.
The externalities will be covered in the following sub-chapters:
●
●
●

Membership Externality
Usage Externality
Information Externality

5.2.1 Membership Externality
The increase in the number of members will bring platforms additional resources, which is not paid to the
creators but absorbed by the platform as higher pricing power. This would explain why there is only one
dominant player in most sharing verticals since all resources tend to gravitate towards the lead player.
Referring to the ride-sharing platforms as an example, the increase in the number of members benefits
the platform. More members would enable easier pairing between providers and users. Consumers would

19

choose the ridesharing platform and travel accommodation platforms with most availability. Advertisers
would gravitate towards platforms with the most users, and the popular platforms would be able to justify
higher advertising fees with wider reach and higher effectiveness.
The externality from increased membership is rather exponential than linear with the number of
membership itself. However, not all parties on the platform enjoy such benefits.

5.2.2 Usage Externality
Higher frequency of transactions would have two major positive externalities to the platform. A higher
utilization rate implies a higher circulation speed of resources amongst all participants, which aligns with
the core objective of the sharing economy. Users will find it easier to find bikes, rides, rooms and drivers
would find it easier to have passengers, likewise for homeowners offering short-stay rental. The usage
externality from increased frequency of transactions and thus increased utilization of the platform is
evident.

5.2.3 Information Externality
The third type of contribution deserving incentive is information (data) externality. Apart from revenue
itself, users and transactions contribute to platforms with data as well. The data includes demand patterns,
reviews, photos, population distribution, tide-effects, etc. These data are of great value to the platforms
for data mining for deeper business insights.
In fact, data has become the core asset of any kind of organizations, especially with the help of advanced
data mining technology like machine learning. Organizations are enabled to make better decisions by all
means with the control of data. In addition, platforms can cultivate and grow new business lines with the
advantage of such insights.
However, the benefit of such positive externalities is again not shared with other participants, especially
those who contribute such data.

5.3 Design of Green-Mining as an Incentive
For every transaction created in the network, the externality created will be shared between 4 parties - the
user, the foundation, suppliers and GSE holders. In order to stimulate the growth of GSENetwork,the
externality distributed to the foundation will be distributed back to users, suppliers and GSE holders.
Take bike-sharing as a specific example in sharing economies, we call the incentive scheme as “GreenMining” to achieve wider understanding of the new concept since ‘mining’ has become a popular term in
the trend of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
In the concept of Green-Mining, users will be rewarded with tokens after they take rides. The design of
Green-Mining should adhere to the following guidelines:
●
●

The design must have the ability to quantify sharing activities and the ability to translate them into
workloads through a clear approach;
The collection of workload data has to have a minimal impact on user behavior, requiring low user
perception in the process and cannot be too time-consuming;

20

●

The workload data must be associated with behavior subjects, possess an anti-counterfeiting
mechanism, and also support verification;

Among these conditions, the first condition is the requirements of the mechanism design, and the two
latter conditions are to be ensured through technical means.
We will further elaborate on the production and distribution of GSE, via Green-Mining, in chapter 7.

21

Chapter 6: Trust Framework
6.1 Introduction of Trust and Why it is Important
Trust is a valued commodity, or a social currency that can facilitate transactions in the sharing economy.
Intermediaries in the first-generation sharing economy perceive authentic profiles as the gateway to
transactions on their platforms.
If every individual’s digital footprint and social media profile are unique, each user should have ownership
of their personal digital data. With the aid of blockchain technology, such records will be permanent and
traceable, forming the basis of trust between user and provider.

6.2 Principles of the Trust Model and Types of Trust
The GSENetwork defines trust using a two core elements to ascertain the authenticity of the user profile Existential Trust and Behavioral Trust.
Existential Trust
The GSENetwork adopts Internet of Things (IoT) devices utilizing GPS, fingerprint scanners,
accelerometers and other IoT indicators to validate the authenticity of the user’s identity. Each logged and
authenticated interaction point would contribute to the user’s trust value.
Essentially,Existential Trust provides information about a participant’s existence. A participant in the
GSENetwork with high Existential Trust may still exhibit bad behaviors, but he/she is still likely to truly
exist, accounting for his/her Existential Trust score.
There is no cap in supply of Existential Trust since a participant can have large Existential Trust
approximating to infinity, correlating to actual human behavior - the longer a person lives, the higher the
number of accumulated interactions with other individuals or objects over a lifespan.
Existential Trust would decay over time. Once a participant stops interacting with other identities in the
network, the identity would gradually cease to exist. Thus, it is necessary to introduce the concept of
accelerating decay of Existential Trust, noting that objects would have a slower speed of decay compared
to humans.

Behavioral Trust
GSENetwork would be able to correlate the user’s online activities, frequency and interaction with assets,
people and platforms the user has interacted with to determine the value of their behavioral trust.
A high Behavioral Trust implies a high likelihood that a target is has produced accountable and ethical
actions, and a low Behavioral Trust could be a result of less than satisfactory interactions or transactions
in the past.
Behavioral Trust is an built-in pseudo-credit system of GSENetwork. Since not all IoT devices can record
and upload information about users’ behavior, Behavioral Trust will have to differ from Existential Trust.
Ideally, Existential Trust would be awarded for every interaction by participants. However, due to the

22

limitation of IoT devices, only specific interactions will be awarded Behavioral Trust. Thus we term it a
pseudo-credit system. Before we are able to adequately equip Behavioral Trust-enabled IoT devices with
the right technology to record accurate information GSENetwork requires, we will closely observe the true
effectiveness of Behavioral Trust and compare it against GSE Trust Score or other third party credit
scores which will be mentioned in later chapters.
Taking the assumption that there are sufficient Behavioral Trust-enabled IoT devices, several guidelines
should be followed:
●

●

The total distribution of Behavioral Trust should follow normal distribution, or a bell curve
distribution. This complies with distribution in reality where the majority of users are ethical and
have accountable actions. The supply of trust on both the individual at a micro level and
population at a macro level, would be governed by normal distribution and therefore have
diminishing marginal reward. This should be adjusted automatically and dynamically based on
factors affecting the entire network such as monthly active users and total monthly transactions.
Behavioral Trust would also decay over time based on the logic that when a participant stops
interacting with other parties or assets, the system is not able to record information, hence losing
information about it and not that trustworthy as before.

A decentralized trust framework means that users will own the data that they provide to the network and
be able to have control over the data that is shared. Users would be able to affect their own trust value
through their actions and be in control how they are shared and utilized.

6.3 Recording of Trust onto Blockchain

Diagram 4: Illustration of trust system
Trust is an attribute for every ID, and is not a separate token. It cannot be transferred to another user, and
it would decay over time if it is not maintained. IoT devices will record each activity and interaction with
physical assets on blockchain by first determining if the transaction is valid. If it is valid, the transaction
data will be uploaded onto the blockchain. The uploading of the transaction data would pass through a

23

decentralized oracle in the GSENetwork before completion. The smart contracts attribute trust scores
onto the user’s profile through the network algorithms, and the trust smart contract rules are determined
via decentralized voting system of the GSENetwork community.

6.4 Trust Generation Rules
This section will elaborate on the Trust Generation rules and guidelines mentioned in the previous section.
Existential Trust will be awarded to participants for every interaction. Specifically, lower trust identities
would benefit, that is to say, gain a bigger increase in Existential Trust than high trust identities.
Some may wonder the ‘Singular Point’ for the entire GSENetwork since the trust has to start somewhere
in a decentralized way. To solve this, all human users will be granted an initial trust which will decay over
time. By supplying ‘genesis trust’ to each users, trust recognition is realized with the help of all users.
Two explanatory graphs of such mechanism on Existential Trust can be seen below. Once again, we use
our strategic partner, ofo, to illustrate the case.

Diagram 5: Asset Identification
A rider rides an ofo bike with 0 trust score. The rider with trust score of 465, will attribute the bike with an
addition of 10 trust score.

Diagram 6: User Identification

24

A rider with a trust score of 1, rides a bike with a trust score of 10. The rider will gain trust score after
interaction with the bike.
There would be possible changes in Behavioral Trust when IoT devices record new and additional
behavioral data. In a fundamental sense, good behavior would be rewarded with Behavioral Trust.

6.5 IoT Device Governance
IoT devices are a crucial entity in GSENetwork; they act as oracles to convert real world interactions to
the digital world, carrying trust information with them. A single IoT device may act as node on the chain if
it possesses the required computation power, storage capacity and transmitting bandwidth.
In cases where an IoT device fails to meet the minimum requirement of a node, Shadow Nodes will be
utilized. One Shadow Node can correspond to one or many IoT devices. The IoT devices serve as a data
collector, or Oracle for the Shadow Node. The Shadow Node could be a PC, a server, depending on the
requirement of its device governance. A Shadow Node shall have full / core capabilities of operating on
blockchain, especially ‘mining’.
As data collection from IoT devices may be prone to fraud and misuse; GSENetwork will require each
Shadow Node to put a stake proportionate to the number of IoT devices it controls as deposit.
GSENetwork blockchain will provide mechanism for dispute on stakes. Should there be any dispute on
fraud or data integrity collected by IoT and uploaded by Shadow Nodes, network members will be able to
raise dispute against the Node. If the fraud is proven to be true by voting or other means, the stake
deposit will be confiscated.

25

6.6 Trust Score
With proper control and approval, a user’s behavior can be analyzed and any party can generate a Trust
Score for reference. This should be a composite score based on both Existential Trust and Behavioral
Trust while there could also be specialized focus depending on the application of the Trust Score.
It would help to promote the adoption of the score if the publicized rules for calculation are transparent
and open sourced. However, having a black box for calculating such scores will not be a critical barrier for
the adoption, as long as the entity publicizing it is able to verify its reputation and credibility.
A fundamental objective of Phase 3.0, full suite of access control will be provided to users to reach the
optimal balance between user privacy and data acquiring.

26

Chapter 7: Tokenomics
7.1 GSE Token
The token of GSENetwork is referred to as GSE. The system will produce a certain amount of token in
every fixed period of time. This process is accompanied by two categories of behavior in the system: first,
the users’ participation in the Green Mining of the sharing economy, and the other is nodes’ participation
in the accounting. In each certain period, the produced token will be distributed to these two categories of
users based on certain proportion.

7.2 Production Rate of GSE
The rate at which the system produces GSE in any fixed period will decline over time, in accordance with
the following formula:

𝑆𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝 = 𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 ∗ 𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛 −𝑖𝑛𝑡((𝑇𝑐𝑢𝑟−𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 )/𝑇𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛) ∗ 𝐹(𝐶⃗, 𝑇𝑐𝑢𝑟 )
𝑆𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝 : the total number of GSE generated in each period
𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 : the number of GSE generated in each period during the Genesis stage
𝑇𝑐𝑢𝑟 : the current time
𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 : the time of genesis
𝑇𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛 :the period of decline of generation of tokens
𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛 : the decline factor of GSE
𝐹(𝐶⃗, 𝑇𝑐𝑢𝑟 ): function of work based on member in sharing economy, such as bike-sharing
𝑖𝑛𝑡(): stands for integer-valued function and its meaning is that for each period of time passed, the
number of GSE generated in each unit time will decline according to a certain rule.

The number of GSE produced according to the formula above will be distributed among the contributors
of the sharing economy and accounting nodes. Before the main chain of GSENetwork is released online,
third party main chain will be used for accounting. Given that the transaction rate will hardly meet the
needs of huge number of transactions in the sharing economy, the accounting period will lag behind the
generation of workload in Green-Mining before the main chain is released online, therefore the system
will pre-produce a certain amount of tokens based on the production intervals of the third party main chain
and distribute them, and instant distribution will be adopted after the main chain is released.

27

Diagram 7: GSE production algorithm for bike sharing

28

7.3 Distribution of GSE based on workload
The measurement standard of users’ engagement in the sharing economy, which could be referred to as
Proof-of-Labor, labor contribution will be expressed as ⃗⃗⃗
𝐿𝑖 (𝑡), 1 ⪯ 𝑖 ⪯ 𝑁𝑡 , among them 𝑁𝑡 is the total
number of users engaged in riding in period 𝑡. From a quantification perspective, on one hand, the
feedback for users’ contribution to the sharing economy by using the service and making payments
should be manifested. On the other hand, the feedback for the positive influence on sharing economy
brought by users’ other non-payment engagements should also be manifested. Therefore
𝑆𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝 = 𝑆𝑤 + 𝑆𝑟 , 𝑆𝑤 is the feedback reward.
The total mark for an individual user’s contribution to Green-Mining:

⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗
𝑉(𝐿
𝑖 (𝑡)) = 𝑊(𝐿𝑤𝑖 (𝑡)) + 𝐶(𝐿𝑟𝑖 (𝑡))
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗
Among them, 𝑊(𝐿𝑤
𝑖 (𝑡))is the total amount of labor in the current period; 𝐶(𝐿𝑟𝑖 (𝑡)) is the weight of
specific behaviors.
Based on the definitions mentioned above, the rewards for a particular user mainly depends on the ratio
of a user’s workload to the riding workload in each period of time and the rewards for feedback mainly
depends on the workload evaluation conducted by external system. The latter will be adjusted according
to the proportion in the whole system.

7.4 Features of GSE Token
GSE is designed to be used solely on GSENetwork as a unit of exchange for all services on GSENetwork,
as well as providing the economic incentives which will be consumed to encourage participants to
contribute and maintain the ecosystem on GSENetwork. GSE is an integral and indispensable part of
GSENetwork, because in the absence of GSE, there would be no common unit of exchange to pay for
these costs, thus rendering the ecosystem on GSENetwork unsustainable. GSE is a non-refundable
functional utility token. GSE does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or
interest in the Foundation, its affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will GSE
entitle token holders to any promise of fees, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended
to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction.
GSE may only be utilised on GSENetwork, and ownership of GSE carries no rights, express or implied,
other than the right to use GSE as a means to enable usage of and interaction with GSENetwork. In
particular, you understand and accept that GSE:
●
●

●

is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other assets)
or any payment obligation by the Foundation or any affiliate;
does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any form with respect to the
Foundation (or any of its affiliates) or its revenues or assets, including without limitation any right
to receive
is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic money), security, commodity,
bond, debt instrument or any other kind of financial instrument or investment;

29

●
●

is not a loan to the Foundation or any of its affiliates, is not intended to represent a debt owed by
the Foundation or any of its affiliates, and there is no expectation of profit; and
does not provide the token holder with any ownership or other interest in the Foundation or any of
its affiliates.

The contributions in the token sale will be held by the Distributor (or its affiliate) after the token sale, and
contributors will have no economic or legal right over or beneficial interest in these contributions or the
assets of that entity after the token sale. To the extent a secondary market or exchange place for GSE
does develop, it would be run and operated wholly independently of the Foundation, the Distributor. The
sale of GSE and GSENetwork. Neither the Foundation nor the Distributor will create such secondary
markets nor will either entity act as an exchange for GSE.

30

Chapter 8: Roadmap
GSENetwork will adopt a ground-up approach to build our platform. A strong user base with a stable
value of exchange, will be the building blocks for a strong foundation for the GSENetwork. In this section,
we will set out timeline for GSENetwork technical developments.

Diagram 8: GSENetwork Roadmap Overview

31

Chapter 9: Token Distribution
The entire volume of GSE shall be 100 billion, with 0.0001GSE as the minimum unit, as follows:

40 percent of GSE will be set aside towards ecosystem building such as green-mining, strategic
partnerships, ecosystem incentives, etc
20 percent of GSE will be allocated to the Foundation in order to provide support for community
operations
20 percent of GSE will be released to private investors
15 percent of GSE will be allocated to the team
5 percent of GSE will be allocated to the advisors
Diagram 9: Percentage distribution of Token Distribution

32

Chapter 10: Risk
You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing GSE, holding
GSE, and using GSE for participation in GSENetwork .

10.1 Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions
The regulatory status of GSE and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many
jurisdictions. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing
regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including GSE
and/or GSENetwork. Regulatory actions could negatively impact GSE and/or GSENetwork in various
ways. The Foundation (or its affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory
actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially
undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.
After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and legal
structure of tokens, a cautious approach will be applied towards the sale of GSE. Therefore, for the sale
of GSE, the sale strategy may be adjusted in order to avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible.

10.2 Competitors
It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same or similar code and
protocol underlying GSE and/or GSENetwork and attempt to recreate similar facilities. GSENetwork may
be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact GSE and/or
GSENetwork .

10.3 Loss of Talent
The development of GSENetwork depends on the continued cooperation of the existing technical team
and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors. The
loss of any member may adversely affect GSENetwork or its future development.

10.4 Failure to Develop
There is the risk that the development of GSENetwork will not be executed or implemented as planned,
for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset,
token or GSE, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.

10.5 Security Weaknesses
Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with GSE and/or
GSENetwork in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,
consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third
party or a member of the Foundation or its affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce
weaknesses into the core infrastructure of GSE and/or GSENetwork , which could negatively affect GSE
and/or GSENetwork .

33

10.6 Other Risks
In addition to the aforementioned risks, there are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Terms and
Conditions) associated with your purchase, holding and use of GSE, including those that the Foundation
cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the
aforementioned risks. You should conduct full due diligence on the Foundation, its affiliates and the
GSENetwork team, as well as understand the overall framework and vision for GSENetwork prior to
purchasing GSE.
