BLOCKCHAIN IGNITED

Whitepaper v1.2
March 2019

ABSTRACT
RedFOX Labs is a blockchain based technology company that identifies and builds
proven unicorn business models for the emerging markets of Southeast Asia.
We create innovative and scalable solutions to unlock true market potential on the
Komodo Platform, as we aim to create leading companies in the e-commerce,
e-media, e-travel, ride hailing and logistics areas.
To allow the under-served with effective access to the internet economy we needed
a competitive technology, we needed a technological edge. The Komodo platform is
widely considered one of the most innovative in the blockchain space allows us a
myriad of entry points and options to explore opportunities previously unexplored.
Replicating large-scale unicorn models requires certain core competencies we
believe only the Komodo platform can provide at this time.
In order to be competitive in our selected verticals we require a largely language
agnostic, interoperable solution which can grow rapidly without issues of congestion
or scalability. The Komodo platform can deliver this with benefits that will allow us to
aggressively take market share in a market that currently caters to less than 50% of
its population and has 104 million residents aged between 25 and 34, which make up
the majority of our core audience.
RedFOX Labs is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.

INTRODUCTION
RedFOX Labs was founded in July, 2018 with the intent to be Southeast Asia's first
blockchain venture builder and to help with the mass adoption of blockchain
technology through the Komodo Platform.
Having been the general manager of Komodo since Dec 2017, Ben Fairbank and
co-founders Glen Pearce and Wade Lueders, had already identified that the gap
between the core protocol layer of blockchain technology. The ability for the end
consumer to interact, meant mass adoption was still some time away, yet the
solutions it presented were too good to wait for. The Komodo technology offers, in
our opinion, the most complete end-to-end offering currently on the blockchain
market.
Having experience as C Level executives for companies such as Virgin Mobile,
ChinaHR and Grab, the team is well versed in running successful companies within
the region and almost 2 decades of experience with multi-national corporations
such as Viva and Cell-C through Silah Gulf and Ooredoo.
Through an advanced ecosystem of internet economy companies, RedFOX Labs will
take steps to become a super dApp in Southeast Asia.

PROBLEM

More than 50% of the population in Southeast Asia does not have access to the
internet economy. Many of the problems that restrict access are related to lacking
bank accounts, credit cards, high fees, or simply a lack of trust in digital payment
options, which are required for services such as Netflix.
Many companies struggle to grow at scale and sustainably in these markets and fail
to capitalise on the wider audience. Therefore these companies concentrate on the
larger cities where people are likely to be more connected to the internet economy
and the subsequent digital payment systems.
The concentration of competition to major cities and the lack of engagement in the
internet economy means there are a number of opportunities that are untapped in
the region.

SOLUTION

Identify Model

Replicate

Rapid Growth

We take proven and successful unicorn companies and replicate them for the
emerging markets. We utilise blockchain technology to leverage solutions to the
existing problems businesses face in the region.
With the use of Komodo’s superior technology we are able to unlock a percentage of
the market that remains under-served.
From micro payments to agile models capable of rapid deployment and expansion,
we gain significant competitive advantage over our traditional competitors. Faster
payouts, near instant settlements, ease of entry through subscription models and
enhanced privacy and security are just a few of the advantages we can implement.
We also make it easier for willing participants to interact in the internet economy,
without the need for a bank account knowingly using blockchain technology to
transact and interact.

THE MARKET SIZE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA’S
INTERNET ECONOMY

Despite the low participation rate of residents in the internet economy, there are 350 million
internet users, 104 million residents aged 25 to 34 and a 2018 transactional market size of 72
Billion USD. This market is thriving and is set to experience unprecedented growth in the
coming years. Google anticipates a market size of 240 Billion USD by 2025.

MARKET GROWTH POTENTIAL

6

RED​FOX​ L
​ ABS 4 VERTICALS OF FOCUS

E-COMMERCE
With E-Commerce doubling up year on year, RedFOX Labs has the opportunity to
compete against local giants such as Lazada, Shopee and Zilingo in this rapidly
growing industry sector. Through the use of blockchain technology, RedFOX Labs
can utilise its advantage of allowing faster and cheaper transactions, easier entry to
the market for the underserved and the ability to scale faster without the limitations
of being bound by physical borders.
RedFOX Labs will ascertain the business models with the least market saturation
and lowest barriers to entry and look to apply blockchain technology as its key point
of differentiation. With many existing models reliant heavily upon banking and
credit card solutions, RedFOX Labs can leverage Komodo technology to take these
services to the far reaching areas of both Vietnam and the greater Southeast Asian
region.

7

ONLINE MEDIA
This avenue provides a myriad of opportunities for RedFOX Labs when you consider
that Komodo technology already lends itself favorably to both gaming and online
streaming variations.
RedFOX Labs will look to leverage from Komodos Crypto Conditions UTXO based
smart contracts to offer a variety of services and products within the online media
sector to cater for the ever growing consumer demand.
Rapidly diminishing internet service provider costs coupled with increased options
in online content have lead to huge growth in the sector and heavy foreign
investment. With anticipated growth to nearly triple over the next 6 years, there is
plenty of room for RedFOX Labs to stamp its authority on this sector within the
region.

8

ONLINE TRAVEL
The online travel vertical provides much opportunity to RedFOX Labs in both
Vietnam and the region.
In Vietnam 80% of the industry is dominated by foreign players such as Expedia. This
is set to change as many of the local players transition away from the traditional
brick and mortar model, to the more heavily favored online version.
The next 6 years are set to bring about more than 250% growth and is ripe for a
locally based player to offer tailored solutions to the local population that is spending
more of their disposable income on travel both domestically and also internationally.
The region also provides a window of opportunity to appeal to and capture the more
rural regions of Southeast Asia through creative blockchain solutions that will unlock
a percentage of the dormant internet economy.

9

RIDE HAILING
Although Ride Hailing is an area of focus for RedFOX Labs, it will not focus nor intend
to compete against local giants like Grab and Go Jek for ride hailing.
The industry itself require domination to be profitable and therefore the focus will be
more on delivery and logistics which are a problem waiting to be solved in the
majority of the Southeast Asian countries.
With increasing traffic congestion and longer travel times, food and convenience
goods delivery services have boomed regionally. Demand outweighs the supply and
therefore a number of transport and delivery companies have emerged.
None of these is more prominent than Grab who are now also venturing into
payments and other sectors as it aims to become Asia’s next “super app”.

10

RED​FOX​ LABS ECOSYSTEM
CONCEPT TO DESIGN
The four industry sectors which we focus on are largely tied to the Internet Economy
and include E-commerce, Online Travel, Online Media and Ride Hailing.
RedFOX Labs employs a 9 step funnel process to determine which business to
replicate. This ‘RFOX Funnel’ process determines competition, market size, feasibility,
market growth potential and determines if there is an actual advantage in using
blockchain technology.
This model removes all emotion from the decision making process and relies on
hard data collected during the ‘market research’ stage. By using the ‘RFOX Funnel’
we greatly reduce the risk of replicating a business that is not successful.
Once the model is chose we have 100 days before we enter the market. This phase
entails hiring an expert local team, establishing legal structure, product
development, testing, marketing and defining target audience parameters. During
the 100 days the RedFOX team will be on the ground and actively involved in its
execution.
For the following 100 days, the RedFOX team will stay with the team and do post
launch reviews, product improvement, customer experience and touch-point
mapping, market analysis, design a revised 2-3 year business plan and help the
company to raise capital to and expand and scale.
After 200 days the RedFOX team will return to its headquarters to begin the
planning of the next business. RedFOX Labs will remain majority equity holders in
the businesses we build and occupy seats on the company board of directors.
RedFOX Labs sees a number of opportunities that fit within the vertical that lie
outside of traditional ride hailing services.

11

CONCEPT EXAMPLE
We replicate unicorn businesses and enhance them with features specific to
blockchain that allow for more rapid growth and scaling potential. These may
include unlocking the internet economy for the unbanked, QR payment systems,
faster and more secure payments, interoperability across platforms, reduced
transaction costs, immutable transaction records, stronger security levels, dynamic
pricing and automatic account reconciliation and a reduction of hacking threats.

**These images are for illustrative purposes only and designed to be a representation of general
orientation of the proposed projects or existing structures and are not in any way designed to represent
or guarantee anything that may or may not be built or completed. These concepts are not for
commercial distribution or sale.

12

PROOF OF CONCEPT

ZADDEX
The Zaddex Exchange is a centralised exchange that will soon develop a DEX using
Komodos CC UTXO technology and utilise all that Komodo technology has to offer.
This will be also accompanied by a full STO platform where Zaddex will utilise
partnerships previously established.
RedFOX Labs commissioned the build of the exchange and found a team and put
them in place. This team will take full operational control of the exchange and be
responsible for any legal and financial requirements. The Zaddex exchange has a
Komodo-based token called ZEX and was not subject to a sale of any type and was a
fair launch for the period of testing. This structure may be subject to change.

AIRDROP
All ZEX holders will receive 1 RFOX for each ZEX on an agreed-upon date.

13

TEAM STRUCTURE
The RedFOX Labs team will remain lean and agile. Our main competitive advantage
is that we have an ecosystem of service providers, vendors and third party providers,
meaning we can scale up and down with ease and are not burdened with extended
capital expenditure burden.
RedFOX Labs team will act as the strategists, designers, and implement the GTM
and business plans. RedFOX Labs will have agreements in place to work with a
number of professional service providers across multiple industries that can lend
deeper experience to each of the businesses we build.
As each business is likely to be different in its structure and design, we are better
suited to ‘on-call’ experts rather than trying to up-skill the existing team in industry
experience that may take years to develop.
The core team of RedFOX Labs will train and develop new members to understand
the DBOT (Design, Build, Operate, Transfer) model, which will allow us to set-up
more businesses in the second and third years.
The RedFOX Labs core team is experienced in running disruptive technology
businesses and start-ups in Southeast Asia and for multinational companies globally.
The network of contacts that has been established will allow us to grow and expand
with expert assistance and guidance.

KOMODO PLATFORM
Komodo is an open, modular blockchain platform with a unique multi-chain architecture.
Consistently recognized as one of the world’s most innovative blockchain projects, Komodo
hosts a global, interoperable blockchain ecosystem that’s secured with the power of the
Bitcoin network and independently scalable for every project.

DELAYED PROOF OF WORK (DPOW) SECURITY
Komodo’s innovative security mechanism protects the entire ecosystem with the power of
the Bitcoin network. This is accomplished through Komodo’s innovative Delayed Proof of
Work (dPoW) security mechanism, which notarizes a block from the Komodo blockchain
onto the Bitcoin ledger every ten minutes.
As a result, every blockchain integrated to Komodo’s dPoW security network receives a level
protection consistent with that of the Bitcoin network. To compromise a protected chain, an
attacker would need to overpower the native network, the KMD network, and the BTC
network— all at the same time. Komodo’s Blockchain Security Service is available to any
UTXO-based blockchain.
RedFOX Labs can therefore build out companies, infrastructure and chains, with the
knowledge that no matter how many transactions are utilised, they are protected by chains
with potentially much higher transaction volumes.

CONTINUOUS OPEN-SOURCE DEVELOPMENT
Komodo is an open-source project that is constantly innovating and developing. All new
features are pushed to every project in the ecosystem. With a future-proof blockchain
architecture, Komodo gives every project the ability to create modular, customized solutions
for any situation.
RedFOX Labs can benefit from current and future additions to the Komodo environment
through sharing, co-development and general improvements to the open-source
environment. This is extremely useful to a project with an ever-changing roster of clients and
subscribers.

18

LIMITLESS SCALABILITY
Komodo has a unique multi-chain architecture that gives every project a dedicated
blockchain with independent infrastructure. The activity on one blockchain cannot
and will not affect the performance on any other blockchain built with Komodo’s
technology.
In addition, every project has the option of adding more blockchains to scale out and
increase transaction-processing capacity. If one chain isn’t providing adequate
performance, additional chains can be added to scale out and increase performance
linearly. Komodo’s architecture is such that no project’s growth will ever be
constrained by limitations of the technology itself.
Scalability will be an extremely crucial piece of the RedFOX Labs ecosystem as to
reach mass adoption there needs to exist the possibility to scale rapidly and with
little notice. Komodo’s scalable solution ensures that RedFOX Labs is not bound to
heavy overheads, liabilities and unnecessary capital expenditure.
Learn more: ​https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-platform-new-scalability-solution/

CROSS-CHAIN INTEROPERABILITY
Every blockchain in the Komodo ecosystem has the opportunity to become part of a
seamlessly interoperable blockchain ecosystem. This allows cross-chain verification
of transactions and even cross-chain fungibility. Every Komodo-based blockchain is
connected to chains outside the ecosystem via atomic swaps. Komodo has already
linked 95% of all blockchains in existence.
An important factor in building out communities and products on Komodo
technology is to ensure that the languages used are largely agnostic and we are not
bound by the limitations of non-compatible infrastructure and core technology. We
can build with the confidence that the dApps and products we create will be
interoperable with all third party providers technology.

19

UTXO-BASED SMART CONTRACTS
Komodo’s UTXO-based smart contracts are revolutionary because they make
BTC-protocol blockchains Turing complete and enable language-agnostic
customization of spending conditions for any specific set of fund. They also enable
development of decentralized apps.
Komodo’s UTXO smart contracts are available on every independent blockchain
created within the ecosystem. Every project on Komodo has the opportunity to
create a blockchain platform.
Previously, many business models that were dependent on smart contracts were not
practical to implement as they relied heavy upon multiple exceptions and
permutations, not to mention gas fees. Komodo UTXO-based smart contracts allow
RedFOX Labs to build anything from simple one exception contracts, to complicated
and layered offerings, without the thought of high fees to execute.

ATOMIC SWAP TECHNOLOGY
Put simply, atomic swaps are peer-to-peer trades of cryptocurrencies made directly
from one user to another. Atomic swaps made wallet-to-wallet. In fact, atomic swaps
do not require centralized exchanges, proxy tokens, escrow services, or any other
type of third-party.
It’s important to emphasize that all traders hold their private keys throughout the
entire atomic swap process. As a result, atomic swap trading is magnitudes more
secure than trading crypto on a centralized exchange. It is also less expensive, as
transaction fees are minimal.

KOMODO’S MULTI-CHAIN SYNCING
Komodo’s multi-chain syncing combines multiple blockchains, each processing
transactions simultaneously, to achieve blockchain interoperability.
Komodo currently utilises the services of 1,024 individual chains to test the scalability
solution. Komodo’s independent chains are termed ‘assetchains’ and are capable of
processing completely independent transactions which are not performance
dependent on the other chains. Meaning if one chain experiences slower speeds or
high transaction numbers, this will not impact the other chains.
Using this multi-chain architecture allows the scaling of up to thousands of chains,
not only possible, but also extremely simple.
Komodo’s scaling solution follows a procedure somewhat similar to the dPoW
notarization process. To put it simply, Komodo’s scaling solution works by creating
many blockchains that can each process transactions simultaneously, while also
syncing with one another to achieve​ b
​ lockchain interoperability​.
It’s worth emphasizing the fact that there is no limit to the number of assetchains
that can exist on The Komodo platform. Assetchains are created for the purposes of
Komodo’ scaling solution, but they can also be created for independent projects. If
you’re a developer, entrepreneur, or enterprise leader and you’re interested in
launching your own scalable, secure blockchain, contact Komodo
at marketing@komodoplatform.com.
All of the assetchains using the Multi-Chain Syncing tech communicate with the
KMD chain. This interoperability can also be extended beyond the scaling solution
tech.
The synced chains can also communicate, via the KMD chain, with every other chain
that exists on Komodo Platform. This allows any chain on Komodo to verify
transactions that took place on any other chain in the ecosystem.

21

1. MERKLE ROOT OF MERKLE ROOTS
The first step in Komodo’s scaling solution is to create thousands of Merkle Trees out
of all the transactions taking place on each and every chain on Komodo. Read this
post about M
​ erkle Trees​ if you aren’t too familiar with the concept. It will make
understanding Komodo’s scaling solution much easier.
Traditionally, each block in a blockchain has one (and only one) Merkle Root. That
Merkle Root is the digest of all the transactions IDs for all of the transactions written
onto that particular block. Like all other blockchains, this is true for each block in
each of the assetchains on The Komodo platform.
New blocks are mined roughly every 60 seconds for each assetchain. This means one
new block, with one unique Merkle Root, is produced every minute or so, for each
chain.
Then, every ten minutes, Komodo’s notary nodes create a new Merkle Tree out of all
the Merkle Roots that have been generated since the previous notarization. This
happens for each assetchain in the Komodo ecosystem utilising the multi-chain
syncing feature.
Since blocks are mined roughly every 60 seconds and the notarization process
occurs roughly every ten minutes, there are between 8 and 12 Merkle Roots that get
organized into a new Merkle Tree. Each new Merkle Tree fingerprints these 8 to 12
Merkle Roots into a new Merkle Root. We might call these new digests the “Merkle
Root of Merkle Roots” or the MoM for short.

22

2. SYNC TO KMD
Next, Komodo’s notary nodes take the MoM from each assetchain and sync them all
with the KMD chain.
This is similar to the dPoW process except, rather than notarizing a snapshot of the
KMD ecosystem to the BTC chain, the notary nodes are notarizing a single digest—
the Merkle Root of Merkle Roots, or MoM— from every assetchain onto the main
KMD chain. This doubles as a security feature for every assetchain in the ecosystem.
Learn more about​ K
​ omodo’s Blockchain Security Services​ ​here.

THE FINGERPRINT (MOM) IS SENT TO THE KMD BLOCKCHAIN

23

3. FINGERPRINT DATA
Once all the MoM have been synced with the KMD chain, they are organized into yet
another Merkle Tree. So all 1,024 digests are fingerprinted into one new Merkle
Root— the Merkle Root of the Merkle Roots of Merkle Roots (MoMoM).
This single code is the fingerprint of every single transaction that has taken place on
The Komodo platform since the previous MoMoM notarization occurred. That’s true
because every transaction on each block is hashed into a Merkle Root. All of the
Merkle Roots for all the new blocks are hashed into a MoM. This happens for each
chain in the Komodo ecosystem. Then those MoM are sent to the KMD chain, put
into a new Merkle Tree, and hashed to form the MoMoM.

KOMODO CREATES A MASTER FINGERPRINT (MOMOM)

24

4. SYNC FROM KMD
The fourth and final step in Komodo’s scaling solution process is to notarize the
MoMoM back onto every assetchain in the ecosystem. Komodo’s notary nodes
perform this operation, too.
This last step is crucial because it allows interoperability between all chains within
the Komodo ecosystem. That is, transactions that occur on one blockchain can be
quickly and efficiently verified on a completely separate blockchain. This increases
the speed at which the ecosystem can process payments and transactions.
It bears repeating that all four steps of Komodo’s scaling solution are repeated
approximately every ten minutes. This is an ongoing process that continually puts all
of the chains in Komodo’s ecosystem in sync with each other.

FINGERPRINTS ARE SENT BACK TO ALL CHAINS

25

SECURITY AND SPEED
Because Merkle Trees present such an efficient method of verifying data, Komodo’s
scaling solution can process more transactions per second than any other
blockchain platform in existence.
THE MULTI-CHAIN SYNCING TECH HAS ALREADY PROVEN IT CAN HANDLE OVER
20,000 TRANSACTIONS PER SECOND.
Currently, Komodo is working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to obtain the
infrastructure necessary to increase the magnitude of our scaling tests. The goal is to
achieve a sustained result of 1 Million transactions per second. Komodo is on the
Road to 1 Million.

UTILITY OF RFOX
REDFOX ENTERPRISE KOMODO ECOSYSTEM
The RFOX coin will be used as a form of payment to contractors, developers, network
operators, for security, bug bounties, discounts on certification and many more. The
RFOX token will serve as the global currency within the RFOX-KMD enterprise world.

BUY IN
As RedFOX Labs will build out a number of businesses, the RFOX token will be used
as the sole purchasing method for these token generation events. There may be
times whereby other tokens or purchasing methods may be accepted but the RFOX
token will always provide the best rate of exchange for these purchases.

ECOSYSTEM TOKEN
Some of the companies that RedFOX Labs creates may not have a need for their
own native token and may choose the path of becoming a side-chain and therefore
utilising the RFOX token to facilitate transactions and reward miners for processing
these blocks.
An example of this could be when building a pay TV model. Customers may require
a credit card to transact and instead we may offer a QR code and then facilitate
receipt generation or personal account verification on the blockchain. In this instant
the processing of these transactions may be facilitated by using the RFOX token,
without the customer ever knowing they were even interacting with the blockchain.

CONSULTING
RedFOX Labs will offer discounted rates on consulting services when using the RFOX
token.

TOKEN ALLOCATION
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SALE
Private sale is 10 million seed sale at $0.035 USD and 70 million private sale @ $0.04
USD, with public sale 50 million tokens at $0.05 USD

KOMODO DEVELOPMENT FUND
The further development of Komodo is paramount for the success of RFOX,
therefore we will distribute 100 million tokens over 4 releases starting at 6 months
and ending after 2 years.

TEAM AND ADVISORS
These tokens will be released over 2 years, as tabled above

ZEX HOLDERS
As a thank you to the community that helped mine and test the exchange for the
Zaddex team during its development, RFOX would like to repay our gratitude and
establish a long term relationship with Zaddex as we will use this platform to launch
future projects and provide liquidity for tokens within both the RFOX and KMD
ecosystems. 40 million tokens will be delivered 1:1 any remaining tokens will be used
for the purpose of attracting people to the RFOX ecosystem.

RFOX HOLDERS
RFOX holders will be rewarded with 280 million tokens over a period of 2 years,
beginning at year 1 and ending at year 3.

REDFOX ENTERPRISE ECOSYSTEM AND PARTNERS
240 million tokens will be reserved for the development of the RedFOX Enterprise
Komodo Ecosystem which will begin development after 18 months of launching
RFOX.

18. SECURITY
You are responsible for implementing reasonable measures for securing your wallet, vault or other

requisite private key(s) or other credentials necessary to access such storage mechanism(s). If your
private key(s) or other access credentials are lost, you may lose access to your Tokens. The Company is
not responsible for any losses, costs or expenses relating to lost access credentials.

ANNEX A
RFOX RISKS
By purchasing, owning, and using RFOX, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:
1. Risk​ ​of​ ​Losing​ ​Access​ ​to​ ​RFOX​ ​Due​ ​to​ ​Loss​ ​of​ ​Private​ ​Key(s),​ ​Custodial​ ​Error​ ​or​ ​Purchaser Error
A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of RFOX stored in
your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet
or vault storing RFOX will result in loss of such RFOX. Moreover, any third party that gains access to
such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use,
may be able to misappropriate you RFOX. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to
the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store RFOX in, including your own failure to
properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your RFOX.
Additionally, your failure to follow precisely the procedures set forth in for buying and receiving Tokens,
including, for instance, if you provide the wrong address for the receiving RFOX, or provides an address
that is not Komodo compatible, may result in the loss of your tokens.
2. Risks​ ​Associated​ ​with​ ​the​ ​Komodo​ ​Protocol
Because RFOX and the Crypto20 platform are based on the Komodo protocol, any malfunction,
breakdown or abandonment of the Komodo protocol may have a material adverse effect on the
platform or RFOX. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development
of quantum computing, could present risks to the RFOX and the platform, including the utility of th
eRFOX for obtaining services, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that
underpins the Komodo protocol.
3. Risk​ ​of​ ​Hacking​ ​and​ ​Security​ ​Weaknesses
Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the platform or RFOX
in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,
consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing. Furthermore, because the platform is

39

based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team
may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the platform,
which could negatively affect the platform andR, including the utility of RFOX for obtaining services.
4. Risks​ ​Associated​ ​with​ ​Markets​ ​for​RFOX
If secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively
new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or
manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to
RFOX (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile.
5. Risk​ ​of​ ​Uninsured​ ​Losses
Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, RFOX are uninsured unless you
specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value,
there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by Company, to offer recourse to you.
6. Risks​ ​Associated​ ​with​ ​Uncertain​ ​Regulations​ ​and​ ​Enforcement​ ​Actions
The regulatory status of RFOX and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many
jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation
with respect to such technology and its applications, including the RFOX ecosystem and RFOX. It is
likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes
to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the
ecosystem and RFOX. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the platform and RFOX in various
ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale and
delivery of RFOX constitutes unlawful activity or that RFOX are a regulated instrument that require
registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale
and delivery thereof. The Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory
actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially
undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.
7. Risks​ ​Arising​ ​from​ ​Taxation
The tax characterization of RFOX is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with
purchasing RFOX, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes,
income taxes and tax reporting requirements.
8. Risk​ ​of​ ​Competing​ ​platforms
It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same open source code and
protocol underlying the platform and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the
RFOX services.

40

9. Risks​ ​Arising​ ​from​ ​Lack​ ​of​ ​Governance​ ​Rights
Because RFOX confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the RFOX token or the
Company, all decisions involving the Company’s products or services within the ecosystem or the
Company itself will be made by the Company at its sole discretion. These decisions could adversely
affect the ecosystem and the utility of any RFOX you own, including their utility for obtaining services.
10. Unanticipated​ ​Risks
Cryptographic tokens such as RFOX are a new technology. In addition to the risks included in this
Annex A of these Terms, there are other risks associated with your purchase, possession and use of
RFOX including unanticipated risks. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or
combinations of the risks discussed in this Annex A of these Terms.
