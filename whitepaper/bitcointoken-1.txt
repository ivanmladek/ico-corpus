Abstract
BitcoinToken is a de-centralized Currency on blockchain technology. Open Source.
Community run and maintained. It is a currency ultimately owned by the people who
possess it, a financial system owned by individuals not a large entity.
BitcoinToken is not an ICO but a radical step towards repeating and improving the
legacy of the original Bitcoin in creating a de-centralized currency, by the people for the
people. Unlike other cryptocurrency ventures that seeks to sell all or almost their entire
tokens during their ICO, BitcoinToken is designed to be majorly distributed as awards
to adopters for maintenance and continual improvement of the project. The remaining
large portion of tokens are to be airdropped freely. This again is another attempt to start
a movement of a crypto community that can not be controlled by major donors or
financial investors but each person of the community adds value to the currency.
Instead of nodes it is people. Instead of business decisions, it is passionate people
adopting a new way of thinking and transferring money through blockchain
technology.

Introduction
From $0.003 USD in March 2010 to $9337.74 USD in February 2018. This is of course, the
price-value of 1 BTC (Bitcoin) in US Dollars. Bitcoin which started in 2009, is a cryptocurrency, a
digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to control its
creation and management, rather than relying on central authorities.
The Bitcoin network came into existence with the release of the first open source bitcoin client
and the issuance of the first bitcoins, with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the first block of bitcoins
ever (known as the genesis block), which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins even when it had no
significant price-value. A lot of investors and traders from numerous parts of the world have
since then, found it profitable and comfortable to participate in the economy of this currency.
Cryptocurrency, which started with the introduction of Bitcoin, has now led to the presence of
over 1500 crypto-based coins in the world. This technology (Cryptography) which works with a
transparent ledger system, known as Blockchain has made its marketplace a convenient one for
everyone.

A NEW SOLUTION NEEDED
With larger adoption Bitcoin has run into problems like scalability. It’s price-point is daunting to
investors or for common day usage. Mining resources to sustain the network have become
astronomical in energy consumption. The time and fees of the TX have made the currency
un-usable for day to day transactions with waiting periods of up to 30 minutes or longer. These;
among others, are the problems that inspired the creation of Bitcoin Token (BTK). Despite the
challenges associated with bitcoin, a lot of investors still want to participate in its market. To
this end, BTK is introduced as a platform for easy, fast, affordable and efficient use of bitcoin.
The solution is centered around giving people (BTK community) the ability to comfortably use
bitcoin through a scalable alias – BTK.

Our Vision
One ailment of the crypto-currency world is over-technicality and confusing jargon. We believe
that blockchain technology can be delivered to a larger user-base with simplicity, and less
confusion. BitcoinToken is striving to be one of the leaders in adoption of digital currency for
everyday use. We intend to simplify and bring the powerful peer-to-peer ledger system into the
hands of every day people who will utilize it for everyday transactions. Our vision to
accomplish this is to put the community and the people first. We regularly speak of ourselves as
a community currency and enjoy the simple comments and interactions of new users to
blockchain technology. We allow them to dictate how we should make things easier and more
effective for their use. We also are community run and desire to set the framework of an open
source system where this currency will perpetuate with the community in control not a large
investor or any larger centralized entity. We desire for BTK to remain and continue as a
decentralized currency for the people.

Objectives
E-COMMERCE APPLICATIONS
BitcoinToken is looking to make the bitcoin currency easily transferable and liquid-able for
purchasing power. We are already in talks with various companies that we believe are
spearheading the way forward to integration with all major existing e-commerce online
platforms. The current TX rates can be as low as .2 cents, so this makes our solution strongly
competitive with Paypal or Stripe who charge 2.9%+ for each transaction of money. So our goal
is to have BitcoinToken available to be used by small businesses or websites as method of
payment or donation to transfer funds.

TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES

BitcoinToken is to provide a stable cryptocurrency that will be trusted and adopted. We are
currently utilizing the Ethereum blockchain as we have started an ERC20 token under their
system. Our circulation of tokens is 10 billion with a decimal point of 18 and our contract
address is: 0xdb8646f5b487b5dd979fac618350e85018f557d4. The Ethereum platform is trusted
and utilized by very large companies and is a very forward thinking blockchain. We have
discussed amongst developers the need to continue to evaluate the long-term durability of the
ETH blockchain and if we need to start our own blockchain. So we have not closed the door to
this possibility depending on the adoption rate of BitcoinToken and it’s scalability issues.

EDUCATING USERS
BitcoinToken is very sensitive to the need to educate people on blockchain technology in a
simple user-friendly fashion. This objective is close to the heart of the project in putting people
and their needs first in ensuring adoption of the technology is easy and even fun. Our platform
is open source and also spreads further education and forward thinking of the blockchain
technology, spurring on innovation.

WORLD-WIDE COMMUNITY
BitcoinToken has, since its foundation, been a world-wide currency. Developers from many
countries, advisors, innovators and volunteers on social media have been from varied parts of
the world. This has become part of our DNA to cater to the needs of translation work and
adoption of blockchain technology in countries all over the world. This is another way that
blockchain technology is disrupting the financial sector in that it is rewarding not only the rich
but poor in any part of the world. We are excited to have team members joining from all walks
of life and social status to be a part of BitcoinToken.

USABILITY
BitcoinToken will make blockchain technology less daunting for the end user and give people
renewed confidence in this pioneering way of transferring funds through a peer to peer digital
network. From our custom applications to partnerships with like-minded teams, we are seeking
to make this technology as user-friendly as possible.

members to remain anonymous in their

on the main project and ensure steady growth.
We see the same in the original vision of
bitcoin, anonymity was also part of its success.
Our goal is results that are tangible in
user-interaction and adoption and not to focus
on the developers behind the scenes.
B) DECENTRALIZED
Many ERC20 tokens starting are used by
businesses that are centralized entities. The
original vision of blockchain technology is to
operate in a way that is peer to peer and not a
part of any centralized hub. The genius of this
technology is that it runs and works apart
from the control of any one individual.

We are disseminating the currency in a way
that will not allow for whales or large
investors of a certain extend to own the
currency at the beginning. This gives an equal
fair share for investors of all types. Being a
token and not a mineable currency we are
ensuring wide distribution in varying
amounts.
E) LARGE AIRDROP
Airdropping of token currencies is a fad right
now as a PR stunt for many new tokens
starting. We are looking to airdrop not just part
of the currency but the lion-share to a
large-user base.

Our Growth
WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED?
BitcoinToken has grown at a fast pace and many have remarked how well and fast the
project is growing. The Cryptocurrency world is a very face paced technology and
things move quickly. We seek to follow pace with fast-growing innovation, and
implement the most effective and new technical additions to our currency.

Here is a short list of some accomplishments in the past month (with this current rate of
growth we could be one of the leading tokens in a matter of time):
- The @bitcoin_token Twitter account has grown to over 10,000 engaged followers, with
a twitter audit of over 98% real followers.
- We have started over 15 Twitter Language translation accounts, each with an active
#BTK team member running each channel.
- A Telegram following of over 2,000 members has also been achieved through very little
promotion of it’s channel, along with over 5 active #BTK team admins.
- We have distributed BitcoinToken to over 1,600 addresses, along with a current
campaign of giveaways and bounties that will add 2,000+ addresses to that number in
the very short term. Our general airdrop will increase that number to over 100,000.
- Currently BitcoinToken (BTK) is listed officially on 3 exchanges (Token Store, Stocks
Exchange, Fork Delta). There are other exchanges we are negotiating with.
- The active #BTK community has initiated voting with 5 larger exchanges and we have
significant numbers on some of these vote lists that compete with and even supersede
other well known established currencies.
- Development is almost complete for a referral based #airdrop script that will increase
our twitter following to an estimated 100k followers. This script will
allow us to send out the BitcoinToken #airdrop to these followers
via smart contracts.
- The #BTK team is growing daily with new developers,
marketers, and volunteers of all types committed
passionately to the project.

LOOKING BEYOND (2019-2020)
- In the fast-pace crypto world everything can change in one year! Our main longer
goals would be larger user-adoption and on-going development of our APP.
Integration with cutting edge platforms into e-commerce and other methods of
transferring monetary value. We will continually be petitioning for larger and more
extensive open source development help and ensure a public free decentralized
platform for the furthering of the project. We intend to see increased value and use of
BitcoinToken over time.

Joining with #BTK
BitcoinToken is a tremendous opportunity for someone who is looking to invest in
blockchain technology. We believe with large user adoption and holding of the currency
there will be increased value and demand for BitcoinToken (BTK). Many projects start
with ICO’s or pre-made business models that ensure that the company or entity is first
in reward. We intend to reverse this where the people themselves are rewarded as early
adopters for a pro-longed period of time.
Join us! Be a part of crypto-currency history and enjoy the benefits for yourself. Our
currency is available at a variety of exchanges, but our recommended avenue for
investors is the Token Store (a safe trust-less decentralized exchange) that we have
partnered with initially and will continue in that relationship. We welcome your
questions and ideas, we are here to serve you: talk@btk.community
