Abstract
In this paper, we present a high-level overview of the OXYCOIN® mobile application: the one place
that contains everything cryptocurrency investors need right at their fingertips. This mobile application
will enable investors to easily purchase cryptocurrencies directly with FIAT (i.e. USD or EUR),
manage all their wallets and passwords, implement a user-friendly Global Address Book, and will be
the information hub where they can access any information they need to make informed investment
decisions. As a result of its simplicity, we believe the OXYCOIN® mobile application will pave the way
for mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.
This paper will also contain an overview of the OXYCOIN® Software Development Kits which will
serve as solutions to another large problem - software development tool limitations - that is also
hindering cryptocurrency mass adoption. After completing our first milestone, the OXYCOIN® mobile
application, we will release an “Enhanced Decentralized Software Development Kit” which will allow
non-blockchain developers to build decentralized applications (DAPPs) using JavaScript and enable
something truly powerful that has never been possible before – Mobile and Web applications interacting
with decentralized applications! With these powerful tools being placed in the hands of non-blockchain
developers, many exciting OXYCOIN® token uses cases will be made possible.
The purpose of this document is to illustrate the vision of the OXYCOIN® team, explain the problems
that we are solving and how we are going to achieve our goals. There will be a separate Technical Paper
which will further elaborate on the technical fundamentals such as how the dPOS (Delegated Proof of
Stake) blockchain will be used, the network infrastructure, security, and core functionalities of the mobile
application and future developments.

Introduction – The First Problem: User-Facing
Limitations
For many years, the cryptocurrency community has steadily grown, but the fact remains that this
community is still in the early stages of expansion. Reputable media outlets have started reporting on
the progress - mostly the price - of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As more exciting news stories
are reported and the world’s curiosity towards cryptocurrency grows, people are continuously attracted
to the fascinating world of digital currencies. There are many people wanting to invest in blockchain
technologies, unfortunately many have not been able to due to the complexity of entering cryptomarkets.
Ever since the inception of Bitcoin and throughout the entire history of cryptocurrency, one of the
major barriers to entry for curious individuals has always been converting FIAT directly into Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies. The process usually requires some degree of technical skill and knowledge,
an understanding of security, and trust in a system which is unlike anything these people have previously
used. There’s no phone call to a broker to make a trade, there’s no speaking with an advisor in an office,
and of course there are ways of being swindled. Currently, the process of buying cryptocurrencies is a
tremendous multi-step hassle. Generally speaking, it begins with trying to figure out how to buy Bitcoin
from various platforms (e.g. Bitcoin ATM, website, cash-deal), sending it to an exchange (e.g. Bittrex,
Poloniex) and then figuring out how to make a trade for the desired cryptocurrency. These multiple
steps can seem complex, intimidating, and incomprehensible in some cases. Even for experienced
investors with technical knowledge, the process of converting FIAT into digital currencies is generally
slow, limited, frustrating, and occasionally risky. Due to these inconveniences, we believe that curious
and qualified investors are still turning their backs on the crypto-markets and are consequently missing
opportunities they would have otherwise seized.
Another one of the major barriers to entry for investors is acquiring the right news articles and
development progress information. It’s common for a crypto-enthusiast browsing the internet in search
of accurate information needed to make an informed decision. It’s not easy for new crypto-enthusiasts
to find the right sources because they are seemingly endless and unfamiliar – the task of seeking
information can feel cumbersome in a world they have just started trying to understand. Wouldn’t it be
logical to have all the current news, market values, video tutorials, and technology updates in one place
where investors can quickly and easily access the information needed to make informed decisions?

Introduction – The Second Problem: Developer
Tool Limitations
In the current evolution of blockchain technology, there are still limitations to decentralized applications,
also known as DAPPs, as they require a blockchain node (server) to properly execute. These nodes
are difficult to use for the average end-user. For example, in the case of Ethereum, users must tweak
“GAS values” and “transaction values”. These tweaks allow the DAPP to accept the inputs and function
as desired. In a world where people want to easily send money with the click of a button, these extra
technical steps are not user-friendly and increase the risk of user-error.
Outside the challenges faced by regular users, in the world of blockchain software development, DAPP
SDKs (Decentralized Application Software Development Kits) are lacklustre and often difficult to
understand - a problem which limits the potential of what can be created with blockchain technology.
The existing DAPP SDKs do not offer the proper facilitations and information to developers.
Consequently, they are forced to write code for the most basic functionalities, which is extra work that
can hinder progress and deter them from working with blockchain all together. In addition to these
problems, there does not yet exist an SDK specifically designed for Mobile or Web applications. This
type of tool would have the power to spark a complete shift in the entire world of software development.
After completing our first milestone - the OXYCOIN® mobile platform - we will tackle the developerfacing problem by creating the Enhanced DAPP SDK. As mentioned in our Abstract, this special tool
will enable “non-blockchain developers” to build decentralized applications (DAPPs) using JavaScript
and enable something truly powerful that has never been possible before – the interaction of DAPPS
with Mobile and Web applications! A valuable aspect of this SDK is that developers will essentially no
longer have to worry about the backend. Our technology manages the backend work behind the scenes
and allows DAPPs to “talk” with our blockchain through Application Program Interfaces (APIs). For
once, developers will have the tools they need to solely focus on what matters - building their frontend.

Our Vision – The Solutions
We’re pleased to announce that the solutions to the aforementioned problems are the OXYCOIN®
mobile platform and OXYCOIN® Enhanced DAPP SDK (Decentralized App Software Development
Kit). It is our mission to enable investors that are trying to enter the crypto-markets; we can achieve
this by simplifying the purchase of cryptocurrencies. Our mobile application will be the easiest way to
purchase cryptocurrencies with FIAT and will also feature a central information hub where investors will
receive any crypto-media they would need for investing in digital currencies and blockchain projects. In
short, we are tackling user-facing limitations by building the one and only platform that has everything
that crypto-enthusiasts will need in one place and tackling developer tool limitations by creating SDK’s
which will allow Mobile and Web applications to make use of decentralized applications.
Understanding the true growth potential of the cryptocurrency world becomes obvious when observing
the facts. According to a study by the University of Cambridge: “the current number of unique active
users of cryptocurrency wallets is estimated to be between 2.9 million and 5.8 million” - representing
less than 1% of the world’s population. Though the full growth potential of the crypto-markets clearly
remains largely untapped, at the time of writing this white paper the total market capitalization of all
cryptocurrencies is still a very impressive figure - approximately $141,253,369,650 (~ $141 Billion)
according to Cryptolization.
With community support and ICO funding, the OXYCOIN® team plans to push the number of active
users to over 10 million and the market capitalization to over $300,000,000,000 ($300 Billion) in our
first year by enabling a whole new wave of crypto-enthusiasts that are waiting for a simple platform to
help them easily convert FIAT into cryptocurrency.

Technical Summary - OXYCOIN® Mobile
Application
The main feature of the OXYCOIN® mobile application is to enable users to purchase cryptocurrencies
directly with FIAT - whether they have IT knowledge or not. OXYCOIN® provides a user-friendly
platform that contains all the information and tools needed by any crypto-enthusiast and puts it right at
their fingertips. With OXYCOIN® our users will be empowered to make informed decisions and take
positions in crypto-markets effortlessly.
We’re also tackling the issue of tracking multiple addresses for multiple cryptocurrencies, lowering the
possibility of sending funds to the wrong place, by introducing our OXYCOIN® Global Address Book.
Users may create one single username that is searchable in the Global Address Book, and all their wallets
will be linked to this one username. This feature lowers the risks that accompany long alphanumeric
addresses such as “3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy”, which are prone to typos.
With our Global Address Book, users simply type their friend’s name, see their friend’s various
cryptocurrency wallets, and transfer funds to them within seconds. Keeping simplicity at the core of our
vision, we also plan to utilize QR codes as another user-friendly way to transfer funds.
The OXYCOIN® platform avails itself of the full power of blockchains to simplify the lives of
cryptocurrency users in that OXYCOIN® usernames are stored in the blockchain, allowing anyone
to find the addresses of their friends and use them right away. For example, when opening the mobile
application, a fresh list of the usernames (and their addresses) will be retrieved from the blockchain. This
enables auto-completion when one types a username in the Global Address Book.
These are just a handful of examples to briefly illustrate the value we can add by enabling user-friendly
features by including specific types of information in our secure blockchain, extracting its practically
limitless value. There are more technological features we will implement with our OXYCOIN® mobile
application, and the full details will be explained in our Technical Paper.

Technical Summary - OXYCOIN® SDKs and OXY
Token Use Cases
After completing our first milestone, the OXYCOIN® mobile platform, we will tackle the second
problem – Developer Tool Limitations - by creating the Enhanced DAPP SDK, Mobile SDK, and Web
SDK.
ENHANCED DAPP SDK
The Enhanced DAPP SDK is crucial for enabling “non-blockchain developers” to build their own
DAPPs using JavaScript and make it possible for Mobile and Web applications to interact with them.
The current problem is that most of the existing DAPPs only contain backend code (code that runs
on the server). This means that to build a user interface, you would typically need to have your own
server and create a website (or an app) that interacts with core-code through Application Program
Interfaces (APIs). We will deliver the OXYCOIN® Enhanced DAPP SDK to let developers build User
Interfaces without the need to run their own server. Such an SDK will also be used to interact with
our mobile apps or even third-party mobile apps. The SDK will essentially allow DAPPs to “talk” with
our blockchain through Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and manage the backend work behind
the scenes. For once, developers will have the tools they need to solely focus on what really matters building their frontend.
Another important feature to consider is that developers would have the ability the create user
interfaces directly within their DAPP and allow any other software developer to use their DAPP on the
OXYCOIN® mobile app.
User interfaces aside, we believe that third party developers with little to no experience in blockchain
technologies who want to use OXY in their app need the chance to be involved. That’s why the
Enhanced DAPP SDK will also include mechanisms for developers to:
- Manage end-user one-time payments (e.g. Google PlayTM Store)
- Manage end-user subscriptions model payments
Providing these developers with an easy way to interact with our OXY blockchain will be critical in
making users aware of OXY and the power of blockchain technology.

Technical Summary - OXYCOIN® SDKs and OXY
Token Use Cases
THE MOBILE SDK & WEB SDK:
The OXYCOIN® SDKs for Mobile Applications and Web Applications will pave the way for a whole
new wave of development possibilities! Developers will be able to create DAPPS that can interact
with our Mobile and Web SDKs. When considering use cases for the OXY token, it is very exciting
that developers could now take advantage of the OXY in-app payment system instead of using current
expensive options such as Google Play™ Store (30%). All the functionalities included in the Enhanced
DAPP SDK – UI rendering, in-app purchases, in-app subscriptions – will have their own counterpart
within the Mobile SDK and Web SDK. The potential with these tools is effectively limitless.
What can be achieved with these new development tools?
The momentum behind mobile application development continues to grow each day and blockchain
technologies are quickly gaining more traction between users and developers. With the potential that
our 3 SDKs could unlock, we expect to see a proliferation of Mobile & Web apps using blockchain
technology as their persistent database. Here are some examples of token use cases:

•

Mobile in-app revenue model (e.g. games accepting/spending OXY). To contrast, through the
Google PlayTM platform, developers pay 30% commission which is very expensive.
Mobile apps securing their data using OXY blockchain. Blockchains are very secure, inexpensive,
and efficient. Conventional methods for storing data are more expensive, centralized, and potentially
more vulnerable to security breaches.

•
•
•
•

Mobile apps marketplaces
Micropayments
Subscription model DAPPs
E-commerce websites using OXY blockchain

•

These examples are just a handful of use cases and there are obviously many other opportunities for
developers when they start making use of our powerful SDK’s. Once the floodgates of creativity are
opened for non-blockchain developers, it will be exciting to observe the evolution of DAPP integration
into the Mobile and Web world.

The Plan
MOBILE APP
Our talented Android and iOS developers are actively working to produce the first version of the
OXYCOIN® mobile app. After the first version is released, we will continue to develop new features and
add more cryptocurrencies into the OXYCOIN® platform.
The backbone of the mobile application relies on a robust blockchain network that has 100% uptime,
meaning the network will always be online and available. The blockchain will securely store your wallet
addresses of any supported cryptocurrency by linking it with your username. This way, other users can
easily transfer cryptocurrency to your wallet by finding your username in a Global Address Book. If you
would like to read more about the use of our blockchain or other technical information, please refer to
our Technical Paper.
MARKETING
To reach our goals of making the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies a reality, it will be crucial that
we continuously promote our vision across the globe. Our talented marketing team will be actively
promoting the OXYCOIN® platform by using ambassadors and distributing media through major social
media platforms and media outlets.
ICO
An Initial Coin Offering, a common way of starting projects in the blockchain world, will be used to
generate the seed funding that is needed to support our project goals. The ICO details can be found on
the “ICO – Initial Coin Offering” section of this white paper and on the ICO web page.
EARLY SUPPORTERS
There are individuals who would like to support OXYCOIN® before the ICO begins. To compensate
them for their extra support and trust, we are developing an “Early Supporter Program”. Early
supporters will receive many benefits which are described in the “ESP – Early Supporter Program”
section of this white paper and on the Early Supporter web page.
ROADMAP
In short, we’re starting with creating the iOS and Android mobile applications, creating the
OXYCOIN® website, launching our main production network. The official Roadmap of our project can
be found in the “Roadmap” section of this white paper and on the Roadmap webpage.

Early Supporters Program – A New Approach
Conventional token exchange platforms revolve around the concept of currency exchange; Bitcoins
in exchange for tokens. The relationship between development teams and supporters is virtually nonexistent - strictly monetary. This means the voice of the supporters is not heard and their knowledge is
not leveraged.
The OXYCOIN® team believes in the value of supporter knowledge and experience. We know that
you have the power to grow and improve our platform, thus we would like to give you a mechanism
to vocalize your opinions and collaborate. The Early Supporters will essentially be the voice of our
community and will actively take part in the decision making through our weighted polling system.
For example, we understand there are many ways to monetize our platform, but our current primary
focus is developing a revolutionary and user-friendly mobile application. This means our new approach
involves leveraging the expertise of the Early Supporters, which will provide many possible solutions for
the future success of our platform. This new system will assist our team in determining the best course of
action for advancing the potential of OXYCOIN®.
One of the best aspects this program is the Status and Bonus Protection for Early Supporters. For
individuals planning to send BTC or alternative cryptocurrencies, this system ensures that when you join
the Early Supporters Program, your status and bonus tier will be protected in the event of a downward
trend in the alternative currency markets during the ESP/ICO period. Once an Early Supporters,
always an Early Supporters. The main purpose of this protection is to ensure that the Early Supporters
win big if the currencies they send increase in value and still win when the currencies they send decrease
in value. Please note, there is an entire section dedicated to explaining this concept in full detail with
various examples beginning from the section entitled “Distribution Calculations – Fundamentals”.
Early Supporters will receive many other benefits such as Early-Bird-News, Early-Bird-Access, poll
taking, ROI (Return on Investment) calculations, insight into our detailed task list, Meet & Greet with
the team, and receiving BONUS OXY.

13

Early Supporters Program – Bonus Structure
The contribution of Early Supporters will receive a bonus of 25% or more OXY in the ICO coin
calculation. Furthermore, that same weight will also be used in the poll-taking process, thus Supporters
with larger amounts of OXY will have more voting weight. Please note, we will be accepting the
following cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCC), Ethereum (ETH), ARK (ARK),
SHIFT (SHIFT), RISE (RISE), LISK (LSK). The financial details for our Bonus and ICO distribution
calculations when using cryptocurrencies other than BTC for can be found in the section covering
examples for distribution calculations.
BONUS STRUCTURE
From August 21st, 2017 until August 31st, 2017 - Early Supporters the following bonuses:
•
•
•
•

Send 4 BTC or more: receive 25% bonus
Send 10 BTC or more: receive 30% bonus
Send 20 BTC or more: receive 35% bonus
Send 50 BTC or more: receive 50% bonus

EARLY BIRD ADDITIONAL BONUS
From August 15th, 2017 until August 20th, 2017 - Early Supporters receive an additional 10% bonus:
•
•
•
•

Send 4 BTC or more: receive 25% + 10% = 35% bonus
Send 10 BTC or more: receive 30% + 10% = 40% bonus
Send 20 BTC or more: receive 35 % + 10% = 45% bonus
Send 50 BTC or more: receive 50% + 10% = 60% bonus

ICO – Initial Coin Offering Overview
An Initial Coin Offering, a common way of starting a project in crypto-currency world, will be used to
generate the seed funding that is needed to support our project goals.
MINIMUM THRESHOLD
We are looking to raise a minimum of 250 BTC. This will enable us to deliver v1.0 of the mobile
applications (basic functionality) and enable it to run on our stable blockchain network. The 250 BTC
will cover all the costs related to this including development, marketing and server expenses until
December 31, 2017. Therefore, we will be setting 250 BTC as our minimum funding threshold.
TARGET
The target figure for the campaign is 700 BTC. This will enable us to release a fully functional version of
the application on both Android and iOS mobile platforms which will include full functionality of all
features, a news section, video tutorials and a globally stable blockchain network.
Hard Cap - A Funding Ceiling of 2,000 BTC has been established. This is to ensure that those who sent
BTC receive a certain amount of OXY after the end of the ICO. If the 2,000 BTC limit is reached, the
ICO will be closed and the OXY tokens distributed between the participants.
SUPPORTING WITH ALTCOINS
Accepted tokens are: BTC, BCC, ETH, SHIFT, LISK, RISE and ARK. For those participants
supporting with Altcoins rather than BTC, the value of the tokens used will be averaged across the
period of August 15th to the end of the ICO Period. The average value will be calculated by picking the
value of each Altcoin multiple times a day using the Coinmarketcap API functionalities.
PRICE PER OXY
The price of the OXY token will depend upon the amount raised during the ICO and reaching the
minimum funding goal of 250 BTC. The full calculation details and examples can be found in the
sections of this white paper for “Distribution Calculation Examples”.

•

Supporters will be given a chance to request a full refund of their support funds until October 15,
2017 01:00am UTC.
We will continue developing v1.0 of the mobile application.
There will be a fixed price of 0,00000933 BTC per OXY.
The OXY that are not sold in the ICO will be locked away in a separate wallet for a year or until the
team lacks funds, to be used for a second ICO.

Distribution Calculations – Fundamentals
We understand that there are individuals who will support our project using cryptocurrencies other
than BTC. The ICO distribution calculations for those not using BTC are slightly more complex due to
price fluctuations, however we’ve implemented an attractive calculation system which will protect Early
Supporter bonuses. The ICO and ESP final distribution calculations depend on two systems: “Status and
Bonus Protection for Early Supporter” and “Average BTC Value of the Alternative Cryptocurrencies”.
STATUS AND BONUS PROTECTION FOR EARLY SUPPORTERS
We are protecting the status and bonuses for our Early Supporters by determining eligibility and bonus
tier based on the value of the transaction at the time it appears – not the average value at the end of the
ICO. This system will protect the Early Supporter status and bonus percentage if there are downward
trends in the alternative cryptocurrencies during the ESP and ICO period.
For example, when sending 4 BTC worth of LISK during the Early Supporter period, the value of the
transaction at the time when it appears guarantees that you are an Early Supporter and will still receive
your bonus, even if the average BTC value of the LISK you sent is worth less than 4 BTC at the end of
the ICO.
In the case of higher tier Early Supporters (10 BTC or more), your bonus tier will not drop into a lower
bonus tier, it will be protected and stay the same.
AVERAGE BTC VALUE OF THE ALTERNATIVE CRYPTOCURRENCIES
As of August 15th, 2017 – the start of the Early Supporters Program - the BTC value of all supported
alternative cryptocurrencies will be saved each day until the end of the ICO period. We will determine
the average BTC value of alternative currencies over the whole period between August 15th and the end
of ICO. This average BTC value will be used in determining bonuses and final OXY distribution. There
are many detailed examples in the following pages of this white paper.

Distribution Calculations – Equations
EQUATIONS & TERMINOLOGY
BTC value sent by an account - This is the amount of BTC “value” sent by an account during the ESP
and/or ICO period. This figure considers both the actual amount of BTC sent and the average BTC
value of alternative cryptocurrencies sent. It is calculated with the following equation:
[Actual BTC sent] + [Average BTC value of alternative crypto currencies sent]
Total BTC value received - This is the total amount of BTC “value” received by the OXYCOIN® team
during the ESP and/or ICO period. This figure considers both the actual amount of BTC received and
the average BTC value of alternative cryptocurrencies received. Note, it does not factor in bonuses. It is
calculated with the following equation:
Sum for all accounts [BTC value sent by an account]
Weighted BTC value sent by an account - This is the total weighted BTC value sent by an account
which factors in the bonuses. It is calculated with the following equation:
[BTC value sent by an account + Bonus]
Where Bonus = [Bonus Percentage * BTC Value sent by an account]
Total weighted BTC value received - This is the total weighted BTC value received by the OXYCOIN®
team which factors in the bonuses. It is calculated with the following equation:
Sum for all accounts [Weighted BTC value sent by an account]
Percentage of ICO distribution - This is the percentage that an account will receive from the 75,000,000
OXY that will be distributed at the end of the ICO. It is calculated as follows:
[Weighted BTC value sent by account / Total weighted BTC value received]
OXY final distribution – This is the amount of OXY the account will receive at the end of the ICO
period. It is calculated with the following equation:
[Percentage of ICO distribution * 75,000,000 OXY]

On August 25th John sent 4 BTC
John qualifies as an Early Supporter so will also receive the 25% bonus OXY.
John’s “weighted BTC value” to factor in his 25% bonus is going to be calculated as 4 BTC + 1
BTC.
His total weighted BTC value is 5 BTC.
For OXYCOIN®, Total BTC value received = 750 BTC + 250 BTC = 1000 BTC.
If the Total weighted BTC received by OXYCOIN® was 1300 (Please note that this figure can only
really be determined at the end of the ICO when all the bonus calculations are done).
John’s Percentage of ICO distribution is:
[5 BTC / 1300 BTC] = 0.003846154
John’s final distribution is:
0.003846154 * 75,000,000 OXY = 288,461 OXY

NOTES

•

Without Early Supporter Bonus, John’s final distribution would have been 230,946 OXY.
[ 4 BTC / 1299 BTC ] * 75,000,000 = 230,964 OXY.
If John was an Early Supporter with Early Bird Bonus of +10%, John’s final distribution would have
been 311,442 OXY.
[ 5.4 BTC / 1300.4 BTC ] * 75,000,000 = 311,442 OXY

* In these calculations, the weighted BTC value received by OXYCOIN® must change due to the changes in
John’s bonus.

Distribution Calculations – Example #2 – “Win
When Markets Lose”
This example will illustrate the added value of our Early Supporter Status and Bonus Protection system
when average BTC values of alternative cryptocurrencies decrease during the ICO period.
SCENARIO:
OXYCOIN® received 750 BTC and the calculated average BTC value of alternative currencies received
is 250 BTC at the end of the ICO. In this scenario, the average BTC value of Ark and LISK are half
value at the end of the ICO.

On August 25th John sent 2 BTC + 1 BTC worth of LISK + 1 BTC worth of ARK.
On August 25th, the BTC value sent by John was 4 BTC.
John qualifies as an Early Supporter will also receive 25% bonus OXY.
If at the end of the ICO the average BTC value for ARK and LISK are half compared to the day he
sent it, thus the BTC value sent from John’s account will now be 3 BTC as per:
John sent 2 BTC + the average BTC value of his ARK is now 0.5 BTC + for LISK 0.5 BTC,
totaling 3 BTC. John does not lose his Early Supporter Status or Bonus.
John’s “weighted BTC value” to factor in his 25% bonus is 3 BTC + 0.75 BTC.
His total weighted BTC value is 3.75 BTC.
For OXYCOIN®, Total BTC value received = 750 BTC + 250 BTC = 1000 BTC.
If the Total weighted BTC received by OXYCOIN® was 1300 (Please note that this figure can only
really be determined at the end of the ICO when all the bonus calculations can be done)
John’s Percentage of ICO distribution is:
[3.75 BTC / 1300 BTC] = 0.002884615
John’s final distribution is:
0.002884615 * 75,000,000 OXY = 216,346 OXY

NOTES:

•

Without Early Supporter Status and Bonus Protection, John’s final distribution would have been
173,176 OXY. John has saved himself from losing 43,170 OXY by taking advantage of the Early
Supporter Status and Bonus Protection. [3BTC /1299.25 BTC] *75,000,000 =173,176 OXY
If John was an Early Supporter with Early Bird Bonus of +10%, John’s final distribution would have
been 233,600 OXY. [4.05 BTC / 1300.3 BTC] * 75,000,000 = 233,600 OXY

* In these calculations, the weighted BTC value received by OXYCOIN® must change due to the changes in
John’s bonus.

Distribution Calculations – Example #3 “Win
When Markets Win”
This example will illustrate the added value of the Early Supporters Program when average BTC values
of alternative cryptocurrencies increase during the ICO.
SCENARIO:
OXYCOIN® received 750 BTC and the calculated average BTC value of alternative currencies received
is 250 BTC at the end of the ICO. In this scenario, the average BTC value of Ark and LISK are double
the value at the end of the ICO.
• On August 25th John sent 2 BTC + 1 BTC worth of LISK + 1 BTC worth of ARK.
• On August 25th, the BTC value sent by John was 4 BTC.
• John qualifies as an Early Supporter and will also receive 25% bonus OXY.
• If at the end of the ICO the average BTC value for ARK and LISK have doubled from the day he
sent it, the BTC value sent from John’s account will now be 6 BTC as per:
• John sent 2 BTC + the average BTC value of his ARK is now 2 BTC and for LISK 2 BTC, totaling
6 BTC.
• John’s “weighted BTC value sent” to factor in his 25% bonus is going to be calculated as 6 BTC +
1.5 BTC.
• His total weighted BTC value is 7.5 BTC.
• For OXYCOIN®, Total BTC value received is 750 BTC + 250 BTC = 1000 BTC.
• If the Total weighted BTC value received by OXYCOIN® was 1300 BTC (Please note that this
figure can only really be determined at the end of the ICO when all the bonus calculations can be
done. Here we are using a sensible number to show how the calculation would work).
• John’s Percentage of ICO distribution is:
[7.5 BTC / 1300 BTC] = 0.00576923077
• John’s final distribution is:
0.0057692307 * 75,000,000 OXY = 432,692 OXY
NOTES:

•

Without the Early Supporters Program Bonus, John’s final distribution would have been 346,533
OXY. John now has an extra 86,539 OXY by taking advantage of the Early Supporters Program.
[ 6 BTC / 1298.5 BTC ] * 75,000,000 = 346, 533 OXY
If John was an Early Supporters with Early Bird Bonus of +10%, John’s final distribution would
have been roughly 467,092 OXY.
[ 8.1 BTC / 1300.6 BTC ] * 75,000,000 = 467,092 OXY

* In these calculations, the weighted BTC value received by OXYCOIN® must change due to the changes in
John’s bonus.
