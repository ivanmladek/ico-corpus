The Genesis Concept – LydiaCoin Project

Crypto Currency offers a developer a unique insight into the
nature of money. The LydiaCoin Project began as just such an
exploration. Lydia is an ancient nation (located roughly where
modern Turkey is today) where it is believed the first ever coins
were minted from precious metals as we know coinage in the
west. This innovation took place in approximately 650 BCE. I
began tinkering with a fork of ZetaCoin primarily to gain an
understanding of the nature of monetary systems, and the
wonderful ways in which this can be expressed in an alternative
crypto coin. What I discovered is not what I expected.
When you look at a picture of that very first coin, what leaps to
mind is this big solid looking hunk of pure gold. We in the modern
age are wowed by the incredible sense of intrinsic value this coin
would possess today. Such images reinforce our commonly held
mis-perception that money is not "real" if it doesn't have some
serious intrinsic value incorporated into it. But let's examine this
idea more closely. Did the ancient Lydians choose gold because
of it's great rarity? I think not. First of all the earths population
was dramatically less than it is today. Secondly, there were no
where near the amount of industrial uses for gold as there is
today. And lastly, gold could still be found on the very surface of
the ground in many locations worldwide. Simply put, gold just
wasn't nearly as rare as it is today in ancient times.
So why did the Lydians choose gold (and silver)? Durability.
Gold does not tarnish. It is malleable yet holds it's shape and
form. It is simply a durable and easy to use container.

A container of value. Social value, economic value - even political
value. That is a coin's job, to be a long lasting and deployable
medium of exchanging value. Crypto Currency appears to be
eminently suitable to the task of acting as such a container of
value, being both durable and easy to use. Additional if marginal
intrinsic value is added by the energy and labor costs associated
with mining Crypto Currency into existence. We thus begin to see
the fallacy of commodity based monetary systems such as gold
or silver backed currency. Such extreme intrinsic value is not only
unnecessary, but prevents the currency from gaining economic
and social value aside from the backing commodity. And while it
is useful to have a Crypto Currency with rarity settings that mimic
a naturally occurring commodity, it is important to understand that
fielding a global and general purpose Alt Coin requires one to
place serious anti-deflational measures into the coin's source
code.
When we examine an Alt Coin such as InfiniteCoin as an
example, we see an Alt Coin at which seemingly every possible
means of inflation has been built into the algorithm. While the
deflational tendency of all Crypto Currency is difficult if not
impossible to overcome, it would seem that in InfiniteCoin the
deflational curve has finally met it's match. And yet InfiniteCoin
holds marginal value, is traded on the exchanges – and is even
accepted as payment in a few places. A coin that by rights should
simply explode from inflation based on it's settings, is instead
holding it's own on the global market.
And so we begin to see a model, a way forward – when
fielding general purpose global Alt Coins. Liberal use of the
counter-deflational and rarity settings would appear to be the best
approach for a slow and stable growth in economic and social
value. There are many kinds of Alt Coins, so called “cause coins”,
even collectible crypto. And some of these coins might actually
require encouraging the natural deflational tendency of all Crypto
Currency. But for general purpose global Alt Coins, the exact
opposite is true – and the Coin Maker should make every effort to
thwart deflation using the settings in the code base.

Innovation Of A Permanent Inflation – The ZetaCoin Project

The first consideration in designing a Crypto Currency is the
choice of scrypt or proof-of-work. For MazaCoin, proof-of-work
was chosen for the environmental considerations. A proof-of-work
coin can be merge mined with other similar blockchains, such as
BitCoin – thus mining multiple Crypto Currency for the same
hardware and energy footprint. Also, it is easy to obtain
inexpensive outdated ASIC hardware now that the difficulty level
of BitCoin is so high – making the creation of the back-end
network for MazaCoin much more affordable.
One obvious choice for a particular Alt Coin to fork for the
purpose of a global Crypto Currency would have been the
incredible PeerCoin. Certainly the infinite coin base and other
anti-deflational features of PeerCoin would be in line with the
theory of stable value retention elucidated above. But with
MazaCoin we have a dual purpose that must be carefully
balanced. We desire MazaCoin to be traded and adopted globally,
and yet it is also targeted to be a true and working Sovereign
National Currency. MazaCoin is the first ever Crypto Currency in
history to attempt to fill both these roles. Thus a more fine grained
control over long-term inflational measures is necessary to strike
the proper balance. And so ZetaCoin was chosen as the fork.

ZetaCoin is a fork of BitCoin designed by Master Coin Maker
Giskard. It contains numerous improvements in the BitCoin
source code, but the biggest innovation of ZetaCoin is the
permanent adjustable inflationary mining reward that begins when
the coin base is achieved. This adjustable feature allows for a
more controlled approach to a permanent inflation and of course
provides a solid reward for post Exodus Block miners to ensure
blockchain security.
As we begin to reconcile the desire to have a global Crypto
Currency against the need to tailor MazaCoin to a relatively small
national economy, we can appreciate the ability to more finely
tune the long-term inflationary aspects of the coin that forking
from ZetaCoin has provided. And as we approach this task it does
become apparent that we must in fact tailor the over-all size of
MazaCoin to the economy of the Oglala Lakota Nation. For to do
otherwise would risk creating a coin base so big and a blockchain
so overwhelming as to simply swamp this small tribal economy,
rather than stimulate it to growth as is desired.
Being a proof-of-work coin that can be mined with ASICs and
merge mined with other like chains such as BitCoin and ZetaCoin
allow MazaCoin to be one of the most environmentally friendly
Crypto Currencies in the world. Using the same hardware and
energy foot print to merge mine multiple blockchains, and opening
the second hand ASIC market to small investors is one of many
often overlooked benefits of proof-of-work Alt Coins. And finally,
ZetaCoin has made other innovations upon the BitCoin source
code which make for a smoother and more secure monetary
system.
The choice of which coin to fork is the first decision that a
Master Coin Maker takes. It is the foundation upon which one
builds the economic vision that is the basis for your new coin.
ZetaCoin is quite simply very fine money, and will make an
excellent global currency. And it is a perfect fit for the overall
ideas I wanted to express and goals I desired to achieve with
MazaCoin. I sincerely hope the ZetaCoin community feels the
same, and will join with us in this historic experiment.

MazaCoin – First National Sovereign Crypto Coin

The proposition of attempting to create a new global Crypto
Currency is audacious to say the least. But when one is also
attempting to create a Sovereign National coinage the
challenges are truly daunting. I am neither an economist, nor a
mathematician – I am a simple hacker. But coin making is as
much a hand crafted art as it is a science. There is more to a
National Sovereign currency than merely a monetary system. As
we shall explore below, both the science and art of coin making
are put to the ultimate test when your coin must represent the
history and heritage of a living people.
Finding myself in un-charted waters when it comes to coin
making, I began by first gathering publicly available data on the
economy of the Oglala Lakota Nation. Then using various Alt
Coins that I felt fairly represented the trajectory we can expect
from MazaCoin, combined with the added effect on the tribal
economy of the BTC Oyate Project founded by Payu Harris – I
attempted to forecast the Oglala Lakota national economy for the
next decade.
To be sure, all such forecasts whether done by experts or
amateur coin makers are mere guess work at best, and
witchcraft at worst. But it did give me a broad picture of how the
initial parameters of MazaCoin should be set to best facilitate it's
dual role as a globally traded currency and a National Sovereign
coinage. The more data we added, the more accurate the model.

One of the more controversial features of the MazaCoin
formula is the initial one-time two-phase pre-mine of 50 million
MZC. Those who object to this re-distribution of wealth simply do
not comprehend the economic devastation that has been inflicted
on these people by 150 years of economic warfare against them
by the USA. It is impossible to model this tribal economy and
escape the essentially crushing poverty that persists. And it
simply makes good sense, as well as smart Alt Coin
management – to make certain that the Oglala Lakota are firmly
vested in their own National Currency. It doesn't just help the
Lakota, it helps make MazaCoin stronger. The MazaCoin premine is a single unique event during the pre-launch and will never
be repeated. It represents a tiny fraction of the overall coin base
of MazaCoin – and once it is complete and MazaCoin is released
to the public it will be produced and traded globally just as any
other Alt Coin.
Ultimately as a coin maker I discovered that the biggest tool at
my disposal for connecting MazaCoin to the Land through it's
people was the artwork. Indeed, almost as many hours were
spent pouring over graphics for MazaCoin as was spent coding it.
I felt great pressure to not only try and make that almost spiritual
connection of the coin to the people, but also to make it look as
stately and dignified as the Oglala Lakota so richly deserve. This
is not some collectible meme coin, this is the National Currency
of a great and courageous people who have suffered much to
preserve their ancient culture. This will continue to be a focus
going forward as we roll out things like paper wallets, etc.
In the end I faced an unprecedented and historic challenge as
a Master Coin Maker in creating MazaCoin. I firmly believe we
have succeeded in giving the Oglala Lakota Nation the finest
national coinage in history. I would like to thank those on the
Development Team, and others around the world – for your
fantastic support as we completed and released MazaCoin. Let
MazaCoin stand as a beacon of hope to other tribal and micronations that there are solutions. Crypto Currency is a revolution,
perhaps the greatest revolution in history.

My thanks to dear friends who supported me in bad
times while I finished MazaCoin. Thanks also to Payu
Harris of the BTC Oyate Project, who is essentially a cocreator of MazaCoin and my rock. Finally, my deepest
gratitude to the MazaCoin community of supporters, and
to the Oglala Lakota for trusting me to make MazaCoin
for them.
I hereby dedicate the creation of MazaCoin to the Lakota
people themselves, for their courage and dignity in the
face of genocide and war. You have persevered. Your
future has arrived. Thank you for letting me make history
with your brave people.
