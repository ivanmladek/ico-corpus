Unfortunately, these early attempts to put forward viable alternatives to world fiat currencies did not get off the ground. Governments were vehemently opposed to seeing
them succeed and deemed them as a threat to the status quo monetary systems. It was,
therefore, difficult for the early contributors in the field to push their ideas to a wider audience. Nevertheless, there was still eagerness to pursue further research.
In October 2008, an individual or group of people known by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto
published the Bitcoin whitepaper[2]. It is described as an innovative breakthrough, especially by those who initially read it, for the initiation and implementation of a new type
of money called cryptocurrency. Bitcoin learnt from previous failed systems by creating
a decentralised network-based transparent ledger. It provides several desirable features
including:

A peer-to-peer decentralised network protocol

INTRODUCTION

Incentives for users to keep the network robust
A finite hard cap on supply to prevent inflation

Since the inception of Bitcoin, thousands of cryptocurrencies have been launched. Most
ventures into the cryptocurrency sphere have not gone according to plan as their founders would have hoped. Nevertheless, there are currently hundreds of crypto related
projects which are succeeding. SnowGem is a new type of cryptocurrency which has objectives to improve upon proven technologies developed so far. There will be similarities
between SnowGem and other coins, but the team wish to follow their own philosophy.

After this innovative breakthrough, people have been developing technologies that apply
practical use to cryptocurrencies. For example, some cryptocurrencies have focused on
providing users with reliable, compatible and user friendly wallet client systems for robust forms of payment.

INTRODUCTION

SnowGem is a new type of cryptocurrency that can be developed on verified technology.
It is a project that embraces a unique philosophical approach on how cryptocurrency can
be used in real life. SnowGem aims to build a better cryptocurrency by incorporating previously proven aspects of blockchain technology including network robustness, feature
rich services and end-user friendly support.

world without the need to trust a central
authority such as a bank or other clearing
house. SnowGem users are able to send
or receive XSG quickly, reliably and securely using a personal computer, laptop or
mobile device.
snowgem whitepaper

Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel from scratch, the founder of SnowGem Tinh Pham
(TXID), after studying the codebase of other cryptocurrencies, decided to base SnowGem
on Zcash. Zcash is the first cryptocurrency to apply zkSNARKs (Zero Knowledge Succinct
Non-Interative Argument of Knowledge) which allow parties to prove a statement without
revealing any information other than the validity of the statement. SnowGem began as a
fork of the Zcash blockchain(5) and inherited all features of Zcash at that time (23rd December 2017).

WHAT IS SNOWGEM?

SnowGem officially launched its blockchain on the 25th December 2017 after 72 blocks had
been timestamped. During the first 72 blocks, no external miners could mine (less than
7 XSG was mined during this period). It was considered necessary to make sure the blockchain launched seamlessly.
On the 15th April 2018, masternode payments were activated. This meant that SnowGem
became the first Equihash algorithm oriented cryptocurrency with zkSNARKs(6) to implement active masternode technology.
Like all cryptocurrencies, people have chosen to adopt SnowGem as a medium of exchange/
store of value through personal choice. An innovative feature, affinity towards the brand or
high confidence in the community could be reasons for doing so. Key advantages of using
SnowGem are:

SnowGem is permissionless, so anyone is free to use its services.
It is accessible from anywhere in the world.
It has no central point of failure.
It is free from government censorship.
SnowGem users receive regular block rewards for participation in
helping to secure and decentralise the network protocol.

HISTORY

HISTORY

snowgem whitepaper

11

Since the inception of SnowGem back in
December 2017, the project has grown from
strength to strength.

By laying the brickworks of our foundation the
SnowGem team and the community have worked
non-stop in a diligent manner to ensure the rapid
success of SnowGem.

HISTORY

Both the SnowGem team and community
have contributed to the ongoing success
of the project.

snowgem whitepaper

12

Key events which have occurred during SnowGem’s relatively short history include:

On the 22nd December 2017, the SnowGem blockchain was announced
to the wider cryptocurrency community via an online forum called
Bitcointalk.
On the 25th December 2017, the SnowGem blockchain officially launched at 00:32:41 UTC at block number 73.
On the 12th January 2018, the first cryptocurrency exchange to initiate
live real-time XSG trading was Stocks.exchange (now known as STEX).
On the 13th February 2018, the initial testing phase of masternode
technology was announced by Tinh Pham. Beta specifications were
made available.

HISTORY

On the 5th March 2018, an updated simple wallet client (version 2.0.0)
was released for users to install. It became possible for users to create SnowGem masternodes.
On the 15th April 2018, the first masternode payments were received
by operators at block number 159,428.
On the 4th May 2018, the first SnowGem mobile application was released on the Android operating system. It became possible for users to
store XSG on their phones.
snowgem whitepaper

13

On the 20th May 2018, the SnowMine mining application tool was released.
On the 28th June 2018, the SnowGem blockchain successfully hard forked to an improved variant of the Equihash hashing algorithm (from
<200,9> to <144,5>).
On the 6th September 2018, the SnowGem Modern wallet was released.
It is a client which includes way more features than the simple wallet
client. Presented with a more professional and seamless GUI, users
can manage and monitor their SnowGem portfolio as well as other
coins which are being added.

HISTORY

Members of the SnowGem team are dedicated to build upon the progress made in
the last year or so. There is enthusiasm that, with the help from the community,
SnowGem will become a highly adopted and used method of payment.

*The founder coded block generation to incrementally increase by 0.0025 XSG each block beginning with a 0.0025 XSG
block reward at block number one. It attained the 20 XSG block reward at approximately block number 8,000. This gave
users ample time to join the network and prevented high hashrate miners from accumulating a large number of XSG early
on.
**A Founders’ Reward was decided upon as the best method by which to raise the necessary funds for code development, marketing and other operational activities. While acknowledging that an ICO (initial coin offering) is a great way for
blockchain projects to raise initial funds, it was considered as a risky approach. SnowGem know the importance that, for a
project to succeed in the competitive crypto sphere, funds are required to attract talent and pay for services. In the future,

transactions recorded in blocks ever executed since the very first block. Additionally, it continuously updates in real-time
when a new block is successfully mined.

snowgem whitepaper

19

Blocks enter the blockchain in such a manner that each block contains the hash
of the previous one. It is therefore utterly resistant to modification along the
chain since each block is related to the prior one. Consequently, the problem of
double-spending is solved.
The first block of the SnowGem blockchain timestamped at 13:08:01 UTC on the
23rd December 2017. It was not until block number 73, the time at which the blockchain officially launched, that external miners were permitted to mine blocks.
Since this time, there has been one notable update to the underlying codebase
which required a hard fork for protocol parameters to change. On the 22nd June
2018, an important update (version 2.0.3) was released for users to install before block number 266,000. Primarily, it changed the parameter setting of the
Equihash hashing algorithm from <200,9> to <144,5>, after which the SnowGem
blockchain became low-memory GPU and ASIC resistant.

BLOCKCHAIN

For members of the general public to view the blockchain, web developers create
block explorers. They are online websites which present certain aspects of the
blockchain including wallet addresses and transaction identifications. SnowGem
officially recognises https://insight.snowgem.org as its most reliable block explorer.

BLOCKCHAIN

As time goes by, the number of XSG mined per block will decrease. This means there
is a hard cap on the number of XSG to be mined, which is 84,096,00 XSG. What follows
is the SnowGem block distribution table which covers a timeframe for the next 23
years.

One of the major breakthroughs which

such as the US Dollar issued by a central
bank, are highly susceptible to inflation,
manipulation and theft.

snowgem whitepaper

23

EQUIHASH HASHING ALGORITHM

For cryptocurrencies, no central authority or third party is required to verify the
validity of transactions on the blockchain. Instead, miners are collectively responsible for validating each and every transaction in a proof of work timestamping
process. This competitive task secures and decentralises the network protocol.
SnowGem adopted the Equihash hashing algorithm and implemented its code on
the 23rd December 2017. Miners compete to find hashes, then are subsequently
rewarded a certain number of XSG as an incentive. These coins are issued by the
software in a transparent and predictable way outside the control of its developers. The Equihash hashing algorithm is defined as(7):
It is a memory-hard Proof-of-Work introduced by the University of Luxembourg's
Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) at the 2016 Network
and Distributed System Security Symposium. The algorithm is based on a generalization of the Birthday problem which finds colliding hash values. It has severe
time-space trade-offs but concedes vulnerability to unforeseen parallel optimizations. It was designed such that parallel implementations are bottle-necked by
memory bandwidth in an attempt to worsen the cost-performance trade-offs of
designing custom ASIC implementations. ASIC resistance in Equihash is based on
the assumption that commercially-sold hardware already has quite high memory
bandwidth, so improvements made by custom hardware may not be worth the
development cost.
Therefore, SnowGem is a currency which has no central authority to issue its
coins. Its users are not required to trust anyone to perform transactions, but rely
entirely on the distributed network consensus of the blockchain.

authorities collect, and even distribute,
spending habits to find out what people
engage in.

snowgem whitepaper

26

Bitcoin offers a certain level for anonymity for its users, but falls short. By design,
every transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is recorded in a public ledger, thus, at
any point in time, the full transaction history is accessible. It is possible to use various methods, such as network analysis[3] or web purchases tracking[4], to track
who spends what and where. This is obviously not ideal for users who like to
preserve their privacy.
SnowGem utilises a technologically proven protocol called zkSNARKs (Zero
Knowledge Succinct Non-Interative Argument of Knowledge) which allow parties
to prove a statement without revealing any information other than the validity of
the statement. Zcash is the first cryptocurrency to apply zkSNARKs.

ENHANCED PRIVACY

Similar to Zcash, SnowGem provides two types of address:
t-address
used to perform transparent transactions, which are publicly recorded
on the blockchain
z-address
used to perform shielded transactions, which hide the identity of both
the sender and the receiver. The amount of XSG transacted is also hidden
Therefore, SnowGem offers its users a choice whether they transact transparently or privately. There are some situations where parties prefer to stay transparent.

specialised nodes (computers) that host a
full copy of the blockchain. Like all other
nodes, they help to verify the validity of
transactions sent from one peer to another.

snowgem whitepaper

29

SnowGem fully implemented masternodes on the 15th April 2018. Anyone is free to
create a masternode, but must raise the necessary collateral in order to operate one.
This associated cost (entry barrier) to become a masternode operator is necessary
because it disincentivises one to cheat the system. SnowGem masternode operators
must hold a total of 10,000 XSG (cannot be spent and is described as not being part
of the overall coin circulation) in a designated wallet address in order to keep the node
running.

MASTERNODES

As an incentive for masternode operators to keep their nodes running, they collectively receive a percentage of overall block rewards. What follows is a table which shows
how many XSG have been, and are, rewarded to masternode holders as a whole:

SnowGem considered the ramp up in masternode reward percentages as allowing
users the time to accumulate XSG more easily at the beginning via mining. It is therefore the case that masternode operators earn a passive income on the investment
they have locked up. What they receive in terms of the number of rewarded XSG
depends on the total number of active masternodes at any given time (see table
immediately above).

SNOWGEM MODERN WALLET
Designed to be more professional, comfortable and simple, the SnowGem Modern Wallet was released on the 6th September 2018. It brings together the
most important aspects of the SnowGem ecosystem into one place. Transferring XSG units of account is an easier process. Unlike the SnowGem simple
wallet, it allows users to monitor and manage their masternodes. SnowMine is
also accessible from this wallet.

KEY FEATURES

We had ease in mind when creating our wallets,
mining tools and Masternode Map. All have been
designed with user friendly features.
SNOWMINE APPLICATION TOOL
SnowMine is the ultimate mining application based on SnowGem. It makes the
process of configuring one’s mining equipment easier. If mining issues arise, the
application promptly sends a notification (either via e-mail or pop-up) to make
the miner aware. Users are able to receive statistics and control their mining
equipment via a mobile device, Discord or Telegram. No account is required.

snowgem whitepaper

33

SNOWGEM WEB WALLET
Built especially for novice users, the SnowGem Web Wallet does not require users
to download, and then install, any software. It is a secure, reliable and robust online medium to send, receive and store XSG units of account.
SNOWGEM ANDROID WALLET
Released on the 4th May 2018, the SnowGem Android wallet is a secure, open-source and easy method by which to send or receive XSG units of account via a
mobile device. All private keys remain in the control of the user at all times. Like
other wallets, multiple wallet addresses can be created and customised.
LIVE MASTERNODE MAP

HOW TO ACQUIRE SNOWGEM

Instead of acquiring XSG units of account via mining or exchanges, there are other
ways to become a SnowGem holder or investor. These include:
By being a SnowGem masternode operator. It is then possible to receive a percent-age rate of interest on the 10,000 XSG locked as collateral.
Receiving coins for contributing to the project. This can be done by
either participating in code development, marketing, graphics designing and so forth.
Receiving coins from someone as a donation or gift.
Taking part in a face-to-face transaction where XSG units of account
are bought/sold with both parties agreeing the terms.

nowledges that there is still a lot of work
to do before that time.

snowgem whitepaper

43

Looking forward, SnowGem will investigate and develop ways to improve upon
their blockchain. What follows are the most exciting things being worked on:
Overwinter and Sapling Upgrades
SnowGem are working hard to implement two network protocol parameter
changes. In particular, the Sapling upgrade will integrate improvements to the
efficiency at which shielded transactions are processed and lower CPU memory
to optimise performance on mobile devices. Both upgrades will be integrated
into SnowGem via a single hard fork of the blockchain.

FUTURE VISION

Masternode Reference
Masternode operators will be able to invite friendly masternode servers. By
being a reference, the masternode operator will receive an extra 2.5% XSG bonus reward when the friendly invited masternode has received their masternode
payment. If no reference is applied, the block reward is sent to proof of work
miners instead.
Lottery Systems
SnowGem users will be able to participate in regular lotteries via the SnowGem
Modern Wallet.
Payment Solutions
An objective to make it easier for everyday users to purchase goods and services. SnowGem wants to create a fast, unique and secure payment processing
system, directly on top of their blockchain. It will be built into any software
which supports API calls including ecommerce, e-shops and Point of Sale (PoS)
systems.

snowgem whitepaper

44

Decentralised Exchange
It is well known in the cryptocurrency space how frustrating online centralised exchanges can be. Users regularly complain about lost, manipulated and stolen coins.
SnowGem wishes to create their very own decentralised exchange (DEX) that will help
improve the trading experience without downtime and maintenance periods.
Content Masternodes
SnowGem plans to improve the code to make it possible for all types of data to be
stored on their blockchain. Documents, media files and contracts will be publicly or privately stored. They will also be necessary for running the SnowGem DEX and provide
file storage for data required for decentralised applications (dApps) (based on IPFS
protocol).

FUTURE VISION

Blockchain Technology Company
In order to take great strides forward, legally and compliantly, SnowGem wants to
establish an official foundation. It will help SnowGem become more professional and
attract much needed investment.
Ultimately, the goal is for SnowGem to be used instead of fiat currencies. At the moment, the main purpose of SnowGem is a store of value for performing transparent or
private transactions. After further development, there is confidence that SnowGem can
gradually expand its reach to become a trusted, reliable and secure worldwide payment
solution .
