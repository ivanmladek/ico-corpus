A Brief Overview of SALUS Interoperability Approach

Scalable, Standard based Interoperability Framework for
Sustainable Proactive Post Market Safety Studies

Executive Summary
Pre-approval clinical trials cannot guarantee that drugs will not have serious side
effects after they are marketed. Post-approval drug safety data studies aim to address
this problem, however, their effectiveness is started to be discussed especially after
recent examples of drug withdrawals. This is due to the fact that, current post market
safety studies largely depend on the submission of spontaneous case reports where
underreporting is a major problem. The need for a more proactive approach is
apparent, where safety data from multiple sources are actively monitored, linked and
analyzed. Effective integration and utilization of electronic health records (EHR) can
help to improve post-market safety activities on a proactive basis. SALUS aims to
facilitate this through providing functional interoperability profiles and supporting
open source toolsets enabling EHR systems and clinical research systems to
communicate and exchange EHR data; implementing semantic interoperability
solutions enabling meaningful interpretation of the exchanged EHR data;
implementing security and privacy mechanisms and open source toolsets ensuring
that clinical information is shared in an ethical and safe way and providing a novel
exploratory analysis framework for open-ended temporal pattern discovery for safety
studies on top of disparate, distributed, heterogeneous EHR Systems.

Introduction

SALUS aims to create the
necessary semantic
interoperability
infrastructure to enable
secondary use of EHR
data in an efficient and
effective way for enabling
pro-active post market
safety studies

Addressing the need for
more effective post
market surveillance
methods

The process of approving pharmaceutical agents for use in humans usually
hinges on establishing the efficacy of the agent. This is usually achieved
through appropriately designed and rigorously analyzed randomized clinical
trials. Whilst certain safety aspects are established though the evaluation of
the development program ranging from animal studies to dedicated large
trials, for most approved agents however, there are limited data for ensuring
the safety of the product at approval. These include, for example, the risk of
rare events which are not identified in the clinical trials due to their limited
size, or delayed effects of the drug due to the limited duration of the trials.
Furthermore, clinical trials usually have exclusion criteria, e.g. the elderly
or pregnant women and therefore there are little or no data on certain groups
available prior to approval, but who may ultimately use the agent.
Moreover, the pattern of drug use in clinical trials may not necessarily
reflect the real-world use once the drug reaches the population and therefore
may impact safety.
For these reasons, while pre-market safety analysis through clinical trials
remains vital, there is considerable attention towards improving the
reporting and collection of post-market data. Current post-market safety
surveillance and reporting activities are largely based on reports of
suspected adverse drug reactions sent to the regulatory bodies by medical
professionals, and in some countries by patients themselves. While
spontaneous reporting remains a cornerstone of pharmacovigilance in the
regulator environment and indispensable for signal detection, recent
examples of drug withdrawals1 due to uncommon adverse events after
millions of patients were exposed, the need for a more effective and
proactive surveillance is reinforced. One of the main problems of the
current drug surveillance system is underreporting: It has been estimated
that only around 5% of adverse drug events (ADEs) are reported through
spontaneous reporting2. This is partially due to fact that overloaded medical
personnel do not always see reporting as a priority. Another issue is that
detecting adverse events may not always be straightforward, hence can be
overlooked. Also, as it is not possible to estimate the number of patients
taking a drug from spontaneous reports, they do not readily enable the
quantification of any risk. Therefore the benefit-risk profile of the product
cannot be determined.
It is evident that whilst more proactive post market surveillance methods are
needed, they should not create additional burden for the health care provider
or the patient.

A Brief Overview of SALUS Interoperability Approach

The SALUS Consortium believes that an effective integration and utilization of electronic health record
(EHR) data can help to improve post-market safety activities and will result in:


Strengthening the spontaneous reporting process by automated ADE detection and
reporting tools screening EHRs in a hospital so that ADE reporting burden can be
overcome within a clinical institute. This can increase data accuracy as it eliminates
manual screening of clinical care data for identifying ADEs.



Enabling ADE reporting by extracting the available information from the EHRs into the
individual case safety reports to avoid double data entry. This facilitates delivering timely
feedback to the regulatory bodies via automatic EHR supported adverse event reporting.



Strengthening the current signal detection processes in pharmacovigilance centers for
tracing case reports to their corresponding patient records to allow actual incidence rates
to be computed, and to provide additional information on extended parts of the
underlying medical history of the patient.



Enabling real time screening of multiple, distributed, heterogeneous EHRs for early
detection of ADE signals. This facilitates proactive safety monitoring as a
complementary approach to reactive signal detection based on spontaneous reports.



Enabling sustainable and scalable EHR data re-use facilitating wide scale outcome and
health effectiveness research, to be able to observe selected cohorts of patients over an
extended period of time screening multiple, distributed, heterogeneous EHR systems

Another important advantage of EHR data is that they offer the potential for quantification and
contextualization of any risk though safety studies and therefore help determine the benefit-risk profile of
the drug, which ultimately determines the use of the drug in a population. To facilitate these wide scale
proactive post market safety studies, there is a need for a new capacity enabling access to the data locked in
multiple different heterogonous EHR systems: an interoperability architecture. This interoperability
architecture should enable execution of proactive post market surveillance studies by the pharmaceutical
companies and regulatory bodies in cooperation with the heterogeneous, distributed EHR systems.
SALUS Project3, an R&D project co-financed by the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme
(FP7), aims to create the necessary semantic and functional interoperability infrastructure to enable
secondary use of EHR data in an efficient and effective way for reinforcing the post market safety studies,
addressing the challenges that are presented above.

A Brief Overview of SALUS Interoperability Approach

SALUS Interoperability Architecture
One of the first challenges to address is achieving syntactic and functional interoperability between EHR
systems and clinical research systems. In SALUS, our approach is to provide functional interoperability
profiles and open source tools to query EHR data for ADE identification, ADE reporting and signal followup studies and to sub-scribe to clinical data for a selected cohort of patients for signal detection and outcome research over distributed EHRs. These interoperability profiles aim to enable the EHR systems and
clinical research systems used for running post market safety studies to communicate and exchange data.
In order to enable the collaborating systems to interpret the queries and the resulting clinical data
exchanged meaningfully and accurately for producing useful results, there is a need for a semantic
interoperability layer built upon these functional interoperability profiles.
One of the first pre-requisites for such a semantic interoperability architecture is to have a common core
data set of interest to data analysis tools used for post marketing safety studies. The role of SALUS
semantic interoperability framework is semantically mediating the clinical data represented through
syntactically different but semantically equivalent EHR content models to one another, by making use of
the core set of common data elements as the common denominator. This is facilitated through an
ontological framework.
In the following subsections, we will further analyze the need for functional and semantic interoperability
solutions for enabling post market safety studies on top of EHRs, and present SALUS approach to realize
these.

Providing Functional Interoperability Profiles between EHR Systems and Clinical
Research Systems Enabling Proactive Post Market Safety Studies
Achieving syntactic and functional interoperability between the EHR systems and clinical research is the
necessary condition for further enabling semantic interoperability.
The requirements for syntactic and functional interoperability profiles for enabling proactive post market
safety studies can be summarized as follows:


Different rule based intelligent data analysis algorithms can be plugged on top of available EHRs
to detect ADEs by checking the administered drugs, laboratory test results, vital signs, findings
and diagnoses and report them to the medical practitioners in order to facilitate detection and
reporting of ADEs. Standard based protocols are needed to specify the data to be screened in a
machine processable manner, to feed these data to the intelligent data analysis algorithms, and to
send the suspected ADE list back to the medical practitioners seamlessly within an EHR session.
In this way it will be much easier to integrate several different ADE detection tools with
heterogeneous EHR systems in order to conduct scalable distributed post market safety studies.



Upon detection of such ADEs through these enabling mechanisms, if confirmed by the physician,
these should be reported to regulatory bodies through standard based individual case safety
reports. Most of the data that needs to be reported within these case reports are mostly available in
the EHRs. In order to avoid duplication of effort to fill in these data to the case safety reports once
again manually, there is a need for interoperability profiles to fill in these standard based forms by

extracting the required information from the underlying EHR system, and sending the completed
forms to the respective regulatory bodies.

system to seamlessly exploit
the already existing clinical
data in EHRs



Spontaneous reports only report the ADE events. The information related to the percentage of
other patients who used the drug but not experienced ADEs, i.e. the denominator data, is missing.
On top of that, these reports may fail to take into account important information about the patient
such as underlying medical conditions and co-medication. An ideal system for adverse drug
reaction surveillance would combine the strength of case reports with those of EHRs4. Standard
interfaces are needed for tracing case reports to their corresponding patient records, to query the
EHRs to enable absolute reporting rates to be computed, and to retrieve additional information on
extended parts of the underlying medical history of the patient.

A Brief Overview of SALUS Interoperability Approach


Strengthening available spontaneous reporting will already be a step forward for post marketing
safety studies. However, in order to realize near-real time proactive post market safety studies,
there needs to be a mechanism for screening the available heterogeneous and disparate EHRs for a
specified time period for adverse event signal detection and also for conducting observational
studies for validation of the suspected signals and for carrying out outcome research to see long
term effects of drugs. There is a need for a machine processable mechanism to identify the target
patient population for eligibility checking and the details of the clinical data to be collected,
together with an exchange mechanism to feed the pseudonymized patient data to a common
registry.

Syntactic and functional interoperability can be achieved if and when two or more systems are capable of
communicating and exchanging data by specifying communication protocols and data formats. For
addressing the requirements of the proactive post market safety studies summarized above, there is a need
for standardized interfaces between EHR systems and clinical research systems:


To specify the eligibility criteria to select the patients for the specific post market safety study



To specify the clinical data requested by an intelligent data analysis tool (ADE detection/signal
detection/outcome research) to be fed to a clinical data registry for the selected group of patients



To transfer the specified clinical data to the clinical data registries for the selected patients



To query the underlying EHRs to support follow-up studies for signal detection



To query the underlying EHRs to fill in the ADE reports after an ADE is detected

To define such standardized interfaces, in the SALUS project we will follow a “profiling” approach. The
profile concept aims to eliminate the need for a bilateral agreement between any two information exchange
partners by defining a standard set of messages/documents, choreographies, business rules and constraints.
By analyzing the selected use case scenarios the required transactions will be determined, and for each of
them, the best suitable standards for enabling these transactions will be chosen. SALUS functional
interoperability profiles will be based on the available initiatives for achieving syntactic interoperability for
re-use of EHRs for clinical trial execution, such as IHE Retrieve Form for Data-Capture (RFD)5, Clinical
Research Data Capture (CRD)6, Drug Safety Content Profile (DSC)7 Profiles, HL7 Clinical Research
Filtered Query Service Function Model (CRFQ SFM)8, and where suitable by proposing the necessary
extensions for enabling such a standard based interoperability architecture for post-market surveillance.

A Brief Overview of SALUS Interoperability Approach

Providing Semantic Interoperability Framework Enabling Proactive Post Market
Safety Studies
Beyond the ability of two or more computer systems to exchange information through addressing syntactic
and functional interoperability requirements, semantic interoperability is needed to automatically interpret
the information exchanged meaningfully and accurately in order to produce useful results 9.
Semantic interoperability is a prerequisite for enabling secondary use of EHR data in post market safety
studies so that clinical data is consistently captured from the EHR systems and analyzed by intelligent data
analysis algorithms.
The need for semantic interoperability between clinical research and clinical care systems may stem from
the following facts:


Clinical statements may be represented through different reference and
domain information models, like HL7 RIM and CDA, CEN/ISO 13606 5
part (E.g. Reference Model plus Archetypes/Templates, Patient Mandate)
or CDISC ODM/SDTM. CDISC10 is a non-profit organization that develops
standards covering almost all the steps within a regulated clinical research
study including study design (SDM), study data collection (ODM and
CDASH), study data analysis (ADAM) and submission to the regulatory
bodies (SDTM).



Although the same information model is selected, consider for example
HL7 CDA, the same clinical information can be represented through
different compositional aggregation of clinical statements. To address this
problem, these information models could be restricted more through CDA
templates or CEN/ISO 13606 archetypes or CDISC ODMs based on
selected CDASH data sets. Content models based on one or more of these
possibilities can be created. Yet, the content models used by clinical
research and care domains usually differ.



Although the same content model (template/archetype) is chosen, clinical
statements may be represented using coded terms from different
terminology systems.

Reasons for Semantic
Mismatch:
- Different Reference
Information Models
-Different Templates
-Different Coding
Systems

To address these problems, semantic interoperability framework should not only handle the structural
mappings of two different information models, but also resolve the semantic mismatches due to the use of
different terminology systems and different compositional aggregations to represent the same clinical
concept differently even when a single information model is used.

A Brief Overview of SALUS Interoperability Approach
In order to be able to detect such semantic similarities, there needs to be a common harmonized ontology
that represents the semantics of reference information models, templates, archetypes and the terminology
systems used. In SALUS Interoperability Framework we aim to provide tools to create and maintain such a
harmonized ontology as a linked set of ontologies, and also to provide the semantic mediators that run on
top of this harmonized model to map message payloads represented in one content profile to another in
cooperation with terminology servers. SALUS common harmonized ontology aimed to act as a common
denominator for exchanging clinical data required for proactive post market patient safety studies between
clinical care and research systems. This ontology shall be based on the already existing standards used in
clinical care and research domains and the already existing data sets. To be able to create this common
harmonized ontology in a systematic and scalable way to serve the needs of SALUS use cases, the
following activities are aimed to be carried out based on our methodology:


Identifying the clinical information requirements of the selected SALUS use
cases and the related transactions enabling safety research. For this, we aim
to agree on and design content models as the message payloads to be
exchanged based on the prominent clinical data exchange standards used in
clinical care and research domains (such as CDISC ODM models, CDA
templates, CEN/ISO 13606 archetypes). There is an important initiative in
this respect, namely the intended CEN/ISO Semantic Interoperability
Artefact Modeling Standard (SIAMS) 11. SIAMS approach provides a
generic, neutral, standard approach for defining models of use which is not
specific to CEN/ISO 13606, openEHR or HL7 CDA syntax. This generic
model of use can be translated into 13606 archetypes, openEHR archetypes
or HL7v3 CDA based content templates when necessary. We aim to
develop a generic editor for Clinical Information Models (CIMs) for
defining models of use, which then can be translated to different standards
like HL7 CDA, CDISC ODM and CEN/ISO 13606.



Based on these information requirements expressed as content models,
identifying the core common data element (CDE) set as meaningful
fragments/building blocks to be used to create such content models. We will
provide necessary tools to create, select, adapt and manage the CDEs in this
core data set in conformance to ISO/IEC 11179 standard for metadata
registries12.



Building a harmonized patient safety study ontology on top of this core
CDE set. This evolving ontology will act as a common semantic dictionary
of the clinical terms to be exchanged between EHR systems and clinical
research systems. Supporting ontology fragments from domain specific
ontologies (such as drug ontologies, specific disease ontologies) should also
be added to this common ontology by providing the necessary semantic
interlinkages between these ontology fragments. It should also cover the
related fragments of the terminologies used in clinical care and research
domains like MedDRA, LOINC, ATC, SNOMED CT, ICD-10, WHODD.

SALUS will build a
semantic metadata
registry for managing
common data elements in
conformance to ISO/IEC
11179 standard

A Brief Overview of SALUS Interoperability Approach
On top of this harmonized ontology, SALUS Semantic Mediation Framework aims to enable the
underlying clinical research and clinical care systems to communicate through their already existing
domain information models.
For this, we support two complementary approaches:

Complementary semantic
interoperability support for
clinical care and research
systems that have varying
levels of semantic awareness



We enable the clinical research and clinical care systems to communicate
via the functional interoperability profiles by exchanging message payloads
in conformance to the specified content models. In this way, they become
able to communicate through the existing well accepted standards they
choose like archetypes, CDA templates and CDISC ODM models. SALUS
provides tools to semantically mediate these semantically similar but
syntactically different content models to one another by exploiting the
harmonized SALUS ontology.



We enable the development of semantic interfaces on top of their existing
proprietary systems that will enable the EHRs and clinical research systems
to communicate directly through the harmonized SALUS semantic model.
For this, we aim to develop wrappers to translate these semantic interfaces
enabled through semantic query languages like SPARQL to the native
interfaces supported by the available systems, like SQL.

Expected Results

Early SALUS Results are
already available from:
http://www.salusproject.eu

The SALUS project will foster integration of clinical care information from
EHRs into clinical research systems to enable proactive post-marketing
safety studies for early detection of potential safety issues. Such an
environment will increase data availability and data accuracy for the clinical
research community; reduce time spent on data entry for filling individual
case safety reports by seamlessly retrieving data from EHRs; support wide
scale longitudinal observational studies by enabling access to clinical care
data stored in multiple distributed EHR Systems; decrease the time to detect
the adverse drug events, as access to distributed EHR systems will
drastically increase the scale of the safety studies; and facilitate
participation by a greater number of clinicians and healthcare institutes in
safety research.
SALUS Project has started its activities in February 2012, the consortium
has identified the selected use cases, finalized requirement specification and
currently working on the conceptual design of architecture. This study also
includes the initial specifications of the functional interoperability profiles,
the common set of core data elements required in these use cases. The
consortium is also actively developing early proto-types: the first prototype
enables conduct of a post market safety analysis study by a regulatory body
to assess the validity of a reported adverse event, by collecting case safety
reports from heterogeneous hospitals presenting medical summaries in HL7
CDA, and CEN/ISO 13606 EHR Communication format using diverse
terminology systems, and seamlessly analyzing the collected reports
although different EHR standards and terminology systems are used, and
