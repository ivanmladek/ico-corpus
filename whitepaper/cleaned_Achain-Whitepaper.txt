world, founded blockchain now considered one the technological innovations the greatest potential and creativity the world. there were three key turning points the human history: the first industrial revolution, marked machines replacing manual labor, the second industrial revolution, followed the inter-combustion engine and other mass production techniques, and the third industrial revolution, driven computer technology, nuclear energy, space technology and bioengineering. however, the foundation our relations production has remained the same: still confined into centralized, top-down, pyramid structure. the more complicated this structure gets and the more levels generates, the more difficult ensure efficiency. blockchain, also known ?the value network?, decentralized and entrusted network that achieves peer-to-peer value exchanges. achain believes that blockchain technology the innovation reform the current relations production and pave the way for the next longawaited revolution the history mankind. with the help achain, can create world where people are directly connected, trusted, collaborative, peer-to-peer-exchanged and value-driven under social consensuses. achain will accomplish this goal three phases. first, we?ll build secure and stable blockchain network with modular design approach that will enable smart contracts and digital assets. smart sandbox will also used create environment for intellectual tests and monitors contractual execution. sandbox ensures contracts are safe enough avoid similar dao incidents before being uploaded officially the chain. second, use forking meet different business appeals such insurance, document preservation, cryptocurrency, tracing, personal credit, and more. this phase will lead evolving, easy-to-use, low-cost, well-tailored blockchain network. finally, through the value exchange protocol (vep), will connect these forked and active networks together, and even open data exchange with other networks (possibly non-blockchain) build connected and multidimensional data interrelated internet world. using multidimensional data such personal credit, assets, production and consumption data, community consensus, individual behavior, and value exchange will better integrated organically. the token, named act achain, holds the value its ecosystem. possessing act gives you access all basic blockchain services such smart contract release, network forking, and much more. achain designed put safety, stability and scalability the first place order create the ecosystem mentioned above. achain, public chain, selects the more practical dpos (delegated proof stake) consensus mechanism, which occupies less resource and creates result-delegated proof stake (hereinafter referred rdpos) consensus mechanism. under the same security situation, rdpos better improve the transaction performance the entire network well other parameters the network whole. theoretically has reached even exceeded ,tps (transaction per second). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_dao_(organization) background and commitment the history network development oct th, two separate points, arpanet university california los angeles (ucla) and stanford research institute (sri), successfully got connected through cable, signifying the arrival the age internet. the last years, with the emergent internet based companies such amazon, google, facebook, alibaba, etc., the information technology proved how could change the world. oct st, satoshi nakamoto presented the idea bitcoin his essay, bitcoin: peer-to-peer electronic cash system, declaring the arrival value transfer network. bitcoin impressed the world its anti-fraud, distributed-ledge, anonymous, and reliable characteristics. however, its performance and pow (proof-of-work) consensus are yet improved. recent years, groups and individuals have engaged technical innovation blockchain trading performance, consensus algorithm and secure anonymity. for example, the graphene tech and lightning network upgraded its performance; proof stake (pos), delegated proof stake (dpos) and practical byzantine fault tolerance (pbft) were proposed refine its consensus algorithm; zero-knowledge proof (zkp) and mixed-coin tech were expected enhance security. why need blockchain? really need the blockchain? early participant and witness, achain believes that this innovation has irreversible impact and will not short-lived. this based two reasons. first, need real, valued information, that can reduce cost trust. computers and the internet make information sharing cheaper and more convenient. with information technology, can optimize the value chain and improve the efficiency collaboration. however, are aware the faster and easier spreading hazardous information and will prioritize the security over the cost building trusted network. secondly, need network connect the social consensus, our behavior, and value incentives. have witnessed only little changes our relations production: still centralized, top-down, pyramid structure. the more complicated this structure gets and the more levels generates, the more difficult ensure efficiency. blockchain integrates distributed storage, encryption technology, network and other technologies. has the technological advantages decentralization and trustworthiness, which known the value network. blockchain will more efficiently solve problems trust between people and create new production network peer-to-peer value exchange. topics unsolved problems since its invention bitcoin has derived blockchain technology, and countless technology enthusiasts have been contributing the blockchain development. there have been the ethereum, which serves decentralized platform, bitcoin and lite coin, which focus the development digital currency, factom, which provides filing notarization, zcash and dash, which protect user privacy, bitshare, which functions decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, and even corda, rcev?s popular distributed bookkeeping platform. despite the rapid development the blockchain technology, there are still challenges ahead. security risks smart contracts. users might lose their digital assets during hacker attacks. difficulties cooperations and interconnections different blockchain platforms different fields application. although such information interactions were already attempted, not sufficient support the development the whole blockchain ecosystem. difficulties linking between the blockchain world and the non-blockchain based reality. ideas cannot easily put into application, such tracking commodity authentication. present, the blockchain industry still requires high technical qualifications, which leads the high cost large-scale business. low transaction performance compared the centralized systems. why need achain? achain prioritizes security, stability, extensibility. introducing cutting-edge designs virtual machines, smart sandbox, value exchange protocal, and forking mechanism, achain creates evolving, user-friendly, low-cost, and customizable blockchain network. the optimization block interval, block volume and consensus algorithm also helps achain reach performance rate tps. achain believe that the technological innovation creates new production relation network, will solve the problem trust interpersonal communications and organically integrate societal consensuses, individual behavior, and value exchange into inseparable whole. principle stability network stability essential the functioning blockchain solution. this is, however, increasingly challenged potential uncertainties, given the platform?s decentralized nature and its ever-expanding number applications. achain, with its philosophy modular design and simplification, developed lvm (lua virtual machine). the new vm, exclusively designated smart contracts, offers two advantages. has upgraded performance rate powered lua language, effectively protecting against potential system coupling. and also adopts separately run and independently built structure prevent the entire network quality from being affected local hazards. safety pow used guard the security the bitcoin network, but due the increasing mining demands and hashing force, significant amount power has gone into the hands miners and mining pools, resulting unwanted centralized "central server". entity controls percent the computing power, theoretically, possible control the majority bitcoin transactions, which known dos (denial-of-service) attack. besides, high power consumption also generates huge cost. compared the pow model, the pos (proof-of-stake) model aims for higher level security and wider range applications. pos model contributes the network security only when attracting enough holders for pos mining. based pos, dpos was later released enhanced version; but achain even invented more commercial-friendly and universally-accepted version, the rdpos consensus mechanism. when run just securely dpos, rdpos can increase the block response and improve the stability and security the network. addition, achain proposed smart sandbox mechanism. any released contracts should test-run the smart sandbox the first place automatically tested case health deteriorate loopholes. the network determines itself the newly written contract qualifies uploaded the achain ecosystem. scalability scalability proposed solve the problem incompatibility blocks the blockchain. first all, believe that upgrading and forking are the effective ways network evolution. after fork occurs, will generate main chain and number sub-chains. all chains are completely equivalent structure, but each given different logo based different community consensuses. each sub-chain can customized according different applications constructing the vep (value exchange protocol), which, like gateway, allows information sharing and value exchanges among chains this kind collaboration forms multi-application network. not only that, but the online data non-blockchain based events will also incorporated into the achain ecosystem. supplemented with smart contracts respond events the real world. easy-to-use achain provides with ease use two ways. the first provide the blockchain service (baas for short) lower the technical threshold for enterprises and individuals. blockchain applications become easy-to-use the means forking chain, data customization, smart contract publishing and upgrading, asset transaction monitoring, and supplement with visualization. the second the offer multiple programming language support, from lua, c++ java, that encourages most developers and enthusiasts involve easily. implementation smart contract lvm the conventional principle smart contract only allows for data access within blockchain networks. however, achain rebuilds this technology into one that enables data interaction between the blockchain system and outside networks. this can also realize synchronization between daily activities, such business process legal enforcement, and data status changes. business applications reality are complex due the nature data structures and business rules and achain making two aspects preparation overcome such complexity. the first singling out abstract ideas and general requirements behind potential applications order accordingly design the api interface and data structure advance. the second selecting turing complete language approximate the rules the real physical world much possible. lua, achain?s first choice, virtual machine with optimized compiler and bytecode. suitable for the blockchain application, lua enables static compilation and on-demand execution. blockchain networks, there are stages life cycle smart contract. create source code lua. compile gpc bytecode. contract registration contract account deposit. call contract api. upgrade destroy the contract. for economic consideration, tokens will spent only when registrations, calls and upgrades occur. the one hand, the execution contracts must take computer resources, blockchain capacity, and network traffic. the other hand, economic means raises the threshold potential cyber-attack. the separated module for contract execution, lua virtual machine (lvm), functions follow: architecture lvm the lvm includes parts, they are cli (command line interface), rpc (remote procedure call), mid-ware and lca (lua compiler actuator). how lvm works? firstly, contracts are entered from the console form lua command line. second, the cli receives command and transfers the mid-ware. the rpc receives lua request from blockchain the same time, the mid-ware will transfer both command and request lca synchronously. the end, lca runs the execution environment, receives lua script, and executes program and feedback results the mid-ware. the cli and the rpc return the results from midware the console and the blockchain separately. there?s frequent demand execute contract within active blockchain network. ensure high efficiency, achain follows two principles. first minimizing the startup and shutdown time the lvm process. second ensuring execution outputs consistent different nodes and different time with identical inputs. lvm supports more advanced program languages, such c#, java, solidity (ethereum program language). that enables most developers and enthusiasts get involved. consensus agreement the blockchain network cannot work without consensus. present, widely available consensus solutions are: pow, pos, pbft and dpos. achain selected the dpos and improved into new mechanism named rdpos (resulted-delegated proof stake). the rdpos inherits all the advantages dpos. not only unnecessary consume redundant computing power get new block, but also are the execution results contract able verified agent node all nodes alternatively, depending the state networks. it?s unable establish the community consensus without incentive, which usually called token the blockchain world. achain such public blockchain with its own token, act. the actholders have the right involve the community events, such creating and publishing smart contracts, accessing network service, voting agents, getting profits agent. achain community, candidates are voted all act-holders, the top candidates with the highest number votes will upgrade agents and get the right verify transactions turn. one can modify the verification sequence itself. work exchange rewards, work would punished. theoretically, rdpos enhances the network transaction capability better than dpos. specially that case long-time execution high-usage storage, all nodes, not just the agent node, take part verification. the rdpos can reduce the congestion level whole networks. moreover, optimizing consensus mechanism, the members group agents always change. this important for the networks keep decentralized. account account specially designed for secure transactions during the blockchain networks. there are elements need mentioned when talk about blockchain theory, account, public key and private key: private key public key account, specified order. thanks the sha (secure hash algorithm) method, blockchain secure network because private key too hard cracked reversely. the hash value refinement object, something like software, email, webpage etc. usually its output has fixed capacity and smaller than the input. detailed generation process follow. generation process private key, public key and act account divide accounts into two kinds according the byte length, the main account and the sub-account. the main account contains bytes but sub-account bytes. obviously, the subaccount has more bytes than the main one, because the sub-account contains main account and another -byte random characters. for this reason, main account can associate with lots subaccounts, long all them have the same first bytes. it?s easier improve transaction performance with help such design. parallel transactions among different sub-accounts are allowed those sub-accounts belong main one. the main-sub design mainly used cryptocurrency exchange for saving account consumption. achain selected the account model instead utxo (unspent transaction output) model, which applied bitcoin. utxo excellent design with features parallel transactions and better anonymity. is, however, very difficult realize smart contract under transaction-oriented design. it?s easier initiate transactions through triggers caused state conditions changes. forking network ?hard fork will make network more resilient,? asserted the ethereum foundation cofounder, taylor gerring. achain advocates for proper fork network for two reasons: first, hard forking keeps the network vigorous; second, hard fork satisfies different application scenarios. blockchain network kind social consensus supported people the community. when social consensuses change, hard forking will inevitable. some forking blockchain will survive and others die due lack support. forking signifies the process evolution any distributed autonomous organization, and eventually each survived forking blockchain prove better solve real-world problems. secondly, blockchain still early stage development. besides cryptocurrency, other use cases based blockchain still need verified. many technologies, such lighting network, zero knowledge proof, side chain, and segregated network, emerged recently blockchain field. these innovations demonstrate that different transaction rate, different consensus algorithm, and different technology characteristic could combined together satisfy different requirements. ideally different forking network will meet corresponding needs. although, forked network may also generate new issues, which will discussed the next section. achain designated the initial blockchain. from achain, user can fork multiple new blockchains easily, and user can even fork from newly created blockchain continuously. all forked blockchains are equal, which means they are not hierarchical from technical economic perspective. vep (value exchange protocol) will record and broadcast the message about newly forked blockchain, which includes genesis block, blockchain identification, seed nodes, cryptocurrency, service identification etc. each forking will trigger new vep message broadcasting. when blockchain need communicate with each other, the node the blockchain will find nodes another blockchain from vep broadcasting message, and exchange information and values under vep infrastructure. vep works like dns service, which provides with registration, update, and access services. order achieve these goals, achain sets its baas (blockchain service), and utilizes multiple programming languages and visualized development reduce the difficulty adoption. anybody could utilize forking network develop his own application, encourage community innovation. when the achain community becomes more active, achain value will increase, more and more developers will join achain forking network. this mutual stimulation will prosper achain ecosystem. value exchange protocol vep cross-chain communication protocol. single blockchain has its limitation support many different applications, but connected blockchain network could produce overlaid value. the more forking blockchains are connected, the more values are created. before discuss how vep works, let?s see how nodes trust each other within blockchain network. blockchain stores unchangeable and trustable information, which relies distributed ledger and distributed consensus algorithm. blockchain also community based agreed consensus, nodes blockchain trust each other based such consensus and economic inspiration. the same way, the whole blockchain could taken ?node?, and when numerous ?nodes? connected, ?nodes? need new consensus among the forking blockchain network. becomes more difficulty because the forking blockchain network need also equality, trust, and balance different interest, not mention evil nodes the network. important setup rules advance, just like human need cooperate across organizations under certain laws, contracts, and morals. vep defines the rules connection and communication. vep registers each forking blockchain, and provides query and access service for each licensed forking blockchain. vep supports two major user scenarios: cross-chain communication and cross-chain smart contract invocation. crosschain communication means that smart contracts communicate and invoke with each other, with possible new data creation, which are triggered indirectly ledger offline data changes. for instance, overdue loans, which are defined smart contract, will impact personal credit. the loan records are stored blockchain credit information stored blockchain and personal identification stored offline public database. simple example about cross-chain smart contract invocation cross-chain token exchange, which guarantees unchanged total value. cross-chain communication cross-chain smart contract invocation vep includes following information: blockchain registration information, network identity, service identity, seed nodes, etc. cross-chain verification protocol. communication protocol. assets exchange protocol. rewards and punishments mechanism. event-driven based vep, forking achain network can communicate and exchange values. through iot (internet things) and (artificial intelligence), forking achain network can even embrace offline data, such enterprise and public database, into achain network, and finally achieve real time event driven from real world. there are steps for event-driven mechanism: recognize different scenes, categorize them, and setup response standard. open listening service and catch information. calculate and check response. execute smart contract through vep. return execute result. applications supply chain finance supply chain finance, also known supplier finance reverse factoring, set solutions that optimizes cash flow. enables businesses extend their payment terms their suppliers while allowing their large and sme suppliers get paid early. one the fastest growing industries recent year. however, there too many parties involved, which leads scattered data storage. supplier's inventory information listed its warehouse management system; the deliverable information located the crm logistic company; the funding information allocated the bank; and the operation data the hands the enterprise itself. very difficult build credit system since all the data non-transparent and incomplete. therefore, the financial institutions will very cautious and miss some good projects eventually due huge cost credit assessment. achain can help enterprises and financial institutions rebuild credit system optimize efficiency supply chain finance. the solution build achain-based enterprise credit system that involves warehousing, logistics and financing services providers. the blockchain-based system enables all the companies the supply chain access all the data collected during production, logistics and auditing. e-receipt will utilized and its issuance, confirmation, circulation, splitting and acceptance are triggered through smart contracts various parties the supply chain. and will only triggered and recorded when data was updated one the enterprise?s system, which was mutually agreed between all parties. all actions made the system will recorded and stored the blockchain and cannot modified deleted. achain leverages technologies such baas and smart sandbox enable fast-track deployment the blockchain. allows the users quickly build blockchain network folk low cost. addition that, achain accepts using vep establish connection protocol and activates the event-driven mechanism integration data. this case, all participants are able verify the data ensure the transfer funds the supply chain with improved efficiency. authentication the retail industry naturally characterized the fragmentation transaction data, the diversification trading nodes and the complexity trading networks. the packaging item usually labels its date production, place origin and manufacturer regardless its sales channels. however, difficult verify the listed information. huge profit margins create great incentives for fraud, especially for high-value goods, such diamonds, luxury bags and skin care products etc. the existence fraud harms consumer?s interest and causes damages the credibility and brand image the authentic business. there are three major industry pains for authentication goods. first, has trace back not only its production process but also its logistic process which involves high complexity cross-organization cooperation. secondly, the information isolated different centralized systems used hundreds parties. lastly, centralized system can risky the information can changed deleted individual party. achain proposed the solution the retail industry blockchain iot with iot, data production and logistics can collected real time through smart devices and stored achain?s traceable network through vep. blockchain?s unique data storage structure and distributed ledger technology ensure that the data the chain cannot deleted altered. meanwhile, asymmetric encryption and anonymous mechanism ensure that information security. customers can easily access the full profile product providing its product code and batch number. blockchain can solve the pain authentication while preventing disclosure corporate information. the information transparent all relevant parties: manufacturers, logistics providers and the consumers. the purchase information and logistic details provide insightful support the manufacturer for analyzing their production strategies. such mechanism also benefits the logistic provider giving data support. the blockchain technology makes transparent and efficient society. development plan plan stage. singularity?~? the first stage enhance the achain network?s security and stability. smart contracts, digital assets, and sandbox simulations are made available through the methodology modular design. sandbox can automatically test and monitor the environment where the newly created smart contracts operate. thereby they ensure that those contracts run stable and safely within the achain network. stage. galaxy ?~? achain splits into multiple sub-chains meet the need for different applications the reality, including insurance, e-documentation, cryptocurrency, record investigation, credit rating, and much more can fulfilled sub-chains within interconnected, low-cost, user-friendly, and customized blockchain network. stage. cosmos?~? stage. the baas and vep (value exchange protocol) concept and technology can not only unify the main chain and sub-chains but also connect the non-blockchain realities the blockchain ecosystem. this pushes the world?s interconnections greater, all-encompassing dimension. achain development plan program governance about achain foundation the achain foundation responsible for achain?s development, its transparency administration, and
