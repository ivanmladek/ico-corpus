ABSTRACT

This paper introduces
DataBroker DAO, a peer to
peer marketplace created
to provide IoT sensor
owners with a clear path
to data monetization and
data consumers with a
decentralized market to buy
IoT sensor data.

With DataBroker DAO, we aspire to unleash long-tail creativity with
the use of sensor data to facilitate the conversion of incredible
ideas into value adding services. By providing a distributed
foundational layer for the buying and selling of IoT sensor data, we
expect that unimagined uses of data that exist in the hearts and minds
of entrepreneurs, researchers and organisations around the world, will
emerge to create incredible value adding services that enrich the quality
of life in our cities and our societies as a whole.
The global market for IoT sensors has
surpassed 600 billion USD per year ¹
including the purchase, installation and
maintenance of sensors and the acquisition of software packages to interpret
and enrich the data. The data resulting
from this investment is for primary usage
by the sensor owner or enhanced with
value-added insights and resold.
Whether for primary usage or for enrichment and re-sale, the data remains gross-

ly underutilized and the utility for society
locked away in organisational silos. By
connecting data owners with 3rd party
data consumers directly, DataBroker DAO
provides a marketplace where IoT sensor
data can be fully valorised outside of the
primary silos in which it is locked today.
In this sense, DataBroker DAO can be
likened to a “secondary market” for IoT
sensor data and has been referred to as
an “eBay” or “Amazon” for IoT sensor data.

UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL &
MONETIZATION OF IOT SENSOR DATA
Individuals, companies, researchers & governments are spending
hundreds of billions each year on buying and maintaining IoT sensors.The growth of the investment and applications in IoT is truly staggering, and yet, all data captured by these devices is locked up in silos
and walled gardens.
On its path from sensor to silo, all this
data flows over gateway operators like
telecom companies, networks and even
the control panels of the sensor manufacturers.
These sensor owners usually have a two
year business case for their placement
and the data they generate. The primary

marketfor these sensors is expected to
reach 1.2 trillion USD in 2019, and estimating that at least 10% of the data generated
is sought for others (1-3 times), the value
of data locked away will reach 120 billion
next year

BY 2016, THERE WERE NO FEWER
THAN 9 BILLION SENSORS DEPLOYED
GLOBALLY, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO
GROW TO 33 BILLION BY 2019.

DATABROKER DAO: A PEER TO PEER
MARKETPLACE FOR IOT SENSOR DATA
Using a smart contract based marketplace on the Ethereum network, it becomes possible to unlock this value. Via
their gateway operator, the sensor owners
place the data generated by their sensors
up for sale (while staking some of their
DTX tokens), and buyers can discover and
purchase access to the data using that
same DTX token.

The gateway operator will run their own
Ethereum mainnet blockchain node and
run the open-source DataBrokerDAO dAPI
(distributed API) on top. Data generated by
the sensors of their clients is sent (within
the same datacenter) to their dAPI which
check who has purchased access and
send the data directly on to the location
specified by the buyer on purchasing.

Since the gateway operator is
already set up to deal with the data
their clients generate, routing purchased data streams to a location
on the internet is a straightforward
extension.

For doing so, the gateway operator is
awarded 10% of each transaction in DTX
tokens. The platform also earns 10% and,
most importantly, the lion share goes to
the sensor owner receiving 80% of the
proceeds.

To move from a local to a global marketplace, the DataBroker DAO implementation is replicated with a multitude of
gateway operators around the world.

7

This grants access to a global market for
data. Anyone in the world will be able to
buy any available data anywhere, making
it truly, “a global market for local data”.

STAKEHOLDERS
There are a number of stakeholders in the DataBroker DAO including
sensor owners, gateway operators, data processors and data buyers.
Below is a definition of each of these stakeholders.
SENSOR OWNERS

Sensor owners are the stakeholders who
have purchased IoT sensors and make the
data emitted from their sensors available
for sale via the DataBroker DAO platform.
This is a diverse group who have generally
purchased sensors in order to improve the
efficiency of their operations.

in collected and conditioned form
— data which would otherwise be
fragmented, conflicted and sometimes unreliable.
•

Smart data services provide conditioned and calculated data, with
analytical rules and calculations
applied to derive further insight from
the collected data and aid the decision-making process. (e.g. Artificial
Intelligence)

•

Adaptive data services apply analysis
to a customer’s request-specific
data combined with data in a context
store. This is a more advanced form
of service.

The key role of Sensor Owners in DataBroker DAO is to sell the data from their
sensors on the platform.

DATA BUYERS

Data Buyers are those stakeholders who
will purchase data on the platform. This
purchase may be to use the data in its
raw form for their own purposes or to
purchase the data with the intention of
transforming/enriching the raw data to be
resold with added value via DataBroker
DAO (see Data Processor below).
The use of the data purchased by Data
Buyers can be quite straightforward, for
instance, purchasing temperature and
rainfall data provisioned by a neighboring
office building to have accurate local readings to the more complex, like purchasing
data to train one’s AI.

DATA PROCESSORS

Data Processors are those Data Buyers
who purchase data with the explicit
intention of enriching the data and either
reselling it or handling it for their clients.
The enrichment may take many forms
and Data Processors can be categorized
by the level of insight provided³:
•

Simple data services are the most
common. Data brokers collect data
from multiple sources and offer it

3-4-5

8

It is estimated that there are more than
5,000 data processing companies worldwide relying on a vast array of open datasets published by government agencies
and non-governmental organizations4
(Moore, 2016) in combination with their
proprietary datasets and algorithms to
enrich publicly available data.
These range from specialized boutiques,
such as CB Insights, Fico, Intelius, etc.
to large global consultancies such as
McKinsey, Deloitte, PWC. It is estimated
that 75 percent of analytics solutions
will incorporate at least ten or more data
sources from second-party partners or
third-party providers by 20195.
It is expected that Data Processors will
make up the majority of Data Buyers on
the DataBroker DAO platform.

Moore, S. (2016, June 8). How to Choose a Data Broker.

GATEWAY OPERATORS

The data emitted by the billions of
devices deployed globally flow across a
wireless sensor network (WSN) operated
generally (but not exclusively) by large
telecommunications companies in each
country. This may be a traditional GSM
network, a LORA network or an alternative
such as SigFox.
The key role of Gateway Operators in
DataBroker DAO is to expose the gateway
they operate to enable sensor owners to
sell their data on the platform.
The diagram below demonstrates
how these stakeholders interact in
DataBroker DAO.

IN A SENSE,
DATABROKER DAO
CAN BE LIKENED
TO A “SECONDARY
MARKET” FOR IOT
SENSOR DATA AND
HAS BEEN REFERRED
TO AS AN “EBAY” OR
“AMAZON” FOR IOT
SENSOR DATA.

WHO “WINS" IN THIS STORY?
Sensor owners (data providers) are able
to directly monetise their data to generate
passive income that will turn a sunk cost
into a potential money maker and at least
the opportunity to recoup some of their
investments in IoT sensors (purchase,
installation, maintenance, software licenses
to interpret the sensor data). A sensor
owner will earn 80% of the amounts
received and pay a small recurring fee for
putting the sensor on the platform.
Data buyers and data processors get data
as a service so do not need to make the
upfront investment in hardware to get
the data they require. Another advantage
for both buyer types is that DataBroker
DAO provides access to data that would

otherwise be trapped in the data silos of
sensor owners.
Gateway providers: gain scale and speed
in the adoption of their network/devices
as the partner connected to DataBroker
DAO can present a win-back to their
enterprise accounts, a clear USP. These
gateway operators are the gateway
through which the data flows to the
DAO, and as such, they are also paid out
immediately for each sale in the platform
and will receive 10% of the fee.
The DAO takes the remaining 10% of all
funds, depending on market conditions,
received on the platform to cover
operating costs.

WHO “LOSES” IN THIS STORY?
Sensor manufacturers: While
manufacturers will increase sales in the
short run due to the higher profitability
of IoT projects. However, on the longer
term, “sharing” sensors may reduce their
day-to-day sales. This can be balanced
by higher replacements due to the higher
amount of sensors in the field.
However, hardware margins are in a “race
to the bottom” and are already razor thin.

10

Sensor providers already make most of
their money via software and services.
From this perspective, the producer
can pull resources and capital out of
unprofitable hardware manufacturing
and allocate these to successful SaaS
offerings. From our discussions with
manufacturers, they are very enthusiastic
about this prospect.

WHO WILL SELL DATA?
There are a number of data sellers
identified and the overview of the sectors
already investing in sensors from Gartner
highlights the key potential sellers of
data for the years to come. The diagram

Home Security and Safety

below identifies the 2 groups (business,
consumer) and the sub- groups that
constitute each. It is clear that the
business group is the main driving force in
sensor deployment globally.

Information and Entertainment

Home Automation,
Energy Management, Other

Banking and Securities
Communications,
Media and Services

Health and Fitness

Education

Automotive infotainment

Govermment
Utilities

Health Providers
Consumer

Transportation

Retail and Wholesale Trade

11

Insurance

Business

Manufacturing and
Natural Resources

THE BUSINESS GROUP IS LED
BY THE FOLLOWING SECTORS:
Manufacturing and Natural Resources:
the so-called industrial IoT consists of
companies that are deploying sensors
in order to improve operations. Their
primary purpose for deploying sensors is
to improve the efficiency of operations to
reduce their cost base. DataBroker DAO
presents the opportunity to sell selected
data that will not reveal to competitors
specifics of their manufacturing process.
Transportation: the data for
transportation consists of both traffic
and vehicle specific data. Traffic data
includes for instance congestion and for
instance data for shipping of goods like
temperature sensors in food shipping
containers. This also includes sensors
for managing public transportation such
as trains and busses. Vehicle specific
data includes a wide array of sensors in
cars and trucks both personally owned
vehicles and fleets measuring everything
from CO2 emissions to speed to
preventive maintenance.
Utilities and Government: Utility
providers deploy sensors for “smart”
utilities en-masse to deliver more efficient
utility services to their clients including
smart grids and smart meters primarily
for electricity and water. Government

12

sensors are also wide ranging including
everything from water level sensors to
detect flooding, air quality monitoring to
smart street lights.
In addition to these sellers which
represent the bulk of currently deployed
sensors, we identify at least 2 additional
growth areas in the coming years:
Smart City Initiatives: a roadblock
for getting smart city initiatives off the
ground is the upfront cost of populating
the town with sufficient sensors to be
meaningful. The DataBroker DAO platform
provides a means to turn what is today a
sunk cost and a perpetual maintenance
expense into an investment with a 2-3
year payback period and a continuous
income stream after that.
Agricultural sector: in Belgium today,
10% of farmers are “techie”. They have
a drone flying around and 5-20 sensors
deployed and some other automation in
place. The sensors include for instance
wind, temperature, barometric pressure,
humidity, PH level in the soil. They use
these to manage their farm and spend
between 10-50k euro per year, and
DataBroker DAO will provide the possibility
to recoup some of this cost.

WHO WILL BUY DATA?
Aside from the data processors in the ecosystem, any company
looking to commercialise a product that is data driven is provided with
the opportunity to develop the product without having to invest in the
hardware. The potential buyers are extremely broad.
•

From the agricultural example above,
two potential buyers jump out with
> 1000 temperature sensors from
nearly all regions of the country, the
data is more accurate and granular
than the national weather service.
They are a potential buyer as are tv
and radio stations who, by buying data
directly on the marketplace, cut out
the national weather service in their
purchase from the farmers.

•

With >1000 PH level sensors covering
most parts of the country, fertiliser
companies would view this as a
“honeypot” for their sales people.

•

Smart City Initiatives can limit the
upfront cost of populating the town
with sufficient sensors and turn the
expense into an investment with a 2–3
year payback period and a continuous
income stream after that.

•

Academics get access to the data
from thousands of sensors and can
buy data directly on the marketplace.
This will result in a boost in the number
of potential spin outs from academia
as projects no longer have as high

startup costs associated with buying
and deploying a network of sensors.
•

Public Transport data can be sold to
entrepreneurs who can help to create
applications such as mobile apps to
help the general public find the perfect
routes to their desired destination, this
introduces an extra revenue source
for local governments while improving
the infrastructure around the public
transportation systems.

•

Self-driving technology companies
could buy car sensor data to create the
perfect self-driving AI and license this
back to various car manufacturers.

•

Environmental agencies can gather
data from millions of sensors around
the world, such as PH water sensors,
to get insights into environmental
change, impact of their programs and
understand where to act.

•

Energy corporations can purchase
wind, weather & consumption data to
plan new green energy initiatives and
understand where to best place new
wind or solar farms.

IN SHORT
The stakeholders in the IoT space have a lot to gain:

13

•

Sensor owners can monetize their
data and turn a sunk cost into a
potential money maker and at least the
opportunity to recoup some of their
investments in IoT sensors.

•

Network operators acting as gateway
operators gain scale and speed in the
adoption of their network as connected
telcos can present a win-back to their
enterprise accounts, a clear USP.

•

Sensor manufacturers acting as
gateway operators can stop the

“race to the bottom” for production
and pull resources and capital out of
manufacturing and allocate these to
more successful SaaS offerings.
•

New types of buyers have
unprecedented access to data and
options to monetize their own data,
in this category we see the entire
booming and vibrant startup scene.

•

Data processors have an ecosystem to
sell their services to the right people.

THE DATABROKER DAO ALLIANCE
In the future we envision, the world where
the DataBroker DAO platform will be
an integral part of the “IoT data”-fabric,
there will be, more than ever, a need for
collaboration between the stakeholders in
this ecosystem. These parties will need to
find ways to work together to further their
collective businesses and use-cases.

ecosystem. Apart from gaining essential
insights into the requirements of the
platform, we feel that guiding the
stakeholders through this foundational
change in doing business together will be
the linchpin in the further development of
the platform.

We formed the DataBroker DAO alliance
to help facilitate this collaborative

“We are happy to cross paths
with SettleMint and to engage
with blockchain technology over
DataBroker DAO. The integration
was smooth and successful due
to technical excellence. In a next
step on our roadmap we intend to
include a DataBroker DAO “sell my
data” option into our portfolio, as we
realise this is a new monetisation
opportunity for both sensor owners,
data consumers and vendors”
MR. RAJEEV JHA
CEO of Yuktix

14

At this time there are + 20 companies that have formally joined the
alliance. They include players in each of the stakeholder groups and are
a good cross section of the ecosystem.

16

The biggest obstacle to the success of
DataBroker DAO and the full valorisation
of IoT sensor data is on the supply side
of the equation. That is the adoption of
the marketplace by data sensor owners
who are generating data. DataBroker
DAO enables sensor owners to sell their
data directly to interested 3rd party data
consumers and are thus provided with the
opportunity to recoup their sunk costs for
IoT sensor hardware and software (>600

billion USD today) incentivising them to
provide access to their proprietary data.
To overcome this obstacle, one of the
first priorities will be hiring an experienced
team of enterprise sales profiles. Their
focus will be to guide the gateway
operators through the sales cycle,
onboard them into the DataBroker DAO
Alliance and push for the integration of the
dAPI into their systems.

1. “Marketplaces offer customers

2. “Data marketplaces can define
metaformats and abstractions that
support cross-device and crossindustry use cases.”
3. “Service-level agreements can
ensure that marketplaces deliver
data of consistently high quality.”
4. “By assembling multitudes of thirdparty participants, companies can
increase the relevance of their own
digital platform.”

market by providing information
and transactional gateways for
businesses such as charginginfrastructure providers, mobilityservice players, and vehicle
manufacturers. Charging-station
operators, for example, are free
to determine their own pricing
structures based on data available
about customer habits and market
trends.”
6. “Data marketplaces make it
possible to share and monetize
different types of information
to create incremental value.
By combining information and
analytical models and structures
to generate incentives for data
suppliers, more participants will
deliver data to the platform.”

6 Johannes Deichmann, K. H. (2016, October ). Creating a successful Internet of Things data marketplace.

17

Below is an assessment of the current beta version
of DataBroker DAO based on these 6 pillars:

18

•

Creating a central point of
“discoverability”: the DAO pulls
together data that is otherwise locked
in organisational silos controlled by
the sensor owners.

•

Supporting interoperability: the DAO
defines standard metaformats for
data descriptions and will integrate
several processes to bring actual
data into standardised formats in the
next iteration of the platform.

•

Achieving consistent data quality:
data streams come directly from
the gateway so there is no point
in the process that is open to
manipulation of data. In the next
iteration of the platform, a reputation
system that allows data buyers to
provide feedback on data quality
will be added to further enhance the
controls on data quality.

•

Building an ecosystem: the DAO
brings the stakeholders in the IoT
sensor data market together. It is the
foundational layer of the ecosystem.

•

Opening up new monetization
opportunities: Sensor owners
are incentivised through direct
remuneration from data buyers. In
a future iteration, the platform will
introduce additional data enrichment
and display options that service
providers can monetise through the
platform. The roadmap includes
graphical packages from mapping to
charts.

•

Enabling crowdsourcing: Sensor
data is crowd-sourced directly from
sensor owners.

WHY USE BLOCKCHAIN?

From a marketplace perspective using the public Ethereum chain
enables the use of a fully built out financial ecosystem, with minimum of
fees. Traditional fiat payment processors charge between 1 and 3% for
money in and money out, while a purchase using the utility token costs
around 0.003 USD7 in fees for purchases of any size.
Using a utility token over fiat currency
also brings the advantage of 18 decimals.
Combine the possibility to use extremely
small fractions of the token with very low
fees, and real microtransactions become
possible.
While these actions will ease adoption,
there will be a learning curve for
these enterprises. Every project in the
blockchain space is working hard to try
and solve some of these issues and it is
only a matter of time before the skillset
of the users and de technical capabilities
meet in the middle.
From a decentralised network perspective
it is also a perfect fit. Very large numbers
of participants, in a trustless environment,
transacting with each other is the
definition of a perfect use-case.
From an ecosystem perspective we
notice a lot of activity in the IoT sphere,
solving a lot of hard problems for the
future. And we are avid fans of these
trailblazers knowing that the Databroker
DAO is a great addon for many of these
project, the missing link in the ecosystem.

We are not blind to the usability issue
in using separate tokens on a public
blockchain for any type of user. We are
working on several solutions to ease
adoption:
•

We will facilitate corporations to
purchase tokens from DataBroker
DAO directly. These tokens will come
out of the reserved platform fund and
will be sold for fiat currency with full
invoicing, just like any other digital
good. We will not buy back tokens or
issue more.

•

We are planning on implementing
the GasStation8 concept presented
by Swarm.city on DevCon 3 to
overcome the “gas” hump when
onboarding new users of the
platform.

•

We are working actively with leading
wallet providers to include our tokens
by default, easing the setup and
management of these tokens for an
enterprise.

A C O M P E T I T I V E A N A LY S I S O F
IOT BLOCKCHAIN PROJ ECTS

There are 3 commonly named projects that live in the same sphere:
Streamr9, IOTA10 and OceanProtocol11.
Streamr is taking their traditional data
transfer platform and will attempt to
“blockhainize” it. While we will not go into a
deep technical analysis of these projects
the conclusion can be drawn from reading
the whitepaper that the goal is to replace
the entire IoT stack, from top to bottom,
with the Streamr solution. A monumental
challenge if you keep in mind that if they
are operational in 2 years, they will have
to replace an industry with 30 billion
deployed sensors.
IOTA’s plan is similar. But they go even
further, aside from replacing the entire
IoT ecosystem, they also replace any
underlying blockchain base with a new
and untested network, using a concept
called a “tangle”. Double down on the
challenges.
Both Streamr and IOTA describe a data
marketplace. A marketplace for data
on the the Streamr or IOTA platform/
network. Of, at some point in time, one of
them has replaced the IoT ecosystem, the
winner would indeed be a real competitor
for DataBroker DAO to break down data
silos and facilitate the easy transfer
of data, regardless of the underlying
network.

DataBroker DAO takes a radically
different approach:
•

It is built to go into production this
year. This ensures we both need to
use proven technology, and a first
movers advantage over these other
players.

•

It is built to interface with the
large players in the ecosystem
(manufacturers and gateway
operators) in a non invasive way. We
are not replacing anything or anyone,
ensuring a low friction environment.
The only way to get market scale fast
enough.

•

It focuses on being a complementary
component in the current and future
ecosystem, meaning that in the
future DataBroker DAO can co-exist,
integrate and complement IOTA,
Streamr and OceanProtocol.

We wish each and every one of these
projects all the success in the world, and
we will happily integrate them into the
ecosystem upon reaching critical mass.

OceanProtocol is a different story. Their
focus is a new kind of BigchainDB-based
network specifically for buying and selling
AI datasets. While not a lot is known at
this point, the roadmap specifies several
years before their solution will be ready
and the underlying technology is less
decentralised/open compared to an
Ethereum based solution.

THE ARCHITECTURE

A token curated registry for reputation, quality and curation.
The core component of the platform is
the registry of sensors and data steams/
files offered in the platform. In the
DataStreamRegistry we will store all data
providing sources that stream sensor
data. Streaming data can be live data
coming from an IoT sensor. This data is
sold per timespan. The DataSetRegistry
will hold ‘files’ of data that can be bought;
these are sold per download.
To list a stream/set in these registries,
the owner has to stake (to stake means
commit/sent/lockup in this context) a
certain amount of DTX tokens. These
tokens are locked as a guarantee for good
behavior by the data seller.
There will be a minimum stake required to
be listed in the registry at all. Data sellers
can stake more DTX tokens if they want
to. Staking more allows these streams/
sets to appear more prominently in the
listings (e.g., sorting, or additional badges
in the interface) improving the chances of
being bought, and at the same increase
the guarantees a buyer has that the
data is of good quality and contains the
advertised information.
A data buyer that is unhappy with the
quality of data can challenge an entry in
the registry by staking some DTX tokens.
This challenge will be represented in the
UI to all potential buyers as a negative

21

reputation score. In itself, it does not have
any effect on selling of the data.
Upon reaching a certain threshold of
challenges, a check of the data provider
will be performed by a DataBroker DAO
administrator. Upon finding issues
with the advertised data, it’s stake is
distributed equally over all challengers and
the DataBroker DAO platform wallet. The
entry is removed from the registry. If it is
deemed that the data is sound, the staked
tokens by the challengers get distributed
to the data seller and the platform.
•

This incentivizes data sellers to
maintain a good standing and
delivering data as advertised.

•

Data buyers are encouraged to
report bad data to recoup the lost
funds due to bad data. Data buyers
are discouraged from reporting
false challenges, and the seller can
reduce lost funds due to unfair bad
reputation.

•

The DataBroker DAO platform and
its administrators are encouraged
to handle these disputes quickly and
efficiently and are rewarded for their
time and effort.

IDENTITY MANAGEMENT FOR A BILLION SENSOR OWNERS
Databroker DAO is a peer-to-peer
marketplace of IoT sensor data. This
data is created by sensors, and we are
talking about billions of sensors. These
sensors are owned by again a very large
number of owners. These owners have
contracted a network operator (which
might be a telco, or a manufacturer) to
transport the data generated by their
sensors to a (mainly internet-) gateway for
consumption.
The network operator takes up the role
of gatekeeper in regards to the data
flowing through their gateway. They have
performed all required KYC procedures
on the sensor owners and they have
identified and validated the sensors
themselves. They are also garding their
network against unauthorised use. And
in most regions, network operators
do not have a monopoly resulting in a
large amount of potential partners, but
significantly reduced compared to the
amount of owners or sensors.
For Databroker DAO partnering with
these gateway operators is quite an

22

advantageous scenario. By controlling
and verifying the gateway operators,
the platform has a way to manage and
control the gigantic amount of sensors
and owners by proxy.
This has a consequence for managing
the identities of the sensors, owners and
operators in the platform. Building on the
work of end user identity management
projects like uPort, the platform works with
“Managed Identity Proxy” contracts. These
proxy contracts contain the link to the
sensor owner’s wallet and identity. Different
from the end user solutions, these proxy
contracts are also linked to the identity of
the owner at the gateway operator and can
be controlled by that gateway operator.
This allows us to have full ownership by
the sensor owner, combined with the
ability of the gateway operator to control/
automate their interaction with the system,
and even handle end-user private keys
until proper key management has become
widespread and commonplace. This
system will be open-sourced before the
main token sale.

DAPP AND DAPI
In the blockchain world, a large number
of projects are building distributed
applications or dAPPs. These client
side applications interact directly with
Ethereum or other blockchains. In many
cases, for the sake of user experience,
these applications are running on remote
shared nodes like the ones Infura12
provides. While this is the only way to
create user friendly end-user peer-to-peer
applications, it has serious drawbacks for
some of our use cases:
•

•

Single point of failure. During some
of the recent token sales, the client
side applications coupled with
high demand have brought these
shared nodes to a halt. Not for the
lack of trying or skill, but due to the
sheer amount of RPC calls needed
to perform certain functions on
Ethereum smart contracts. In a high
stakes sector, such failures are not
an option.
Web interfaces and apps are nice,
but the real value is in APIs. In the

current SaaS and cloud boom this
is almost a given. You have no real
product unless you also have an API
for it. Slack, Zapier, Github, CRM and
ERP systems, they all attribute parts
of their success to their commitment
to APIs.
•

More apps, more problems. Adding
an extra interface only makes it
harder to use for the average user.
The sensor owners already have an
account with the operators. They
have figured out how to work with
them and are happy (and if not, they
switch operators).

That is why we add in, what we call,
a dAPI. Just like a dAPP, it’s an API
application that is deployed at each
node. Primary usage of this dAPI is at the
gateway operator, data processor and
large scale data buyer sides, and not at
the sensor owner or small scale buyers.
They will use the (existing) interfaces
provided by the gateway operators or the
Databroker DAO dAPP.

DATA DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE
Billions of sensors generate huge
amounts of data. And any company using
IoT sensor data has their systems for
processing it and is most likely not inclined
to replace that system. This means we
cannot enforce a new data storage system
on them. Even more important, it is not the
goal of the platform to store all IoT sensor
data for eternity.
Built in the dAPI, there are connectors to
integrate with the leading IoT and bigdata

storage vendors, leaving the buyer the
choice on where their data needs to
be sent.
Now there is a valid use-case for
blockchain anchoring of this data. The
immutability and timestamping capabilities
are worth something. To benefit from
these capabilities the dAPI will anchor
batches of data on the Ethereum mainnet
(using the Chainpoint spec13).

GOVE RNANCE
25

The “DAO” in the DataBroker DAO name is not a marketing ploy. We
believe that a platform at such a crucial crossroads between IoT and
blockchain, with a global and wide variety of involved parties, will need a
non-traditional governance model.
Though the community has learned a lot
since initial DAO governance experiments,
there is still a long way to go. Especially
since a lot of the partners in this
ecosystem are more enterprise minded at
this time.
Since agility and flexibility are crucial in
the early stages we decided that, since

best practices and adoption of this model
are still a moving target, Databroker DAO
will be run using a traditional company
structure, until such a time we, in active
collaboration with the community and
industry, can determine a governance
model that works for all parties involved.

THE DT X TOKE N

VALUE & HISTORY OF THE DTX TOKEN
The goal is to have 1 DTX token to cover
the average value of the data from a
sensor for one week. This allows us

significant growth and price increases.

members joining the project and will be
vested in stages over 3 years, and the
unvested tokens return to the fund in
case the team member leaves the team.
The rest is distributed to current team
members and advisors.

We determined the corresponding
price per token by looking at the market
predictions in the previous section for
2024. By then we project to have 2.5
billion USD flowing through the platform
for 225 million sensors.

An additional 10% is reserved for the
platform fund. The majority of these
tokens will be used to allow enterprise
users to buy tokens using fiat currency
to ease adoption of these crucial users.
This will happen if no other solution via
exchanges can be found, and gradually
over the next 4 years as not to influence
the market.

2 500 000 000 USD/YEAR
225 000 000 SENSORS/YEAR
= 11.11 USD/SENSOR/YEAR

The average sensor has a value of ~12
USD per year, ~1 USD per month, or 0.25
USD per week and as such the value of 1
DTX token should equate initially to this
number. At an ETH price of 1,000 USD
/ ETH, 1 ETH will get you 4,000 DTX
tokens. During the token sale we doubled
the number of tokens, coming to a rate of
8,000 DTX/ETH.
We determined the maximum number of
tokens issued to be 225 million, the number
of sensors on the platform in 2024.
5% is reserved for team incentives over
the coming 4 years. The majority of this
team fund will be distributed to team

Our earliest supporters, who purchased
the old DATA token, got an equivalent
of their original ETH investment in DTX
tokens at a bonus rate of 60% to reward
them for their trust in the project. This
amounts to 6.5% in total.
30% or 67,500,000 tokens will be locked
up until January 1, 2021. Effectively
decreasing the available supply
significantly for the foreseeable future.
0.5% of the tokens has been reserved for
our bounty campaign.
On June 30, 2018 our main token
sale ended, resulting in a total sale of
67,137,510 DTX.

THE TEAM

SOME HISTORY
The DataBroker DAO was conceptualised at SettleMint in late 2016. The
dynamics of the market and the opportunities it brings immediately
sparked the development of the first proof of concepts.
After the first beta was completed in
February, it has been on the road to
tradeshows, pitch competitions and
blockchain challenges across the
world to test its market viability.
We have demoed the platform in
London, Dublin, Berlin, Singapore,
Dubai, Jeddah, Salt Lake City,
New York, Paris and Tokyo.
The result was astounding, people love
the idea and the product, and interest
from manufacturers and gateway
operators has been encouraging.
In June, the decision was made that the
project itself has too much potential to
not run with a dedicated team and that a
token sale was better suited to the project
than traditional VC rounds.

To give all of our early community the
chance to push the ecosystem forward,
we opted to do an early token sale in
September. With a very long lockup and
significant risk to the buyers, they truly are
our avid supporters. We raised a little over
960 ETH that has appreciated significantly
since then.
During this early token sale we were asked
by the Belgian regulator (FSMA) to give
more context and to determine if this token
sale was regulated by them. Assisted by
Willem Van de Wiele, crypto expert and
legal counsel at White & Case LLP we
provided the regulator with a complete
written and verbal overview of our project
and plans. At that time there were no
further questions nor actions required.

ABOUT SETTLEMINT
SettleMint is a Belgian/Dubai based startup focussed on creating tools
to make building blockchain applications easy by any IT team.
All the work and R&D is encapsulated
in a distributed middleware called Mint
which consists of 4 SDK. Notary, which
deals with anything related to recording
information on blockchain, but also IPFS
and swarm. Provenance for supply chain
tracking. Ballot box for voting and last but
not least Marketplaces for functionality
ranging from tokens to exchanges of
digitally traded products. All the while
supporting a wide range of public
and private blockchain solutions like
Ethereum, Bitcoin, Multichain, BigchainDB
and the Hyperledger projects.

27

Mint is used in the DataBroker DAO. The
marketplaces SDK and smart contract
templates are used for the marketplace
part of the project, while the Notary SDK
is used in the archiving and sharing of the
dat part of the project. A yearly licence
fee will be payed out of the revenue of the
platform as compensation.
DataBroker DAO is based out of the
SettleMint Dubai office.
