Abstract
Joint Ventures brings a much-needed change to the current digital content landscape. Our aim
is to create an economy that rewards every participant of the network, including publishers,
authors, commenters, advertisers, and moderators, while minimizing third-party commissions.
Joint Ventures plans to create a community-centered content economy. We discuss the
implementation of a transparent advertising revenue model in our ecosystem, which will allow
publishers to monitor real-time engagements with their content as well as helping advertisers to
get the maximum value out of their advertising budget.
Our first product is projected as a commenting solution, envisioned for the benefits of both
publishers and commenters. It is designed to increase user interaction with publishers and will
be available on websites along with mobile applications. That functional and unique user
interface will attract users and publishers, leading to increased user engagements. Joint
commenting solution will run on websites with millions of monthly visitors, enabling a new
token economy where publishers will be gaining Joint tokens based on the quality of the content
and commenters will be rewarded in regard to their contribution to the ecosystem.
On a typical commenting solution, on the other hand, the commenters are not rewarded fairly
for their contributions. Regarding money stream, the money flows from advertisers to
publishers, but not before the commenting system takes its own cut. Blockchain allows Joint to
easily calculate the value of individual contributions and distribute the rewards fairly and
transparently.
This will be followed with our other in-line product, Ad Exchange, to bring advertisers in to the
system. Content Discovery on the other hand, will enable publishers to acquire new visitors
from other Joint publishers, and Affiliate Platform, which will make it possible for publishers to
earn more revenue with referrals. All of these products will run on Joint token which is an
erc-20 based token that will be tradeable on multiple cryptocurrency exchanges.
Joint Ventures offers additional tools to publishers to create, reward, and grow their
community. Publishers will receive the major share of the advertising revenue. For advertisers,
our platform offers a competitive pricing strategy and an option to advertise at specific ad
placements for different time slots. Joint splits publishers’ rewards with commenters,
depending on the commenters’ level of interaction and value addition to the network.
Joint Ventures addresses the major fraud and middlemen commissions concerns of the
advertising industry by using blockchain technology. Blockchain technology promotes
transparency and creates a secure network for engagement. All the information about the
content economy will be accessible through blockchain explorers.

1.0 Introduction
The Internet is growing exponentially: with every passing day, users generate up to ​2.5
quintillion​ bytes of data. In simple terms, as much as 90% of all online content has been
generated in the past two years. With rapidly growing Internet adoption and affordable smart
devices, content creation will only continue to grow in the coming years.
However, the current content landscape is primarily dominated by a few major players, with
little to no transparency for the end-user. These middlemen make money from both publishers
and advertisers. According to data shared by ​Google​, the company shares with publishers up to
68% of the revenue generated by ads displayed alongside content that uses Google’s Adsense
service. This percentage drops down to 51% for the revenue-sharing structure used in Adsense
Search. Facebook has even less transparency than Google: Facebook’s Audience Network does
not provide revenue-sharing figures with publishers or the public in general. A close inspection
of all the major ad display networks makes it evident that these networks take a considerable
share of publisher earnings.
Joint is here to end the monopoly of the middlemen within the content monetization industry.
The content economy created by Joint splits revenue with every participant who adds value to
the network. Its operating principles are similar to that of Google and Facebook, in the sense
that it allows ads to be displayed on a publisher’s website, but Joint differs from the rest by
sharing maximum revenue with publishers as well as commenters. Unlike other platforms, Joint
is not just a platform that generates revenue, but also protects users’ personal data from being
collected by advertisers, through cookies or similar techniques.
Joint will use blockchain technology to maintain transparency within its ecosystem.
Additionally Joint will handle all operations and ensure a high ad-fill rate for its network
websites. The differentiating feature of Joint is that it will take less than 1% of the entire
advertising revenue for its operations, distributing the rest to our publishers and our network.
Our goal is to create a content economy that serves the network first.

1.1 Industry Overview
The past couple of years have witnessed an unprecedented growth in the content industry. A
growing user base and internet connectivity have contributed to the creation of hundreds of
thousands of content pieces every single day. In order to understand the size of the current
content industry, here are a few ​facts​:
●
●
●
●

Publishers upload more than 4 million hours of content to YouTube every day.
Users watch 5.97 billion hours of videos daily on YouTube.
More than 67.3 million posts are added to the Instagram platform on a daily basis.
Users post more than 4.3 billion messages on Facebook every day.

●
●

22 billion texts are sent globally on any given day.
Facebook has a daily active user base of 1.32 billion people, as of June 2017.

Internet users generate a massive 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day. It’s important to
note that internet adoption rates are on the rise, with nearly 46% of the global population
having internet access, a statistic that will only increase in the coming years.
While the exponential adoption of the internet and the vast amount of data created every single
day is overwhelming, it’s even more surprising that a major share of the entire content
landscape is under the control of only a few companies. According to the available ad revenue
data​:
●
●
●

Google has a 41% share in the global digital ad market.
Facebook comes second, with a digital ad market share of 16.6%.
Microsoft, Yahoo, and Twitter are other players, each having, respectively, 3.8%, 3.1%,
and 1.9% of market share.

Google and Facebook together capture $0.60 of every single dollar spent on digital advertising
today. What’s even more surprising is that Facebook is growing its ad share at an exponential
rate, with its ad revenue growing over 45% in the third quarter of 2016 in comparison to the
previous years’ same quarter. The two of these digital giants have put traditional media houses
to shame in terms of their online ad revenue.
For a world that relies heavily on the internet, the dominance of Google and Facebook isn’t
exactly good news. The internet, as an advertising option, has witnessed massive growth in the
past couple of years, and it has taken a very short time to overtake television as the favored ad
display channel. According to a report released by Magna, the research unit of IPG Media
brands, digital ad spending in 2017 generated an ad revenue of $204 billion against $178 billion
generated by the television industry globally. Considering the growing size of the online
advertisement market, firms such as Google and Facebook will only gain further digital
prowess in the future.

1.2 Future of Content Economy
Considering the current scale of content creation, the overall content economy is only in its
nascent stage. We’ll witness a growth in every single aspect of the content industry over the
next couple of years, especially with the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT). It is expected
that by the year ​2025​, more than 80 billion devices will connect to the Internet, producing
massive chunks of data, up to 180 zettabytes.
The amount of content generated online will grow exponentially. A few interesting facts
associated with online content generation:

●
●
●

Facebook users post up to 3.3 million ​content pieces​ (posts) every minute.
Yelp users post up to 26,380 reviews every single minute.
Over 5 million ​blog posts​ are published online every single day, as of January 2018.

We can only expect these numbers to grow in the future. Considering the huge amount of
content published every day, current online advertising revenue structures will witness a
gradual change in the coming years.
The online advertising industry will grow in proportion to the online content market. In 2018
itself, online and mobile advertising revenues are expected to grow up to 13% to reach $237
billion, with mobile being the primary driver of this growth. In terms of the digital ad market
share, Google and Facebook (together, often referred to as a “duopoly”) will continue to
dominate the global digital media landscape.
●
●

Google will control up to 80%, or $36.6 billion in revenue, of the total search ad business
in 2019, according to eMarketer.
Facebook will control up to 43.7%, or $23.9 billion in revenue, of the display market
business in 2019.

In the future, we can expect more revenue sharing services to show up globally. The transition
has already started, with major players such as Amazon.com Inc.’s ​Twitch​ following a revenue
sharing approach. Facebook has its Audience Network, and Google has been sharing ad
revenue with YouTube publishers for a long time. With these programs opening up for more
members in the coming years, the important question will be their choice of revenue sharing
model: What percentage of their ad revenues will these companies share? Inevitably, a content
economy that incentivizes users will become the norm.

1.3 Primary Challenges
A growing monopoly of the major advertising platforms has created unique challenges for
content curators (publishers). At the top is the current ad revenue division between advertising
platforms and publishers. Publishers have to share up to 50% of their advertising revenue with
advertising platforms, such as Facebook and Google. Some individual ​studies​ have shown that
the publisher’s share could even plummet to 40% in some cases.
Another major challenge faced by content publishers is the low CPM (cost per thousand
impressions) or CPC (cost per click) rate offered by advertising platforms. Out of a group of five
publishers​, one reported that the average CPM for Facebook video ads stood at $0.15. Another
publisher reported CPM of $0.75 for mid-roll ads, which are displayed 20 seconds after the
video starts playing. Similar earning reports are reported by huge groups of publishers, with
one of them making only $500 out of 20 million video views.

A lower revenue isn’t the only challenge in front of publishers. Some publishers have reported
irrelevant ads being played in between their videos, leading to a poor viewer experience.
Publishers have approached ad platforms with proposals to allow them to sell ad slots, but
these platforms are hesitant to give away their monetization control.
Adding to the list of problems is the poor quality insights offered by some major advertising
platforms. While most of these platforms allow publishers to track their daily, weekly, or
monthly earnings, they do not provide details about the percentage of views or impressions that
were considered eligible for payment. Some market experts even consider the lack of insights to
be part of the shady revenue practices followed by advertising platforms.
A growth in the adoption rate of ad blockers is another pressing concern among small
publishers. Ad blockers could lead to a ​decline​ of up to 16% of overall traffic received by small
publishers. It’s important to ​note​ that around 26% of internet users have ad blockers installed
on their systems, whereas only 10% of mobile viewers use ad blockers at the moment. These
figures are likely to increase in the coming years, creating more problems for medium or
small-scale publishers in the process.

1.4 Joint Content Economy
Joint is a content economy that goes beyond the current revenue structure of the online
publisher. We aim to create an ecosystem where every single contribution is valued, whether it
is the content created by publishers or active participation from commenters. At the same time,
we offer new revenue streams for publishers and their communities.
Blockchain technology has seen a massive adoption in the past couple of years, and it only
makes sense to create a system in line with the latest technology. Joint content economy is
leveraging the power of blockchain technology to create a transparent and secure ecosystem.
We understand that commenters play a crucial role with online publishers by actively
participating in the discussion and spreading content on the internet. Until now, very few
platforms reward them for their contribution, which seems unfair. Joint is ready to fill this gap
with its commenting solution that rewards network participants for their valuable
contributions. We have created an algorithm that calculates a commenter’s contribution using
multiple factors and then splits the rewards between publishers and commenters accordingly.
The next addition to our content economy will be a platform that puts both publishers and
advertisers on the same page. It will allow publishers to monetize their online content inside the
commenting areas. For advertisers, our platform will allow them to choose their placements and
time periods for which the ad is to be shown.
We’ll add an Ad Exchange feature to our content ecosystem, facilitating simple advertising
management. The Ad Exchange will show a list of available ad locations, depending on the

keywords and audience segments. The advertisers will have an option to book specific
placements for different time slots, ranging from a single day to a week or even longer. Joint
platform will use a dynamic pricing structure for these ad locations, taking into account
historical pricing data. Unlike other advertising platforms, advertisers will only pay for
advertisements that are viewed by visitors. All the transactions carried out on our platform will
require Joint tokens, which will be available during our crowdsale.
Joint will offer better control to network publishers. We’ll introduce a publisher pool, which will
act as an escrow containing Joint tokens. Publishers will receive payouts at the end of every
campaign. The calculation of payouts will be available on the public blockchain, allowing
publishers to see all payouts in the network.
Our goal is to evolve with the changing trends of the content industry so we’ll keep adding
features that benefit our content economy and its participants.

1.5 Vision and Mission of Joint
We understand that platform users are the ones who create the content that populates social
media and individual websites, and any single company shouldn’t control their earning
potential just because they control the advertising infrastructure. At the same time, we
understand the value added to the network by participants and commenters, simply by
commenting on or sharing the content.
Joint aims to create a fair advertising platform that puts the entire community at its center and
benefits every participant in the network. In our content economy, the publisher takes away the
major portion of overall revenue, with the rest being split among other participants. In addition
to the advertising revenue, we plan to introduce features that will allow publishers to monetize
their visitor data in future. Joint will provide self-service tools, allowing publishers to monetize
their content and understand viewer engagement better.
Our goal is to create a content ecosystem that values every participant of the network and aims
to reward them for their contributions.

2.0 Joint Platform
Joint is built around the principle that anyone adding a meaningful contribution to the network
should be rewarded. We hold community at the center of our entire ecosystem. Our structure
promotes a fair reward-sharing environment within its content economy. Unlike the traditional
advertising platforms, we have realigned the economic incentives associated with content
publishing and curation.
There are three primary components of the Joint platform:

1. Commenting System
2. Reward System
3. Ad Exchange

Commenting System
Our Commenting System is one of the first in our line of products. It is designed to promote
user engagement while offering extensive moderation control to publishers. Publishers can
install our commenting system by simply adding a Javascript. For mobile applications, we will
release the SDK, allowing seamless integration with mobile applications.
The Joint Commenting System comes with extensive features. We have included cross-site
notifications and multiple sign-in options in our Commenting System, offering a refined user
experience. Publishers can understand their audience’s engagement better with our detailed
analytics and reporting dashboard. We’ll add a monetization system in short order to our
platform, helping publishers grow their income.
Commenters will be able to use our mobile app to hold conversations. In addition to the app,
they will be able to leave comments on any online content piece throughout the web, even if the
websites are not a part of the Joint ecosystem.

Reward System
Our Reward System is how Joint separates itself from other commenting solutions. We have
created a system that rewards publishers for adding valuable content to the network, and at the
same time, it rewards commenters for active participation. The rewards are distributed among
publishers and commenters. In order to ensure a fair reward distribution among publishers and
commenters, we have introduced the concept of commenter and publisher profile scores.
The profile score is based on multiple parameters including active comment count, approved
comment count, rejected comment count, received reply count, upvote count, and ban count.
Every comment carries a value based on different factors such as read count, upvote count, and
reply count. The Joint Reward System focuses on the quality of contribution and uniqueness of
user activity, which helps it prevent fraudulent activities and block any get-rich-quick schemes.
Joint is responsible for the calculation and distribution of these rewards.
All of these calculations will be available publicly in our blockchain explorer.

Ad Exchange
Ad Exchange is part of the Joint content economy. It brings advertisers and publishers on a
single platform, with advertisers getting an option to display relevant ads on our publisher
network. We’ll launch Ad Exchange within 9 months of the beta launch of our platform.

Ad Exchange will work similarly to the other advertising platforms in terms of the allocation of
ad placements through bidding. Advertisers will bid for placements targeting specific
niches/keywords/demographics. Auctions will be automated, choosing the highest bid for a
particular placement. Ad Exchange will maintain historical price data for placements to provide
competitive pricing for advertisers. Furthermore, in order to maximize publisher earnings and
offer a reliable advertising income, ad placements will be sold for specific time periods instead
of using pay per click or pay per view matrices. Advertisers will have an option to reserve a
placement for a specific time slot in the future.
The advertisers will require Joint tokens to advertise on our network. They can purchase Joint
tokens with fiat money with an acceptable exchange rate. Purchased Joint tokens will not be
transferable to cryptocurrency exchanges, which means that advertisers will not be able to
manipulate Joint’s token price on exchanges.
Our Ad Exchange will prohibit the collection of user’s personal data such as email, phone
number, age, or device IDs. We are adtech veterans, and we know how to protect user data.

2.1 Value Proposition
Joint aims to create a content ecosystem that serves every participant fairly. In line with our aim,
we have created a content economy that rewards publishers for creating valuable information.
At the same time, we realize the value of active participation from community members and
split rewards in proportion to their value addition.

Publishers
●
●

●

●

Reward for content creation:​ Joint works on a fair reward system, which means that
publishers are rewarded for adding content to the network.
Reliable source of income: ​Our Ad Exchange system offers ad placement for specific
periods such as one day, one week, or even longer. Advertisers bid for different ad
placements for specific time slots instead of providing a CPC or CPM rate, thereby
providing publishers with a reliable source of income. Furthermore, we understand the
value of creating an excellent user experience, which is why we will show only native
ads on a publisher’s website.
Advanced engagement tracking: ​Unlike existing advertising platforms, we offer
in-depth details of user engagement. It will allow publishers to track user behavior such
as their preferred content type, engagement on different types of post, and similar
matrices. Publishers can then create content that will generate more rewards.
Maximum revenue sharing: ​Ad Exchange takes away only 1% of the publisher’s
revenue, allowing them to receive maximum rewards for their work. This fee is used to
cover adserver costs and to pay for third-party fraud tracking solutions.

Commenters
A community is active only when commenters participate in discussions or comment on
articles/videos. It’s only fair to reward them for their contribution, and that’s exactly what we
have done. Commenters will be rewarded for their contribution, with their rewards being
calculated at the end of every payout period. We have created a profile score algorithm for
commenters, which will evaluate their contributions. While the publishers will have the
authority to moderate comments, we’ll handle the reward payouts, ensuring that commenters
receive their fair share of rewards.

Advertisers
●

●

●

Pay for qualified views only: ​Advertisement fraud is a major concern for advertisers. In
2016 alone, ​bot fraud​ was believed to reach $7.2 billion globally. We have taken that
under consideration, and our Ad Exchange platform will ensure that advertisers will
pay only for qualified views. For example, if an ad placement is located at the bottom of
the page, it will count as a qualified impression only when the user scrolls down to the
bottom. Advertisers will receive a higher return on investment (ROI) for every dollar
spent on marketing.
Dedicated ad placements: ​Advertising in the right niche is the key to marketing success,
and as adtech experts, we understand that very well. With Ad Exchange, advertisers will
have an opportunity to bid on their favored ad placements for an extended period of
time.
Across the network visibility: ​In order to provide maximum visibility, Joint will display
advertisements throughout its network, allowing advertisers to market their
products/service websites to a wider audience base.

2.4 Market Comparison
We have a firm belief that our content ecosystem will gain mass adoption in the coming years.
Disqus is one of our primary competitors in the commenting solution segment. It has gained
vast popularity over the past couple of years, reporting over 50 million monthly comments as of
January 2018. Disqus allows monetization of content through native ads for publishers. It works
on 260,000 different sites according to Datanyze, with a current market share of 35.56%, behind
Facebook Comments (61.47%) only.
Joint is built to promote simplicity and transparency in its operating structure. We provide
every single detail related to the revenue generation on our blockchain, which isn’t the case
with Disqus. Publishers can generate consistent income with our advertising component, and at
the same time, monitor payout distributions on the blockchain. Similarly, advertisers can access
detailed reports of their advertising spending, with information drilled down to a single ad
placement level.
On top of it, our model rewards commenters for their valuable contributions, something unique
to Joint only. It not only rewards the commenters for participation but makes it easier for
publishers to build a community. Commenters can get access to exclusive content by spending
Joint tokens earned on the network.
Our experience in the adtech industry has allowed Joint to address all the problems faced by
every active participant of a content ecosystem.

3.0 Technical Overview
One of the primary challenges faced by the advertising industry is ad fraud. According to some
estimates​, ad fraud is likely to reach $50 billion by 2025, even on a conservative basis, and
without competent countermeasures, it may even reach $150 billion in the same period. The
current online advertising industry is shifting towards ​programmatic​ advertising, and it is
expected that by 2019, 83.6% of US display ad dollars will transact programmatically. However,
it is important to note that programmatic advertising is susceptible to fraud, and YouTube’s ad
controversy​ is a clear example of that.
A ​report​ conducted on behalf of the ANA points out that the US media ad buying ecosystem is
full of non-transparent business practices such as providing cash rebates to media agencies. The
advertisers have little to no control over their advertising campaigns, which in turn, affects their
ability to advertise their services to the target audience.

Having a team of adtech professionals has helped Joint understand these technological gaps,
and our platform comes with countermeasures. We have created a transparent monitoring
system, which allows every network participant to monitor everything happening on our
platform.

Use of Blockchain Technology to Improve Transparency
Advertisers
On Joint’s platform, advertisers will have complete control of their advertising spending,
starting with choosing ad placements and monitoring the publishers where their
advertisements are served. Joint will introduce a blockchain explorer for advertisers, which will
allow them to see their ad placements, visit statistics for publishers, and even see the ad
spending on any given placement. Furthermore, with Joint’s blockchain explorer for publishers,
advertisers will be able to see publisher payouts and other relevant data.

Publishers
We’ll launch a blockchain explorer for publishers, giving them access to their revenue payout
details and other channel reports. Joint will provide a detailed engagement analysis report,
allowing publishers to understand visitor engagement better. In addition to the total number of
views on their content, publishers will have access to commenters’ activity, including upvotes,
total comments, rejected comments, and approved comments. With detailed engagement info,
publishers can improve their community interaction and start publishing content as per their
community’s preference.

Commenters
Joint will introduce a blockchain explorer for commenters as well. Commenters will be able to
view their reward payouts, besides how the rewards are shared with publishers. Some other
details available on the explorer will include total comments made, rejected or approved
comments, and any upvotes or mentions from other community members.
All three of the network participants (advertisers, commenters, and publishers) will have access
to each other’s data, allowing them to keep track of the entire network.

3.1 Joint Token and Blockchain Platform
Joint token is based on ERC20 protocol, the Ethereum platform. Ethereum is an open source,
blockchain-based, distributed computing platform, using smart contracts to process different
tasks.

The Ethereum platform has gained popularity over the past couple of years because of its
support for smart contracts, ability to create decentralized autonomous organizations, and even
create other crypto assets using the platform. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies built
on Ethereum are Golem, Gnosis, and BAT (Basic Asset Token).
Here are but a few of the primary features of Ethereum that have propelled its adoption:
●

●

●

Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are computer programs that govern the transfer of
cryptocurrencies between two or more parties on the successful fulfilment of one or
more conditions. Ethereum allows programmers to run their custom smart contracts,
and it’s one of the primary reasons behind the rise of Ethereum as a platform for crypto
assets.
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): EVM, again, is a software that allows developers to
run a program on the Ethereum platform irrespective of the choice of coding language.
It makes Ethereum highly flexible, saving the trouble of learning or implementing a
single language.
Zero Downtime & Protection from DDoS Attacks: The decentralised nature of Ethereum
guarantees zero downtime, which is crucial for a consistent user experience. Ethereum
runs on a network of nodes (miners), which ensures round-the-clock access to network
services. Furthermore, the decentralised nature of Ethereum keeps it protected from
dedicated denial of service attacks (DDoS).

Joint’s Hybrid Blockchain Structure
Joint is using the Ethereum platform for its ability to execute smart contracts. We’ll use smart
contracts to distribute rewards between publishers and commenters. In order to boost
Ethereum’s security further, we’ll use oracles to execute smart contracts. Oracles allow
blockchains to access data outside their ecosystem, giving them the flexibility lacking in their
default structure.

3.2 In Terms of Decentralisation
Joint token and its transfers will be recorded and processed on the Ethereum mainnet.
Nevertheless, due to the centralised nature of the the existing internet servers, our commenting
solution will be partly running on centralised servers. To be specific, the comment widget that
will be provided for publishers will be cached by services for scalability. That is a front-end
project which communicates with comments storage by cloud services and API’s. This solution
will be getting and sending data and can be regarded as a medium for data exchange services
and end-users.
Our publisher web app, not to mention, will also be a centralised web-app which can only run
on web-servers. This will only be used by publishers to manage their user authorizations,

widget preferences, community and comment moderating purposes. Actions taken from these
related screens will affect the data storage.
Regarding the user wallet and rewarding system; user wallet addresses will be presented from
mainnet addresses, user's public account address and could be explored by any block-explorer
type application, like etherscan for instance. Rewarding system, on the other hand, is
respectively centralised in terms of calculation, yet decentralised when reward distribution is
the main concern. Meaning all the transaction can be monitored with the help of block
explorers, by pool transactions of token contract and if there will be a pool account, who get
how much amount and when.
ICO and Token contracts are also will be available to public on both operating mainnet and
Github.
Concerning the storage of the comments data into private nodes, our process is a little different
from similar comment or content projects. We provide a system to publishers for their usage
and our backbone will be used not only by publishers but their users as well. Adding a
publisher means thousands and hopefully millions of concurrent users that emit data for every
page load (by asking page's comments), writing comments, giving upvotes and replies etc.
Everyday those publishers will create new contents, get new user's attentions in addition to
current ones, finally sum of whole publishers the views, comments, upvotes, replies will hit our
infrastructure.
Handling these asymmetric data flow from different locations, diverse range of view and
writing habits will give us many technical problems to solve within the infrastructure. Due to
the need for high input and output dataflow performance, this part heavily depends on
distributed content delivery networks and temporary memory pools for inserts that runs on
cloud services. Due to high transaction fees and limited transaction size, data can also be
written into private nodes. As a first phase of our product, we will write data directly into the
database. Afterwards, intermediate services will write data into temporary memory cloud
service for high input, then emit it by a new service and write into database in time.

3.3 Token Usage
Joint token is the operating currency of our platform. Every transaction in our content economy
requires Joint token. For advertisers, they require Joint token to run their advertisements and to
participate in placement bidding. Publishers, on the other hand, receive payouts in the form of
Joint tokens. We have plans to list our token on a couple of token exchanges, allowing
publishers to exchange Joint tokens for other cryptocurrencies. In addition, we’ll integrate
third-party token exchange service in our platform for instant swap.

Use Cases of Joint Tokens
●
●
●
●
●

Launch advertising campaigns across Joint network publishers
Boost your comments to get more visibility
Send tips and donations to publishers and authors

Unlock paid subscriptions to exclusive contents

In order to avoid currency speculation, we have set a limit on the number of tokens that
commenters must have before initiating transfer/exchange by requests, currently set at a
minimum of 100 tokens. However, commenters will be free to use these tokens within our
content economy even without reaching the minimum threshold limit.

3.4 Token Launch/Sale
We’ll organize a token sale in order to raise funds for creating a fair content economy. Joint will
issue token after the completion of its launch sale. Token buyers will be able to transfer ETH to
Joint’s wallet. A detailed list of token sale instructions will be provided prior to the token
launch.

4.1 Joint Roadmap
Our goal is to use the proceeds of token sales for creating a global content ecosystem that
follows the principle of collective growth. In line with this goal, here is a roadmap we will
follow:

Joint Commenting System
Our Commenting System is a ready product, and we’ll start onboarding publishers
immediately after the token sale.
●
●
●
●
●
●

April 2018: ​The first group of publishers will join our platform in April 2018. We have
done the background work to ensure the onboarding of popular publishers.
August 2018:​ Finishing backend transformation into cloud-based microservices to
handle growth.
September 2018: ​We’ll release our WordPress plugin for testing and mass
implementation. Our plan is to release a beta version and improve it per user feedback.
November 2018​: We’ll release our block explorer apps for listing reward-related
transactions and contents.
December 2018: ​By December 2018, we will launch our own mobile apps.
February 2019​: We’ll introduce another feature, Content Recommendations, which will
show relevant content recommendations from the website accessed by commenters.
March 2019​: We’ll add a subscription option for commenters, allowing them to subscribe
to exclusive content from our network.

Joint AdExchange - Q2 2019
We will launch AdExchange platform within the second quarter of 2019. It will allow
advertisers to secure ad placements throughout our network.

Content Discovery - Q3 2019
Content Discovery is another project that we’ll add to our content ecosystem. Its main function
is to allow users to discover new content throughout our network. It will show suggestions
depending on users’ reading habits and preferences. For publishers, our Content Discovery
feature will offer an opportunity to gain more visitors from Joint’s network. Publishers will be
able to market their content on our platform by spending Joint tokens. Our Content Discovery
platform will be live by the third quarter of 2019.

Joint Affiliates - Q4 2019
Joint Affiliate is a program targeted towards the expansion of our network. We’ll introduce an
affiliate platform, allowing publishers to earn commissions for generating sales and leads for
advertisers.

4.2 Future Forecast
Our goal is to become a content ecosystem that grows with the needs of our community. It is
our belief that if we create a solution that addresses all the real world issues faced by publishers,
advertisers, and network participants, we will be able to expand our user base manifold.
As of now, our focus is to launch our Commenting System in the immediate future, allowing
the entire network to be rewarded for their efforts. Our next goal is to onboard at least 10,000
publishers in 2019. In the long term, we will continue to build other blockchain platforms for
publishers.
Our approach to reward every participant in a content ecosystem will allow us to gain mass
acceptance in the future.
