Mirai: A-look into the future

Mirai Payments: Decentralized payment integrations
Mirai AR: Decentralized Augmented reality platform

ABSTRACT
Mainstream adoption is an issue that is relevant for all cryptocurrencies at this
point in time. We are on the cusp of the blockchain revolution. Where all
industries will be affected by blockchain technology and none will remain
unchanged. There are obstacles that have slowed the momentum of adoption.
This Whitepaper details the development paths that Mirai will follow in an
effort to achieve mainstream adoption. Mirai will apply key strategies
designed to further this goal, based around the conviction that mainstream
adoption will come from ease of use and the underlying blockchain technology
need never be considered by the end user.
This tenet will be applied to the development of the Mirai AR apps for Android
and iOS. The apps will be fully functional with zero knowledge of blockchain or
cryptocurrency. MRI will be used, bought or earned in the same manner that
other games might offer gold or gems.
Incentives in the form of MRI and social rewards will be available to every
user, through the option to create and add content to the platform. Again, the
focus here is on ease of use, with drag and drop assets and intuitive editing
tools. This includes the ability to link in websites, images and videos into 3d
content.
For those not afraid to delve deeper, advanced editing options will also be
available.
For developers, coding options will be available Allowing for the creation of
mini games, interactive displays and app extensions.
On all levels, there is incentive to contribute to the network and earn MRI.

1. MIRAI : A look into the future
There is no doubt that blockchain technology is increasingly gaining traction in the
business world. There are clear advantages for companies that adopt blockchain
technology in providing enhanced security, transparency, increased speed, efficiency,
greater automation and reduced costs. Some of the largest and most respected
companies in the world are now developing blockchain networks.
Yet blockchain based cryptocurrency has not enjoyed the same level of positive
sentiment. The prevailing views on cryptocurrency range from ‘too difficult’ to ‘too
volatile.’ Opinions are also colored by the volume of reports on cryptocurrency fraud,
theft and other illegal uses. It is a testament to the resilience of blockchain technology
that cryptocurrency has not only survived, but is still moving towards mainstream
adoption.
There are currently approximately 24 million bitcoin addresses with a non-zero balance in
existence. Many users own multiple non-zero balance addresses. Even with the
unrealistic assumption of 1 non-zero address per user, the current number of bitcoin
users stands at 0.312% of the global population. Removing lost addresses and multiaddress users, this figure could be as low as 0.15%. With a current global adoption of
between 0.15% to 0.312% it is clear that there is a massive potential for exponential growth
in adoption rates and value.
There is a large core group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts that believe in the future of
cryptocurrency as a decentralized system that cannot be controlled by any one country or
entity and cannot be stopped by laws or central authorities. These people believe that
responsibility for an individuals money, should rest with that person alone. From this core
group has grown a much larger group of early adopters. Businesses, investors and
speculators that see the potential in cryptocurrency. This group heralds the beginning of
mainstream adoption, but
there are still major obstacles:
- The perception of blockchain technology as something that is difficult to understand.
- The perception that the main purpose of cryptocurrency is to enable fraud and illegal activities.
This paper describes Mirai Coins strategies for reducing the effect of these obstacles and
provides a look into the future of Mirai Coin.

2. Core Values
At it’s core, Mirai is a payment coin, developed with the potential to gain a position
amongst the top alt coins. This core value remains unchanged. Mirai will continue to
function as a payment coin with a fast and stable network built on masternode and proof
of stake protocols.
Development will continue at an accelerated pace with a focus on website, app, API and
payment platform integrations. Business to business (B2B and business to consumer (B2C
tools will be developed for easier blockchain integration and advanced statistical analysis.
The final goal is to provide a suite of tools and applications that require almost zero
technical knowledge to launch, use and understand. This branch of development will be
named Mirai Payments.

2.1 Mirai Coin Information
Mirai coin is a blockchain based masternode and proof of stake coin. Blocks are generated
every 3-5 minutes with reward of 40 coins per block, reducing over time.
Masternode holders are rewarded 70% (28 coins) of the block reward for supporting the
network and processing transactions. This network will be invaluable in creating a stable
transaction processing base for Mirai AR.
Proof of Stake rewards users that hold MRI in their wallets. This also expands the
capabilities of the network by providing additional transaction verification. Proof of stake
rewards holders, proportional to the amount they hold. The proof of stake reward amount
is fixed at 10 coins (reducing at specific block numbers). Holders of more coins receive
rewards sooner with a minimum staking time (maturity) of 24 hours.

2.2 Coin Supply
Mirai is a very low supply coin. The current supply of Mirai is 2,950,000 coins. 1,200,000 of
these were sent to an unrecoverable burn address effectively removing them from
circulation, leaving a current true circulating supply of 1,750,000 coins.
The maximum supply of Mirai is 16 million coins. Coin supply is expected to reach 15.7
million coins (14.5 million circulating) in the year 2099.
Mirai Supply Over Time

3. Dual Development Paths
Mirai launches its vision for the future of Augmented Reality with the creation of this
whitepaper. The Mirai development team will be expanded to enable dual development
paths that complement each other. This will allow for the integration of key features
from Mirai Payments through Augmented Reality apps which will be created under the
brand name Mirai AR. Features from the Mirai (Payments team will be applied in Mirai
AR, while Mirai AR will provide greater volume and liquidity to Mirai coin.
*Mirai Payments and Mirai AR will simultaneously use Mirai - MRI currency.

4. Augmented Reality
Augmented reality is the merging of the physical world with the digital. A relatively new
technology, that has previously been impeded by the technological limits of mobile
devices. Until recently mobile devices didn’t have the spatial awareness to map out
surface planes in 3D which is one of the basic requirements in providing a seamless
augmented reality experience.
Augmented reality came to the forefront with the release and viral uptake of Pokemon
Go©. Pokemon Go© however, barely scratched the surface of what is technologically
possible with augmented reality. The potential applications for augmented reality are not
just limited to games. In fact augmented reality has the potential to be as revolutionary
and disruptive as blockchain technology.
Augmented reality enables mobile devices to function as a hand held portal, offering a
freedom from the constraints of the screen dimensions. With wearables such as
augmented reality glasses, this freedom is expanded. It is estimated that the global
augmented and virtual reality market revenue could reach as high as $215 billion by 2021
with augmented reality receiving an estimated 65% market share.

4.1 Augmented Reality Games
One of the most popular applications of augmented reality is in the field of mobile
gaming. Of all the creative markets, the majority of new projects consist of augmented
reality games.

4.2 Augmented Reality Education
Education through augmented reality offers an unprecedented level of interaction.
Various studies performed by the education industry have shown that interactive
augmented reality applications have decreased learning times by as much as 60% while
increasing applied skills and retention by over 70%. For non-creative markets, augmented
reality education is second to only one other field: The automotive, aerospace and
manufacturing industry.

4.3 Augmented Reality in Manufacturing
Recent statistics show that the manufacturing industry is leading the way in terms of both
augmented reality application development and spending in the augmented reality sector.
This is not surprising considering the results of several studies performed by the industry.
An aircraft manufacturer was able to decrease the maintenance time required to identify
and replace specific faulty parts on aircrafts from 300 hours to just 60 hours with the
addition of an augmented reality support application. Other studies indicate similar results.

4.4 Augmented Reality in Entertainment and Events
In the entertainment industry, augmented reality can be used as tool to enable
enhanced interaction through visual cues, information and additional media.

4.5 Augmented Reality in Retail
A very promising field is the application of augmented reality in the retail sector.
Spending on research and development is experiencing massive growth in this industry.
Augmented reality in the retail sector offers all of the benefits of the internet in
providing sales information and advertising opportunities with the additional benefit of
being available on site at retail locations with the use of geo-tagging and visual markers
such as QR codes and specific image recognition.

4.6 Augmented Reality in Social Media
Augmented reality in social media provides an unprecedented level of interaction and
personalization. Social media content can be posted online and also on location. Photos
from a location could be shared so other users, either can see those images in augmented
reality when they visit the same location. This also impacts the retail sector with the ability
to view media on location at retail venues such as ratings and images being visible above
restaurants and cafés in augmented reality.

4.7 Augmented Reality in Advertising
The benefits of augmented reality in the advertising industry are well recognized.
Placement of advertising material and interactive displays at key events in augmented
reality provides a unique opportunity to combine location based advertising with detailed
statistics and targeting normally only associated with online advertising. Advertising on a
billboard location in the real world requires knowing statistics of passing traffic, but data is
limited and static. In augmented reality a billboard can be targeted to a specific market (ie.
18-29 year old, male and results of the advertising campaign easily tracked to provide
customer acquisition cost.

Note: The above sectors that show potential for augmented reality development are by
no means an exhaustive list. There are hundreds of sectors that can benefit from
augmented reality and only a select few have been chosen to demonstrate the potential.

5. Mirai AR
With the launch of this whitepaper we also announce the early stages of development of Mirai AR; A decentralized
augmented reality platform. Mirai AR is a website and accompanying app that will be launched on Android and IOS. It will
provide anyone with the ability to add content to Mirai’s augmented reality world using a simple drag and drop interface.
A library of 3D content will be provided by Mirai. The library will consist of standard assets that can be placed in the
augmented world, dragged, dropped, resized and reshaped. Floating text and media planes allow online content to be
called and displayed in the augmented world.
Any user can access the edit functions to become a Mirai Content Creator. Content Creators are paid royalties in MRI
coins with an algorithm calculating rewards based on popularity/ view count, user ratings, time spent viewing
and advertising revenue generated.
In addition to earning MRI as a Mirai Content Creator, Mirai will also launch the Mirai AR Asset Marketplace. Asset
Creators can upload unique 3D assets to the Asset Marketplace. These assets can then be used by Content Creators in
return for a preset percentage of the royalties generated by the Content Creator at any location that they use the asset.
Content creators can access the edit functions on location. They can also use geotagging combined with a 360 degree
view image, uploaded to the Mirai AR advanced content creation website. The website will provide a more advanced set
of tools for precise positioning of 3D content and the ability to add code for more advanced interactions, mini games,
presentations and displays.

Example use cases:
1. On a walking trail, you come across a fork in the
path with two different directions available and a
sign for ‘Lookout’ in one direction and ‘waterfall’ in
the other. Your Mirai AR app alerts you that there is
AR content available. You open the app and use the
camera to scan the sign, along with geo-tagging, the
sign acts as a marker for correct placement of AR
content.
In augmented reality, you see reviews for both the
waterfall location as well as the lookout. You can see
user images for both locations, how long each trail
takes, cautions, facilities, effort ratings. You
discover that the waterfall trail does not provide a
good view and offers no facilities whereas the
lookout provides a complete view of the waterfalls,
barbeque and toilet facilities and a picnic area.
2. You walk into a shopping center/mall. You need a specific store, so you open the Mirai AR app
and type in the store name. A pillar of light appears at the store location and floor arrows direct
you there. Along the way a giant augmented reality lego man appears to tell you there is 30% off
lego at the toy store.

3. Sitting at a cafe, you open the Mirai AR app and find there is an augmented reality remote
control car and race track in front of the cafe. There is also a giant connect four game with an
open invite to play. You click the invite and play connect four against someone else in the cafe. You
win the game and receive a 20% discount voucher off your next café purchase.

6. Mirai AR Features
On launch of the Mirai AR app for Android and IOS users will receive an airdrop of MRI to allow
them access to premium features of the app. The majority of features will be free with paid
options where a free model would disadvantage asset creators.
Mirai AR Feature list summary:
- Asset marketplace
- Advanced editing website.
- Create augmented reality content and get paid

washer/ video card/ baby seat in AR. *paid
- Much more…

7. Mirai AR Marketing
Mirai AR will be a freemium app. While it operates on blockchain technology and offers users
the chance to earn a share of the revenue generated by the Mirai AR platform, all functions
related to Mirai cryptocurrency will operate in the background and remain unobtrusive. Users
don’t need to think about cryptocurrency at all, but have the opportunity to delve deeper if
they wish.
We believe this is essential to gaining the largest possible user base and achieve viral success.
Mirai will make strategic use of advertising, social media influencers, blockchain conferences
and partnerships to increase awareness of the Mirai AR app. Sponsorship of events and
creation of event related augmented reality experiences.
3D content tutorials and import tools will be provided to ease the transition for Asset creators.
3D model,game development websites and tech conventions will be targeted in an advertising
campaign.
In app events targeted at user retention.

8. Mirai AR Revenue Model
Mirai AR will have a number of revenue streams, including:
- Paid advertising will be available in the augmented reality space. This can be targeted at a
specific audience, location or event. It will be possible to attach advertising to specific
user content (subject to our advertising best practices guidelines).
- Product placement advertising will be available.
- Animated reality advertising opportunities: That model next to the coke machine calling
you over.
- Agreements with mainstream and blockchain companies will raise revenue through paid
services: Mirai created interactive content for events, tourist locations, festivals.
- Paid app features include advanced education content, hire an expert, removal of
advertising.

8.1 Dividing Revenue
Mirai Ar is an incentive driven app. Every user is a potential contributor that can earn
MRI through their contributions. Revenue will be divided as follows:
60% of revenue is divided amongst contributors.
40% of revenue is retained by Mirai to cover operating costs and development.
This will be reviewed frequently and skewed in favour of contributors as mainstream
adoption is increased.
Revenue assigned to contributors will never be less than 60%
Revenue assigned to Mirai will never be more than 40%
A reserve of MRI will be created from dev funds in the early release stages to pay
contributors while the advertising network is being established.
