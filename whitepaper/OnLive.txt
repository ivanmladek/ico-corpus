INTRODUCTION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM

The On.Live platform allows users to provide almost any service to anyone from anywhere and
become a broadcaster and earn money for presenting valuable content in various business models
(Pay Per View, Pay Per Minute, In-Stream Payments).
The main goal of the Project is to be the market leader in the live advising platform market
where the customer will always ﬁnd a team of specialists and valuable content on hand to
provide easy access to their knowledge. The On.Live platform creates a large blockchain
ecosystem enabling the sale of services through live broadcasts and place for stream content live
and sell it to a wide audience at aﬀordable prices.
On.Live is a project that brings three marketplaces into one product:Live broadcast (1:
many), Live Services (1:1, 1:8), Transcoding and Relay Node market.
We use blockchain to control transactions and settlements (tokens) and we have our own platform
for real-time communication, trading and dealings.
Live Services - The marketplace gives service providers the ability to sell their services to anyone
who needs them. It enables scheduling of live broadcasts, broadcasting in HD quality in real time,

This applies to many industries - Lawyers, Doctors, Weight Loss, Job seeking, Fitness,
Education, Insurance, Language Learnings, Financial advice, etc.

Live Broadcasts - enables service providers to deliver HD live broadcasts to unlimited numbers of
viewers, billing on pay-per-minute and pay-per-view models and scheduling future live broadcasts.
Our powerful B2B and B2C tech can be used on a number of verticals, including Workshops,
Practical tutorials, Sports, Conferences, TV, SVOD, Music, eLearning, Wellbeing, Charity, etc.
Transcoding and Relay Node - Thanks to decentralized marketplace of Transcoding and Relay
Nodes services, all network users have the possibility of making money by utilizing their
computing power for relay and transcoding operations. On.Live transactions protocol inducted into
livestreams opens the possibility of conﬁrming transactions when transmitting video streams.
Network nodes perform real, useful work instead of useless computations as it usually
happens in a standard Proof of Work based blockchains.

On.Live provides a broad range of possibilities:

1.

COMPANY DATA

Anyone with access to the internet may be a user of the platform: individuals (e.g. doctors, lawyers,
teachers, consultants), companies (e.g. law ﬁrms, medical and educational centres, insurance
companies), large enterprises (e.g. TV stations, advertising networks, event companies).
It is an excellent way for users to quickly – and without leaving home – use the help of numerous
professionals or take part in live events taking place all over the world. Viewers will ﬁnd a lot of
interesting content. It is a complementary system, where users are charged only for the actually
delivered services.
On.Live is equipped with relevant tools and functionalities to satisfy the needs of both
broadcasters and viewers. Two communication paths allow for the creation of public broadcasts,
addressed to large groups of viewers, and private, one-on-one consultations. Each of these options
enables authors to monetize their activities while delivering high-quality services to users.
The commercial success of On.Live is driven mainly by the steady growth of new Buyers and
Sellers. Other Key Performance Indicators of the business are Cost of Customer Acquisition (CAC),
Recurring Cost of Service (RCS) and Customers Lifetime Value (CLTVcomplete) which could be
interpreted as the discounted value per Customer.

2.

PROJECT SUMMARY

What is the market?
The global video streaming market for live services was valued at $30.9 Billion in 2015 and is
estimated to grow at a CAGR of over 16% from 2017 to 2024 to reach $123.2 billion in 2024 and we
are going to ﬁll in the gap in the form of live services and paid public broadcasts.
Such strong market growth is anticipated on account of the rising number of online users,
technological advancements, the development of high quality content and an increase in
subscriptions for various streaming channels.
The global digital transformation consulting market was worth around $23 billion to consultants in
2016. Currently standing at twice the size of the UK’s overall consulting industry, and ﬁve times the
size of the consulting market in China, the report from the research and analyst ﬁrm shows that the
global digital transformation market now accounts for £2.26 billion of the UK’s entire £7.31 billion
consulting market.

So you have heard about this site or you have been to it, but you cannot
ﬁgure out what it is or what it can do. MTA web directory is the simplest
way in which one can bid on a link, or a few links if they wish to do so. The
link directory on MTA displays all of the links it currently has, and does so in
alphabetical order, which makes it much easier for someone to ﬁnd
they are looking for if it is something speciﬁc and they do not want to go
Hide
through all the other sites and links as well. It allows you to start your bid at
the bottom and slowly work your way to the top of the list. With a very low
costing starting bid of just $1, you are guaranteed to have a spot in MTA’s
successful directory list. When you would like to increase your bid to one of
the top positions, you have to know that this would be a wise decision to
make as it will not only get your link to be at a higher point in the directory
but it will also give you a chance to have your site advertised with the rest of
the top ten on the home page of the website. This means that when visitors
come to MTAweb.com, your site will be one of the ﬁrst things they see. In
other words, you stand a great chance at getting a comeback to your site

It is important that you buy links because the links are what get you the

COMPANY DATA

The Transcoding Services Marketplace is a fully
TRANSCODING
MARKETPLACE

decentralized, open marketplace for transcoding
services.

The Transcoding Marketplace is a place where Transcoders place their transcoding oﬀers on the
Transcoding Services Marketplace. The oﬀer speciﬁes the parameters such as formats they could
transcode to and from, guaranteed capacity (simultaneous users served with a given quality),
Transcoding Initial Fee etc.
Transcoding Initial Fee has to be allocated by the Broadcaster before the streaming starts. This fee
covers Transcoder costs in case no one joins the broadcast.
Broadcasters can also place their orders for transcoding services if there are no transcoders’ oﬀers
that meet their requirements. Transcoders could apply for the broadcasters’ orders.

2.

PROJECT SUMMARY

The business model behind how the Transcoding Services Marketplace works is described in the
“Broadcasting process - step by step” section below.
A Transcoder can refuse to process the content that violates local law, but Broadcaster is free to
choose other Transcoder in that case.

COMPANY DATA

The platform creates a complementary system within which users pay only for the services they have
beneﬁted from. The principles of monetisation diﬀer depending on the model and type of service:
In the case of public broadcasts for a broad range of viewers the service provides two basic
solutions in terms of collecting fees:

PAY PER VIEW

PAY PER MINUTE

Also known as „Access Payment” or
„Ticket” is a primary choice for sport
matches or music concerts, etc.

Live broadcasts where users are being charged for
every minute of a show.
A perfect choice for interactive events, lectures, etc.

“Pay Per View” (PPV) – per viewing speciﬁc content where access for the customers depends on
the entry fee, called the “ticket” enabling handing payments right in the broadcast window. In other
words, viewers pay for each programe that they choose to access. This is the model followed by
iTunes. Having ONL Tokens is all you need.
On.Live oﬀers an integrated payment system to quickly handle viewer transactions from PPV. This
is accomplished right in the video player window from an integrated paywall. The purchaser does
not have to exit the player page to complete the transaction, which might reduce conversions.
Broadband access rates are set individually by each broadcaster. For example a broadcaster could
charge 1 ONL for every access to the event.
“Pay Per Minute” (PPM) - per each minute of the viewed content.
This option allows the customer to pay per minute, which is the actual time of the live broadcast.
For example, the customer connects with a person who needs help but he does not know how long
the actual explanation will last. The customer sets a payment per minute and he settles for the
time he spent on the conversation.

On.Live Whitepaper 2018 ©

COMPANY DATA

Subscription Plans

Netﬂix is the most common example of this model. The customer pays a regular (typically monthly)
fee, and gains buﬀet-style, all-you-can-eat access to a live broadcasts and library of video content
from the content creator channel. Each site user can run this option and oﬀer access to their
content in the monthly subscription model.
The subscription model of video monetisation can be highly successful. Looking, for example, at
lucrative services like Netﬂix and HBO, it becomes clear that they reap major proﬁts using it.
At On.Live, the same in-window payment system for one-time transactions can handle
subscriptions as well. Videos — either live or on-demand — can be accessible via either payment
option. For example, a language course consisting of 11 live lessons or classes with a ﬁtness
trainer.

Tips / Donations
The platform oﬀers also a whole range of additional ways of making proﬁt such as oﬀer systems
and booking systems, loyalty programs and options to receive tips or donations during broadcasts.
Users have the ability to tip during live broadcasts. This provides an additional source of income
for broadcasters. If the user is satisﬁed with the service he received during an individual live
session, he or she will be able to hand over the tip after completing it. Broadcasters who broadcast
live can also receive tips from their fans during the broadcast.

Advertising*
Creators will be able to make proﬁt from advertisements thanks to the built-in system. This is the
model broadcast television utilises. Cable TV relies on a blend of subscription fees and advertising
for support. YouTube uses ad-supported viewing to pay its bills, as do countless other video
services.
For On.Live video providers, advertising can be a potentially lucrative source of income. However, it
is important to remember that attracting a large viewership is essential for advertising. When the
customer can bring in a large audience, advertising can be quite eﬀective.
The best ad-supported programmes tailor their advertising to the audience at hand via keywords
or even custom selection. On.Live has integration with VAST standard video ad services. However,
sponsorships and direct advertising are very important. It may be more lucrative for the customer
to reach out to speciﬁc businesses in the industry to oﬀer them the opportunity to reach a highly
speciﬁc audience.
* This functionality is designed for a centralized version. This is a separate large marketplace to
design. We will make every eﬀort to decentralize this functionality as well.

OTHER MARKETPLACES AND PLATFORMS

Transcoders and Relay Nodes may build their own decentralized or centralized platforms for
speciﬁc, aggregated and categorized content distribution, where they can oﬀer broadcasts from
the On.Live Network. For example, a platform that oﬀers online medical consultation provided only
by veriﬁed doctors. Such platforms can also provide additional services for their audience, or
simply use On.Live Network as a supplement for their main services. The On.Live Team
continuously develops its technology for voice, video, communication between participants,
convenient billing, ﬁle sharing, and so on. The code already prepared can be used to build tools
tailored to diﬀerent industries.
The ﬁt.ﬁt is the best example of the use of On.Live technology. This marketplace services
nutritionists, ﬁtness trainers and doctors who oﬀer their services in a convenient way through the
platform. Customers can easily ﬁnd a specialist in their chosen ﬁeld who will prepare a dedicated
diet plan for them, develop workouts at the gym or at home or advise on medical issues.
Participants of this platform will use as a unit to settle ONL tokens and technology developed by
the On.Live team. We pan to public this project a few months after ICO.

ONL TOKEN INTRODUCTION

ONL Token is a standard ERC20 token deployed on the Ethereum network. It has a predeﬁned,
limited supply, is easily integrable with both decentralized and traditional exchanges.
Its total supply is equal to 59,725,382 ONL and is divisible up to 18 decimal places. No additional
tokens will be mined or minted in the future.
In the ﬁnal version (On.Live Network version 1.0), ONL token is a cryptocurrency that allows instant
and costs free transactions inside the On.Live Network.
ONL tokens serve as a sole payment method inside the On.Live Network. Users use ONL
tokens for paying to the Broadcasters for the content they provide or for one-to-one online
video-services, to Transcoders for transcoding services and to Relay Nodes for broadcasts.
On.Live Network is a complete economic market. The more users join the On.Live Network the
higher ONL tokens utility is. ONL token can be also used as a value transfer mechanism between
users inside the On.Live Network and on sites that use On.Live technology and that are part of the
On.Live Network (eg ﬁt.ﬁt).

PROJECT SUMMARY

Content authors will be able to easily make a proﬁt with the numerous tools provided by the
platform. Also, they will receive active system support in acquiring new customers for their
services.
Monetisation principles vary depending on the model and type of services oﬀered.
• Individual consultations may be oﬀered free of charge or for a ﬁxed charge agreed between the
author and user. The rates may be negotiated on a case-to-case basis. The platform comes with a
billing and escrow system, which secures the charge for the duration of consultation. This gives
the author the conﬁdence that the user will pay for the service, whereas the user is certain that
they will be provided with high-quality consulting.
• For public broadcasts addressed to a large audience, the site provides two basic “Pay Per View”
solutions, where access for customers is subject to an initial fee, the so-called “ticket”. There is no
time limitation for that. Also available is a “Pay Per Minute” solution, which allows for charging
the viewer for each started minute of broadcast.
The system also provides other monetization options such as: In-Stream Payments, Advertising,
Tips / Donations, Subscription Plans, etc.

V11 ESCROW

What is Vault 11?
On our Platform the safety of your tokens is paramount.
That is why we created “Vault 11” - a high proﬁle escrow
solution designed to protect ONL tokens and encrypted
using the latest cryptographic technology.
https://v11.on.live/

How does it work?
Say you want to have your one-to-one online guitar lesson
through the On.Live Platform. You log in, book available time of
your class, and make ONL payment. Your tokens do not directly go
to your guitar teacher as they are deposited in Vault 11. They are
now in escrow which means that they go to the seller only if the
service is successfully completed. Otherwise you will get your ONL
back. Therefore, Vault 11 ensures everyone gets what they are due
at essentially the same time.

COMPANY DATA

ONL LOCK IN V11 ESCROW

V11 is used to lock up certain amount of tokens not assigned for Pre-ICO and ICO as well as all
funders tokens released on ICOs. The holders of lock-up tokens cannot sell them until precisely
deﬁned date. This mechanism is deployed to insure steady rise of ONL at exchanges and to
prevent abrupt price changes in case of large pools of tokens put up for sale. For instance, all
tokens assigned to founders are issued with at least 60 months lock-up period with the last
tranche scheduled to be released in April 2023. Tokens envisaged for marketing, advisors and legal
counsel of the platform are also rigidly locked in tranches with release dates stretching up to 2021.
Vault 11 solution oﬀers transparent view on all locked-up pools of tokens. Every On.Live user can
be sure that none of the tokens locked in vault will be transferred until applicable period is over. To
further prevent depreciation of value of tokens in hand of our contributors, not sold ONL’s will
never enter the circulation. All unbought tokens will be burned! After token burn total number of
tokens available on the market decreases and, as a consequence, the value of each individual
token may increase.
Vault 11 adds all important safety, transparency and insight to ONL currency system. On.Live
founders are strongly committed to long run success and grow of the platform, and believe that
Vault 11 solution greatly adds to present On.Live credibility expressed widely by contributors and
the community.
For November 2018 there is total 34 856 546 ONL Lock in V11.on.live. You can always verify
status of lock tokens on address 0x591191cdf58643578422cbe3f4bb0decd966efdf and check

TRANSCODING FREEZE & HEDGE

COMPANY DATA

Apply to Transcoding Freeze & Hedge at https://v11.on.live/

One of On.Live’s main business goals is to create decentralized, power-sharing system which allows
anyone, beginning from individuals, up right to large datacenter operators to contribute any free
or dedicated computing power resources to broadcasts and live video transcoding within the
On.Live network. A dedicated Freeze and Hedge program based on ONL virtual currency is part of
this endeavor. Transcoding Freeze & Hedge Program is now open to all our current and future
users and contributors. User tokens delegated to program will serve the purpose of securing
development of Transcoding Nodes network, allowing for higher quality, stable and uninterrupted

If you hold ONL tokens in your Ethereum Wallet you are eligible to freeze them by opening a
deposit for 3, 6 or 12 months. Once the deposit period is over, you will receive your tokens back
and an additional ONL bonus tokens. Such bonus depends on the deposit period (The minimum

COMPANY DATA

Example: You have 5,000 ONL tokens in your Ethereum Wallet, open a deposit for 3 month, and
transfer your ONL tokens to our special escrow multisig account (read more about Vault 11 at
on.live). After 3 month you receive your 5.000 ONL tokens back plus a bonus of additional 250 ONL
tokens.
All deposits in program are protected against loss of value. If during a deposit period, a volume
weighted average market price of ONL token falls below a market price as of the ﬁrst day of the
deposit period, On.Live will hedge you against such risk. In such a case, you will receive additional
ONL recovery tokens calculated pursuant to the below formula:

(T×P1) - (T×P2)
P1

where:

“T” means a number of deposited ONL tokens
“P1” means ONL token price as of the ﬁrst day of the deposit period
“P2” means a volume weighted average market price of ONL tokens during the deposit period
In addition to the ONL recovery tokens you will also receive the additional ONL bonus tokens.
Example: You have 5,000 ONL tokens in your Ethereum Wallet, open a deposit for 3 month, and
transfer your ONL tokens to our special escrow account (read more about Vault 11 at on.live). On
the deposit open day ONL token market price is USD 0.20. During the deposit period a market
price of ONL tokens falls and, as a result, the volume weighted average market price of 1 ONL
token during the deposit period is USD 0.10. Your loss shall by recovered by additional 2500
recovery ONL tokens.

(5000×0.20) - (5000×0.10)
0.20
In addition, you will receive additional 250 ONL bonus tokens for 3 months deposit from ﬁrst
example . So you will get it together 250 ONL for deposit + 2500 ONL recovery tokens if the price
falls. Please note that the amount of recovery tokens is always calculated at the end of the deposit
period and is weighted by the average turnover throughout the deposit period.
Enter the https://v11.on.live/ and apply for to the program. Minimum deposit applicable for
Transcoding Freeze & Hedge is 5000 ONL.

BROADCASTING - STEP BY STEP

Broadcaster signs a contract for transcoding and relay services
An entire Transcoders’ and Broadcasters’ history and ratings are recorded on the blockchain, so
users make educated decisions when choosing their best business partners.
For example: if a top-rated Broadcaster wants to start a new broadcast, instead of choosing
Transcoders oﬀers that include high initial transcoding fees, they could place a transcoding order
on the marketplace. Since there is a high chance that this broadcast will be very popular,
Transcoders start applying for this order. If the Broadcaster ﬁnds transcoders that have excellent
historical records and meet other criteria they sign a smart contract for transcoding services.
Both parties choose the oﬀers they like the most. Next, they sign a smart contract for providing the
services they have agreed on.
The Broadcaster starts streaming
The Broadcaster sets a broadcast price that he wants to be paid from each Recipient watching the

2.

PROJECT SUMMARY

transmission for a given time (for example some amount of ONL tokens per minute).
Transcoders place their transcoded streaming oﬀers on the Streaming Marketplace. Transcoders
add their fee to the Broadcaster’s transmission price so they could cover their costs of transcoding
and assuring the given bandwidth. The higher the chance the transmission will be popular, the
higher the price at this stage may be. Both Recipients and Relay Nodes might decide to buy the
transmission directly from the Transcoder.
Relay Nodes assure transmissions scalability
When the demand for particular streaming is high, some Relay Nodes may decide to buy the
transmission from the Transcoder at a given price and list their broadcast oﬀers on the Streaming
Marketplace with a new price that includes their relay fee. Since Relay Node scales up the network
capacity, they can oﬀer lower prices for the broadcast, so Recipients who are connected directly to
Transcoders have an incentive to reconnect to the Relay Node and release the place for another
Relay Node who would like to connect directly to Transcoder.

Recipients decide from whom to buy the broadcasts
Recipients can buy the broadcasts (valuable content) in the format and quality they like by
choosing oﬀers from Transcoders and Relay Nodes. Taking into consideration aspects such as
geographical location, internet network infrastructure, various encoding formats and standards,
and demand for various qualities the open market will regulate itself.
On.Live provides a tool for testing/estimating the transmission quality that could be used by
Recipients before they pay for it.

LIVE SERVICES - STEP BY STEP

Service provider creates an oﬀer
The service provider sets a service price that he wants to be paid from the Recipient watching the
live broadcast for a given time (for example 11 ONL tokens for 20 minutes), selects one of the
transcoding oﬀers (for example 1 ONL token per hour) and transfers the fee into a smart contract
acting as an escrow.
Transcoders place their oﬀers on the Streaming Marketplace. Transcoders add their fee to the
Broadcaster’s transmission price so they can cover their costs of transcoding and assure given
bandwidth.
The service provider chooses Transcoders and pays an initial fee to cover their costs of transcoding
in the case of an insuﬃciently large audience joining the broadcast. The fee is secured by escrow
implemented as a smart contract.
Security and protection of transactions - resolving issues with an order
2.

PROJECT SUMMARY

If the Recipient has any problems with service execution, he can open a dispute. The system will
choose random Validators. For a small fee, they check the recording and vote to settle the dispute.
Only then the payments are released from the escrow.
All private sessions are logged and encrypted and subject to a subsequent review at the time the
claim is ﬁled. If there is no dispute, then after the expiration of the complaint period are removed
from the servers.
If the service has not been executed, funds will be returned to the ordering party's account. Each
party can cancel the transaction.

Recipients decide from whom to buy an oﬀer
After the service is performed, the recipient of the service evaluates the service and the service
provider. Only then is the money released from the escrow account and transferred to the service
provider's account. If there are problems with the service, both parties can report the dispute.

FLOW OF ONL TOKENS

Recipients pay for broadcast and transmissions costs
The Broadcaster sets the Content Price that he would like to receive for the broadcast from each
Recipient watching the transmission (it could be a one time fee PPV or PPM).
The Transcoder when transcoding and transmitting video adds to the Content Price their
Transcoding Fee and places the transcode transmission oﬀer with a new price on the Streaming
Marketplace.
Relay Nodes may buy transcoded transmission from the Transcoder and publish a new (usually
cheaper) transmission oﬀer on the Streaming Marketplace so more Recipients can connect to it.
Recipients may buy transcoded transmission directly from the Transcoder or Relay Nodes. Thanks
to the scale eﬀect, Relay Nodes oﬀer this transmission cheaper than the Transcoder and still make
a proﬁt from the relay services.
Relay Nodes do not need to decrypt the transmission to relay it forward.

2.

PROJECT SUMMARY

The most important part is that the Broadcaster always receives the Content Price from every
Recipient watching his transmission. All the intermediaries are paid for their services as much as
free, open market allows for that. At the end of the day, Transcoders’ and Recipients’ fees are
determined by the free market ruled by the demand and supply, and limited by the costs of
resources needed to perform transcoding and relay services.
Broadcaster pays the Initial Transcoding Fee
The Broadcaster has to pay the Initial Transcoding Fee to the Transcoder. It is set by the Transcoder
to mitigate the risk of no-one watching the transmitted content. The Transcoder guarantees the
minimum transcoding/transmission time that he is going to perform for this fee even if no one
joins the transmission.
The second reason why On.Live Network implements this fee is a spam ﬁltration. It protects
Transcoders from processing unvaluable content and spam attacks.

COMPANY DATA

On.Live, unlike any known platform, always provides a way to negotiate the price with every single
content recipient for any single live broadcast session. This price depends only upon mutual
agreement between both interested parties. There is also initial fee for transcoders to insure
proﬁtability in case of insuﬃcient number of transcoded stream recipients. All this functionality is
provided by blockchain technology incorporated in the core of On.Live platform. It takes care of
instant fee transfers and allows monitoring of all important technical aspects of every transmission
for later review in case of dispute.
On.Live is the only platform that enables such solutions, and only one that allows its users to be
proﬁtable right from the ﬁrst broadcast they will perform. It presents most modern,
unprecedented attitude towards internet video distribution, and its open for community unlike any
other service available on internet.

ON.LIVE NETWORK SECURITY

Transactions Security
Transactions between all parties are secured by the blockchain and Smart Contracts. In the ﬁnal
version of On.Live Network there is no need for a trusted authority to conﬁrm all transactions
between all parties.
Content Security
The content broadcast by Broadcasters is encrypted in way that only chosen Transcoders and
Recipients who have paid for the transmission are able to decrypt it.

ON.LIVE TRANSCODING AND RELAY NODES - PROOF OF STAKE
High Quality Transcoding and Relay Nodes services
To assure high quality transcoding and relay nodes services we have added a users’ rating system
combined with Proof of Stake.
2.

PROJECT SUMMARY

Transcoders and Relay Nodes stakes a given amount of ONL tokens to guarantee the quality of
their services. They might be penalized if the signiﬁcant amount of Recipients complain about
transmission quality.
Proof of Stake and penalties for low quality services
If a network user decides to start serving transcoding or relay services they need to stake some
amount of ONL tokens on a smart contract to provide a guaranty of the quality of the services they
provide. If a signiﬁcant number of Recipients submit a complaint about the transmission quality
Transcoder or Relay Node they have bought the transmission from will be penalized.
All the complains and transmission history will be stored on the blockchain so both Broadcasters,
Recipients and Relay Nodes will prefer to choose trusted Transcoders with positive records.
Transcoders and Relay Nodes history browser
Among other important tools, OnLive provides a blockchain history browser that allows easy
access to Broadcasters, Transcoders and Relay Nodes history and ratings.

Additionally, besides Transcoding and Relay services, the On.Live Platform provides extra
functionalities for its users in version 0.1 such as:
The Messaging platform - Any service provider or content
creator has direct access to people who want to make
contact through chat. Chat has been equipped with a number
of tools to help you make transactions quickly and eﬃciently.
Each chat participant has the ability to upload ﬁles. The
channel owner can create dedicated oﬀers for his clients
Chat and get a rapidly prepared
dedicated oﬀer and exchange of ﬁles

directly in the chat, including the negotiated price, the
duration of the consultation and its terms.

The customer entering the chat via the channel sees all its oﬀers and can ask for any of them. The
system will automatically send a query that shortens the communication time between users.
After sending a dedicated oﬀer, the customer receives information on the oﬀered transaction in
the chat and the date of its execution now or on the dates available in the service provider's
calendar.
Payment options - Each service provider or content creator,

A choice of various payment
options for live broadcasts

for access to pay-per-view content.

Wallet - On.Live users can earn and pay only with On.Live
tokens. You can buy On.Live tokens through an integrated
wallet that allows you to purchase ONL’s via various methods
such as credit cards, bank transfers, etc. We have developed
a system that stores information about all transactions made
via the platform and monitors the amount of ONL’s in each

account. The User must have funds in his or her wallet
account in order to be able to order a service in the system
or buy access to the broadcasts.

user account reﬁnement and recommendations. Each
channel owner has the ability to supplement information that
will lead to a point rating of the channel and provide that

information to prospective channel customers. Selected
veriﬁed users of the system carry out the second veriﬁcation
option. This concerns the veriﬁcation of channels that require
a license to operate, such as a doctor or a lawyer.

My calendar - System users may schedule any individual

consultation or buy access for public broadcast.
"My calendar" is a place where anyone can ﬁnd a list of all
the available broadcast subscriptions and a list of all the
services they have used and which they have bought. From

friends. There is also a list of lost opportunities, a list of
consultations that for some reason did not come to fruition,
you can write from this position on chat to the service
provider or client and try to carry out the service again.

Channels - Each channel has its own proﬁle on the system
that contains information about the service provider or the
content creator. The channel owner can freely modify and
improve the content of the channel by supplementing
information about the services oﬀered, planning public
broadcasts, news, etc. Customers can read this information

COMPANY DATA

Besides all advantages such as full decentralization and openness, this solution still faces a few
limitations that every Ethereum-based system has. For example:
- Long transaction conﬁrmation times that makes Instant Payments impractical
- High cost of transactions that makes micropayments impossible
All of this problems will be solved in version 1.0.
First we run this setup below to allow scalability that can potentially reach millions of concurrent
clients. Using this architecture, we can have a large number of independent networks acting as
resellers for centrally generated content. This is the intermediate state before ver 1.0

ON.LIVE NETWORK VERSION 1.0

COMPANY DATA

Wider adoption of the On.Live Network could be achieved by lowering the cost and conﬁrmation
time of the transactions between users caused by blockchain technology limitations.
The On.Live Network version 1.0 solves that by implementing direct payment channels between
network users.
Using already established video connections between network users as a transaction transmission
layer opens a lot of possibilities. The On.Live Network can make almost instant transactions
between its users and provide a high level of security and scalability.
Computing power used for video transcoding, transmission, encryption and decryption can also be
used for transaction conﬁrmations. In this way ONL tokens can be exchanged inside the network
almost just in time and costs free.

The On.Live Network delivers the highest quality content by creating an economic incentive for
broadcasters and transcoders to invest processing power and network bandwidth into the most
valuable streams.
The content distributed in On.Live Network is censorship-free, but network users make an impact
on what type of content is distributed in the network. Transcoders and Relay Nodes may choose
not to distribute the content they do not like, but there might be other Transcoders and Relay
Nodes, more business who will distribute it. The On.Live Network can disrupt centralized video
streaming services providing a scalable, decentralized medium for people all over the world.
