Introduction
Everyone is familiar with services such as Uber and Booking.com, but few people are
aware that, in fact, they are affiliate programs. An affiliate program is a marketing
model, where an affiliate intermediary is involved in a promotional campaign, and an
advertiser pays for end results.
Any advertiser can create their own affiliate program. They can do so independently
or by using existing affiliate program constructs. In the latter case, the advertiser
is subject to the affiliate's costs, as well as the need to combat potential fraudulent
actions on the part of affiliates. Moreover, the affiliates lack trust in the advertiser, as
no one can be sure that results are not being concealed or tampered with.
Such shortcomings are absent when an advertiser relies on the services of an
affiliate network. However, costs rise as up to 50% of results could be commissions
paid for the affiliate network.
But, what if a solution could combine the benefits of both approaches? Introducing
the world's first decentralized marketing platform - HOQU.
HOQU is a decentralized affiliate platform combining the performance-marketing
model with blockchain technology. The aim of the project is to create a decentralized
ecosystem, which will be used to build CPA services, ranging from affiliate programs
to affiliate networks and related products. HOQU integrates advertisers, networks
and affiliates into a single platform, significantly reducing the financial costs for all
market participants.
The project’s mission is to make the distribution of rewards in the internet affiliate
market more equitable, and to set new standards of transparency and efficiency to
benefit all conscientious market participants.
Our goal is to provide advertisers, affiliates, and affiliate networks with a new
service so that internet marketing becomes easy for its participants, thus creating a
decentralized ecosystem where market participants can openly interact.

3

On the HOQU platform, an advertiser can easily create affiliate offers, and the
results of affiliate advertising campaigns will be stored in distributed registries
(blockchain). Rewards will be paid through smart contracts that guarantee honesty
and transparency of transactions. A smart anti-fraud system developed as part of the
advertiser's decentralized application will not allow affiliates to engage in fraudulent
activities, and independent, decentralized audit appeal centers will address any
emerging, controversial issues.
The HOQU platform will also be useful for existing affiliate networks. The SDK
will enable one to integrate networks with the platform, thereby lowering the cost
of paying affiliate fees. As well, it shall and add transparency to your network by
enabling all affiliates registered within the platform to work with affiliate programs
of the network.

1.1 Terms
CPA — Cost per action or payment for an action. There are many ways to pay for an
action, and the most popular ones are:
СPL: Cost per lead — payment for an application/action.
CPS: Cost per sale is a payment for a confirmed sale.
CPO: Cost per order — payment for an order.
CPC: Cost per call — payment for a call.
CPI: Cost per install — payment for the installation of an application.
Performance marketing is a marketing industry, whose goal is to achieve concrete,
measurable results. Its distinctive feature is the ability at all stages to see a specific,
quantitative indicator that reflects the outcome of each individual marketing
activity (e.g., site visitor cost, application cost, call cost, order cost, and end cost of
attracting the customer who has carried out the target activity).
Affiliate Marketing is an internet marketing industry that works on the basis of
a payment model for affiliates (web-masters) for each targeted action by their
customers (order, purchase, install, etc.). Advertisers often do not work directly, but
through affiliate networks (CPA Networks).

4

Affiliate Networks (CPA Networks) - services in the sector of affiliate marketing,
offering affiliates remuneration on the basis of the CPA model and providing
advertisers services necessary for the establishment of affiliate programs. Affiliate
networks charge advertisers for customer actions, pay commissions to affiliates and
charge commissions for the service.
An affiliate (web master, Publisher, advert) - a professional marketer (or a group
of marketers within a single account in an affiliate network) who advertises the
product or service for advertisers and receives a cash reward for the target action of
the client.
Advertiser - in this context is one who incentivizes affiliates to engage customers
by creating offers and paying the affiliates (often through affiliate networks) for
targeted customer actions that match the conditions of the offer. Often, advertisers
describe possible ways of attracting customers by providing materials, ready-made
templates, scripts, and so on.
Tracking - tracking of many different campaign metrics in the affiliate marketing
process. For example - time, source, or number of target activities.
Fraud - in terms of affiliate marketing, various ways of deceiving the affiliate
network and advertisers, in order to obtain a monetary reward. Varieties of fraud
may be: Emulation of target actions, spoofing the source of introduced clients
(cookie-stuffing), deceiving customers by using misleading ads to increase the
likelihood of target action (for example, by using a significantly lower price than the
offer of the advertiser) and others.
'Shave' - a deception of the affiliate network or the advertiser by an affiliate, which
downplays the performance of an advertising campaign in order to pay less.
Lead - the target action of a customer in response to an ad campaign: sales, order,
call, register, application installation (install), etc.
Offer - an advertising proposal to attract targeted activities from advertisers or
affiliate networks.

Industry issues and solutions
The stagnation of the traditional advertising industry and the development of
digital methods of attracting customers make the question of the future of internet
advertising more relevant. The International Advertising Bureau identified the main
problem for internet advertising and performance marketing as the establishing of
common client action accounting mechanisms between advertisers and affiliates.
Thus, the main problem in this market is establishing trust between the parties.

2.1. Issue of Fraudulent Schemes
FRAUD:
On the part of affiliates in relation to advertisers:
In the area of e-commerce, affiliates could visit web the sites themselves and place
orders.
They could use "gray" or dubious schemes to obtain customers' personal data and
pass them off to the advertiser as their own clients.
When making payments, in-house personnel could make calls, impersonating
customers.
On the part of affiliate networks:
showing advertisers an exaggerated number of leads;
discreetly debit advertisers' accounts.
SHAVE:
On the part of advertisers in relation to affiliates:
Informing an affiliate that an order has not been delivered and refusing to pay
commission on a customer's purchase.
Ignoring a customer's calls, identifying the caller's ID and contacting them directly.
Modifying the affiliate network code on a proprietary website so that not all leads are
recorded on the affiliate system.

6

On the part of affiliate networks:
Paying incorrect sums for customer activities to an affiliate.
Displaying understated estimates for leads to affiliates.
Discreetly debiting affiliates' accounts.
The losses presented by such problems can make up a significant portion of the
advertising budget, causing financial losses to advertisers and affiliates. According
to a study carried out by Applift and Forensiq,- companies specializing in mobile
network application development, up to 34% of advertisements on mobile devices
are suspicious. Of the aforementioned 34%, 22% is identified as fraudulent.[1]
According to estimates by the Videology marketing company, the use of bots by
unconscientious publishers for feigning customer action caused damage in the
amount of US $6.3 and $7.3 billion respectively for 2015 and 2016.[2] According to the
Partnership marketing company and Adloox Audit, in 2017, losses from fraud could
make up US $16.4 billion (more than 6.5% of the global Internet advertising market).
[3]

Artificially generated machine traffic is a big problem for the industry. The Incapsula
content delivery network reported that 51.8% of website sessions were conducted by
bots[4].
This is due to the imperfection of classic advertising models and their methods
of payment. In order to reduce the share of poor traffic, the advertising industry
should further develop the use of the performance-marketing model. The best
manifestation of performance marketing is affiliate marketing. When working with
this model, affiliates have an interest in increasing sales and customer health, and
there is no sense in attracting irrelevant traffic.
With blockchain technology and smart contracts, the reputation control system and
CPA system, HOQU completely eliminates opportunity for fraud.

2.2. Personal Identification Issues
Traditional advertising services do not completely solve the problem of remote
identification of individuals; this contributes to the growth of shave and fraud.
In the HOQU system, user identification is carried out via the Civic[5], blockchainplatform, which successfully addresses the problem of remote identification and can
be integrated with other blockchain solutions.

2.3. Ensuring Results
When ordering adverts via advertisements from traditional advertising exchanges,
advertisers have no guarantee that their investment will produce the desired result.
New advertising networks using the programmatic model (Sociomantic and Criteo)
have improved the algorithm for their work, but they do not give advertisers any
guarantees of increasing sales because they are paid for advertisements rather than
for customer activity.

8

Working using the performance marketing model, HOQU is fundamentally different
from classic advertising exchanges, and is able to demonstrate a more efficient
advertising campaign.

2.4. The Issue of Security and Stability
Security in current affiliate networks is poor. If a centralized network is hacked,
attackers can access all accounts in the system. Also, in the case of a technical
failure on a centralized platform, all affiliate networks stop working until the cause is
resolved.
Thanks to blockchain solutions, members of the HOQU platform are not connected
to each other in this way and are not affected by hacking. HOQU’s decentralized
software solution allows modules to be self-contained; in the event of a program
malfunction in any of the modules, the platform continues to work.

2.5. Cost Issues
The traditional business model for a centralized affiliate platform has a high
threshold for entering affiliate networks. Also, centralized platforms charge for their
services. For example, on the Hasoffers affiliate platform, the minimum entry fee is
$279 per month, on the Affise platform - $299, and on the Cake platform - $399 per
month.
With registration on the HOQU affiliate network, each affiliate and advertiser gains
free access. HOQU does not charge for platform use. Blockchain solutions reduce
the cost of storing platform user data and reduce the commission for affiliates and
advertisers.
One should pay particular attention to the low rate of payments for affiliate services.
In centralized affiliate networks, payments on traditional platforms and networks
take between a few days to 2-3 months to process. HOQU smart contract payments
take up to 10 minutes.

9

2.6. The Issue of Conflicts
Customers on many CPA networks have to trust them without being able to audit the
results of their work. This often leads to various conflict situations.
HOQU, through its tracking mechanism and smart contracts, ensures that all the
conditions of a customer's offer are transparent. This ensures transparency and
honesty in relationships between advertisers, affiliates, and affiliate networks.
On the HOQU platform, if an affiliate network acts against an affiliate's interests,
protection can be sought by filing a request to the appeal centers. In the case of
inadequate service delivery, unconscientious advertisers and affiliates will be obliged
to return funds. Violating the rules of the platform will lower the reputation of the
unconscientious party. To further combat fraud, the platform provides filtering and
detection of questionable sources of traffic.

2.7. Functionality and Ease of Use
Existing platforms provide only services to users. HOQU works with all possible
types of customer action and, in addition to services, offers several other types of
collaboration:
Ready open-source software.
An API for integration.
An SDK for the development of customers' own affiliate networks or other services.
On the HOQU platform, one can use both a web application and a mobile app for
iOS and Android. Given the steady growth of mobile traffic in worldwide internet
advertising, the development of its mobile application will allow HOQU to gain
additional competitive advantages.
It is also worth noting that there is no convenient mechanism for dealing with large
amounts of data from advertisers when working with multiple CPA networks. As
a result, advertisers have a problem evaluating the effectiveness of advertising
campaigns.

10

The HOQU platform stores data on blockchain, which allows advertisers to see all
affiliate programs and analyze their results for each type of customer activity (leads,
installs, calls, sales, etc.). Additionally, a member of the platform can generate a
report in a user-friendly manner with the information they require.
Current centralized affiliate networks and platforms are largely opaque and
incapable of solving the aforementioned problems. HOQU technologically surpasses
the competition and, thanks to the design team's solutions, can address most
current market problems.

Internet Advertising World Market Review
3.1. Internet Advertising Market Volume
The world market for internet advertising grew by 15-22% annually from 2010 to
2016[6]. The share of television advertising costs has traditionally been higher than
that of internet advertising. In 2017, share of internet advertising has exceeded
the share of TV advertising.[7] According to the Statista portal, the market for
internet advertising in 2017 will be US $227.802 billion.[8]
The scope of internet advertising continues to grow. According to the Dentsu Aegis
communication group, the share of internet advertising in 2018 will exceed 50%
of the total advertising market in 8 countries: Australia, the United Kingdom,
Denmark, China, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden.[9] According to
a forecast by Magna, by 2021[10] the global share of internet advertising will increase
from 36% to 50%.
The following is a forecast for the restructuring of the advertising market from 2016
to 2021 by Magna.

12

According to eMarketer, the market volume for internet advertising will amount to
US $335.48 billion by the year 2020.[11] The world's largest countries are presented
on the graph[12]:
Online advertising market volume in 2017, by country, $bln.

3.2. Performance Marketing
A relatively new phenomenon in the internet advertising market has been the
growing popularity of performance marketing. In Russia, in the first half of 2016,
the market for performance marketing amounted to 50.2 billion rubles, which is
30% of the total advertising market during this period, second only to television.[13]
Compared with the equivalent period of 2015, the performance marketing industry in
Russia showed an increase of 29%.[14]
In the UK, the market for performance marketing in 2016 was £1.578 billion, which
is 12% more than it was in 2015.[15] Thanks to the use of performance marketing,
in the United Kingdom in 2016, goods and services were sold for a total amount of
£19.4 billion. Each £1 invested in performance marketing resulted in sales returns of
£12.3.[16]

13

The popularity of performance marketing is attributable to the increasing cost
of attracting users. In these circumstances, advertisers prefer to pay only for
targeted customer actions. The International Advertising Bureau has identified the
main problem of performance marketing as the development of reliable common
customer accountability mechanisms between advertisers and affiliates (tracking
and analytics). The introduction of blockchain technologies to the industry can solve
this problem, creating convenient and transparent mechanisms for the accountability
of customer activities.[17]

3.3. Affiliate Marketing
According to estimates made by the AWIN marketing company, the total world
market in this industry is US $13.2 billion.[18] In the opinion of expert Eugeni
Prussakov, affiliate programs generate between 15% and 30% of all online sales for
advertisers.[19]
One of the reasons for the growing popularity of affiliate marketing startups is the
desire of investors to test the viability of projects at an early stage. According to
the Business Insider advertising agency, about 15% of total revenue of the internet
advertising industry is generated in the area of affiliate marketing.[20]
The volume of the affiliate marketing industry in the United States is US $5.4
billion.[21] In the UK, this figure is about $2.1 billion.[22] According to the manager of
the Neo@Ogilvy Singapore affiliate marketing service, William Hammer Jones, the
biggest prospects for the development of CPA networks in the Pacific Rim countries
are China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and Australia. The reasons are
economic growth in these countries in general, and e-commerce in particular.[23]
According to estimates by the Japanese consulting company YANO, the volume of the
market for affiliate marketing in Japan was 200 billion yen or about US $1.8 billion in
2016 and continues to grow.[24]

Description of the HOQU Platform
4.1. Functioning of the Platform
The HOQU platform provides a wide range of opportunities not only to advertisers
and affiliates but also to affiliate networks. Two operation modes are possible
on the HOQU platform: Direct interaction between advertisers and affiliates, and
collaboration between advertisers and affiliates through interaction with affiliate
networks.

15

The HOQU ecosystem involves several key players:
Merchant (advertiser);
Affiliate (partner);
Affiliate Network (partner network);
Customer (client).
The advertiser hosts offers on HOQU, aimed at a specific kind of data (leads) for
which they are willing to pay up to a specified cost.
An affiliate wanting to promote an advertiser's offer independently deploys and
maintains a marketing network by attracting customers. Through marketing
resources (websites, call centers, outdoor ads, etc.), the affiliate generates a flow
of leads that are collected and processed by tracking services for a particular offer.
The tracking-service creates the lead data and adds key information about it to the
platform (through the API or by calling the smart contract method directly).
If the advertiser approves the added lead by calling the appropriate API method
or the smart contract method directly, they will charge the cost of the lead to the
account and send it to the affiliate, minus the platform commission. By endorsing the
lead, the advertiser gains access to information about the lead and can obtain full
lead data (with the help of the tracking service or by unpacking the lead data with the
help of the key.)
The HOQU platform provides the opportunity of working not only with advertisers
and affiliates, but also with affiliate networks. An affiliate network can place all of its
offers and leads on the platform. Any affiliate already working with the platform will
be able to see and work with the offers of an affiliate network without any additional
customization.

4.2. Registration on the Platform
Before starting work on the platform, a user must register with the web service
hoqu.com, confirming their phone number and e-mail address.

16

Registration on the HOQU Platform

The next step is for the user to undergo verification. Currently, verification shall
enlist the aid of Civic’s services, but, in the future, internal verification may be
implemented, which would require the user's ID and registration address.
Next, an Ethereum hot wallet is created, giving the user a personal Ethereum
address and a private key to the wallet, required to access their personal account on
other devices.
The next step is for the user to indicate their role in the system — advertiser or
affiliate. Depending on their selected role, they are given access to an appropriate
personal account.

17

4.3. Platform Units
Decentralized web applications will be designed to work with the platform and can
be accessed through hoqu.com, as well as an SDK for custom solution developers.
The applications will include:
An advertiser’s application;
An affiliate's application;
An affiliate network administrator application;
An application for the appeal/audit service operator.
Each web application will have a public API for obtaining information about a user.
Advertisers and affiliate network applications shall have an additional private API for
providing affiliate program information.
Data from the blockchain will be collected in real time, then processed and stored
in a relational database. Any user registered on the platform can work with
the database through the public API. Because the platform uses the Ethereum
blockchain, this feature is needed to ensure that users do not have to incur additional
overheads by burning gas when they receive data directly.
Such an architecture allows new users to work with the platform without wasting
time, whilst taking full advantage of decentralized solutions as well as integrating
with the platform. Using the SDK, all existing affiliate networks will be able to add to
their solutions the benefits of the decentralized HOQU platform.
Operating Conditions of Advertisers:
The possibility to work with any affiliate network on the platform through the web
client or mobile application (IOS/Android) unless an affiliate network prohibits this.
The possibility of selecting the defining activity in the transaction (CPA, CPL, CPI, CPC,
CPS).
Payment is made only for the selected transaction type included in the smart
contract.
Easy development of your own affiliate network with all the tools and affiliate
database of the platform.
The possibility of working with affiliates directly for an 0.5% commission.

18

Confidence in the integrity of affiliates (affiliate network).
Guaranteed availability of the required number of transactions for any field of activity.
The possibility to challenge transactions through appeal centers.
Affiliate Operating Conditions:
The ability to work with any affiliate network on the platform through the web client
or mobile application (IOS/Android) unless the affiliate network prohibits it.
Any individual or organization matching platform criteria or a specific offer can work
with the platform.
The right to complain about unconscientious affiliate networks or advertisers.
Selection of an affiliate program and offer according to the best reward model (CPA,
CPL, CPC, CPS, CPI).
Seasoned professionals, reliable affiliates and novices in the field of affiliate
networks can all work with the platform.
In the event of collaboration with an affiliate network, one can make payments in a
convenient form.
Operating Conditions of Affiliate Networks:
The possibility of working with any affiliate or advertiser through the web client or
mobile app (IOS/Android), if this is not limited by the privacy settings.
The possibility of creating services for cash input and withdrawal on the platform.
Adding advertising offers to the platform. If an offer is added by an affiliate network,
it is considered to be the actual owner of the offer, but the advertiser is its nominal
owner. Only the owner of the offer can perform different actions with it (change the
cost and terms of the deal, activate and deactivate offers, and so on).
A 24-7 support service.
Development of promo materials and help with setting up tracking services.
Estimation of the offer's cost.
Appeal and Audit Centers:
The Appeal Centre is a unit within the HOQU platform that regulates and audits the
mechanisms in the service. Any member of the HOQU platform may appeal the action
of another participant by submitting an application to the appeal center. When a
complaint is received, the Center conducts a semi-automatic review of the parties to
the conflict and makes its decision.

19

Functions:
Performing independent investigations into the appeals of advertisers and making
decisions about them.
Monitoring the reputation of platform participants.
Verifying affiliates' reputational feedback from advertisers.
The appeal centers have their own rating that is dependent on the adoption of
equitable and prompt decisions on appeals arising. If fraudulent activities are
detected, the centers have the right to downgrade the reputation of these members
of the platform and to prohibit them to work with the materials and objects they own.

5.

Technical Features of the Platform
Interaction between members of the HOQU ecosystem is maintained through
Ethereum blockchain solutions. Basic platform functionality is implemented through
smart contracts whose source code is available on GitHub[25].
The HOQU platform will have a set of decentralized applications, with the help
of which one can easily add offers and leads, as well as create custom affiliate
networks from scratch with all the benefits offered by the platform. HOQU will have
many preinstalled modules, as well as a feature enabling the creation of custom
modules (plug-ins).

Merchant App

Affiliate App

21

5.1. Creation of an affiliate program
Within an advertiser's decentralized web application, an advertiser has the
opportunity to create their own affiliate program, where they can register offers
on the system by setting the rules for and the amount of an affiliate's reward. An
affiliate can receive a reward for various types of application — leads, activities,
installs, calls, GEA, and more. Affiliates can also have objective (scoring is
performed automatically) and subjective (scoring is performed after the body of the
lead is evaluated by the operator) evaluation criteria.

How to Create Affiliate Program

Reward amounts are determined in HOQU Platform tokens (HQX). A reward can have
a fixed value, or it may be calculated as a percentage of the value of an attracted
lead. It is also possible to fix the cost of a lead to any fiat currency. In this case, the
value of a lead will be calculated in HQX tokens at the internal exchange rate current
at the moment the lead was created on the hoqu.com web service.

22

An affiliate program can be created either directly by an advertiser in their personal
account or by an affiliate network on behalf of the advertiser, having become a
member in advance. In the event that an affiliate program is created by an affiliate
network, all editing and publishing rights belong to the affiliate network, the data is
stored in the network database, and the advertiser is the nominal owner.
After the affiliate program is created, its header data are placed on the blockchain.
Full data on the affiliate program is located in the advertisers' relational database or
affiliate network, depending on who the creator of the affiliate program is. To access
data in this database, one can use an API, whose logon credentials are also stored
on the blockchain along with affiliate program data. To access data through the API,
if a user is working with an affiliate network, or when an affiliate program has a
private status, users need a private API key issued to affiliate network members or
issued by advertisers upon an affiliate's request. In addition, the affiliate program has
the API credentials of the supporting services — the lead tracker and the authorized
Appeal Center.

23

Affiliate Network App

5.2. Decentralized web application for Affiliate Network Administrators
A decentralized affiliate network administrator application allows one to create and
deploy affiliate networks on the HOQU platform. This application has built-in trackers
that can work with any kind of payment for action — CPL, CPS, CPO, CPC, CPI, and
others. The Affiliate Network Administrator application consists of many modules:
HUM (HOQU user management) is a system for managing the administrators
(users) of an affiliate network, with a feature for creating different roles, adding and
restricting different access rights.
HAFS (HOQU Anti-Fraud System) is an anti-fraud system that identifies fraudulent
leads using more than 50 different metrics, neural networks and machine learning.
HAT (HOQU Automation Tools) - an automation tool that includes tools for creating
templates for promo materials, and tools for developing an operating strategy for
affiliate programs using specified algorithms, allowing an increase in the KPI.

24

HAM (HOQU Affiliate Management) - a system that allows affiliate members of
a network to join different groups, assign them different ranks and influence the
reputation of participants.
HPD (HOQU Plugins Development) — each affiliate network can use different plugins for customization, and it is also possible to create custom plug-ins to be made
available to affiliates.
HSR (HOQU Statistic reports) — the system displays statistics with different data in
real time and enables the creation of various user reports, and uploading of data to
Excel.
HDPN (HOQU Dedicated Phone Numbers) - a system allowing one to associate a
different phone number with a specific affiliate's work (required when using the pay
per call model).
HOQU Support - a system for communication with affiliates and advertisers that
includes a ticketing subsystem and chat with users.
An affiliate can start working with an affiliate network by becoming a member. To
do so, they must meet the conditions of participation (territory, reputation, etc.)
and apply through the public API of the affiliate network to obtain a private API
key to access the affiliate network data. Public API credentials can be provided to
an affiliate by the affiliate network itself, or obtained from blockchain by calling a
special method in the smart contract. The request includes the logon credentials for
the public API of an affiliate's web application, through which the affiliate network
can obtain all required affiliate data. If approved, the collaboration will be recorded
by the affiliate network on blockchain through the appropriate smart contract
method.

25

How to Join the Affiliate Network

In order to avoid mass registration of empty affiliates, the affiliate network can
be given different auto-rejection criteria for submitted applications or manual
confirmation of applications from the affiliate network administrator's office.
After the collaboration is recorded, an affiliate, through the affiliate network API,
receives affiliate program data as well as widget data that is designed by the affiliate
network to facilitate work with its affiliate programs. A ticketing and chat subsystem
is also available for communication with the representatives of an affiliate network.

26

Registration of a lead on the HOQU platform

5.3. Registration of a lead on the HOQU platform
For lead registration, the platform uses special services known as trackers. A
tracker has its own Ethereum address, a relational database, and special software
registering different types of transactions (leads). Trackers have permission to
determine the method of adding a lead in the smart contract. The tracker software
can regulate not only the leads but also how these leads are sold — whether
directly to the advertiser or auctioned.
Anyone who wants to register their tracker can do this by determining a special
smart contract method, specifying the type of lead to be accepted, as well as access
credentials to the public API of the tracker.
The approximate scenario for a typical tracker is as follows. The affiliate passes the
lead through the tracker API, the tracker widget, JS of the tracker API, and so on, and
primary processing of the lead is done without registering it on the blockchain. At
this stage, the user is protected against mass lead-adding attack, which, if detected,
can lead to blocking of the private API-key of an affiliate.

27

The lead is then registered on the blockchain by determining the special tracker
smart contract method, which first checks for links between the affiliate and the
affiliate program, and then adds the metadata to the blockchain. The lead approval
event is added to the scheduler queue with a hold time (payment delay) if it is
stipulated by the terms of the affiliate program that determines this smart contract
method, which charges tokens to the address of the advertiser, and ensures all
interested parties are paid. In the event of a successful sale, the advertiser receives
a full access key to the data, and the affiliate and affiliate network have a restricted
access key. The blockchain stores only the headers of the lead, the party identifiers
and the public tracker API credentials which give access to the body of the lead.

Frequently Asked Questions
How to participate in the HOQU Token Sale?
To take part in the Token Sale, you need to get whitelisted. Note that the Whitelist
only has a limited number of spots. The Whitelist registration will be closed once
we have received a pre-set number of requests. Each participant will have their
personal account with a step-by-step instruction on how to buy HQX tokens.
Can I send ETH from an exchange to the token wallet?
No, you cannot. If you send ETH from an exchange to the token sale wallet, they will
most likely be lost. You must send ETH from any Ethereum wallet: MyEtherWallet
(no download needed), Parity (Desktop), Mist (Desktop), imToken (iPhone), imToken
(Android).
What if not all HQX tokens are sold at the token sale?
If the hard cap is not reached by the end of the token sale, then all unsold tokens will
expire.
Where can investors see their token sale balance?
The obtained tokens shall be visible immediately upon acquisition on the balance
located on the user page. Two to three days after the end of the token sale, all HQX
tokens shall be distributed onto Ethereum wallets.
Bounty рrogram:
2% of total issuance (17,777,760 HQX) will be allocated to the bounty program, which
will be distributed as follows:
39% Signature and Avatar campaign.
26% Content creation.
15% Translation and moderation.
20% Social media (https://bounty.hoqu.io - bonus is available if KPI is reached):
Including Twitter, Facebook, Medium, Telegram, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and
WeChat.
Affiliate Program:
HOQU has used a performance marketing model since the very beginning of the
project. We offer an affiliate program to which 0.5% of the total issuance will be
allocated (4,444,440 HQX). Tokens will be distributed among affiliates according to
their invested amounts. The affiliate program will be launched from the beginning of
the pre-sale and will run until the end of the main sale.

Token Function and Project Economics
A key component in the economy of the HOQU project will be the HQX token, which
will perform an infrastructural function and is required for transactions between
platform members. The rewards for affiliate networks and affiliates will have a fixed
price in US dollars as well as a floating price in tokens.
HQX tokens will receive turnover via:
Payment for affiliate network services by advertisers.
Payments from affiliate networks.
Payments from advertisers to affiliates.
HQX will be exchanged on platform-independent exchanges.
The following assumptions were made when building the financial model:
According to the Statista portal, the internet advertising market in 2017 will amount
to almost US $228 billion.
Internet advertising market volume grew by 15-22% annually over the last seven
years. According to the financial model, the growth of the internet advertising market
for the next six years (from 2018) will be 15% annually.
The market for performance marketing in different countries is 10-35%, and in the
financial model this figure is 20%.
Performance marketing is growing faster than the internet advertising market.
According to some estimations, the share of performance marketing within the
internet market share of advertising will be increasing by 4% annually in the next six
years.

32

Performance marketing market size and HOQU’s share of it

It is estimated that the market size for performance marketing by the end of the year
2023 will have grown from the current US $46 billion to US $232 billion, and in six
years HOQU could occupy a 2% share of the internet advertising market.
The HOQU Platform’s turnover and revenue

33

With 2% of the market share, the quarterly turnover on the HOQU platform will
exceed US $2.32 billion by the end of the year 2023, and the quarterly revenues from
the platform’s commissions will be US $11.60 million, reaching US $87.13 million
within six years.
But HOQU is not purely a platform for CPA marketing, it is also an affiliate platform
in a broader sense, because HOQU is not limited to internet marketing. It is possible
to use other media for advertising, such as television, outdoor advertising, printing,
radio, advertising on transport and others. Potential revenue from these directions
for the HOQU platform is not taken into account in the financial model, but it will be
present in the actual operation of the platform.
The distribution model for token sale funds is as follows:

34

According to calculations, the attracted funds are sufficient to fully develop and
maintain the functioning of the platform for at least 3 years. This period is sufficient
for the project to achieve positive operating profit, even under a conservative
scenario. With a more optimistic scenario for the development of the platform and
the market, the project shall achieve positive operating profits after 1.5 years.

Marketing Strategy
In its activities HOQU will rely primarily on the team's long experience, as well as
its relations, affiliates and clients. The Marketcall project launched by HOQU in only
two years has become a leader among CPA networks in the CIS countries with
respect to calls. The Marketcall system has already more than 1000 advertisers
and more than 50,000 affiliates: From professional marketers with large teams to
affiliate-owners of small themed sites. The entire business of the Marketcall project
will be transferred to the HOQU platform.
HOQU plans to focus on the following markets:
North America: United States, Canada.
South America: Brazil, Argentina, Chile.
Europe: Germany, Great Britain, France, Netherlands.
Asia: China, India, Japan.
Performance marketing is gradually gaining popularity among advertisers, especially
in the countries listed above. The following information is provided on potential
markets for HOQU:
1. E-commerce
One of the first markets where the performance marketing model has been actively
applied is e-commerce. E-commerce sales in 2016 amounted to US $1.86 trillion
worldwide and and US $354 billion in the United States.[26][27]
2. Tourism and Travel
Tourism and travel is a large market, with proportionate advertising budgets.
Companies selling tickets, tours and that receive income from hotels can only benefit
from paying for the marketing of their services. The cost of internet advertising
for one of the world's largest travel companies, the Priceline Group, was US $2.74
billion in 2015.[28] The volume of online sales in the tourism industry in 2016 was US
$564 billion.[29]

36

3. Mobile Applications
Affiliate marketing is often used to distribute mobile applications that can only be
advertised through the internet. Paying publishers for each application install by the
CPA model is one of the most popular ways of promoting mobile applications. The
total marketing costs of application installs in the United States in 2016 amounted to
US $5.7 billion, according to Statista.[30]
4. Financial Services
The financial services sector is considered to be highly promising for the
implementation of performance marketing technologies. Growing competition in the
industry is making traditional payments for clicks and ads less profitable for financial
institutions.[31] According to eMarketer, the total cost of internet advertising in the
financial sector in the United States will be US $10.1 billion in 2017.[32]
5. Vehicles and Real Estate
At the moment, performance marketing is practically non-operational in automobile
sales and in 2016, 88 million cars were sold worldwide.[33] Analysts from CBRE
believe that online real estate sales will continue to grow,[34] and 80% of real estate
buyers use internet searches.[35] However, large purchases such as automobiles or
real estate can be mutually beneficial for the performance marketing advertiser and
the affiliate, for example, in the CPS (cost per sale) model. This model allows one to
increase rewards for affiliates and effectiveness of advertising for advertisers at the
same time, because affiliates will have an interest in actual sales.
21% of the funds attracted (the hard cap is $6.595 million) will be allocated to HOQU
platform marketing, and expansion (opening additional offices) to the countries
mentioned above is planned, which will require 17% or US $5.338 million of attracted
funds if the hard cap is reached.

Development Strategy and Roadmap
HOQU has significant competitive advantages over centralized affiliate platforms. The
main strategy for the development of the project is to realize these advantages.
Comparison of HOQU with centralized affiliate platforms
Centralized platform

HOQU Platform

High commissions

Low commissions

High cost

Free use

Difficult start

Easy start

Work instability

Module Independence

Up to 45% of advertisers' funds
are allocated to the payment of
commissions to intermediaries:
Banks, payment systems,
advertising agencies and
platforms.

Affiliate networks pay for the
use of existing platforms on
a monthly basis or invest in
developing proprietary systems.

The traditional platform
operating model has a high
entry threshold for affiliate
networks.

When a centralized platform
fails, all affiliate networks stop
working, until the cause is
identified and the problem is
resolved.

0.5% commission for
transactions and the lack
of intermediaries make the
platform more profitable for
advertisers and affiliates.

HOQU provides the facility for
using its blockchain platform
to all affiliate networks at no
additional cost.

After the simple registration
of an affiliate network on the
platform, each affiliate and
advertiser gains access to the
platform for work.

Other modules do not influence
work on the platform in any
way, and work continues even if
a neighboring module has failed.

38

Affiliate Marketing Industry without HOQU

The commission of banks and payment systems for affiliates and advertisers makes
up 3-5% of turnover.
The advertising agencies and CPA network fees make up 15-25% of turnover.
Advertising sites and services commission makes up 5-15% of turnover.

39

Affiliate Marketing Industry with HOQU

HOQU realizes that traditional affiliate networks currently function with fiat currencies
only. However, possibilities for buying goods and services for cryptocurrencies are
rapidly growing. The crypto industry is a new and fast-growing market, and HOQU
can offer new possibilities to its participants. Of course, the existence of Ethereum
wallets and the need for the use of smart contracts impose certain restrictions on
participants of the system, requiring them to have a sufficient level of technical
expertise and resources. HOQU will accommodate network participants who are not
ready to build their own technical solutions using the HOQU SDK.
HOQU will offer a simpler, more intuitive web-based application (for which both
desktop and mobile versions will be available), the server aspect of which realizes
all of the above logic and addresses smart contract methods using the service
API. This does not violate the principles of openness and decentralization, as all
operations will continue to be performed through the blockchain, but via the HOQU
API. Platform participants will then be able to simply obtain an account on the HOQU
system, add the required budget using any convenient currency and start work using
the system.
Using HOQU, advertisers work directly with affiliates and save around 44% of their
advertising budget.
The HOQU commission for the deal constitues 0.5%.

40

The emergence of such blockchain projects as AdEx, qChain, adChain and Papyrus
attests to the great potential of the blockchain industry. However, transfer of
traditional advertising exchanges to blockchain systems, which these projects offer
will not fundamentally change the way the market works. Sooner or later, classical
models will yield to performance marketing and one of the most effective models,
namely - affiliate marketing.
In 2018, HOQU plans to continue active development of the project and update its
releases. There is great potential for using HOQU in the areas of cryptocurrency
retail and e-commerce, cryptocurrency exchanges and services, as well as in
affiliate programs for ICOs and tokensales. The team’s further plans for platform
development will be announced subsequently. A more detailed description of
development phases can be found at https://www.hoqu.io. So far, the main planned
stages of the project's development are:

HOQU focuses on effective interaction with professional marketers and industry
experts, with whom HOQU will create one of the best marketing blockchain
platforms in the world. Advertisers will be able to increase the effectiveness of their
advertising campaigns, and affiliates and affiliate networks will gain direct access to
the customer base.
We provide affiliate networks with an inexpensive infrastructure that is
technologically superior to its counterparts. There are no other blockchain-based
affiliate networks with a smart contract system present on the market.

Team & Advisors
We started working in the internet marketing field in the early 2000s. Gradually
developing our expertise, in 2006 we were among the first in Russia to establish
our own agency for SEO promotion — PromoPage, and in 2008 we created the real
estate aggregator Move.ru and a number of other projects.
As professionals in the advertising industry, we have noticed how poorly advertising
campaigns are sometimes realized. Many advertisers and advertising agencies have
faulty objectives, which lead to ineffective budgeting. Unsurprisingly, advertisers
are increasingly dissatisfied with the payment mechanism used by publishers and
webmasters when paid ads or clicks are not converted into sales.
In 2015, we set up an affiliate network for calling — Marketcall, which works using
the performance-marketing model, where an advertiser pays only for results:
targeted calls from clients. In two years of work we have become leaders in the
number of attracted targeted calls in the CIS market.
This year, at an industry event, we met the co-founder of IBCG, an expert in the field
of cryptocurrency and blockchain, Roman Kaufman. Thanks to Roman, we realized
the potential of the introduction of blockchain technology in the area of affiliate
internet marketing.

Risks
Regulatory risks
The adoption of new laws regulating cryptocurrency turnover and the implementation
of token sales worldwide is just beginning. HOQU warns investors that it is not
responsible for possible changes in the project in the event of a possible restriction
on cryptocurrency projects and tokensales in different jurisdictions.
As China and the United States prohibit their citizens from participating in
investments in high-risk projects related to the cryptocurrency market, we
cannot accept investments from the citizens of the aforementioned countries and
jurisdictions. Blockchain technology is a recent development, and the technical and
legal issues associated with it are virtually unregulated or nonexistent.
HOQU notes that it is not responsible for possible adoption of laws regulating
blockchain technology by any country that would adversely affect the development of
the project or the entire crypto industry.
Technological risks
An open protocol creates additional risks for the development of HOQU. A platform
can be a target for cyberattacks that will have a negative impact on its cost,
reputation, tools, and customers' personal data. The team will engage every
resource at its disposal to ensure the project's safety, but notes that it is not
impervious.
The creation of a blockchain platform in the area of internet advertising is a new
challenge requiring human resources and the necessary material and technical
resources.
There is a risk that HOQU will require more investment to develop than is anticipated
at the current stage. In addition, there is a risk that the necessary expertise to
successfully launch the project could not be attracted.

55

Financial risks
Investments in companies, cryptocurrency and various tokensales are considered
high-risk. Investments in HOQU do not guarantee income. There is a risk of incurring
serious losses.
The HQX token is used as an exchange tool between all members of the HOQU
platform to pay for advertising content. It does not provide the right to vote or the
right to property in HOQU Inc. The platform does not translate HQX tokens into fiat
currencies and is not responsible for the fluctuation of the HQX token if it is listed on
third-party exchanges.
Cryptocurrencies currently have a high volatility. Financial losses are possible in the
event of acute fluctuations in cryptocurrency or fiat currencies.
If any jurisdiction implements a law with adverse effects on the crypto industry,
translation of tokens to fiat currency could become difficult or impossible.
When tokens are exchanged to fiat, the relevant services could charge a commission
and the government of the relevant jurisdiction could mandate payment of taxes.
If new laws are enacted in any of the world's jurisdictions, there is a risk that
investors be obliged to pay taxes or additional charges against any funds invested in
HOQU.
After investing in the token sale and before the launch of the project, investors could
lack the ability to use tokens in any way or sell them.

56

Industry risks
The HOQU team does not guarantee successful project development or a return
on investment. Competition in the field of internet marketing continues to grow.
Alternative projects could be successful, which will have a negative impact on the
position of HOQU investors.
The performance marketing model also has critics among publishers. Many
publishers currently do not work with the performance marketing model, and some
use irrelevant traffic. Such publishers would not be interested in the HOQU platform.
Publishers not using a performance-marketing model are likely to ignore HOQU and
criticize it.
