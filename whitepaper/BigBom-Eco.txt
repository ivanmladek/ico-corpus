1. INTRODUCTION
Bigbom Eco serves as a decentralized advertising ecosystem for all parties involved in online
advertising, inclusive of advertisers, service providers, content publishers, advertising channels, platforms. Bigbom Eco is being developed using smart contract, running on Ethereum
blockchain. We are proud to say that all data linked through Bigbom Eco is transparent, accurate, automated and immutable.
The Bigbom Marketplace concentrates on all service suppliers, who are rated and evaluated
by Bigbom Eco, and service buyers transparently. The Buyer or Advertiser is able to choose
the most suitable service supplier basing on the rating and reviews.
Bigbom iAds utilizes an auto-optimized advertising system on an array of channels, such as
Facebook, Google, Instagram, and Twitter. This system has been developed with a self-developed algorithm which facilitates the automatic optimization of advertisements, thus removing intermediaries in the decision-making process. Bigbom iAds will automatically deactivate
those ads that exhibit a relatively lower conversion rate, or incur higher cost prices than
expected. Advertisers will be able to manage ad campaigns according to KPIs, and the
system will then automatically allocate the budget towards efficient ads, campaigns and
channels. This helps advertisers conserving up to 80% of the campaign implementation effort
while decreasing the costs by as much as 20%. In return, this helps them increase their return
on investment (ROI).
The goal of companies and advertisers is to maximize their marketing impact while minimizing their marketing costs. In order to reach this goal, they have to target the right audience,
who needs or matches the ad and using the right channel at the right time.

2.VISION AND PURPOSE
Bigbom Eco is the first digital advertising ecosystem built as a decentralized application platform (DApp), which links ad platforms and publishers to advertisers globally. We aim to solve
the trouble of truth between advertising buyers and sellers by using blockchain technology.
We aim to free up human resources in online marketing optimize costs and increase the
effect of advertising campaigns through the development of Bigbom iAds, an advertising
automation utility which abilities to self-learning and optimizing ads bidding on many popular
platforms.
In next 5 years, Bigbom Eco aims to become an ecosystem with a significant influence on the
global online advertising industry.

3.MARKET OVERVIEW
Approximately 50 million new businesses are established around the world (by Moyak, 2016).
This leads to an increased level of competition in all fields day-by-day. As the competitiveness
increases, the advertising/marketing demand increases sharply. Simultaneously, online
advertising technology has dramatically evolved in recent years, thanks to preeminent advantages over traditional advertising, such as the possibility to target ads more specifically, a
higher measurement accuracy and lower costs. As a result, annual revenue of the online
advertising industry continues to grow strongly. In 2017, online advertising accounted for 41%
of global advertising expenditure and is forecasted to increase in the coming years (Magna,
2017). According to Magna (2017), worldwide advertising expenditure for digital channels
represents a $209 billion market, accounting for 41% of the advertising industry. It has overtaken traditional advertising channels such as TV ads $178 billion (accounting for 35% of the
market). The shift towards digital advertising spending demonstrates that brands and advertisers recognize the growing influence of online advertising channels.

MARKET OVERVIEW

Given the growth rate, Magna projects the expenditure of digital advertising will grow by 13%
to reach $237 billion in 2018 and $300 billion by 2020

Figure 1: Data for 2017 and beyond are forecasts (MAGNA)
Another source, Statista.com estimates that digital advertising spending will reach $269
billion in 2018 and $335 billion in 2020.
Figure 1 further demonstrates that advertisers are shifting budgets from traditional advertising markets to digital advertising market, and the level of spending on digital advertising
keeps rising rapidly.
According to global statistics, Google and Facebook are the leading providers of online advertising worldwide with revenues $95.38 billion and $33.84 billion in 2017, respectively (Statista.com, 2018). The figures show that Google and Facebook account for nearly 20% of total
global online advertising revenue. In addition, other channels such as Twitter accounts for
$3.26 billion in 2017 and estimated to have speedy growth in the coming time (Statista, 2018).

4.CURRENT PROBLEMS ON THE MARKET
The online advertising industry has grown exponentially in recent years, and is projected to
keep doing so in the coming years. Though, the team behind Bigbom Eco found that the problems it had to deal with on a daily basis, were still the same ones as the problems it had to
deal with during the industry’s infancy.

Trust between advertising buyers (advertisers) and sellers (ads platform publishers):
Buyers: Buyers often waste time on selecting the right ads platform and suitable publishers.
Moreover, they are unable to evaluate the effectiveness and quality of advertising before
actual implementation. This leads to uncertainty about the level of efficiency and whether the
KPIs promise by the sellers will be met.
Sellers: For sellers, there is a risk of non-payment, as they generally provide the service before
payment is completed. For instance, Google, Facebook and similar platforms hosting ads are
forced to lock their customers accounts, due to them not having enough funds to cover transactions on due date. This may results in these customers being in debt to the platform, with
debt collecting fees negatively influencing the platform’s profit margin.

Lacks of support for DApps through traditional marketplace solutions:
With the emerging popularity of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, the transition
from traditional application to DApps occured in multiple industries, such as entertainment
and financial technology etc. However, the amount of marketplace for advertisers and advertising platform/content provider is very limited. This reduces the ability of expansion to potential customers in the digital money economy.

6

CURRENT PROBLEMS ON THE MARKET

Manual management of ads is time-consuming and ineffective:
Managing ads across multiple campaigns on multiple channels is time and labor intensive.
Clients may be able to reach thousands of users by setting up an ad on Facebook, Google or
Twitter, though there is a little control on the performance of these ads without manual adjustment. In addition to manual adjustment being necessary, advertising agencies are usually not
working around the clock, which means that there is no possibility of adjustments outside
working hours.

Suboptimal Advertising Budgeting
Advertisers usually are able to measure and adjust their online ads spending only inside the
ads platform/publisher that their campaign is running. This does not guarantee the budget is
fully optimized. For example, when an advertiser evaluates their results on the multiple platform such as Facebook & Google, there are some ads is not having good performance on
each platform. As a result, budgets will not be optimized for these specific ads. This means
that the campaign is not as successful as it could have been.

These lead to the following questions:
How to optimize budget when investing in advertising?
How are the budgets among the different ad channels optimized?
Bigbom has run over a thousand campaigns each year for many large companies, including
Baskin Robbins, Jockey, Lazada and VNG. Through their business, Bigbom experienced
first-hand which difficulties clients and users within the advertising industry have to deal with.
Even though talented teams and companies invest significantly time, effort and money into
their advertisement, the structure disallowed them to reach a maximized return on investment. That is the reason why Bigbom Eco was started.

5.BIGBOM ECO - DECENTRALIZED
ADVERTISING ECOSYSTEM
5.1.What is Bigbom Eco?
Bigbom Eco is a decentralized advertising ecosystem for all parties involved in online advertising, including advertising, content publishers and advertising channels. Bigbom Eco is
developed using smart contracts, running on the Ethereum blockchain and Tomochain. All
connected data via Bigbom Eco is transparent, accurate, autonomous and immutable when
data is posted on blockchain.
Tomochain:
Tomochain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem with the Ethereum blockchain.
Tomochain plans to support horizontal scaling via adding more second layer blockchains
with good performance integrated with Ethereum for backup and atomic cross-chain transfer.
Bigbom has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Tomochain. With this MOU,
Bigbom Eco will receive advisory and technical support from Tomochain in the development
phase of Bigbom Eco. Bigbom Eco will experiment itself on Tomochain for comparison about
transaction speed, network fee and stability against Ethereum.

5.2.BBO Token
BBO, implements using ERC-20 standard, is the main utility for transactions under Bigbom
Eco’s ecosystem. The reason we have our own token is we wanted to have better ownership,
and make it easier for users on the ecosystem. Relying to other cryptocurrencies/tokens
brings a lot of risk to Bigbom, since they can change their own policy. advertisers can buy BBO
tokens during the ICO or purchase it on exchanges after the ICO is completed, or buying it
directly from our reserve using credit card (explained in next section).

5.3.Ecosystem
Any platform, service or product related to digital advertising around the world can become a
part of Bigbom Eco. They may be advertisers and publishers, and even ads platforms may opt
to integrate the Bigbom Ecosystem.
The infographic below describes the relationship between all parts of Bigbom Ecosystem.
Each member will have a specific benefits by joining into this ecosystem.

BIGBOM ECO - DECENTRALIZED

Easy engagement and cost effective for advertiser:
Establish a contract with a few clicks.. No extra fee. The only fee is a small
transaction fee for the execution of the smart contract.
Easy to choose your partner:
Through ratings & reviews on smart contracts, advertisers can decide which publisher is the
best fit for their business Bigbom Eco Marketplace also provides rich and transparent provisioning for each ads platform/publisher joining the marketplace
Fast & Reliable & Secure:
With Ethereum network, a transaction usually takes around 15-30s for confirmation.On
Tomochain, this is less than 2 seconds. This is totally comparable with credit card, but the fee
is much less. With large transaction, one common method is wired transfer, but it takes 3-5
days depends on many factors. Compare with Ethereum/Tomochain, the transaction time is
x 216,000 faster.
Decentralized network is a network consisting thousands of nodes, although there are still
some limitations in the implementation regarding the consesus protocol, but project such as
Ethereum and Tomochain is currently actively working on more stable consensus protocol,
such as Proof of Authority and Proof of Stake, which provides more scalability and fault tolerance. Blockchain is secure by nature. Record in blockchain is immutable, meaning no one
could change it by any method. Users also own their private key, the only method to access
their account on blockchain.
Easy Engagement:
The marketplace allows you to actively engage with advertisers, using Direct Offer or partici

10

pate to a Client Bidding Offer . In addition, our recommendation engine will select and give
best suggestions about which customer you should engage.
All campaigns, many platforms, ONE place:
Bigbom iAds allows you to connect with multiple different ads platform within a single
account. All your campaigns are now available under a single overview on your computer.
Reach you goal with minimized cost:
Bigbom iAds allows you to connect with multiple different ads platform within a single
account. All your campaigns are now available under a single overview on your computer.
Crypto-ready:
Bigbom Eco allows users to pay with their traditional payment methods, such as creditcard.
In practice, they will essentially buy BBO tokens from the BBO Reserve at a rate 5% above
market price, therefore minimizing impact on the overall value of the BBO-token. In addition,
these BBO tokens will be directly used within the system, thereby further decreasing supply of
the BBO token.

6.TECHNOLOGY
Ethereum & Tomochain
The Ethereum network provides distributed ecosystems and smart contracts that have been
proven and widely used by many companies, including JP Morgan, Cisco Deloitte Credit
Suisse, HP Enterprises. Ether (ETH), the Ethereum token has become popular in recent years.
Ethereum is the second largest coin in terms of market capitalization, just after Bitcoin. Ethereum is also the largest smart contract platform with the largest number of deployed contracts, approximately 18,000 smart contracts (according to etherscan.io).

11

TECHNOLOGY

In addition to Ethereum, Bigbom will develop its system in parallel on Tomochain. Tomochain
aims to solve the scalability problem within Ethereum, and plans to support horizontal scaling. It does so, by adding more second layer blockchains, allowing cross-chain transfer.
Bigbom will work directly with Tomochain on this integration. After pilot testing, Bigbom will
opt which of the 2 solutions is the most effective for its business.

6.1.Smart Contract Execution
The majority of the features on the Bigbom Marketplace are operated by smart contract.
When a party (advertiser) needs to use online advertising services from service provider (ads
platform/publisher), both parties will agree on the price and specific commitment (KPIs) at
the time signing smart contract.
A full overview of the various stages incorporated into the smart contract can be found below:

01

one the smart contract is signed, Bigbom Marketplace
secures the necessary BBO tokens from the Buyer to
ensure the payment process later. Any transaction
transferred to Bigbom Marketplace without a smart
contract on the platform will be refunded

02

The service provider will deploy customer’s campaign
in accordance with the terms of the contract

03

The payment process will be activated at the time was
previously set in the smart contract. Based on the
actual result of the campaign, terms of payment will be
carried out in accordance with the original conditions

04

Bigbom Eco automatically evaluates each transaction
by comparing the original commitments to the actual
results. At the same time, the Buyer can rate the Seller
in order to receive a certain amount of BBO tokens
from the bonus fund. Smart contracts will ensure this
process is completely transparent

Figure 3 : 4 steps of smart contract execution

TECHNOLOGY

6.2.Main contracts on the Bigbom Marketplace:
Service Offer Contract:
When the ads platform or publisher offer their services to customers, the Service Offer Contract us used set start and end dates, KPI terms and payment terms between both parties.
Buyers will be able to review the information in advance, and make a decision on whether they
would like to move forward with the deal.
Service Bidding Contract:
Both advertisers and ads platform/publishers have the ability to create a Service Bidding Contract. With the same type of service as in the Service Offer Contract, participants will be able
to make offers at the best prices, based on the term. After the Service Bidding Contract is
validated, whoever makes the highest bid will be selected to execute the contract.
Payment Contract:
When an ads platform/publisher executes an advertising campaign for their customers, all
KPIs promised in Service Offer Contract/Service Bidding Contract will be tracked and recorded by Bigbom Eco. Ads platforms/publishers can only request their customers to pay for
BBOs when the KPI conditions have been met, and did not exceed the time specified on the
smart contract.
Review/Rating Contract:
In order to evaluate the quality of both parties, the Rating Contract will be used to evaluate
advertisers and ads platform/publisher. The evaluator will receive a bonus with a certain
amount of BBO as a reward.

13

TECHNOLOGY

6.3.Bigbom Marketplace’s Workflow:
The Bigbom Marketplace is a place where all service providers are evaluated and ranked by
Bigbom Eco and serves buyers fairly and transparently. Advertisers are able to select their
service provider based on their ratings and previous reviews.
When the contract ends, advertisers are encouraged to rate and review the service providers.
Advertisers who give reviews are rewarded a certain amount of BBO tokens from the bonus
fund. Only those who use a service provider, which can be tracked through smart contracts,
can give them a rating, which makes the ratings far more accurate than other review platforms.
The advertisers can see ratings and reviews on the Ratings page. The advertisers can compare between ratings left by other Buyers and ratings that are automatically generated by the
system. The thorough and unbiased rating information helps Buyers selecting better quality
service providers.
The higher the service provider is ranked, the higher they will appear on the Ratings page.
Being listed higher helps the Seller attract more customers and motivates the Seller to
improve their services and advertising effectiveness.

How does Bigbom iAds reduce up to 80% of human costs and decrease the advertising
costs by as much as 20%?
Other systems on the market rely on simple “if, else” rules for optimizing their advertisements.
With Bigbom iAds, advertisers only need to enter their desired bid and Bigbom will automatically optimize campaigns using cle ver and sophisticated algorithms.
Bigbom iAds will create multiple ad placements at the same time, reducing ad creation time
by 80%.

Figure 6: Bigbom iAds’s permutation algorithm
Bigbom iAds uses a series of smart algorithms to make the most cost-effective and optimal
bids for each ad.
A/B testing helps advertisers find the right audience for each ad. Based on the results from
this test, the system automatically allocates the ad budget for the best audience.
The system automatically creates or cancels ads based on each ad’s effectiveness. Ads are
automatically evaluated against the advertiser’s KPIs. This helps advertising agencies spend
less time monitoring ads.

7.COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
In the past years, the cryptocurrency industry has seen multiple projects utilizing blockchain
technology in an attempt to solve the issues the traditional advertising industry faces. However, previous projects such as Adex, Indahash and Adhive are structurally different from
Bigbom Eco. Bigbom Eco has been purposely made as a decentralized ecosystem with variety of solutions offered including Smart Contracts, Marketplace and Bigbom iAds. Other platforms platforms are essentially advertising platforms
This means, that technically these platforms could become a target audience for Bigbom Eco
in the future.

Our primary focus is Bigbom iAds and Bigcom Eco development. We will open our Beta
version of Bigbom iAds as MVP before ICO date.
Below is our roadmap, including our key milestones for technical and business development.Dates and activities may be subject to change.

12. MARKET EXPANSION
Our development strategy is different depending on each stage of the project. In the first
phase, we focus on expanding markets in Asia (excluding China) and the United States. Then,
we will expand to other markets in Europe, India and China. In order to accelerate the market
expansion, we will promote the cooperation of Bigbom with professional and popular advertising partners in the targeted markets. To be clear, we use the "Network Growth" Fund to maximize our partners' participation in the Bigbom Eco ecosystem, and will provide a free fixed
amount of time to attract more advertisers using BigBom iAds.
In general, we will expand in different markets depending on the capital we gain during the ICO
period.

Figure 10: Market expansion based on raised funds

13. TOKEN
13.1.Token Sale
BBO will be issued as ERC-20 compatible token. Only 15% token is available for public sale.
The reason we have chosen for a hard cap of only 12,000 ETH, with a relatively lower amount
of tokens allocated for the token sale, is because we are able to set out and accomplish our
first goals with only 12,000 ETH in funds. This approach is more similar to a Seed Funding
approach, which is more appropriate given the nature of the businesses in this stage. We
could have opted to increase our hard cap and allocate a larger amount of tokens for the

25

TOKEN

token sale, though we do not want to raise more capital than needed at this stage. This
approach further internally incentivizes a long-term approach for Bigbom.
At a later stage, once the product is more developed, we may raise more capital in order to
fulfill our further goals for the project. Token freezes are incorporated into our smart contracts
to ensure that this will only be possible at a later stage. Details about these freeze times can
be found further in this document.
Our Pre-ICO will happens from 28 March 2018 10:00:00 GMT to 31 March 2018 10:00:00 GMT.
Our ICO will happens on April 2018.

Note:
We do not guarantee that all investors will be able to purchase BBO tokens during the ICO
period. To ensure legality, investors need to provide personal information (KYC) to be included
in the whitelist. We reserve the right to refuse investment from citizens from certain countries
that have laws prohibiting ICOs or have other relevant regulations. By carefully following legal
processes, we will make it easier for BBO tokens to be listed on major international exchanges.

TOKEN

13.2.Token Allocation
Founders & Core Staff (13%): These tokens are allocated to founders & core staff, who have
been involved in this project for a long time before this ICO. These tokens will be frozen for a
duration of at least 24 months (2 years).
Advisors (7%): Bigbom has appointed several experienced advisors, who will assist with the
project not only during the ICO, but also afterwards. These tokens will be frozen for a duration
of at least 12 months (1 year).
Bounty Program (2%): In advance of the ICO, we are organizing a Bounty Program, aimed at
those individuals who assist in bringing Bigbom to a wider audience. There are several ways
for individuals to earn bounties, including writing articles, joining the Telegram channel and
making a video about Bigbom.
Network Growth (30%): Primarily for attracting new advertisers, ads platforms/publishers
into the ecosystem. We will not release all the tokens at once, instead we will develop a plan
to release the token, depends on ecosystem’s development. These tokens will be frozen for a
duration of at least 12 months (1 year).
Reserve (31,75%): In order to decrease the barrier of entry to our customers, customer are
able pay for their services on our ecosystem by traditional payment method, such as credit
card. In practice, these customers will essentially buy BBO tokens from the BBO Reserve at a
rate 5% above market price, therefore minimizing impact on the overall value of the BBO-token. In addition, these BBO tokens will be directly used within the system, thereby further
decreasing supply of the BBO token on the market. This system will go into place after 12
months (1 year). Implementation of traditional payment methods may occur before that period.In this case users buy directly from the market through the Bancor Protocol. In addition,
the reserve may be used to raise more capital at a later stage.

TOKEN

Token Sale (16.25%): 16.25% of the tokens are allocated for the token sale, for a total hard cap
of 12,000 ETH. The token sale consists of Private Sale (1.25%), Pre-Ico (1.25%) and Public
Sale (14%). Unsold tokens will be burnt.
After contract is deployed, all Tokens that do not belong to Token Sale phase will be sent to
multiple Ethereum Multisig Wallets. Each wallet represents a different category. The funds in
these wallets will be frozen according to the structure laid out in Figure 12.
After the frozen duration, BBO can be withdrawn from these Wallets, but we will apply a maximum withdrawal limit for each Wallets. We also apply another 24hrs lockout if the maximum
withdrawal is reached. Table below is describing about the token withdrawal policy.

main focus will be on developing the best product possible, and bringing the most benefit to
the users. As a result, Bigbom anticipates they will be happy to introduce Bigbom Eco to
others. In addition, by enhancing promotion, advertising, or being as sponsorship of relevant
events in targeted markets will also extremely assist in boosting the Bigbom Eco brand.

experience in products / services in the ecosystem. In addition, customers and VIP partners
can be supported directly by Bigbom team.
More important, Bigbom will cooperate globally with influencers in the field of online advertising and pre-coding, to deliver our message to potential clients and partners.

16. REVENUE FORECASTS

number of advertisers and partners participating in Bigbom Eco and Bigbom iAds to expand
market share.
There are two main sources of revenue:
Revenue comes from Bigbom Eco Marketplace:

time, they will share with us 3-5% of their revenue.
Note: For ad alatform / publisher only use smart contract, but do not join the marketplace of
Bigbom Eco will not require to pay any fee for us.

17.RISK ANALYSIS
We perform risk analysis based on 3 major area: Technology, Market and Legislation. The
analysis relies on our more than 10 years in this industry, and our experience on blockchain
technology since 2016

Technology: What is your risks in terms of technology?
Stability of decentralized network, especially Ethereum:
We had anticipated that the decentralized network itself is till in early-stage, it could be
changed, transformed, or completely disappears without notice. Even we’re developing our
solution on Ethereum platform, the largest smart contract platform in current time being,
there’s no guarantee that Ethereum will head to its current plan. A dencentralized network is
running by community, and very fagile in terms of regulation, so we cannot expecting consistency at this moment.
Risk Rating: AVERAGE
Despite this situation, Bigbom believes that smart contract platform has huge potential in the
future. Smart contract development still has a lot of space for improvement, innovation. In
any circumstances, our solution only can become better, with the evolution of the smart contract technology.
Impact: LOW

33

RISK ANALYSIS

Marketplace: advertisers and partners are not willing to use the Bigbom Marketplace and
Bigbom iAds.
Bigbom iAds is convinced to be able to attract advertisers to their platforms, because of
several reasons:
The Bigbom Marketplace solves the trust issues which are currently occurring in traditional
systems. Bigbom Marketplace is safe and secure, and severely reduces the risk of fraudulent
transactions. In addition, it reduces the risk of deferred payment from advertisers.
The Bigbom iAds saves up to 80% in terms of effort and 20% in terms of efficiency, will be a
significant attractor.
Finally, Bigbom will create a user-friendly experience which will be easy to use.
Risk Rating: LOW
Impact: None

Legislation: If countries prohibit the use of tokens as intermediary payment assets.
This is a common problem for multiple companies involved in Cryptocurrency. Bigbom Pte
Ltd, a Singapore-based company, a country with an advanced and transparent legal system,
and has been supportive of cryptocurrencies. In case the growth of Bigbom Eco is hampered
by legal issues, Bigbom may consider to move operations to other countries.
Risk Rating: LOW
Impact: LOW

Business: Market expanding difficulties
Each market has different size, culture, legistation and geographic. Expanding into a new
market requires a lot of research, networking, presence establishment. Only by challenging

34

Figure 12: Token withdrawal policy

these problems seriously, a company is able to successfully expand their business into other
markets.
Risk Rating: AVERAGE
We will use raised funds for investment into market research, legal assistance, and opening
our representative in upcoming markets. With our current experience in advertising industry,
and support from our high-profile advisors, we don’t see any big obstacles regarding this
problem.
Impact: LOW

18.FAQS
How can advertisers and investors purchase BBO tokens?
BBO tokens can be purchased during the Private Sale, Pre-ICO, and ICO. BBO tokens may also
be purchased on an exchange after the ICO closes.

How will Bigbom increase the value of BBO tokens over time?
The value of BBO will be decided by market, the higher the demand, the higher the value of
BBO will be reflected. Our primary target is attracting thousands of advertisers and ads platform/publisher into our ecosystem, generating high volume of transaction. As a result, there
will be a high demand for BBO token in the market. Our product development is progressing
well, and we are able to release our products in 6 months after ICO ended.
In addition, the total supply of BBO is fixed and unchanged over time.

What is the fee per transaction when using smart contract?
The fee will be determined by the Ethereum Network. We’re working on a scheme for letting
anyone able to execute our contracts, giving them right to choose the gas price that suit them.

35

FAQS

The value of BBO can change during a contract’s duration. How will Bigbom
reduce risk for the ads platform/publisher?
This is a common problem for the whole cryptocurrency market. When a person accepts payment through Bitcoin or Ethereum, they accept that the value of these coins may change over
time. Bigbom is committed to develop a strong Bigbom Eco following in the long-term. If successful, demand for the BBO tokens will increase, which has a positive long-term effect on the
tokens. Though, for those cases where users may appreciate more stability, Bigbom Eco will
be linked with cryptocurrency converters so that investors and partners can quickly convert
BBO tokens to USD or other at currencies.

How are the Campaign Reports generated, and how accurate are they?
With institutions capable of delivering reports through the API, Bigbom Eco will integrate with
their APIs to collect information about the advertising campaign and provide advertisers.
For organizations that do not have the ability to provide reports through the API, the advertiser
will negotiate with the provider on the authenticity of the campaign results. Examples of such
method are Google Analytics and Appsflyer.

Do all countries share the same problems between advertiser and ads platform/publisher in the online advertising industry? Which benefits does the
ads platform/publisher receive by participating in Bigbom Eco?
Depending on the country, the proportion of unpaid customer accounts is around 4 to 8%.
This is a huge loss of revenue compared to the 0.1% charge of Bigbom Eco (2.5 to 5% compared to total loss). Therefore, ads platform/publisher are expected to have a significant revenue gain by using Bigbom Eco. In addition, as the community of BBO advertisers grows, ads
platform/publisher will have more opportunities to acquire new customers through the
Bigbom Marketplace.

36

FAQS

Why should advertiser choose ads platform/publisher on the Bigbom Eco
Ecosystem? What are the benefits?
First, Bigbom Eco will use a smart contract to guarantee maximum benefits for the Buyer. The
ecosystem’s marketplace allows advertisers to easily search for and select service providers.
Advertisers can make informed decisions by reviewing the service providers’ ratings. The
ratings are provided by the Bigbom system and other advertisers, and are transparent, objective and accurate.
Second, once Bigbom Eco is fully developed and used widely, it will become a common platform for all parties in the online advertising industry. Being a part of this ecosystem will be an
advantage for all advertisers, and platforms who seek new customers, partners and service
providers.

Where is Bigbom based?
Bigbom Limited is a British Virgin Island based company (BVI Company No 1971098).
BigBom Limited is the parent company of Bigbom Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based company (UEN
No 201801349C). Both companies are headquartered at 160 Robinson Road, SBF Center, #
26-10, Singapore 068914.
BigBom Limited is the issuer of BBO token whereby BigBom Pte Ltd will be in charge of business development including building the network of Advertising Agencies that will join the
BigBom Ecosystem.

If Facebook or Google temporarily suspend all ad APIs and change the distribution algorithm then why?
It is unlikely for Facebook and Google to suspend all their API, as there are hundreds of major
advertising companies in the world that are connected to their APIs. And as discussed above,

37

they have a policy of developing the Agency network. Bigbom iAds does not interfere with the
delivery of ads on Facebook, Google and other platforms.
