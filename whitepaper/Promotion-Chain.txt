of Promotion

Status-quo and Problems of Promotion
Promotion is an inevitable topic in today’s commodity economy system.
Especially in an era of internet economy featuring information explosion, the
promotion and exposure of products are the foundation for effective brand
promotion and the rise of brand awareness. They are as well a must for
businesses to make profit.

Conventional promotion relations cannot match with advanced
promotion capacity and profitability of the intermediate link
depends on monopoly, so users and promoters cannot acquire
their due return, which considerably contains the development of
the macro-economy.

Status-quo and Problems of Promotion
Promotion has become the bottle
neck of economic development
Complex promotion procedure
with low efficiency

Tedious reconciliation process
and severe data contamination

Tradition promotion industry lacks universal norms and is
loose in structure and poorly organized. Different promotion
distributors have different docking cycle and rules and
standards. There are too many links between agents at
different levels. These problems have lengthened the
promotion cycle and waste of resources.

The reconciliation and settlement processes in current
promotion industry are fairly complex, resulting in the
fact that the settlement is not finished in time and huge
amount of bad debt is caused. Data and capital are kept
long in stock, which contribute to low efficiency of
information and fund flow.

Lack of market analysis ability and dev
iation from promotional objectives

Low industry transparency res
ulting in difficulty in standard
management
Under
the current system, there is information isolation

Under a diversified economic structure, any product has
its targeted customers. Yet, promoters are usually not
good at market analysis of product, so targeted
customers are not met, the group with demand is not
fully covered and the customer conversion rate falls.

between manufacturers, promoters and users. Transparency
is lacked in promotion, setting up obstacles for supervision
and management. As a result, it can be frequently seen that
manufacturers give short of quantity and are in arrears with
fees and promoters counterfeit the quantity. Effective
promotional behaviors are hard to be protected.

Solutions

Promotion Chain Solutions
Promotion Chain applies block chain technology in the promotion industry. It develops a very simple structure
of “product--customer” through decentralizing the structure of this industry, thus creating a global
promotion ecosystem featuring win-win results for users and promoters in the block chain era.

Decentralized Promotion Ecosystem
Reshaping of the identity of manufacturers
Under existing industrial structure, product manufacturers have almost no controlling power over promotional
behaviors. Promotion only relies on previous experience, money input and luck. Therefore, promotional effects cannot
be guaranteed.

Raised value of promoters
Under existing promotion model, promoters are restrained by intermediate links, so they have no say on products and can
not make any decision. They are faced with not only low returns but also arrears or cut payment.

World-class Platform
and Promotion of
Block Chain Projects

World-class Platform and Promotion of Block Chain Projects
As globalization further deepens, “strengthening cooperation in a fractured world” proposed at the annual meeting
of Davos in 2018 has become a new topic in the area of economy. Promotion in the block chain era also calls for
world-class landscape and long-term oriented insight.
The team of promotion chain have ten years of global promotion experience with considerable cooperation
resources including overseas media we media and social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and
YouTube. The team provides promotion services of multiple dimensions for products globally based on big data
analysis and targeted launch, which is a solid foundation of world-class decentralized promotion platform.

Global brand incubation plan

Top quality design

High-quality promotion is a prerequisite for
the forming of a brand. Decentralized
promotion platform can bring significant rise
in brand value for manufacturers. And more
manufacturers settling can in turn help this
platform with its global enlargement, which
can facilitate the formation of a
decentralized global brand incubation pool.

“Promoters’ planet” conception
Promoters are the foundation of the
promotion industry. Promoters’
community is the utopia set up for
promoters. With the globalization of
promoters’ community will come a
“promoters’ planet” on which everyone
promotes and everyone gains.
World-class Platform and Promotion of Bl
ock Chain Projects

The promotion chain is aimed at developing a world-class platform, building a
bridge of win-win and mutual benefit for manufacturers and promoters, and
creating a decentralized global promotion system that is free of threshold and
resistance.
