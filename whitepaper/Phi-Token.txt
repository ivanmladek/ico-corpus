at, is not promising. With bond returns
holding a zero or even negative value
and the stock market carrying a positive
growth rate for nearly a decade, it seems
unlikely that the industry will be able to
sustain such trends.

Background
and Landscape
The
global
Wealth
Management
industry has been thriving thanks to
high returns generated from the twentyyear bond rallies and from the returns
of the American equity indices and
Emerging Markets. This favourable
scenario combined with the poor
financial knowledge of customers has
allowed the industry to generate and
maintain inefficiencies and high costs
in the distribution and management of
financial products.
The future of the financial market and the
rate at which it is, and has been operating

With returns predicted to be low, it
becomes apparent that the industry
will not be able to cover the high costs
from the inefficiencies. Additionally,
pressures are increased from emerging
Fintech companies, such as the Robo
Advisors, which are gaining market
share especially in the United States.
The main critical issues that need to be
addressed are listed below:

1
2

High costs mainly due to out-dated
and labour intensive operating models.

3

Sale of captive products without real
competition between asset managers.

Limited
access
to
multiple
investment opportunities, resulting
in poor results for the client.

Why a Platform
for Hybrid
Investments?
DIAMAN Partners LTD intends to create
the first Platform for Hybrid Investment
(PHI), which allows investments in all asset
classes and investment vehicles including
crypto assets.
The PHI (Platform for Hybrid Investment)
will provide clients with a fully digitized
platform on which to manage all savings
and investments, together with human
wealth managers to play a fundamental
role in identifying the real needs of clients
and assist in managing their emotions to
avoid classic behavioural finance investing
mistakes and/ or poor decision making.

The platform will be a Hybrid Platform
for Hybrid Investments, in other
words, digital process management
with seasoned professional wealth
managers for client interaction.

on the digital platform project for more
than a year with some modules already
implemented: The MiFID II compliance
Risk
Assessment
questionnaire,
the financial planning module and
quantitative
engine
management
models, some of which with a real track
record of up to 15 years of history.

The PHI platform will solve the critical
problems of the Wealth Management
industry due to the following reasons:
• PHI will reduce the commercial supply
chains via digitalization and lower the
costs of providing investment services.
• It will enable you to invest in multiple
investment vehicles, including Crypto
Assets, which represent a fantastic
investment opportunity.
• It will create a comparison between
Asset Managers and Wealth Managers
by stimulating competition and therefore
obtaining better returns for the customer.
• By combining the principles emerging
from the Crypto world, such as
digitalization of processes, sharing,
innovation and competition.

Phi Token
DIAMAN Partners intends to share the
project with the Crypto community
by issuing a PHI Token with the aim of
financing the project.
The aim is to ensure that those who
believe in the project, (and those who
work on it), will share in its’ success.
There are five good reasons that can define
the PHI Token as an amazing project:
1) The parent company DIAMAN SCF
has 16 year of successful business as
quantitative financial advisory company
for institutional and has been working

2) The Platform for Hybrid investment
allow the clients to invest in crypto
related products but isn’t depending by
the future of the Crypto world and can
survive also in the unfortunate hypothesis
that this business will disappear.
3) The platform valorise the Humans
involved in the process of investment
decision, goals definition and also to
correct the behaviours of the clients
during bear markets.
4) The PHI Token allow the normal
person to use in a free version software
usually reserved for institutional clients.
5) The creation and use of PHI Token
allow the company to reduce the cost of
the financial distribution without reduce
the quality of the services.
