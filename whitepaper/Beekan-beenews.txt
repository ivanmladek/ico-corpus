Project Background and Industrial Weakness

1.1 Project background
Klaus Schwab, founder of World Economic Forum, believes that after the invention of
the steam engine, computer and discovery of electricity, we are now in the fourth
industrial revolution—the digital revolution, in which the core achievement is
blockchain. Its decentralization, irreversibility and value upper chain have resulted in
a great reform in the production relationship, and created a brand-new world:
Oliver Bussmann, Chief Investment Officer of Swiss bank UBS AG puts that
blockchain would be the greatest disruption force in the financial field ever;
Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, believes that the blockchain will play a key
role in artificial intelligence development and regulation;
Founder of Facebook Zuckerberg discloses that he would explore the application of
blockchain technologies in Facebook;
In October 2016, PokitDok launched the blockchain named DokChain, which is
applied to distributed network of processing the financial and clinic data and affairs in
the medical treatment industry;
In August 2017, doc.ai Incorporated announced to launch the quantitative biological
platform of natural language processing (NLP) based on blockchain. It adds the time
stamp to the data using blockchain, and processes plenty of medical data via the
artificial intelligence, to provide the users with personalized health feedback;
In November 2017, Health Wizz claimed to launch a mobile platform, which, taking
advantage of blockchain, mobile technologies and data management technologies,
helps patients organize their case materials so they have access to their own database
whenever and wherever.
Since 2017, price of the Bitcoin has grew from the lowest USD760 to the highest
beyond USD20,000, of which the supreme growth rate is more than 26 times., while
Ethereum, rises from USD10 to USD1,400, above with the highest growth rate
exceeding 140 times. Besides, there are countless digital currencies with growth rate
of one hundred, one thousand times and even ten thousand times like IOTA.
In just China, the number of digital currency holders increased from 100,000 at the
beginning of 2017 to 3.5 million at the end of the year.

1.2 Industrial weakness As an ordinary user, how to seek for the value depression
of blockchain projects and digital currencies, and avoid the investment blindness,
there are four following pain points:
1. More than 90% of projects are forged: Since the block chain industry is now in
a cruelly growing state, lack of related supervision, low cost of forging, therefore
many organizations obtain higher market value depending on false statement of
project progress and over package of team, which leads to great investment risk.
2. The media is not objective or neutral: Central media have no effective
screening mechanism to examine information accuracy, and all parties are interrelated
in interest, leaving the investors misled.

4

3. Lack of effective evaluation system for the projects: There isn’t a decentralized
scientific value evaluation system for objectively assessing the projects to help the
users avoid investment blind points.
4. Bias on blockchain: Limited practitioners, high entry barrier and lack of ways to
understand blockchain for common participants cause serious bias of the public on
blockchain.
2.

Beenews: Value Discovery Platform for Blockchain and Digital Currencies

2.1 Vision and mission
Beenews is dedicated to becoming the largest value discovery platform for blockchain
and digital currencies in the world, to helping users discover the value depression and
avoid investment pitfalls, and to driving the healthy development of the blockchain
ecology. Moreover, Meta-graph Chain developed independently can be considers to
the public chain for data sourcing based on the blockchain technologies. It could form
the tracking evaluation system for global digital assets.
2.2 Design concept
Based on digging, computation, reconstitution and intelligent recommendation of the
information of digital currencies on the basis of blockchain technology, Beenews
manages to play the fullest role of the data. And with the help of AI algorithm,
Beenews presents the really valuable data to its users.
Intelligent recommendation of information: Based on the Blockchain Spider
Engine and whole-network search pool of digital currency information, intelligent
information recommendation according to users’ preference is accessible.
Digital Currency Knowledge Graph: Continuous upgrading, iteration and
structurization of data on nearly 100 dimensions of the digital currencies, also various
weights matching to form the knowledge graph for each of the digital currencies.
CV-Rank: Launch the CV-Rank originated in the Graph, to help users timely and
accurately assess the short-term fluctuation of the digital currencies.
Growth track index (GTI) of the digital currencies: On basis of the CV-Rank,
long-term tracking and analysis of digital currencies, complete recording of the
growth track of digital currencies on the blockchain for a growth track index, which
are useful in scientific and accurate evaluation of the long-term value of such
currencies, helping the users find the value depression, investment traps avoiding, and
value investment realization.
3.

Product Framework

3.1 Description of Beenews products
Beenews is the value discovery platform for blockchain and digital currencies
based on Meta-graph Chain.
Unlike traditional news platforms, Beenews, backed by the blockchain and
self-owned core algorithm, offers users digital currency information recommendation
5

in an intelligent way, a complete Digital Currency Knowledge Graph, and a
convenient information exchange channel.
I. According to users’ personal preference data 、 risk types and attention fields,
intelligent recommendation of different types of digital currency information can help
them to obtain the relevant information of digital currency more conveniently.
II. Information of knowledge graph of digital currencies and its index: The data
dimension reduction, noise removal, feature extraction, model training, etc., based on
mass data processing and deeply learning algorithm, eventually would form the final
result output after the quantitative factor optimization and unification. The core is the
processing of daily average grade-T mass data, including the blockchain data, various
kinds of trading platform data, user participation data, information of team
creditworthiness, market assessment data, popularity of searching data, etc. Via a
number of algorithm model training in the artificial intelligence technology system, it
quantifies the data of all the behaviors on the digital currency market, and produces
the complete knowledge graph of the digital currencies, and unique CV-Rank that is a
direct indicator to assist the users in evaluating the short-term fluctuation of the digital
currencies.
The CV-Rank information, rooting in the blockchain, extends in time dimension, thus
forms the GTI. CV-Rank and GTI are stored in distributed way, so this radically
prevented data loss or change, which means even the owners of the CV-Rank and GTI
can’t change the data, either. As a result, the data completeness and reliability are fully
ensured.
III. Knowledge graph based on the digital currencies provides the community
platform to realize the interactions between KOL and ordinary users or among
ordinary users, this, definitely accelerates the information flow and help users make
decisions.
IV. Participants of the platform could earn the BKBT-Token by long-term viewing,
content contribution, actively joining in community and inviting friends and so on.
Additionally contributors of quality content could win BKBT-Token.
V. Beenews also has information about accurate target-users business, and serves
external developers and advertisers.
3.2 Beenews product structure

6

3.2.1

Beenews information flow

Beenews information flow is the core content entrance of the Beenews products.
Based on the Scrapy Engine, it grabs and searches for the digital currency information,
trading information and social contents of the whole network, thus recommends the
information in an intelligent way with the help of recommendation engine.

The users could have the interactions like clicking the “like”, forwarding,
commenting, rewarding or “no more recommendation”.
Beenews information flow is mainly featured with: focused on blockchain and digital
currency fields, intelligent recommendation, users viewing, and social behaviors
combined with Token incentive.
3.2.2

Beenews knowledge graph

So far, Beenews has established a complete knowledge graph containing over 1,400
digital currencies, which includes following three categories:
I. Information dimension: Including but not limited to releasing team information,
founder information, financing size, popularity of searching, media judgment,
third-party information judgment, etc.;
II. Trading dimension: Connected with API of various major exchanges, to obtain
the information about trading volume, change trend, price, etc.
III. Social dimension: Beenews platform encourages the KOL and ordinary users to
share their opinions, including “optimistic”, “waiting and seeing”, “rewarding”,
“forwarding and recommending” and other social behaviors on different dimensions.

7

Data on various dimensions continues to update and iterate and structure, matching
different weights, to establish the knowledge graph for each digital currency. Based
on the knowledge graph, it launches the CV-Rank, which is the direct indicator to
assist the users in evaluating the short-term fluctuation of the digital currencies.
Rooting in CV-Rank, long-term tracking and analyzing of digital currencies, and
complete recording of its growth track on blockchain, form GTI.

8

9

3.2.3

Beenews community

In the view of “Digital Currency Knowledge Graph”, Beenews has developed relevant
user community, and encouraged the participant to create column, to share their
opinions or communication, where the users could mutually follow and “like” each
other and they can see their friends’ dynamics from Timeline Information Flow.
Conversely, all community user behaviors could improve and enrich the knowledge
graph in return, where they also could get relevant rewards in terms of BKBT-Token
according to their activity.
3.2.4

App distribution platform for digital assets

Crypto-Currency Application Distribution Platform of Beenews (CCADP) is the core
module of Beenews, which is dedicated to creating safe, reliable and quality DApp
and App download experience, and providing the Beenews users with the one-stop
services from information to downloading. It is truly a solution to the problems such
as difficulty in searching for installation package, downloading, indentifying, and
using, faced by common users now. This ensures that the users download an official
App rather than phishing ones stealing the digital assets of users.
CCADP serves both Android and iOS platforms, and strictly reviews、evaluates and
rates the qualification of developers.
3.2.5

Beenews original content production platform

The core purpose of the original content platform (OCP) is to excavate talented
creators of blockchain content, to share high-quality blockchain apps, to output digital
currency value information, and to promote the whole platform to develop positively.
The OCP gives creators different levels of platform incentives, and at the same time,
creators also enjoy the rewards from users. As the function improvement of platform,
various realization functions, like product embedding, advertisement placement,
investment portfolio demonstration for sales, and annual subscription would also be
supplied by the OCP.
OCP is considered to be an important part of Beenews information flow, in which a
certain rate of Token incentive pool would be reserved for long-term support for such
platforms.
3.2.6

Beenews advertising platform

In the wake of expansion of user base and increase of flow on the Beenews platform,
Beenews would provide the independent advertising platform to serve the advertisers
in the blockchain ecosphere.
Beenews advertising platform provides the information flow, community, CCADP,
original content and blockchain ads, etc. in various scenes and forms, to aid the
advertiser to grab target audience.

c.

Beenews Coin Volativity Rank (“CV-Rank”)

d.

Information Recommendation Engine (“IRE”)

e.

Content Creative Engine (“CCE”)

1. BSE is Beenews’ core data engine which searches the network-wide digital
currency information and forms a source for core data of Beenews information flow.
2.

For BSE-based data accumulation, we establish the DKG accordingly.

The classification of basic dimension data of DKG is as follows:
By team member reputation information, it may be classified into categories such as
high-quality, normal, relatively common and high-risk;
By search popularity, it may be classified into categories such as sustainable growth,
decrease, stable and shock;
By community data, market sentiments are classified into categories such as buy, sell
11

and wait-and-see;
By currency price, a kind of currency may be classified into categories such as
micro-value, small-value, medium-value and large-value.
N features of digital currency in the whole blockchain market are extracted and
classified by the above methods. So this market is an N-dimension market. If there are
M categories for each dimension, then each digital currency is quantified as NxM
matrix, and the prices, trends, user evaluations and others in N×M combination cases
are sorted to form CV-Rank. The CV-Rank will directly reflect the short-term market
fluctuation degree of the digital currency.
J=
R=
R is the score of this dimension; Q is the weight; S is a regulatory factor used to adjust
deviation according to the algorithm for a period; J is a single-dimension quantized
feature value. The second round of weighting and computation based on N vector
dimensions will result in CV-Rank.
3. Based on the existing spider data and user profile, IRE provides accurate and
intelligent recommendations in the information flow, through using 6 aspects of
processing—semantic computation, classification, information extraction, sequence
labeling, behavioral sequence mining, and knowledge base mining.

4.

CCE

CCE is an analysis product that Beenews gives to any content creator based on
CV-Rank. This product offers complete market trend change, user’s hot spots
description, intra-station user’s behavior analysis, market information blind-spot
monitoring and other functions to serve content creators. Thus, it promotes the
higher-quality and higher-efficiency output of content creators and virtuous
circulation of content ecology.

Technology Implementation

4.1 Beenews’ technology architecture

4.1.1

Application layer

About application layer, Beenews is mainly divided into DKG, Beenews application
and CCADP.
DKG is a data set for digital currency development process and structural relationship
generated by spider engine and filtering algorithm, which makes users access to
comprehensive single digital currency evaluation graph, so users can rapidly get
credible digital currency evaluation and form a contrast index based on CV-Rank
score.
13

Beenews is a “Headline + Snowball” in blockchain and digital currency fields, that
focuses on Beenews contents and user interaction community.
CCADP is a digital asset application distribution platform which ensures that users
can download official Apps after passing the credibility validation, and puts an end to
the steal of users’ digital assets as a result of phishing Apps.
4.1.2

Service layer

The service layer mainly consists of API, storage service, search service, information
flow recommendation service and advertising service:
API makes platform capabilities public to the third-party partners through
programmatic interfaces, to improve the ecological capacity of Beenews. In the future,
blockchain-related services will be provided to the third-party partners and developers
through API, so as to lower the development threshold of blockchain DApp;
Storage service and search service mean to form higher-performance data storage
service and search service based on the decentralized storage data, e.g.: the data is
stored in the Database in order to use mature database products and big data analysis
frameworks to improve the data storage and search service ability;
Information flow recommendation service and advertising service are also widely
applied to the existing internet products. On account of current mainstream data
storage and search products, the information flow recommendation service and
advertising service can be put in place quickly.
4.1.3

Kernel layer

Data aggregation engine: It includes two parts—spider engine and CCE. The spider
engine collects dimension data related to digital currency by using spider technologies,
and through computes, filters, processes and structural data forming, a valuable data
source for graph data appears. However, CCE, in which content creators are exposed
to complete market trend change, user’s hot spots description, intra-station user’s
behavior analysis, market information blind-spot monitoring, etc., this promotes the
output much higher-quality and higher-efficiency, and a more positive circle of
content ecology.
Distributed storage: Data aggregation engine forms structural data for all dimensions
of digital currency and stores data in a decentralized manner (e.g.: Storj/IPFS), then
generates the GTI and CV-Rank for the digital currency by using digital currency
graph algorithm.
Smart contract: Data aggregation engine and the decentralized storage address
problems about data source and trusted storage, where such contracts record the
digital currency growth track in a traceable way of blockchain, which is credible and
can not be tampered with.
Beenews will initially deploy contracts, on basis of ETH blockchain, which are
classified into graph contract and index contract: generally, the former records graph
data and Version of a single digital currency, even in case of any change in graph data
of a single digital currency, the development track can be clearly traced by Version;
as a background that there are far more than 1,400 kinds of digital currency, yet, the
introduction of the latter contract can greatly solve the lookup problem about validity
of graph contract, and provide an indexing mechanism for various graph contracts
14

for achieving quicker lookup and confirmation.
4.2 Meta-graph Chain
Meta-graph Chain is a public chain system which includes the smart contract system
and is implemented in the second phase of Beenews.
Consensus algorithm: Meta-graph Chain uses an efficient DPOS consensus algorithm.
It’s been fully verified in Bitshares and Steem systems. EOS system also utilizes
DPOS, as a consensus algorithm, as it can effectively improve any performance
similar to transaction processing of ETH;
Nodes: Meta-graph Chain is divided into Validator Node and Normal Node. Wherein,
the former will be responsible for the validation and packaging of all transactions,
while the blockchain commission is used to stimulate the Validator Node. In order to
prevent the Validator Node from doing evil, the Validator Node is required to pledge a
certain amount of BKBT Token to become a candidate validator in the system. The
candidate validator shall obtain the validator qualification through the pseudo-random
algorithm, and a group of validators shall be reselected every 60 blocks to ensure a
balance between the number of validators and the number of passing blocks.
Meta-graph Chain VM: Meta-graph Chain VM will be designed to be compatible with
the most active ETH Solidity in the current community. For the convenience of DApp
developers, the Meta-graph Chain VM will provide a more advanced API interface
and a high-level language SDK to reduce the DApp development threshold.
Ecology of Meta-graph Chain: Meta-graph Chain provides a more convenient
interface for the developers through using smart contract and API. Meta-graph Chain
uses API to open the data evidence storage capacity, traceability, smart contract and
other advanced blockchain development functions, which can be used to support
financial assets (digital assets, stocks, futures), exiting medical data evidence,
copyright registration, supply chain finance, etc.

15

5.

Beenews’ Ecological Model

To effectively motivate participants and realize the ecological development of
platform, Beenews will issue Token-BKBT. BKBT is the Token issued based on the
Ethereum ERC20 standard and serves as an important value medium tool in the
ecological chain of Beenews. On Beenews platform, all participants are effectively
connected together by the sharing and use of data, meanwhile, the acquisition and
consumption of Token are jointly bound, which brings a healthy and constructive
development of Beenews ecological system.
Any users’ behavior in this system, such as activity, growth and creating, is rewarded
with BKBT-Token.
5.1 Beenews’ ecological system
Beenews’ ecological system includes two crucial ecological platforms (i.e. advertising
platform and “pay for contents”) and three key roles (i.e. creator or content provider,
user and advertiser).
Advertising platform: Based on the popularization of blockchain technology and the
growth of penetration rate of digital currency, Beenews platform will attract more
advertisers to run ads in a Token-consumed manner.
“Pay for contents”: As the platform grows in size, more creators and content providers
will enter the platform to supply exclusive and premium content products, some of
which will be offered in the form of paid subscription. However, no matter free
contents or the paid subscription, readers both need to spend certain Token.
These three key roles of Beenews’ ecological system are involved in the entire process
from content creation to consumption, which is also accompanied by the production
and transfer of BKBT Token.

16

5.2 Beenews’ Token mechanism
As that BKBT is a Token that Beenews platform issues in order to ensure its
ecosystem effectively operated, and any activity in Beenews’s system shall be
connected by BKBT, thus it is very important to design a set of fair, just and
reasonable Token mechanism.

5.2.1

BKBT's incentive pool

In Beenews system, a reserved Token pool will be set up to be distributed to the users
rewarded by the platform. Everyday, the quantity of Token in the pool will gradually
decrease over time. According to such distribution algorithm model of Token, the
redundant Token everyday shall be reserved for the next day.
5.2.2

Data contributor

In Beenews’ ecological system, users can obtain BKBT-Token in light of their
respective contribution, and the obtained BKBT-Token can be used to buy services on
the Beenews platform. For the data contributed by the users, the system will allocate
the intraday BKBT-Token in accordance with three major models, namely,
Encouragement of Activity (“EOA”), Encouragement of Growth (“EOG”) for DAU,
17

and Encouragement of Creation (“EOC”).
1.

Encouragement of Activity (“EOA”)

Beenews platform users can get BKBT-Token according to their personal activity
every day, whose personal incentives will be allocated to by the EOA algorithm based
on their contribution performance.
On account of three-dimensional indicators, Beenews will carry out quantitative
identification for user’s activity:
M=
R is the quantized data of user behaviors, which will be used for quantitative
evaluation and judgment for user behaviors.
1. Active behaviors: The number of starts, the duration of browse, the
number of UGC, the frequency of forwarding, the number of likes, etc.;
2. Passive behaviors: The number of received likes, the amount of received
gratuity, the number of received complaints (negative points), etc.;
Q is the behavioral weight, and the corresponding weight ratio is established for each
action item; S is the corresponding incentive proportion, and a different BKBT-Token
incentive proportion is established for each concrete action item.
2.

Encouragement of Growth (“EOG”) for DAU

Beenews synchronously creates a new user-driven incentive system. Through the
sharing mechanism, any user can invite new users to register and thus obtain the
BKBT-Token from the platform. The invitee will also receive the BKBT-Token from
the platform through the EOG algorithm.
A multilayer revenue system is to be built for the sharing invitees, e.g.: User A:
1.
N;

draws N Users in Level 1 through the sharing mechanism, that is, L1 =

2.

then, N users at Level 1 draw M Users in Level 2, that is, L2 =M;

and so on...
If the user level achieved by A is k and k ≤ 20, then BKBT-Token incentive
granted to A will be A (k) which shall be calculated as per the number of new
users daily drawn in by A:
A (k) = M1* Q1
M1 =
M1 is the total number of all-level users daily drawn in by the parent node of User
A; and Q1 is the given incentive proportion.
If k > 20, that is, the number of user levels is more than 20, then A (k) income
shall be:
A (k) = M1* Q1+ M2*Q2
M1 is the total number of users below Level 20 and Q1 is the corresponding
18

incentive proportion; M2 is the total number of users above Level 20 and Q2 is
the corresponding incentive proportion.
3.

Encouragement of Creation (“EOC”)

a. High-quality content creators are encouraged to continuously create contents on
the platform, and corresponding grading will be conducted based on multiple
dimensions like the quantity, and frequency of creation, reading quantity, the number
of likes, the frequency of forwarding and the amount of gratuity.
b.

The income M for each content creator shall be settled on a daily basis:
M=

A different score estimate value R and a different weight value Q are provided for
each dimension. S is the BKBT-Token incentive proportion in relation to the product
of R and Q.
5.2.3

Content buyer

Any content creator or We-Media content creator can publish free or paid content
products on the Beenews platform. Then, users on the platform have choices to obtain
them free or paid, both of which require the users to consume the BKBT-Token held
by them; and the corresponding service providers get the BKBT-Token accordingly.
5.2.4

Advertiser

Because of Beenews flow characteristics, any advertiser can perform various forms of
advertising on the platform, but certain amount of BKBT Token is required.
6.

Commercial Prospects

Beenews is committed to becoming the world’s largest blockchain and digital
currency value discovering platform which helps users seek for value depression and
avoid the investment blind spots, popularizes the blockchain knowledge. Finally,
these would promote the healthy development of the blockchain ecology. At the same
time, The independently development Meta-graph Chain based on blockchain
technology is a public chain for tracing data source, which could be used to build a
tracking and evaluation system for global digital assets.
6.1 Advertising revenue
To make money by advertising is one of the important business models of Beenews.
Beenews makes many things possible, such as an intelligent and reliable blockchain
advertising and value analysis system. All of these are to achieve maximum benefits
for all parties.
6.2 Sharing of content revenue
As the amout of Beenews’ user increases, Beenews will invite more creators and
developers to enter the platform to provide better contents and services. Beenews will
get a certain percentage of charges from user gratuity, user subscription, membership
revenue, content e-commerce, decision-making data analysis and other value-added
services, to realize its business income in the contents.

19

6.3 Distribution of application revenue
In Beenews where users have channels to download DApps and Apps. And the
corresponding distribution of income generating from the third-party application
recommendations is also one of income sources of Beenews.
7.

Release Plan

7.1 Totals and distribution plan

Errors, omissions or inaccurate information in this document;

3.

Any act resulted from this document.

The team will make efforts to achieve objectives mentioned in the document, however,
25

considering the existence of force majeure, the team cannot completely promise to

platform, rather than an investment. It is neither a kind of ownership nor control.
Control over BKBT Token does not represent ownership of Beenews or Beenews

control or make any decision concerning Beenews and Beenews applications.
We cannot ensure that BKBT Token will appreciate, because its price may also
decline in some cases.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the team is not responsible for
damage and risk arising from participation, including but not limited to direct or
indirect personal damage, loss of commercial profit, loss of business information or

10.2

Risk prompts

There are risks in the development, maintenance and operation of Beenews, many of
which are beyond the control of the developer of Beenews. In addition to anything
described in this white paper, participants also please fully understand and agree to
accept the following risks:
10.2.1

Market risk

BKBT Token price and the entire digital currency market closely linked to the
situation, such as the overall market downturn, or the existence of other
uncontrollable factors, it may cause BKBT Token itself has good prospects, but the
price is still in an underestimated state for a long time.
Risk associated with Ethereum Core Protocol: Beenews and BKBT Token
applications were initially developed based on the Ethereum protocol and therefore
any failure, unexpected feature issue, or attack on any Ethereum core protocol could
potentially lead to the use of BKBT Token or Beenews application stop work or lack
of functionality in unexpected ways until Metasearch chain development enters a
stable, mature phase.
10.2.2

Regulatory risk

Blockchain is still in early development, therefore, there are not relevant regulatory
document in respect of precondition, trading requirement, information disclosure
requirement and locking requirement in the process around the globe. Besides, it is
unclear how the current policy will be implemented. All of these factors may have an
uncertain impact on investment in and liquidity of the project. Blockchain technology
has become the main target of supervision in all major countries over the world. If the
regulatory bodies get involved or exert influence, Beenews applications may be
affected by it. For example, laws and decrees may restrict, impede or even directly
terminate the development of Beenews applications.
10.2.3

Competing risk

26

Numerous competitive projects in the blockchain industry led strong pressure on
market competition and project operating. Whether Beenews project can break
through a great deal of outstanding projects or not is not only linked to all aspects of
its own team capabilities and vision planning, but also influenced by many
competitors and even oligarch in the market, which is widely accepted. In the
meantime, there is the possibility of facing vicious competition.
10.2.4

Brain drain risk

Beenews gathers a talent team with vigor and strength, including professionals
engaged in the blockchain industry for a long time and technical developers with
broad experience. In the future development, we can not rule out the possibility of the
core personnel leaving the team and conflicts within the team, which negatively
affecting Beenews.
10.2.5

Technical risk of project

The accelerated development of cryptography or the technologic development, such
as, the development of quantum computers, has the risk of cracking, which may lead
to the loss of BKBT Token. During the renewal process of project, there may be some
loopholes. Once the loopholes are discovered, they will be repaired promptly, but
there is no guarantee that this will not cause any impact.
10.2.6

Risk of lacking attention to applications

Beenews applications are probably not to be used by a large number of individuals or
organizations, which means that the public is not interested enough in exploring and
developing these relevant distributed applications. Such a phenomenon of lack of
interest may bring negative impact to Beenews applications.
Risk of hacker: Hackers or other organizations may attempt to interrupt Beenews
applications in any way, including but not limited to denial of service attack, Sybil
attack, malware attack or homogeneity attack.
10.2.7

Risk of uninsured losses

Unlike account of a bank or other financial institutions, there is usually no insurance
protection for storage in Beenews account or relevant blockchain-based network. No
public individual organization will underwrite your losses in any case.
10.2.8

Other unforeseen risks

There are still some risks yet not mentioned or predicted by the founding team, in
addition to those mentioned in this white paper. Furthermore, other risks are also
likely to arise suddenly or in combination of many kinds of mentioned risks.
Participants should fully know the team background and overall framework of the
project and ideas before engaging in the decision-making.
