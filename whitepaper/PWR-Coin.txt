PWR Coin

Introduction.

Fiat money defined as paper currency
and coins (MO) is represented globally
by approximately 180 different
currencies (Contributors, 2017) with
an approximate total value of USD 5
trillion. (Wagner, 2013) We believe that
cryptocurrency is becoming a viable
alternative to fiat as it brings a myriad of
desirable improvements.
PWR Coin desires to be a part of this
change by providing an alternative
payment method for online shopping.
We are confident that as people become
familiar with using cryptocurrency, they
will begin to understand the advantages
and this will lead the way towards mass
adoption. The vision of PWR Coin is to be
an integral part of this exciting shift from
the fiat to cryptocurrency!

Historical
Overview.

PWR Coin was first released around May
18th 2016 under the branded name of
Powercoin and was known by the ticker
PWR. If you would like to investigate
this in greater detail, you can review the
Bitcointalk ANN and Twitter page.
At launch, the coin generated some mild
enthusiasm because it launched as a
hybrid coin with both proof of stake and
proof of work based on the GPU mined
NIST5 algorithm. Since ASIC mining of
Bitcoin was considered beyond the reach
of the masses at that time, certain portions
of the crypto community were pleased
to see a new GPU mining coin become
available that was not an ICO based
offering. (Praxis, 2016).

PWR Coin
Within approximately two hours of the
initial announcement at Bitcointalk, a
member named Praxis quickly pointed out
that there had already been a Powercoin
in existence for some time. In fact, you can
see the original Powercoin was initially
announced on Bitcointalk on May 12th
2013 using the ticker of PWC. (NWO 2103).
Interestingly enough, the observation
made by Praxis was quickly brushed aside
by the original poster Petersen with the
following statement: “Nothing to do with
that old coin since it died we decided
to keep making our project calling it
PowerCoin.” Of course, this began what
would become the tangled web of future
events surrounding this coin.

06

Following these events, the coin began
trading on Yobit, and a variety of mining
pools begin to support the coin. On June
4th 2016, the coin began trading on Yobit
at around 77 satoshis, and just four days
later it reached a peak price of 195 satoshis
on June 8th, 2016.
Sadly, the price made a quick reversal,
and within four days it was selling
for 65 satoshis on June 12th 2016.
(Coinmarketcap. 2016).
Now things begin to take a tragic turn
because by the end of June the price
tumbled to almost nothing with users
complaining about being unable to sell the
coin at even 1 Satoshi. Various accusations
quickly swirled with the consensus
being the developer had scammed the
community and made a fast cash out via
a premine-pump-­and-dump scheme.
(Charloz24, 2016).

New and problematic development
started causing additional problems
such as Hubot processing a DMCA
request against the Github repository
for Powercoin on August 20th 2016.
(Hubot, 2016) Those not familiar with
DMCA, it is an acronym referring to
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Suffice to say the Powercoin repository
was removed from Github based on
copyright infringement(s).
At this point, the future of the coin looked
grim, and the legitimacy of the developer
was called into question. The community
was in an uproar, and the price of the coin
was at the lowest possible amount, and
the problems were still not over.

The next greatest destructive force for
this coin would soon appear within the
source code itself. As a result of various
mistakes made by the original developer,
hyperinflation raised its ugly head with the
coin staking at an unsustainable rate of
approximately 1095% APR.

For whatever reason and let’s say it’s
safe to assume it was pure speculation
the coin did continue to trade albeit at
incredibly rock bottom prices. Some
speculators bought the coin thinking that
it may someday come back while others
abandoned the coin.

To make matters worse, the larger the
balance and the longer the coins set
without moving - the more they would
multiply. Coupled with the fact the
developer abandoned the coin, we can
see a very hopeless scenario for this
doomed cryptocurrency.

The final nail in the coffin was when the
largest of the coin holders staked their
wallets into oblivion. Little did they know
that once their balances accumulated
over 92 billion coins, the balance would go
negative making them inaccessible due to
the limitations of the 64-bit signed integer
type. Not only did this impact single users,
it likely affected large exchanges such as
Yobit, Bleutrade, and Coinexchange.

We are now up to that point in time
where all exchanges have the coin in
maintenance, and the vast majority of
users assume the coin is dead. Little did
they know that a new and much needed
second chance was just around the corner
in the form of our development team
stepping in to breath new life into this
otherwise hopeless gem.

PWR Coin

PWR Coin under
new management.
On July 13th 2017 I was searching for ultralow value coins to invest in and stumbled
upon this coin. Because the wallet was
in maintenance mode at the exchange, I
decided to purchase some coins directly
from an individual who was very happy to
sell them to me for one satoshi of BTC per
coin. Like some other hopeful speculators,
I just began staking the coins in the hopes
that maybe someday things would
turn around.

In March of 2018, our development
team was considering a project wherein
we would create a purpose-built coin
designed specifically for use as an
e-commerce payment option. We needed
something with an extremely fast block
time, very low transaction fees and an
incredibly reliable and stable network.
After some lively internal discussion, the
dev team agreed that Powercoin was a
great candidate and could be completely
reworked to provide what we needed.

At this time we decided to tackle the
project wholeheartedly.
Step one was to settle on new branding,
and we opted to go with PWR Coin
utilizing the existing ticker of PWR. A new
logo was created as well as a variety of
header graphics for use on social media
pages while the dev team analysed the
code and debated what changes should
be made, many other items where being
put in place.

PWR Coin

PWR Coin Brand
and Marketing.

New social pages were created on
Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, YouTube,
Reddit, Discord and Telegram. A domain
name was purchased, and a temporary
website was put up on a dedicated server
at https://pwr-coin.com A new Github
repository was created, and we made
available freshly rebranded versions of the
wallet. A new Bitcointalk ANN was created
along with new signatures.

Additionally. new VPS seed nodes were
set up to maintain the network as well
as VPS nodes for testnet testing and a
new block explorer. A branded marketing
video was created to promote the
upcoming changes, build the community
and a variety of promotional activities
began at Discord. Last but not least, the
dev team paid for an exchange listing at
CryptoHub and also added the coin to
the CryptoCapWorld and CoinMarketCap
sites so that the PWR community could
buy/sell and monitor the coin.

With the digital footprint, social channels
and supporting network in place, we
began to analyse the code. Although
we knew going in that the code would
be in bad shape, much to our dismay, it
was even worse than we had imagined.
Refusing to be discouraged from the
task at hand, our three developers
painstakingly worked through the code
for months making all of the necessary
corrections and improvements.

Once satisfied with the code base rework,
we completed extensive testing on
testnet. We subsequently made available
the downloadable binaries along with a
compressed blockchain for faster loading.
Much hard work has now brought us to
the point where we are ready to move
forward with the plans that allow us to
achieve our use case goals.

incentivise miners, to decentralize
the network further and in doing so,
dramatically increasing the number of live

A quick overview of the tasks completed
during our code base rework are below:
The original Power Coin was cloned, based
on the ZeroCoin code base. Minimal effort
was placed on improving the coin or
moving the technology forward. The first
step was the rebranding of the Power Coin
(ZeroCoin) to PWR Coin.
This was followed by numerous
improvements to the code to address a
“double spend” exploit, brand new MXE
compilation process for a stable x32 and
x64 wallet for Windows and in version
2.0.2, modifications to resolve the negative
integer overflow issue when exceeding a
92 billion coin balance, to now handle the
balance of up to 184 billion.
Proof of Stake (PoS) is reduced, and Proof
of Work (PoW) re-enabled to encourage
miners in helping to secure the network
through further decentralization.

We invite you to review our Github
repository, to review the code base for
PWR Coin.
https://github.com/PWRcoin/PWRcoin

PWR Coin

Every detail from branding to code
updates, patches to correct exploits, are
well documented.

Additional modifications and
improvements to the code base:
• FIX: Issue #9 a bug was crashing the
wallet when staking exceeds 1 00M
coins per output limit, the code will
now fail the stake and warn you to split
your inputs instead of crashing. 1 00M
is the MAX_MONEY to prevent large
transactions from paying a fee

• FIX: The money supply field in the
wallet was broken, at FORK height the
field will be reset to 0, and used to track
new coin creation
• NEW: Hardcoded seeds have been
added to the wallet pointing at our
block explorer and PWR seed VPS

• FIX: The wallet will no longer stake dust
• FIX: The old bitcoin IRC code is
completely removed from the wallet
for security reasons
• FIX: A double spending vulnerability

13

• FIX: An RPC handler bug has been
resolved when an RPC client (example:
ccminer) aborted its connection,
this prevented the wallet from
stopping properly

• NEW: At FORK height old wallets< 2.0.1
will be rejected
• NEW: A new RPC call “burn” has been
added to the wallet, for those who
want to burn their coins, the coins are
sent to a vanity address
• NEW: A new RPC call “burn” has been
added to the wallet, for those who
want to burn their coins, the coins are
sent to a vanity address :
BURnBLrcKMwOmfFGFzz4r52scZvJpozs

• The vanity address was generated with
a modified “vanitygenplus” tool that on
purpose does not generate the correct
private key length. Therefore the coins
are lost
• NEW: POW nist5 is enabled again as
of FORK height, you can use ccminer
or cpuminer-multi to mine it, there
is full support for nist5 in existing
pool software
• Version 2.0.2 - Added zapwallettxes
RPC to the wallet, this should avoid the
painful dumpwallet/importwallet cycle
in some scenarios and a new network
traffic widget and peer view table

• The explorer can only scan what is
in the blockchain, which is simply a
collection of inputs and outputs that
make up the wallet balances
• It’s not possible to determine how
many users lost their private keys due
to filesystem/harddisk corruption/
accidental deletion/ software bugs etc
• It’s not possible to determine wallets on
old v1 .0.0 chain - (we hard forked on 12
May 2018)

• It’s not possible to determine wallets
with a negative balance who are unable
to access their funds (fixed in v2.0.2, and
already in use at CryptoHub exchange)
• Orphaned blocks are counted in
the totals because the explorer
software does not handle blockchain
reorganizations. (A software limitation}
• The Coin Supply rises 183,960,000 per
cycle after phase 8
• The total supply takes just over three
years to increase by 2.11 billion PWR
Coins or only a 0.08% increase in
supply to put this into perspective
• The table below demonstrates how
the total coins generated daily was
drastically reduced. Pre-Fork generated
15.84 billion coins daily, compared to

PWR Coin Use Case
- PWR PAY.
As mentioned previously, the intended
use case for this coin is as an e-­commerce
payment option. More specifically, the
PWR PAY e-commerce gateway which
we will be tackling in multiple phases of
development, built on PHP.

17

© 2019 PWR Coin Dev Team.
All Rights Reserved.

In simple terms, PWR PAY will be a
free-to-download plugin that can be
used to extend the functionality of the
e-commerce website by offering PWR
coin as a payment option.

To further enhance the capabilities of PWR
Coin, we will be setting up a gateway that
allows the transfer of PWR coins from one
e-commerce website to another that is set
up with the PWR PAY plugin.
Initially, we will release the plugin as an
extension of the
Woocommerce/Wordpress platform. It
is here where the process of monitoring
for bugs and any necessary features,
improved usability, will begin.

Once the PWR PAY plugin is proven
to be stable and user-friendly, we will
create additional plugins for use in other
e-commerce platforms such as Shopify,
Magento, Opencart, Prestashop, Zencart,
etc.
Our goal will be to provide a
straightforward installation procedure
which can be accomplished by a typical
website developer. Detailed installation
documentation will be included with the

PWR Coin
plugin and offer technical support through
our various channels where we already
provide service to the community.
Regarding PWR Coin being the coin of
payment, we have methodically massaged
the coin specifications for this very task.
For example, block timing consistently
runs at about 30 seconds to allow for
the accommodation of a substantial
quantity of rapid e-commerce payments.
Additionally, the ultra-low transfer fee of
.00001 PWR Coin makes the transaction
incredibly cost-effective.

18

Last but certainly not least is that the
security and stability of the network are
achieved via the hybrid nature of the coin.
A vast network of computers around the
world are online 24/7 performing proof
of stake (PoS) while simultaneously there
is also a substantial amount of proof of
work (PoW) hashing. PoS process onehalf of the blockchain blocks while PoW
processes the other half.
This virtually eliminates any concerns of a
51 % type of attack as well as any concerns
of insufficient transaction processing
resources. With open wallets staking,
miners adding value through PoW, and
e-commerce sites further expanding the
list of available nodes, strengthens the
entire PWR Coin network.

It is important to understand that the PWR
PAY e-commerce plugin can also provide
some other interesting benefits for the
installer and coin. The installer of the plugin
will benefit as a result of gaining PoS
payouts on balances stored in their wallet.
When an e-commerce website is running
the plugin, the balance will provide for
staking rewards which provide the installer
with a stream of coins. The coin itself can
benefit because each e-commerce plugin
installation provides another network node
which can process transactions for the
entire network.
Additionally, the development team
is looking at leveraging the PWR PAY
plugin with a variety of options to help
control and/or reduce the coin supply
such as sending a transaction fee to the
official burn address, requiring a minimum
plugin wallet balance to keep the plugin
activated, etc.
