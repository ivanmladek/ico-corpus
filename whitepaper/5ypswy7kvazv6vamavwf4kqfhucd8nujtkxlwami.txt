1.Responsibilities
Disclaimer
Attention! The current white paper is for informative purposes only. Its content is not a sales promotion
nor an offer of securities or financial securities. Read the document carefully to understand how the Lunes
Platform works.
Potential token buyers should carefully evaluate the risks and uncertainties associated with
cryptocurrencies and familiarize themselves with all the information in this document before conducting any
business.

2.Executive
Summary
2.1 LUNES – THE DIGITAL COIN
The technology of blockchain is one of the most promising that exist
today, ranging from smart contracts to the creation and commercialization of
cryptocurrencies.
In the last few years, this market has been expanding in a surprising way,
solving several problems with its decentralization and speed. Today, it is possible to
make several records, payments, and even raise funds for companies by using this
technology.
The cryptocurrency market has already surpassed the value of renowned
companies such as Facebook and Amazon.
Cryptocurrencies are not only only a solution for depreciating currencies, such
as USD, but also for our daily life. For being decentralized, safe, fast and low (or no) cost
in transactions, these currencies exceeded the value of US $600 billion at the end of
2017.
Although this market is in constant and wide expansion, most cryptocurrencies
have a complicated process of acquisition and negotiation. The wallets offered today
are often poor in terms of usability, and they offer few resources.
With all these obstacles, the experience for new users becomes diﬃcult and
creates unnecessary uncertainty. Many users end up in fear and avoid this market as a
whole due to the risk of being scammed.
The Lunes Platform is a solution to the complications. Lunes has the resources
for anybody interested in the crypto world, ranging from beginners to advanced users.
Its design was created to facilitate and offer practicality, simplicity and intelligence.

2.2 FUNDRAISING FOR STARTUPS AND COMPANIES
Crowdfunding has become one of the best ways to fundraise. It is a great
business model in which people get together to finance a particular project in exchange
for some kind of return or just for the pleasure of helping others.
Today, many entrepreneurs and startups face diﬃculties in raising capital and
expanding their business or launching a new product or service. The Lunes Platform
will help these businesses to be able to allocate resources and funds by creating
tokens.

2.3 PAYMENT GATEWAY
E-commerce continues to grow exponentially each year. Currently, there are
approximately 20 million digital stores in the world, and this number is expected to
increase at a rate of 26% each year.
It is estimated that the total turnover(sales) of these e-commerce businesses in
2017 exceeded USD $2.1 trillion, 10.5% increase compared to 2016 (USD $1.9 trillion).
This is great news for cryptocurrencies as blockchain technology and
E-commerce are complementary to each other.
Through the Lunes Payment Gateway, it is possible to receive payments via
cryptocurrencies, which can be processed by using a physical card or through sending
cryptocurrencies themselves.
With very attractive rates/fees for the consumer and for the company, the Lunes
Platform is a solution for traditional retailers who wish to receive their payment in digital
coins.

2.4 DIGITAL REGISTER OFFICE
In most countries, register oﬃces are crucially important to ensure the
development and security of civil acts. From birth to death, citizens are required to use
certificates in various situations, and these certificates must comply with the legal
requirements.
Lunes Truth plans to test the power of the blockchain in this area. Aiming to
cheapen, simplify, and de-bureaucratize the notarial processes, the Lunes Truth works
as a digital registry that makes it feasible for companies and people to carry out
authentic records in a safe, fast, and totally decentralized method.
The annual billing of Brazilian registry oﬃces reaches billions of reais (Brazilian
currency). Amid this profitable and very bureaucratic market, the Lunes Truth service
provides an alternative to help facilitate the lives of its users.
As you continue to read the whitepaper, there will be more information to learn
more about each of the tools offered by Lunes Platform.

3.Introduction
This document was created to present all the information of the projects on the Lunes Platform. White
paper was created to settle all the doubts of customers, investors and partners interested in doing business on
our platform, or using our solution to eliminate the problems that we propose to solve.
Lunes is a platform that provides a set of solutions that is decentralized by utilizing blockchain
technology: such as creating tokens, authenticity records, and making payment processing possible through our
gateway operators by using “fiat” currencies and cryptocurrencies.
This makes it possible to take blockchain technology to the general public in an uncomplicated way via
the web, mobile, and desktop platforms.

4.Basic Information about
Blockchain Technology
Blockchain is a data structure that represents the record of transaction histories. Each transaction
performed is digitally signed and encrypted ensuring the authenticity, integrity, and security of the data.
The Lunes blockchain was written using the Scala programming language and has implemented proofof-stake as a network consensus mechanism.

4.1 BLOCKS AND TRANSACTIONS
This technology was initially created by Satoshi Nakamoto for the digital
Bitcoin currency. It was the very first “cryptocurrency” to ever exist and offer
decentralization. As blockchain technology advanced, transactions are not only limited
to financial needs but has vast capabilities.
With its advancement, it has been utilized in several other branches, such
as tourism, hospital, financial entities, automobile industries, and others. It has been
proven to have great benefits for the technological community.
The technology employed in Lunes allows the registration of any information
in digital format. With blockchain technology, it is possible to distribute the digital
information without it being copied in order to avoid fraud.
Same as other cryptocurrencies, the transaction record is constructed and
stored in a series of blocks, called the Blockchain or trust protocol. This record provides
a permanent history of transactions and also saves the order in which they occurred. A
copy of the blockchain is maintained on each node on the network.
The subsequent blocks are generated based on unique and unpredictable
information from the previous block. These blocks bind on the basis of this data,
creating a chain of blocks (and transactions), which can be traced back to the Genesis
block.

5

www.lunes.io
Copyright © 2017 Lunes - Nebulosa, All Rights Reserved

In Lunes, the blockchain is based on the technology of Waves NG, which
implements the concept of key blocks, which are referenced by micro blocks, increasing
the speed and the volume of transactions.
Key block generation time is 60 seconds and micro blocks will take only a few
seconds. The maximum capacity for each key block will be 65.5 thousand transactions.

4.2 LUNES NODES
The term node in cryptocurrencies usually refers to the software of wallets.
A “Full node” is nothing but a digital wallet where a full and updated copy of
cryptocurrency chains are maintained. This node connects with blockchain to validate
transactions and blocks. Therefore, the network is kept safe and in a healthy condition
for its operation. The more nodes connected, the more secure and stable the network
is.
A node is a network component, which contributes to validating transactions
and blocks on the Lunes network. Each node in the network has the ability to process
and transmit transactions and information from the block.
The blocks are validated as they are received from other nodes. However, in
some cases, block validation can fail. When it does, the nodes enter the “blacklist”
temporarily to prevent the propagation of invalid blocks.
A Lunes Node is likely to generate a block based on the amount of lunes that
are kept in the users wallet, making it a complete Proof of Stake(PoS) system.

4.3 THE PROOF-OF-STAKE SYSTEM
PoS mining works with randomness to decide who will be the creator of the
next block. Similar to a raﬄe, each coin has its equal share, so whoever has more coins
has a larger stake in this draw, increasing the probability to be the creator of that block.
The adoption of PoS is an attractive feature for cryptocurrencies due to being
more eﬃcient in terms of electricity consumption compared to Proof of Work (PoW).
PoS has an incentive of holding more coins due to increasing the probability of being
selected. PoW is dependent on equipment to “mine” coins and there is no incentive to
holding, so miners tend to dump their coins.
The term used for the blocks in PoS mining is “forged block,” whereas PoW
names it “mined block.”
The reward distribution in the PoS system varies greatly according to the
currency algorithm. In certain currencies, the reimbursement for the creation of a new
block is distributed in a proportional way to the existing quantity.
In Lunes, with the system of leased Proof-of-Stake (LPoS), there is no creation
of new coins for each block because all the coins are already generated in the
distribution of the ICO. Therefore, the mining rewards will be from the transaction fees
of that block.
To have a chance to generate a block, the miner should have a minimum
amount of 5000 lunes staking in their wallet.

5.Leasing
Leasing means granting the power to forge a block to a network user by lending the Lunes coins that are
in your wallet. This allows any user to participate in the forge process with any amount of Lunes. Participants do
not need to have 5000+ Lunes in order to have a chance to generate a block if they lease their Lunes coins.
The process works as if it were a loan from their currencies to the forgers. However they are able to
keep total control over their funds and it is possible to cancel the lease at any time.

Common users can
forge coins.

Being reward for
keeping its coins in
leasing.

Through the leasing
process, the user can lend
its coins to a node owner.
This allow any user to
forge without creating a
node.

The rewards obtained by a node are shared with those who have leased their lunes tokens. This
generates competition between the nodes to offer more attractive rewards, creating a relationship between the
lender and tenant.
Only a Lunes Node can make the process of building blocks, and these can receive more forge power
from their users through the leasing process.
The Lunes uses a system in which each “coin” in a wallet can be used as a tiny forging equipment. The
more tokens kept in the wallet, the greater the likelihood of the wallet earning the rights to generate a block.
The “reward” received as a result of block generation is the sum of the rates of transactions located
within that block.
Currently, the return rates for leasing are approximately 5% per year.

6.Lunes
Wallet
The release of the Lunes platform ICO is going to be done through our web and mobile wallet that are
going to be available before the start of the ICO.
The Lunes wallet is the safest way for the user to store their Lunes coins and also other
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. In addition, the portfolio offers multiple services such
as Block explorer, leasing, voting system, Lunes Market, payment of invoices, and management of debit cards.
The wallet is going to be made available on the Web, Android, IOS and Desktop platforms.

6.1 MOBILE - LUNES WALLET
The Lunes wallet is developed with a focus on security and being a flexible
wallet. The users have total control over their coins and access to their assets at any
time.
To make a transaction on the blockchain, the user must perform a digital
signature of their cryptocurrencies using a secret code, commonly known as a private
key.
In the Lunes wallet, the private keys are owned by the user. Although the private
keys are saved on the Lunes Platform database, the user has full access to them at any
time. Also, the keys are encrypted and can only be decrypted by the owner. The owner
is able to decrypt the private key by using a PIN or fingerprint. Once decrypted, they may
access their wallet information such as transactions.
The mobile wallet is considered to be lightweight because it does not need to
store all the transactions of the blockchain. It could also be called as a “light client”. It
only communicates with the network to send/receive transactions and data, delegating
the validation of transactions to the cryptocurrency’s network.
When it comes to the backup system, it is intuitive and simple. The wallet
generates a set of 12 words, called “seed words”, which is unique for each wallet.
The seed words are used to recover the wallet and should be stored safely, preferably
oﬄine, in a physical device.
In the event of loss or exchange of a smartphone that has the Lunes wallet
installed, the wallet can be restored to another device, as the keys are linked to the
user’s registration on Lunes Platform and not the physical device.
The easiest way for a user to recover a wallet is through their email registered
on the Lunes Platform or by inserting the seed words to make a backup and restoring
their private keys. This will allow them to access their wallet and continue to make
transactions and have full access to their cryptocurrency.
The sending and receiving of cryptocurrencies is simple and straightforward.
The user can either enter the address manually or scan a QR Code. The Lunes Wallet
then quickly sends the transactions to the network. The block explorer is available for

8

www.lunes.io
Copyright © 2017 Lunes - Nebulosa, All Rights Reserved

constant monitoring of the transaction’s confirmations on the blockchain.
Transaction rates are calculated dynamically according to network congestion,
preventing the transaction from being pending without confirmations or paying
excessive fees.
The Lunes ICO will be conducted using the web wallet and mobile wallet. Once
a user stores Bitcoin or Ethereum in the wallet, they can simply buy Lunes tokens. The
coins will be distributed at the end of the ICO.
The wallet also provides several features for the user. As mentioned previously,
the wallet is flexible and can be customized according to the users needs.

6.2 Lunes Wallet features
6.2.1 LUNES MARKET
Inside the Lunes Wallet, there will be an exchange market where the users can
change their cryptocurrency. Although there is an “exchange” within the wallet, the
funds will be fully independent in order to ensure better security for the user.
Balances on a users’ wallets are archived locally for security purposes.
However, users will be able to transfer balances from their wallet onto the exchange
market, allowing them to trade on the exchange without exposing their wallet as a
whole. This feature allows them to do everything on the Lunes Wallet app without
having to access multiple websites.
By the end of the project roadmap, the exchange market available in the
portfolio will become 100% decentralized, further raising the security of the resources.
Users will also be able to schedule purchases and sell orders so they don’t miss any
trading opportunities.

6.2.2 ALERT MODULE
The value alert module has been specially designed for users who like to
track of currency values or to trade. Through this tool, the user can monitor the market
dynamically, without the need to install multiple applications.

Follow several coins
Multiple alarms with triggers in values or percentages
Notifications on the Android/iOS status bar

6.2.3 MULTI COINS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Another feature on the Lunes Wallet is the multi coin management system. This
allows the user to store various cryptocurrencies on the wallet.
The tokens created within Lunes Platform blockchain will have automatic
support in the application. Support for other cryptocurrencies will be added in the
future.

6.2.4 CARD EXPENSES MANAGEMENT
The user will be able to manage and monitor all activities on their prepaid
card. Expenses, balance, and recharges will be within the palm of the user’s hand.
Users will also be able to manage their private label tokens, which are given through
the Lunes loyalty program. In case of loss of the card, the user can cancel the card
through the app itself. User will also be able to recharge their prepaid card with existing
cryptocurrencies in the wallet, instead of having to make an additional purchase.

6.2.5 PAYMENT OF INVOICES AND MOBILE PHONE TOP-UP
Payment services for invoices and cell top-up are going to be available only in
Brazil. The users of the Lunes Wallet can quickly and safely pay for this service with
their cryptocurrency. The wallet will also provide a thorough history of their payments.
The payment can be made by scanning the barcode or by typing their own
phone number. There will be a small fee in order to execute the payment due to the
Lunes Platform liquidating the payment of the desired cryptocurrency into reais
(Brazilian currency).

The user scan or
type the invoice
barcode.

The value in
cryptocurrency
needed to pay the
invoice, and Lunes
fees, is deducted of
its wallet.

Lunes pay the
invoice in the bank
system.

The long-term goal is to provide several other services, such as TED, for the
convenience of users.

7.Lunes
Truth
The Lunes Truth works as a digital register oﬃce on our own blockchain and allows companies and
people to make authentic records by utilizing a safe, fast, and totally decentralized system.
Our system has a set of secure algorithms that allows the user to be registered permanently and
without risk on our platform. However, there is a small fee to pay when logging or signing one of our plans.
Thus, we will use our cryptocurrency, Lunes, as the fuel for the validation of registers within our unchanging
blockchain network.
The annual revenue of a traditional Brazilian register oﬃce exceeds the value of R$ 200 million, and the
overall sum of all these establishments in Brazil is in the billions.
In 2015, the total collection reached was R$12 billion, the state with the largest profit was São Paulo,
followed by Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro.
The goal of the Lunes Truth is to use cutting-edge technology to cheapen, simplify, and reduce
bureaucracy that currently exists when using a register oﬃce.

7.1 AUTHENTICITY RECORDS
Another feature of the Lunes Wallet is being able to register documents. These
documents will be recorded as a digital format with a timestamp to show authenticity
and proof. Any type of document will be able to be stored on the blockchain whether it
be art, declarations, proposals, reports contracts, etc.

Users generate a ‘ h
hash
h ‘ – File
l identifi
d
er
code – which is based on the binary
content of it and serves as a single
fingerprint.

Recording that
information within the
blockchain.

The immutable and transparent nature of the blockchain allows applications to
prove the existence of a file or document at a certain moment in time.
Some solutions are already being used as a type of digital copyright through
blockchain technology. Users generate a ‘ hash ‘ – File identifier code – which is based
on the binary content of it and serves as a single fingerprint, recording that information
within the blockchain.

11

www.lunes.io
Copyright © 2017 Lunes - Nebulosa, All Rights Reserved

Blockchains which allow the recording of arbitrary messages, can be used for
this purpose, since strings can be embedded in transactions in a special field.
Each block has a time record (timestamp), and each hash represents a specific
file (changing a single character from a document or a pixel of an image results in a
completely different hash).
This is the necessary proof that the file actually existed at the time the hash
was loaded.

7.2 WHAT CAN BE RECORDED WITHIN LUNES TRUTH?
The possibilities are really vast; books, music, sheet music, video, contracts,
certificates, projects, monographs, and many other documents that require
authentication such as proof of authorship or validation.
The Lunes Truth can be extended to store copyrighted documents such as
music, books, and videos. It will also be able to register the physical conditions of
properties or even rental cars before they are delivered to the client.
Through the Lunes Truth, users will be able to make contract records using
their digital signature. They will be able to establish contracts eﬃciently in a few steps.
The user may also launch a contract on the platform where the signatories can be
authenticated by the blockchain of lunes. Another example of the variety of service
applications provided by Lunes Truth is the validation of certificates by schools,
courses, and trainings.

7.3 DOES LUNES TRUTH HAVE LEGAL VALIDITY?
The Lunes Truth has full legal validity under Brazilian and international law.
According to provisional measure MP 2200/2001, provided that both parties agree to
the use of digital certification in their due model, it is considered valid.
It is also stated under the Brazilian civil code, Article 107, that “the validity of
the declaration of will shall not depend on a special way, except when the law expressly
requires.” This means that the method of registration or declaration is not in the law,
therefore making it valid when both parties agree.
Art. 10. Public or private documents, for all legal purposes, are considered to be electronic
documents to which this provisional measure is addressed.
§ 2 The provisions of this provisional measure shall not preclude the use of another means
of attesting the authorship and integrity of documents in electronic form, including those
using certificates not issued by ICP-Brasil, provided that they are accepted by the parties
as valid or accepted by the person to whom the document is opposed.

12

www.lunes.io
Copyright © 2017 Lunes - Nebulosa, All Rights Reserved

In terms of international legality, several laws and jurisdictions support
the validity of the process, the example of UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic
signatures, which aims to effect and facilitate the use of digital signatures, through the
establishment of criteria of technical reliability by equivalence between the digital and
manual signature.
There are still others such as Electronic signatures in Global and National
Commerce Act, federal law approved by the United States Congress and the Personal
information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, a Canadian law related to
information privacy.

7.4 LUNES IDENTITY
Through our applications, we can verify the identity of our users. After the
complete registration, the system creates a blockchain identity that is in the possession
of the user.
If the user wants, he can include personal information and define if they want
this information to be public on the Lunes platform.
Using this unique identity, the user can perform actions on the platform, such
as signing contracts through the app or through the website.
In the case of authentic registration, it would be a great idea for the user to
have information linked to the documents registered, such as an e-mail or a company’s
trademark.
The user will have access through the website or the app Lunes Identity, which
will be made available through Web platforms, Android, and IOS.

7.5 PLANS
We intend to make the digital register oﬃce, Lunes Truth, available so that any
person or company can use the services offered at an affordable and fair price.

LOOSE

CORPORATE

Users who have Lunes Identity will
be able to make their records with
the “loose” plan, in which there will
be no monthly fee. Only one payment
per registration will have to be made
within the platform.

This modality is directed to companies
or other online services that require a
volume of authenticity records, which
can be applied in various activities and
actions.

The customer can use the Lunes platform or integrate with our API into their
system, being a fully flexible solution to any business modality, enabling the company to
use our authenticity services in a scalable way, all at minimal costs.

8. Starting
Point
One of the main goals of the Lunes Platform is to foster and innovate the process of fundraising through
Initial Coin offering (ICOs). The possibilities of this modality of fundraising for projects and companies is just
the beginning.
Today, there is a great debate happening worldwide about this disruptive modality of fundraising. There
are many that think of ICOs as a great innovate way to fundraise while many despise it.
Many people dislike ICOs due to various reasons; lack of transparency, non-effective project deliveries,
scams, frauds and other dozens of related problems. Due to these problems, many projects that show potentials
have been pushed away from the market. Also, causing many investors to lose interest.
For this reason, we have developed the Starting Point. It is a portal where a project will be able to
conduct an ICO and create a token only when a vote is made by users of the Lunes Platform. Users will be able
to leave an evaluation of the project. In simple terms, ICOs will be rated by the community.
The vote will be transparent, decentralized, and recorded through transactions on the blockchain of the
Lunes Platform. That way, any user will be able to verify their suitability.
Our goal is that, with these measures, we can generate good practices throughout the maturation of the
process, increasing the amount of quality projects using total decentralized and transparent regulations.
These standards will be validated by the network itself, in order to create a healthy environment for
investors and reduce the risk of investing in projects that are just conducting an ICO for the money. We intend to
become a reference in the market for launching projects and fundraising.
Launching a project using Starting Point will also offer advantages to the project creators. They will
be able to create a profile for the project, where they can disclose design characteristics, the development
roadmap, the team members, and other information that is essential for the community to evaluate the project.
The creator will be able to provide a number of tokens to encourage users to vote on their project. Also,
a portion of the tokens paid as fees will also be distributed as incentives for voting.
The projects on the Lunes Platform will have a life cycle, with a date of creation and a set deadline for
community evaluations. Once the evaluations are submitted, the creator of the project will distribute or cancel
the distribution of tokens according to the communities decision.
Projects that are approved by the community will be assigned a score. The score will be calculated by a
formula that weighs the amount of votes in favor of the project, the amount of lunes coins in stake or leasing in
the voter’s wallet, and the reputation system.
The reputation system will assign an individual score to each user. This score will be attributed by the
assertiveness of the approval or disapproval of projects. When the voter’s opinion is in agreement with the total
community of voters, the user’s reputation will increase and will receive more rewards as they put more effort
into their evaluations. For example, if they voter disagrees with a project and the project is disapproved, his
reputation will increase.
The scoring formula was designed to ensure the safety and quality of project evaluations, avoiding
spam and repetitions of votes and giving greater relevance to the community’s most active evaluators.
Those who vote and evaluate a project first will earn a reputation bonus, as their opinion will influence

14

www.lunes.io
Copyright © 2017 Lunes - Nebulosa, All Rights Reserved

the opinions of following voters.
Once evaluators place their vote, they can leave a comment about the project. The comment may also
receive votes from the community, which will increase the reputation of the evaluator. The more participatory,
agile, and consistent their evaluations are, the higher their reputation will be.
On Starting Point, the best projects with high scores from the community vote will be highlighted and
distinguished from other projects.
Once a project is launched, the creator will be able to keep the community updated through updating
information on the project’s profile page.
In the future, projects will be able to include milestones for additional distribution of tokens in the event
of community voting approval, when deadlines are met, and when terms on smart contracts are met.
The application of this procedure will be quick and eﬃcient.

The user creates
a token, which
allow it to be
listed on the
Starting Point.

When the project is
published, the vote
process is started.
If in the end of votation period the
most part of the votes are positive,
the project will be approved and listed
to fundraising on the platform.

The community
will evaluate
the project
with positive or
negative votes.

Then records all
the information
about the project
and publish it.

8.1 WHAT IS TOKEN?
Tokens are cryptocurrencies that are created on an already existing blockchain.
For example, tokens are registered and stored on the intellectual property of the creator
of the blockchain. Users of the Lunes Platform will be able to create tokens on the
already existing blockchain.
The goal of the Lunes Platform is to make it simple and easy for users with
no previous knowledge to be able to create their own digital token. With access to all
the technology developed by the Lunes project, users will be able to create tokens on
our blockchain with small costs. The whole process can be completed in less than a

15

www.lunes.io
Copyright © 2017 Lunes - Nebulosa, All Rights Reserved

minute, as Lunes is designed to make token provisioning as simple as possible.
The simplicity that the Lunes Platform is aiming for will be a great solution for
companies that have no previous knowledge on blockchain technology but want to use
it.

9.Smart
Contract
With the recent popularization of the cryptocurrencies, it has become possible to create ways to
strengthen negotiations and contract performances in order to provide reliability in transactions.
Blockchain uses smart contracts, which are automatic agreements in which the parties involved define
the terms independently without the need for agreement or brokerage by third parties, such as intermediaries or
lawyers.
Blockchain technology also uses multi-level encryption to ensure document security. Smart contracts
also allows two or more parties to create contracts autonomously. It uses an algorithm that defines the
clauses, conditions, and punishments of both parties and then is executed automatically, according to the preestablished parameters.
There are several clauses that may be included in a contract, such as the double deposit method.
This method is used in order to protect both parties involved in the contract. Unless both parties come to an
agreement before the contract expires, the funds are “burned” and cannot be accessible ever.
Another option is the Oracle contract which is data dissemination service providers that share data that
can be used within the smart contract. An example would be to use it for financial services such as auctions
where it will collect all the bids and select the highest bid automatically at the end of the auction.
Smart contracts are crucial in blockchain technology as it is the factor that generates independent trust
between both parties, even among anonymous people.

10.Lunes
Market
To understand the importance of a decentralized exchange, it is critical to know the security and
reliability issues that the centralized model brings to the cryptocurrency market. In the conventional exchange
market, all users’ assets are in the guardianship of a third party, which is usually the exchange itself, making
these platforms a great target of hackers who seek vulnerabilities to invade and plunder assets.
Another harmful factor is the lack of reliability of leaving values allocated in their hand, as they can,
overnight, remove their sites and disappear with the client’s capital. Depending on the situation, that person has
no one to turn to.

Some famous cases of invasion or disappearance of resources took place in the centralized exchange
already consolidated in the market, such as Poloniex, Bittrex, MtGox and others.
The Lunes Market proposal is totally different from the models that are available, such as the obsolete
systems of centralized exchanges that dominate the market. Our exchange is decentralized and fully integrated
into blockchain lunes.
At Lunes market, users will be able to trade the tokens created within the Lunes platform, in addition to
cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and others, all in a decentralized way, with the user having full
control of their keys and tokens, different from the process in a traditional exchange.
A token can be used to bring an existing cryptocurrency as an active in Lunes Market. In the case of
Bitcoin, users can deposit and withdraw Bitcoin directly via Lunes client.
The bitcoins exist in blockchain lunes as a token called LBTC and are paired 1:1 with other real digital
coins in a multi-signature portfolio managed by a gateway.
This approach can be implemented for any cryptocurrency and our initial focus is to provide the gateway
between BTC, ETH and LTC.

10.1 HOW DOES IT WORK?
The idea behind decentralized exchanges is that the user’s tokens and
cryptocurrencies are not stored by third-parties. This allows the user to have full control
and security over their funds and investments. Decentralized transactions on these
exchanges occur directly between users (peer to peer).

And performs the
transfer on the
blockchain.

When a user creates
a buy or sell order.

Buy order

Sell order

That order is recorded in a service
called Matcher, which runs on a
Lunes node

This allows the user to be directly in control of their currencies and able to
negotiate in an automated and transparent manner.
The rate of each exchange market transaction will be low and can also be
adjusted according to the volume of user negotiations.

11.Lunes
Prepaid Card
With the Lunes prepaid card, the user will be able to add credits by paying with Lunes or Bitcoin by
simply using their mobile wallet or online Lunes platform. Even people that are not familiar with cryptocurrency
will be able use it due to its simplicity. This allows the user to be able to use their digital funds and assets for
any physical business to purchase whatever they need.

12.Private
Label
Private label card is a type of credit card issued by a retailer and commonly valid only for purchases
from establishments of this retailer.
This service is growing in the retail segment. According to the data from the Brazilian Association of
Credit Card Companies and Services (ABECS), these cards account for more than 12% of the total billing of
credit cards in Brazil. Furthermore, Packaged Facts (the leading market research publisher) estimated that a
total of US $108.6 billion were moved through private label cards in 2013 in the United States.
When offering private label cards, the store generates greater customer loyalty. These do not need to
tamper with your bank history or worry about the credit card limit because the store itself can provide credit
limits and differentiated discounts. The shopkeeper who offers this type of service to his clients helps satisfy
populations that do not use bank services (about 40% of Brazilians). By utilizing private label cards, retailers will
be able to see the growth in number of customers and sales.

12.1 PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD
On the Lunes Platform, the invoices for these cards can be paid with Lunes
or other cryptocurrencies on the platform, by depositing at a bank, or directly with the
retailer.
These cards can also have their own visual identity customized by retailers to
advertise their company and create a loyalty program to provide incentive to their loyal
customers. Examples of incentives would be discounts on their next purchase or a free
meal when they have accumulated enough points.
Credits/Points will be stored in the form of tokens on the Lunes network,
bringing gains in relation to transaction costs, which do not require using the traditional
banking network. This way, it reduces the complexity of managing the loyalty program,
as it will automatically be fully integrated into the private label cards.

12.2 PREPAID PRIVATE LABEL CARD
The Lunes Private Label Prepaid card is going to allow the retailer to have more
control over his cashier, generate special discounts for customers, and eliminate the
problem of defaults.
This will be done by creating a loyalty network with long-term relationships
with customers, increasing their sales and leveraging their profits. The card will be
processed on utilizing blockchain technology on the Lunes Platform.
The tool is excellent for use in networks and franchises as a form of payment
and loyalty. In this case, the cryptocurrency can also be used as a trading currency in
the merchants’ Wallet in TEFs and POS.

12.3 PRIVATE LABEL | PRIVATE TOKENS
Private Label and Private Tokens are one of the innovative features listed on
the Lunes Platform. It is a great method for retailers to create a loyalty program for
their customers. It also drastically reduces the fees that retailers have to pay when
microtransactions are made. By utilizing Private Label and Private Tokens, retailers will
have multiple options for their payment systems and also provide autonomy.
Utilizing the Private Label on the Lunes Platform allows retailers to not worry
about converting their Private Tokens or cryptocurrency into fiat. Retailers will be able
to convert their funds through the Lunes Platform

13.Card Payment
Terminal
The Lunes card machine will be a modern device, with a low-cost appliance for formal and informal
traders. It will allow them to have access to markets with the best rates.
The user can take the device anywhere, as it can be connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or GPS, allowing
them to receive payments from any location at any time.
The device is very compact and lightweight. It will be able to receive a variety of payment methods such
as traditional credit cards and debit cards, as well as cryptocurrencies such as Lunes and Bitcoin.
The user will also be able to choose if they want to receive those cryptocurrencies in fiat or keep it as a
digital currency.

19

14.Lunes Payment
Gateway
The payment gateway is an interface that transmits data swiftly and securely between customers and
retailers by using Lunes. The Lunes Gateway is an excellent facilitator for companies that do online business,
whether it is an e-commerce, marketplace, app, digital game, and many more.
Through this gateway, payments will be processed with cryptocurrency or credit card. The fees charged
by the service are very small, which makes our solution advantageous compared to others in the market.
Lunes Gateway will also protect customer information through encryption, ensuring that the data can
safely travel between the client terminal for the vendor and seller of Lunes.
The payment will be deposited into the seller’s wallet and the seller may choose to receive in it in fiat
or digital currencies. This information is then stored, allowing the trader to have a listing of all transactions
performed.

15.Business
Model
The potential Bitcoin has brought to the world with the application of blockchain and all its disruptive,
philosophical, and economical technological arrangements has enabled any individual to be in control of their
resources in a safe and inclusive way.
This breakout in blockchain technology has allowed users to gain financial and technological freedom
to break the paradigms and centralization of capital and information. The rise of the digital assets market as a
trading currency is starting to be adopted worldwide and its potential continues to grow each year.
But undoubtedly, in order for the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain by people and
companies to become a reality, there needs to be more solutions to make the transition smooth and eﬃcient.
Therefore, it is necessary to increase awareness of the technology in the market for people who are
unaware or cannot understand the intrinsic value of the technological revolution provided by blockchain.
Blockchain technology needs to be more user-friendly and accessible for people who are not familiar
with tech.
We, Lunes, understand these diﬃculties and are not seeking to be another fintech that runs behind the
construction of new technological arrangements. Our goal is to use the power of blockchain and smart contract
to bring solutions to everyone in an easy-to-use manner.
Our goal is to promote technology that can be accessible by any person. We will strive to help retailers
establish their business so that they can make cryptocurrencies a method of payment. We will make it possible
for the consumer to make daily transactions in a safe and friendly way, with a unique experience. We will also
generate a set of resources to solve problems in society through the use of blockchain technology.

current market is not user-friendly and easily accessible for many.
This is where the Lunes Platform will be a game changer. Lunes Platform is focused on using a
revolutionary design to make it easier for new and veteran users. All products of the Lunes Platform seek to
solve problems in a practical and simple method. Even if the user does not have any experience with blockchain

exchange world. Both the ICO and the IPO aim to raise capital, but in the ICO, the return of the investments will
be in digital coins or tokens.

18.1 PRE-ICO
The Pre-ICO is the token sales warm-up that occurs before an ICO. During this
stage, it is possible to obtain the assets at a price below what will be marketed during
an ICO. This is a great opportunity for investors to obtain an excellent valuation.

23.Glossary
If you are a beginner in the world of cryptocurrencies, we recommend reading this small glossary.
It will help your understanding to examine our whitepaper. If you are already investor or studying other
cryptocurrencies, maybe this glossary does not need to be read.
Cryptocurrency: Type of virtual currency that uses encryption to ensure more security in online financial
transactions. They serve to buy products or services on the Internet. They are often also used as a value reserve.
Transactions can be made for anyone who is anywhere in the world, without a minimum or maximum value limit.
We often use the name token for a cryptocurrency, but in some cases tokens can have specific purposes within
a system.
Blockchain: It is a ledger, comparable to the book used in Register oﬃces, in its digitized form. Unlike just a
book, a copy of blockchain can be stored on the computer or device of each of its users.
Smart contract: Smart contracts are written as programming code that can be run on a computer instead of a
document printed with legal language. This code can define strict rules and consequences in the same way as
a traditional legal document, establishing the obligations, benefits and penalties that may be due to either party
in various different circumstances. But, unlike a traditional contract, it can also take information as a production
of other goods, process this information through the rules established in the contract and take any necessary
measures from it as a result.
Wallet: It is where you can keep your cryptocurrencies. Portfolios used in computer are generally called Web
wallets and the one used in a smartphone and other mobile devices, are called mobile wallet.
Scala language: It is a relatively new programming language, which can operate along with other popular
language called java. The scala has good renown, such as be used in sites like twitter and Foursquare.
Proof-of-work: In the cryptocurrencies environment, it is a mathematical operation that must be solved in order
to have access to a data or service. When we think of mining in this style, it is as if we have a mathematical
puzzle, and every block solved, or correctly fit, a reward is given to the machine that performed the correct
calculation.
Proof-of-stake: A system that gives rewards to the user who keeps his coins in his wallet.
Explorer: Site or place, in which the transactions between the cryptocurrencies are registered. There you can
consult the history of shipments and receipts in an online and public way.
Full node: A computer or device that has the full copy of blockchain. When the device accesses the network
through an intermediary, without having the full copy of the network, we call the device as light client.
Seed: It is the key. It is a general password of your account, which should be very well kept and should never be
shown to third parties.
