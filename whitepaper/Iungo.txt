1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
AT IUNGO WE BELIEVE THAT AFFORDABLE INTERNET ACCESS IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT!
The emergence of a plethora of powerful personal and business internet applications has
transformed how businesses and consumers operate. Explosive growth in internet consumption is
being propelled by rapid advances in internet-related infrastructure and services.
Despite the explosive growth, major problems still persist for users to get onto this information
superhighway. One of the problems with local providers and local connectivity is that it limits on
the go usage. Mobile data plans implement usage restrictions and relatively high fees.
WiFi connection problems range from annoying nuances such as localized captive portals and
injected advertisement to dangerous issues such as malicious hotspots and open access points
where more or less everyone can eavesdrop on your unencrypted traffic. Industry bodies and local
providers fail to address the issues of seamless connectivity and roaming.
WHY CAN’T WIFI JUST WORK RELIABLY AND SECURELY?
IUNGO is a globally distributed wireless internet service provider built with the help of a worldwide
community. We are bootstrapping a community where everyone can assume responsibilities and
benefit from the associated rewards for running parts of the service delivery infrastructure.
Members can contribute by installing Public Wi-Fi access points on their premises and/or running
parts of the service infrastructure.
Our network will rely on the existing physical Internet infrastructure to carry end-user traffic and
will form an overlay network with unified end-user identification, authentication and billing
systems. We will use the Ethereum network to build trusted, transparent accounting and payment
infrastructure. Our mobile applications will enable low granularity service usage accounting and
compensation for services rendered. Additionally to the software solution, hardware will be offered
as an option, with pre-setup routers available for those seeking a consumer friendly plug and play
experience.
IUNGO will not limit itself to the technical research and development needed to deploy the
network at global scale, but will also build worldwide recognition of the brand.
A TOKEN BASED ECONOMY POWERED BY A CLOSED LOOP OF INCENTIVES
Supply side participants in the IUNGO Network will be incentivized to provide internet access both
in places with high traffic of smartphone users and remote workers (town centers, cafes, airports)
but also in remote places in the developing world where there was no internet coverage before —
imagine, for example, an enterprising citizen of a remote African village sharing his satellite based
broadband with his community via IUNGO. The advantages for the consumers in the developed
world are obvious; fast, secure, instantaneous WiFI internet access wherever they are in the world.
No forms to fill in, no risk of personal data being stolen, no extortionate hidden roaming charges.

power of collaboration with blockchain payments, this market is ripe for disruption.

2. MARKET OPPORTUNITY
The Global Internet Service Providers industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the global
economy. Explosive growth is being propelled by rapid advancements in internet-related
infrastructure and services, as the emergence of a plethora of powerful personal and business
internet applications has transformed how businesses and consumers operate. Rapidly rising
demand for broadband internet access and continued investment in wired internet infrastructure
have helped propel the industry forward.
According to IBIS World research, the annual growth rate between 2012 and 2017 was 8.8%. The
majority of Internet service providers are multi billion dollar Telecommunications companies like
AT&T, Verizon and China mobile.

REGIONALLY BASED PROVIDERS

Most of these Telcos and ISP’s are regionally based with no convenient services for today’s new
generation of freelance workers, digital nomads, travelers, vloggers, etc. It is a significant problem
for them to access reliable and sufficient internet services outside of their home country. Wi-Fi
password hunting, filling forms in airports and public spaces, unknown security or payment
options, poor download and upload speeds and data usage restrictions causing not just
inconvenience but a measurable and material waste of time, energy and money.

2.2. SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESS NEEDS
WiFi is now a must have amenity for every consumer-facing business, but for venue owners,
providing a reliable WiFi service is difficult. Today’s market offers a wide range of guest WiFi
solutions, but they are neither cheap nor simple for a small business to use. Hotspot management
tools suffer from usage complexity, user base disparity and zero brand recognition. The WiFi
experience and monetization models are subpar solutions at best lacking centralized
management, operational tools and usage stats. There is no existing service which provides easy
Plug & Play usage and marketing tools.

2.3. NETWORK EXPANSION AND CAPACITY
As the demand for mobile broadband services continues to explode, mobile wireless networks
must greatly expand their capacities. Simultaneously, the revenues generated from data traffic are
falling. In this context, service providers are calling for network strategies that alleviate the CAPEX
burden of satisfying this demand. One effective method of spectrum reuse by which mobile
networks may be able to accommodate this exponential growth in demand is to offload certain
segments of their traffic onto Wi-Fi networks — which are connected by fixed broadband access

lines directly to the Internet. By migrating data traffic from expensive cellular networks to WiFi
infrastructure, WiFi Offload implies dramatic savings on infrastructural costs and also enhances the
user connectivity experience while providing value-added WiFi services.
Wi-Fi offload allows the portion of data traffic emanating from the mobile device that is destined
directly for the Internet to be injected immediately into the Internet for routing to its final
destination. This traffic never touches the mobile operator's core network. Also Wi-Fi offload uses
unlicensed spectra. Further, Wi-Fi has access to a very substantial amount of spectrum — with
allocations of several hundred MHz in the 2400 MHz and 5000 MHz bands. Because of the low
permitted power of Wi-Fi signals, it is possible to make very substantial reuse of these frequencies.
To take advantage of this, many mobile wireless devices are capable of connecting to local Wi-Fi
networks in addition to signals from cell towers.
WiFi is now a must have amenity for every consumer-facing business, but for venue owners,
providing a WiFi service that adds value beyond connectivity while complying with regulations is
difficult. Complete WiFi service packages offer centralized management, and operation from the
cloud, easy integration into the service portfolio, compliance with security and regulatory
obligations and increased revenue. Revenue could be increased directly by selling WiFi access or
upselling it as a part of package.
Alternatively, additional charges for WiFi are not applicable in some markets due to the broad
availability and competitive prices for LTE. But even in these situations, small and medium
companies would benefit from a complete managed WiFi services toolkit for marketing purposes.

3. BUSINESS MODEL
IUNGO will operate initially with a freemium concept. We are used to having free WiFi (in the
developed world), but instead of standard security for providers and users, some premium services
will come at a cost. For users premium services will include VPN for Total Privacy, Enterprise grade
security for traveling professionals and extreme high speed. For businesses the premium services
will include Marketing tools like user emailing services and in app advertising. Premium services
will be paid for in IUNGO tokens by both users and providers via the IUNGO wallet.
Additionally, our software will allow us to integrate third party apps and services for both users and
business. These third party services will also leverage IUNGO tokens for payment, therefore creating
an ecosystem of applications operating on top of the core IUNGO protocol framework.
IUNGO will charge a 3% transaction fee from WiFi service providers, or Third party services.
Additionally 1% will go to the Service Gateway operator (anyone can operate service gateways). This
one percent will be distributed equally between all service gateways in a situation where multiple
gateways are involved in the transaction chain. Additionally, 1% may go to local evangelists as a
referral bonus. The remaining 95% (or 96% in cases when there is no referrer) of the end user
payment will go to the WiFi service provider.

6. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
6.1.

OVERVIEW

The IUNGO will provide public Wi-Fi access. Service providers will be deploying Wi-Fi sites by
installing and registering access points for public use. Service consumers will be able to use the
IUNGO mobile wallet application or the IUNGO website to locate sites providing access to the
IUNGO network. When in radio proximity to an active access point, a consumer's device will access
internet services and pay for services used. There will be two levels of access security and two
pay ment methods available. High
communication security and more
flexible payment terms will be available
to end users willing to install a IUNGO
mobile wallet application. A fallback
browser based authentication and
payment method will be available via
IUNGO cloud wallet for those without the
m o b i l e a p p l i ca t i o n i n s t a l l e d . A l l
payments will be Token based and
cleared on the public Ethereum network.
Wi-Fi access will be delivered by Wi-Fi
access points installed and operated by

service providers (IUNGO community members). Access points will provide customer devices with
physical access to the Internet directly, via existing connections to Internet Service Providers or
indirectly via transport gateways operated by service providers having carrier status (with legal
immunity from liability in respect to content transferred). Due to limited hardware resources,
access points will offload all end-user identity verification and payment transaction to service
gateways.
Anyone conforming to the qualification requirements and IUNGO operations rules will be able to
operate service gateways and reap the associated rewards. Service gateway operators will be able
to define their own schemes for how they compensate service providers for services rendered.
IUNGO ORG will be operating the service gateways taking fixed commission from actual payments
received from consumers. There is a trust based relationship between the service provider and
service gateway operator. Service providers can freely choose which service gateway to pair with.
Payments from wallets to service gateways will use zero trust state channel based payments.
Payments from service gateways to service providers will rely on trust between them.
You would not be mistaken if the IUNGO service gateway operations looks to you very similar to
the Ethereum mining pool operations: you have miners (providers) running mining rigs (access
points) contributing work (giving access to internet) to a benefit of a pool (service gateway). The
pool (service gateway) operator reaps reward for a block mined (services provided), keeps the
commission and distribute rewards to miner(s) (provider(s)). This model enables creative and
competitive reward distribution schemes to flourish.

6.2. WI-FI DEPLOYMENT SITES
The deployment site is a physical location where access points will be installed by, or on behalf of
the site operator. Access points will provide a physical connectivity layer to the internet. Depending
on the size of deployment site, it may take one to many access points to provide a good quality
service. To address different deployment site scale requirements, three deployment strategies will
be pursued.

In very small sites off the shelf wireless routers running IUNGO provided custom firmware will be
directly connected to local internet service provider. A selected set of the wireless router models
will be supported by custom firmware to act as IUNGO network compatible access points. For
average sized sites up to 8 access points can be daisy chained to cover a larger area. The access
points will be able to detect daisy chained neighbors and auto-configure the bridging mode to
relay traffic to the next neighbor while the nearest one to the ISP will function as site controller.
Small and normal sized site access points will have a dedicated port to connect the site owner’s
network devices (like Point of Sale equipment, video cameras, etc.) which will be completely
isolated from the wireless network. For bigger sites (hotels, exhibition venues) with many access
points installed a dedicated IUNGO site controller will be used to manage the site. Only enterprise
class access points with original vendor supplied firmware and sufficient capabilities or IUNGO
partner provided IUNGO network compatible access points will be supported in big sites to reduce
the chances of hard to debug problems. Additionally — subject to compatibility of existing access
points/switches in an existing Wi-Fi deployment site — a IUNGO site controller may be installed to
add IUNGO network capability to an existing Wi-Fi deployment site. IUNGO network compatible
access points and site controllers will be made available for purchase from IUNGO ORG partners.
Very small sites will have a single access point paired with a service gateway. Average size sites will
have only the access point directly connected to internet service provider and acting as site
controller paired with service gateway. On bigger sites only the site controller will be paired.
Two Wi-Fi networks (SSIDs) will be served by each access point: one open/unencrypted network
and one authenticated/encrypted network. Only open/unencrypted network announcement
beacons will be broadcasted. No network advertisement beacons will be broadcasted by access
points until the control channel to service gateway is established to reduce waste of time / battery
charge of consumers connecting to an access point without access to internet. Unencrypted
wireless network will greet users with a captive portal and will offer users to choose either to install
a mobile wallet application (to become able to connect to the secured network) or to connect to a
secured IUNGO cloud wallet to pay and continue using unsecured Wi-Fi network service.
Authenticated and encrypted network will only serve customers who have a mobile wallet
installed.
A custom firmware for wireless routers will run a Linux based environment build on top of
OpenWrt project. Wireless interfaces will be managed by hostapd daemon. The IUNGO developed
local RADIUS daemon will serve hostapd to authenticate mobile wallet users using an EAP-TLS
authentication scheme and will derive encryption keys for each Wi-Fi client session. Each RADIUS
server (running in access point or site controller) will have a security certificate installed. A captive
portal agent will take over DNS/HTTP traffic on unencrypted wireless network interface and will
redirect consumers to the IUNGO wallet page until network access restrictions are lifted. API
daemon will expose HTTPS based API used by mobile wallet and cloud wallet to communicate
with service gateway serving a site and all other IUNGO services. A control agent will keep live
connection to a service gateway and will control user access to the internet based on commands

received from the service gateway. A similar set of software will be deployed on the site controller.
SERVICE PROVIDER RISKS:

•

Monthly payments;

•

Cheating/attacks by users (no payment for usage from IUNGO) — solution: constant
network improvements, monitoring tools, client support (investigate reported issues);

•

Single payment gateway for initial V1;

•

Service gateway takes risks (places customer money into blockchain).

6.3. IUNGO MOBILE WALLET
The IUNGO mobile wallet is a dedicated software application which enables seamless connectivity
to the IUNGO network. When permitted by the consumer, it will connect to any IUNGO access
point or public IUNGO web-service and will download the dataset of any IUNGO Wi-Fi sites
available nearby. The downloaded dataset will be cached by the application for later use. The
application user will be able to see all IUNGO enabled Wi-Fi sites and associated information on
the map. The IUNGO mobile wallet will be able to login to existing IUNGO cloud wallet accounts
using a remote identity or create and use a locally generated identity. The cloud wallet account
can also be used to backup/restore encrypted locally generated identities. When use of a local
identity is preferred, the application will generate a cryptographically secure pair of keys and will
create a self-signed X.509 standard based certificate to represent end-user client identity to TLS
servers.
When enabled, the wallet application will start monitoring signal levels of all available IUNGO
access points. Wallet users will be able to define automatic connection policies with parameters
such as the highest acceptable price per MB/per minute, lowest acceptable bandwidth, whether
to give away your verified personal information (like name/surname, e-mail address, age, phone
number) in exchange for internet access subsidized by access point operator or to disable
automatic connections altogether. When in automatic connection mode the application will track
the quality of the currently connected session and the quality of beacons received from other
available access points. It will automatically switch over to other access points with better signal/
noise ratio and matching connectivity policy when such an access point becomes available within
radio reach. After associating with the preferred access point, the wallet application requests
provisioning of internet access by negotiating service/payment terms with service gateway via an
API reachable via the access point and by paying each time the previously paid amount is used-up.
The mobile wallet tracks session length and the amount of information transferred to share service
usage information with the reputation service. When in manual mode, the wallet will present the
user with all connectivity choices available and will connect only with the user’s consent.
This application will gradually be made available on the majority of popular operating systems and
platforms like android, iOS, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux.

6.4. IUNGO CLOUD WALLET
The IUNGO cloud wallet is a web service created and operated by IUNGO ORG. The cloud wallet
service enables access to the IUNGO powered network when the mobile wallet application is not
installed on the consumer’s device or mobile wallet application is not available on device’s
platform. The cloud wallet service will be freely accessible via public internet and via any IUNGO
access point. When accessing a service site a consumer will be given the choice to either use an
existing wallet account or create a new one by filling in the account registration form. After logging
in to an existing or new account, a single page JavaScript app will be loaded to present a graphical
user interface. It enables consumers to create additional identities, top-up their Token accounts
tied to identities, transfer Tokens between accounts and to pay for access on IUNGO enabled Wi-Fi
sites. Users will be able to use this interface to top-up their Token account by purchasing tokens
with their credit card and possibly other integrated payment methods. Additionally, a criteria
based searchable map of all other IUNGO powered Wi-Fi deployment sites will be available in the
web app.
In case no mobile wallet has been installed on the mobile device, the consumers must explicitly
direct their device to connect to the open IUNGO network.

When connected a captive portal

software running on the access point will redirect all attempts to visit http sites to IUNGO’s cloud
wallet webpage. After logging in to the secure cloud wallet, the user will be presented with
services available on the currently used access point and respective service prices. The consumer
will be able to choose their preferred service type (subsidized/paid per time/paid per amount of
data transferred) and optionally set a comfortable amount to spend (which automatically limits
time available or enforces a data transfer quota). The session duration and data amount transferred
will be displayed during the active session. Consumers will be able to stop the service delivery and
additional payments at any time with the push of the button.
In the background, the web application running in the browser will establish (Cross Origin
Resource Sharing) connections to both the Access point API and to the Cloud wallet API. It then
will start forwarding encrypted communication messages between the Access Point and Cloud
Wallet establishing a relayed communication channel between the two. The cloud wallet will use
this communication channel to emulate a mobile wallet and will use the same API on access
point to identify and authenticate the deployment site, learn services available, negotiate and pay
for services rendered. After all parties are identified and authenticated a direct channel between
cloud wallet service and service gateway serving access point may be established to reduce latency
overhead of indirect communications.

6.5. PAYMENTS
PAYMENT CHANNELS
Payments in IUNGO network will be token or fiat currency based.

To open a payment channel one party will freeze a selected amount of tokens for the benefit of a
receiving party. A selected amount can also be equal to zero. This frozen amount can be increased
on-chain by the sending party at any time. However, there will be no way to return frozen tokens
back to the sender’s account. By monitoring events emitted by the Token contract, the receiver can
detect payment channel creation events and track the amount of Tokens frozen. When the
sending party decides to send an amount to the receiving party, it generates a signed offer
confirming an un-revocable intend to part with specified amount of Tokens to the benefit of the
receiver and sends this message off-chain to the receiver. The message contains the sender’s
address, the receiver’s address, the per sender-receiver pair tracked serial number of the offer, the
amount sent, a hash of previous attributes, the sender’s digital signature over hash and an opaque,
unsigned bytestring to carry the reason for payment. By reusing a serial number, the sender can
increase the amount sent and update the reason for sending until actively requested by the
receiver to use new serial number for further payments. To settle the state on-chain the receiver
must sign the best offer received from the sender and invoke the Token contract with the
countersigned offer as an argument.
When invoked to settle the offer the Token contract will check if the settlement should be
processed. First, both signatures are checked for validity and the signers match sender and
receiver. Then the offer serial number is checked to determine if it is greater than the last offer
processed by the contract to reject repeated attempts to settle the same offer. Subsequently, the

frozen plus balance amount of the sender’s account is checked to verify it is greater than amount
offered. If all checks are passed, the serial number of the offer is saved in the state memory of the
Token contract, the commission for IUNGO ORG is calculated, the amount promised is deducted
from sender’s account and the amount minus commission is deposited to receiver’s account. The
commission amount is deposited to the benefit of IUNGO ORG. It should be noted that an offer
and all signatures are passed as input to settlement function so that the contract can be invoked
by any 3rd party willing to pay for the gas used and still produce expected results. Service gateways
will act as an intermediary between wallets and the blockchain and will cover transaction gas
costs.
The zero risk guarantee does not come without some responsibilities on the receiving side. The
receiver should always track the amounts frozen and offered by the sender and refuse to accept
payment offers not covered by the frozen amount if it expects zero risk of not being payed. The
zero risk payment scheme allows the sender to trade the costs of updating the frozen amount (by
invoking the contract) on-chain more often for less risk of leaving unused tokens frozen. It also
helps to reduce the contract invocation gas costs covered by the receiver by being more time
tolerant. The receiver can trade a lower gas price for a longer wait time that the transaction will
spend in pending transaction pool without increasing the risk of not being paid.
The same payment mechanism can be reused for payment channels based on trust. In a trust
based payment channel case the sender does not freeze any tokens. The sender sends signed
payment offers in the same way it would be done in the zero trust scheme. It is up to the receiver
to track the amount left in the sender’s account and select the best time to settle on-chain. In this
use case, the receiver is never guaranteed that the sent amount will be available for settlement.
PAYMENT CHANNEL NETWORK
We anticipate that a limited number of parties will be willing to operate service gateway serving a
more significant number of deployment sites used by a substantial amount of consumers. The
chances of the same consumer consuming services provided by the same provider are too slim to
require a direct payment channel between the consumer and the service provider. To reduce the
total number of payment channels it takes to pay for the services, it makes sense for consumers to
open zero risk payment channels only to the benefit of service gateways. Service gateways will
create a zero risk payment channel mesh between themselves to facilitate expedited payments for
their users. Service gateways will open trust based payment channels to process these payments to
service providers.

Two payment scenarios become possible: direct and transitive. In the direct payment scenario a
single gateway has a payment channel to both the consumer’s account and the service provider’s
account open. In case a direct payment is possible it is up to service gateway to decide how the
reward will be divided between the service gateway and service provider. In the transitive payment
scenario, a serving gateway only has a channel to the service provider and payments from the
consumer’s account can only be organized with some assistance from the service gateway who
has a payment channel with the consumer. The implementation of transitive payments will be
based on hashed time lock concept. In case of a transitive payment scenario, a service gateway on
the consumer’s end can keep a protocol fixed 0.5% commission for assisting payments to come
through.

6.6. SERVICES
The IUNGO network’s functionality relies on several services. When connected to any of the IUNGO
network’s access points, the customer’s mobile device can interact with some of these services
even when internet access is administratively prohibited. The freely available services include site
location discovery and mobile wallet.
SITE REGISTRY SERVICE. All access points/site controllers will be paired with SGW’s. When an
access point or site controller is paired with a service gateway the ( geographical WGS84 and street

address based) location information of the deployment site and a list of all BSSIDs of each access
point in the deployment site is provided by the service provider. Additionally, all available services
and service pricing information is recorded after the pairing procedure is complete. The service
provider will be allowed to change service list and pricing information no more often than once in
24 hours. Each service gateway will collect and share site registration data with other service
gateways. Every service gateway will collect site registration data from all other service gateways to
render a complete list of all deployment sites available around the world. This data will be made
available to consumers via site locator service.
REPUTATION REGISTRY. Access points will record user session details like start/end timestamps of
each session, the amount of data transferred and will report it to service gateways. The mobile
wallet service will also gather same session details and will send it to service gateways for
comparison. Service gateways will collect and relay session data collected from deployment sites
and mobile wallet users to the IUNGO reputation registry. The reputation registry will run
mediation process and will use complete event detection on gathered information to detect and
filter out possible reputation fraud. It then will calculate a reputation score (including reputation
score error range) for each site. The reputation score for each site will be made available to service
gateways.
The SITE LOCATOR SERVICE provides access to the site registry database. It will share detailed
information of nearby sites with IUNGO consumers using the mobile wallet or visiting the IUNGO
public internet site. Site information includes physical geo location, street address, services
available (subsidized, paid per time, paid per MB) and their respective prices, IUNGO reputation
score value with error range and a site description supplied by the service provider.
CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY. IUNGO ORG will manage Public Key Infrastructure used to secure
access to the network. IUNGO ORG operated Network CA will act as a trust anchor to wallets and
mobile device Wi-Fi WPA supplicants to ensure consumer’s device is connecting to a legitimate
access point (participating in IUNGO network). The Network CA will sub-delegate certification
rights to service gateways to issue certificates to access points/site controllers. The certificate
lifetime will be limited to one month for access points/site controllers and 6 months for service
gateways. Certificate revocation published by Network CA will describe all revoked service gateway
certificates.

6.7. INFRASTRUCTURE ENTITIES
TRANSPORT GATEWAY. Service providers may be limited by service agreements with their internet
service providers to not provide service to unknown 3rd parties and also

can be held legally

responsible for behavior of their end users. To limit exposure to legal risk, service providers may
choose to redirect all end user internet traffic through a transport gateway operated by other
parties and/or other countries. There are many options with different tradeoffs of what kind of
transport protocols should be used and what legal risk types need to be avoided. We will conduct

further research on needs and options related to how transport gateways will be integrated into
the IUNGO network during the MVP phase.
SERVICE GATEWAYS. The service gateway is actually a collection of services acting in concert with
deployment site hardware and other service gateways to enable a unified global user experience. It
plays a major role in the IUNGO network as a middle ground solution where most of the cost
reduction and performance scaling benefits of a centralized service can be had without sacrificing
diversity and service availability. Each qualified service gateway operator will have a chance to
come up with creative approaches to user onboarding to stay competitive. Running a service
gateway comes with it’s costs: operators will need hardware resources to run the software, low
latency high bandwidth connection to internet. Strict adherence to IUNGO operations rules
covering allowed and disallowed operational practices will be enforced by IUNGO ORG in order to
protect the legitimate interests of the service consumers.
The service gateway will at least run a node of distributed site registry, reputation data collection
agent, one to many instances of site-locator service, an intermediate certificate authority, a web
based management site for service providers and an Ethereum node. IUNGO will provide open
protocol descriptions for all interfaces used and a dual licensed reference implementation of all
software needed to run basic functioning service gateway. A commercial license will be available
for those seeking to create closed derivatives.
