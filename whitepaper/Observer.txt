KEY
CONCEPT

The OBSERVER is an innovative platform where

individuals and private firms trade daily weather

data. Anyone in the world can trade weather data
that is collected by smartphones, mini weather

stations, or automobiles, and receive OBSERVER
coins as compensation. The quality of the

collected data is verified through big data analysis
technology, and the details are recorded in the

blockchain. This allows the OBSERVER to create

high-resolution weather data that has never been
available before.

The weather market, which has been dominated

by public services, is rapidly growing in size. The

portion of the U.S. GDP that is affected by weather
events is estimated to be $1,334 billion annually,

estimated to be at roughly $13 billion (NWS Enterprise

National Weather Service is in the range of a billion
dollars, and the aggregated amount of weather-

related budgets for countries that operate weather
observation networks is estimated to be at several

billion dollars. Considering the recent M&A of major

weather companies, the capitalization of the private
weather industry is estimated to be above $9 billion

and is growing at a rate of 10 to 15 percent annually
(University Corporation for Atmospheric Research).

IBM and Monsanto recently entered the weather

business by acquiring weather companies, further
growth potential. In 2016, IBM purchased The
Weather Company for $2 billion. IBM is now

combining its global cloud with The Weather

Company’s data, which enables enterprise clients to

access weather-related big data solutions. Monsanto,
a leading provider of agricultural products, acquired
The Climate Corporation in 2013 for approximately
$930 million. Monsanto has achieved a higher
corporate value by integrating its expertise in

agriculture analytics with The Climate Corporation’s
weather data.

Weather data is creating value in a wide spectrum

of sectors. Along with business analytics, it has

also become a prominent factor in the corporate
decision-making process.

OBSERVER BUSINESS NOTE

Agriculture

Weather is an important factor for agricultural

productivity, as it is necessary to monitor, analyze,
and predict the weather to maximize crop yields
and mitigate losses from unforeseen disasters.
Large agriculture companies are already using

weather data in order to optimize yields, reduce

environmental impacts and cut operational costs.

Energy &
Power Generation
By using weather data, power companies are able

to overcome challenges like volatile energy prices,

rising pressure from environmental activists and the
growing use of alternative energy sources. Large

power companies, in particular, can take advantage
of weather data to better manage its plants and
power distribution.

Insurance

Weather data enables insurance companies to

create and develop weather-based products. It also
plays a key role in establishing a compensation

model for weather-related insurance (e.g., storm and
flood insurance).

Retail &
Wholesale

Weather, like air temperature and rainfall, can cause

great changes in customers’ buying patterns. Retailers
and wholesalers are monitoring the weather to

maximize sales and better manage their inventories.

Airlines

Airlines are using weather data to prevent flight

delays and cancellations. Weather data is also being

used for various purposes such as in steering aircraft,
controlling air traffic, and maintaining runways to
ensure flight safety and logistical efficiency.

Traval &
Leisure

Accurate weather information is essential for

developers of travel and leisure products, as it
enables them to plan activities and minimize

potential losses due to the unexpected weather.

Financial
Investment

Weather data is already a contributing factor in

investment decisions. Customized weather data

enables investors to evaluate companies in weathersensitive sectors (i.e., energy, agriculture, insurance,
transportation and distribution).

Disaster
Prevention
and Management
Weather information is closely monitored and

analyzed by government agencies and international

organizations that are committed to protecting people
from natural disasters. Weather data helps them

predict natural disasters and devise an emergency
plan for each stage of prevention and evacuation.

Hyper-local weather observations

CROWD-SOURCED
WEATHER DATA

The biggest challenge facing weather companies

is the lack of hyper-local weather data. While macro

data is widely available, hyper-local data still remains
very limited. Attempts have been made but have

not been successful partly due to the absence of a

proper compensation scheme that motivates people

to provide region-specific weather data. Even in cases
where data is collected by volunteer observers, data
reliability issues have hindered its commercial use.

OBSERVER
BUSINESS MODEL
The OBSERVER is founded on the vision that

“anyone can produce weather observations and
purchase them at a reasonable price.” Weather

observations are made worldwide on a timely basis,

weather services that require large initial investments

A NEW
PARADIGM

individuals and private firms to make their own

weather stations across the world and is using real-

with data being made available to the public without
government interference. Big data technology allows
for a systematic data management, while blockchain
platform enables a transparent data exchange.

To achieve this goal, the OBSERVER collects data,

conducts quality control and develops standards
for data transactions. Unlike public and industry

in sophisticated instruments, crowdsourcing enables

time data to feed a multi-billion dollar weather

observations at any place and time.

Weather observation is already an indispensable

part of people’s daily lives. For example, a person can
measure air temperature or pressure by using his/her
smartphone and share the data online. In other

words, without any expensive instrument or expertise,
individuals can measure meteorological conditions

and instantly send out their data via worldwide cable
and wireless networks. This may help overcome the

limitations of existing public observation systems and
inefficient data exchange platforms.

The Weather Company has access to over 200,000

industry. The OBSERVER aims to broaden such

weather networks by including over three billion

smartphones, one billion automobiles, 20,000 aircraft,
50,000 vessels, and countless private weather stations
across the world. Individuals and private firms could
easily collect and share their data by using simple

instruments that do not require sophisticated skill
sets. Once the collected data is quality checked,
the data can be sold in real time to both private

and public sectors. All transactions take place on a
blockchain platform in a transparent manner.

OBSERVER
ECOSYSTEM

Observer Platform

The OBSERVER ecosystem consists of data

providers, buyers, and the OBSERVER foundation.
Data providers send real-time observations to the
OBSERVER foundation where observations are

quality controlled with big data technology and

processed into the database. Once verified, data

providers receive payment in OBSERVER coin (OBSR),
and buyers purchase the data with OBSR.

Since the OBSERVER foundation accepts data from

many different sources, quality control is critical. All
data is subject to quality control by the OBSERVER

foundation. Although this may seem different from

the idea of a decentralized blockchain platform, it is
a necessary move to ensure data quality.

Buyers of historical and real-time weather data

could be individuals, companies or government.

Customers, like weather service providers, can process
OBSERVER’s data to offer real-time information on

urban weather. Weather information obtained from
automobiles can be directly applied to automobile

navigation systems. By combining OBSERVER’s data
with AI technology (e.g., IBM’s Watson and Google’s

deep learning algorithm), weather service providers

can make hyper-local short-range weather forecasts.
Daily observations can be also purchased by

government agencies in agriculture, energy, disaster
prevention and public services. Among others, the

data archived in the OBSERVER foundation can be
useful for local governments looking to develop
smart cities.

Airlines and ship routing companies can take great

advantages of OBSERVER’s real-time weather data

as well. Airlines can use OBSERVER’s data to check
airport weather and monitor clear air turbulence.
As for ship routing companies, they can monitor
real-time weather and marine conditions with
OBSERVER’s data.

Observer Business Expansion Strategy

As the observer's business expands, various

observers participate in the world and real-time

data related to the world's weather is collected in

the observer. In addition to the platform business

to purchase and use collected weather information,
the Observer Foundation can provide data suitable
for the use of various individuals, companies

and buyers such as retail, leisure, energy, airline
business, and autonomous driving business. We

will further invest and improve our data collection,
analysis, and processing technologies.
