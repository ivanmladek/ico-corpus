1. Our Vision: ”Cryptocurrencies for Everyone!”
savedroid, the award-winning German FinTech specialized in artificial intelligence (“AI”)
saving technology, has geared up to democratize cryptocurrencies: savedroid will
create a unique AI fueled ecosystem of crypto saving and investing for the
masses. Users will profit from easy access to AI-based crypto saving plans in Bitcoin,
Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, IOTA, Dash, Stellar, etc. and superior crypto
investment opportunities, such as portfolios, derivatives, and ICOs, without any
technological adoption barriers. savedroid eliminates today’s complex and painful
processes by creating a smart User Experience (“UX”), which conveniently auto-converts
savings to cryptocurrencies, securely stores them, and makes them easily accessible,
tradeable, and spendable. Hence, savedroid is the first German ICO1 driving crypto
inclusion.
savedroid will leverage its existing core assets of state-of-the-art AI technology
and great UX based on maximum simplification and emotional gamification to
deliver this exceptional value proposition. In fact, savedroid is the very first ICO of a
German stock corporation that follows German legislation and regulation to provide
participants with the highest level of security.
So, join us in making the crypto world accessible for the masses and finally democratize
financial services: Give power to the people!

savedroid is committed to a clear roadmap leveraging its existing core assets:
TODAY

AI platform for saving and spending in fiat: Self-learning AI algorithm
analyzing and optimizing users' personal finances to fulfil their wishes
and maximize their lifestyle with 200K+ app downloads, 10M+ saving
transactions, 4.2 app rating and 97% recommendation rate based on great
UX, renowned B2B-Partners such as Deutsche Börse, Wirecard, etc., and an

Initial Coin Offering - although savedroid will offer a token and not a coin, we use ICO as a more common
synonym in our communication. In this Whitepaper we will usually use the more correct technical
expression Initial Token Sale (“ITS”).

experienced diverse team of AI, UX, Tech, Finance, and Marketing experts.
2018

Self-learning AI algorithm enabling convenient crypto saving in Bitcoin,
Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, IOTA, Dash, Stellar, etc.,
providing easy access without technological barriers.

2019

Self-learning AI algorithm enabling smart saving and spending in and
across cryptocurrencies, providing hassle-free crypto trading and
payments.

2020

Self-learning AI algorithm enabling smart investments in cryptocurrency
portfolios, futures, and ICOs, providing cost-efficient and diversified
returns.

Following this roadmap savedroid brings crypto saving and investing to the masses.
Thereby, savedroid consistently extends its value proposition of enabling users to
maximize their lifestyle and fulfil their wishes by saving more and spending less without
even thinking about it. Through expanding the savedroid ecosystem to cryptos,
savedroid finally provides average mass market users – like our existing user base
– with easy access to cryptocurrencies and enables them to participate in the huge
crypto opportunity to fulfil their wishes even faster.

Cryptocurrencies offer many advantages: They are fully decentralized and, hence, no
bank can charge high fees and no government can take them away, they are fast and
offer immediate settlement, and they are also very safe, just to name a few.2 There is
only one problem: complex technological adoption barriers for average mass
market users. Therefore, the world needs a crypto simplifier!

Currently, the crypto world is like a deep jungle for many who have not grown up with
Bitcoin, wallets, tokens, etc. The incredible hype around Bitcoin has raised many
people’s attention. But, still, the adoption barriers for mass market users are extremely
high. Just think about the cumbersome selection of a crypto exchange, the registration,
selecting and maintaining a wallet, and storing and handling private keys.
Honestly, the user experience along the entire user journey completely sucks –
and, even worse, it keeps many from getting into cryptocurrency investments. No
doubt, there are great crypto companies with cool products out on the market. But we
at savedroid firmly believe that dealing with cryptocurrencies has to become much
easier in order to reach the next growth step and make cryptos available to the masses.
That’s why we are upgrading our mobile app to make cryptocurrency saving and
investing just as simple as taking a photo. Our mission is to eliminate existing
adoption barriers and make cryptocurrencies accessible for everyone. savedroid
will offer smart and convenient crypto saving and investing. Absolutely no need for
separate crypto exchanges, personal wallets, and private key handling. We aim to
reduce the complexity of crypto savings and investments to a level that the mass market
already knows and accepts when dealing with personal finances. This is simplification
to the max. We call it the democratization of cryptocurrencies.

savedroid is the right player to make it happen: Founded in Q4 2015 in
Frankfurt/Germany, savedroid has built a proven track record of its capabilities to
simplify traditional financial savings processes and drive mass market adoption.
savedroid has successfully launched Europe’s first AI-based savings app, which has
generated more than 200K+ downloads and more than 10M saving transactions since
its launch in October 2016. savedroid creates significant economic value for mass
market users through offering automated savings, i.e., a self-learning AI algorithm
analyzing users’ checking accounts to identify the savings potential and situational
relevant spend optimization, e.g., a self-learning AI algorithm identifying contract
optimization potential for utilities, mobile, banking, insurances etc.

And this is savedroid’s “secret” sauce: Of course, people know that it would make
sense to put money aside – in theory. Great wishes do need financing. But in real life,
saving money is boring and difficult and it has another major disadvantage: putting
money aside for a future goal prevents people from buying a lot of little goodies right
on the spot. No good. So, in the end, saving money doesn’t feel like a cool thing to do,
especially not for younger people.
Then there is savedroid. We are changing this by connecting the saving transaction
with users’ individual lifestyle, using our AI algorithm. Our approach has three
important parts: Firstly, we make it easy and allow for micro savings. Secondly, we
automate it, so that people don’t have to think about it each time they put money aside.
Thirdly, we connect savings to unique events users personally like or dislike so that
saving becomes emotional and cool.
savedroid’s award-winning AI algorithm is based on self-learning “if-this-thenthat” rules, called smooves. For the start, users define personal saving goals called
“wishes” (e.g., their next summer vacation, a new smartphone or the latest sneakers),
things they want to purchase but can’t afford right now. Then users define personalized
events that trigger saving transactions. To give an example, users can set the smoove:
Save €5.00 every time I go running for at least 3 kilometers. Since the savedroid app is
connected to the user’s fitness tracker, it notices every time you have been for a run.
And since the savedroid app is connected to your bank account as well, it transfers the
money to your savedroid savings account – just like that, fully automated and without
the users needing to do anything. Over time, savedroid’s AI learns more about the
individual user preferences and suggests personalized smooves to further
optimize users’ saving and spending habits and enable them to fulfil their wishes
even faster.
In a nutshell, savedroid’s AI makes saving money easy, automated, and cool. And
that is what we will now transfer to cryptocurrencies as well. savedroid will transfer the
DNA of simplifying crypto saving and investing to provide average mass market users
with easy access. savedroid will thereby support the growth of the crypto community
and do its part to make cryptocurrencies the next big thing in our economy.

2. Our Story
2.1. This is savedroid
Within only 2 years, savedroid has already left its mark in the German FinTech space.
We have built an award-winning, cutting-edge AI savings ecosystem that is available for
free on Android and iOS in Germany. The app is targeting a rather younger user group
- 90% between 18 and 44 years - and has registered more than 200K downloads and
multiple millions of saving transactions have been processed so far. We have created
enormous economic value for our mass market users. And high customer satisfaction –
just have a look at our app store ratings:

It is savedroid’s goal to help people with putting money aside in a dedicated savings
account, using personalized AI based savings rules. These rules — also known as
“smooves”, a contraction of “smart saving move” — allow users to turn their everyday
habits, such as exercising, checking their smartphone, using social media apps or
shopping, into pure savings. savedroid has solved the challenge for common people to
save money - it provides smart and fully-automated micro-savings and even spend
optimization – using a self-learning algorithm with a convenient UX understandable for
everybody. Thereby, we successfully democratized everyday savings.
savedroid was selected to be a member of the Deutsche Börse Fintech Hub and
Deutsche Börse Venture Network – a program run by one of the world’s leading stock
exchanges to prepare selected growth companies for an IPO.

Figure 1: Overview of savedroid

2.1.1. Company History
savedroid was founded as a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) in 2015 as part of the
Unibator program of the Goethe University Frankfurt/Germany – the financial center of
the Euro zone. Since then savedroid has raised more than €3M in equity from renowned
investors such as the Investment and Economic Development Bank of Rheinland-Pfalz
(ISB), 360T Group Managing Partner Alfred Schorno, Infosys Germany Founder & former
CEO Debjit D. Chaudhuri and Traxpay Founder Dr. Michael Rundshagen etc. Just a few
months after its foundation savedroid already closed a partnership deal with Wirecard
Bank and delivered the first mobile app with a fully deposit secured savings account.
Not much later, savedroid launched a credit card so that saved money can be spent
easily to purchase the desired wishes.

26.01.2018

In 2017, savedroid closed a growth funding round that helped to boost its customer
base to 200K downloads and more than 10M processed savings transactions. savedroid
now employs a team of 20 professionals.

Figure 2: Age distribution of savedroid’s user base

2.1.2. Core Products
AI-based Saving
Unlike most FinTech companies, savedroid targets the average consumer who does not
want to spend his time doing financial research. savedroid does not address a small
elite group of hardcore financial experts but the vast majority of mobile users (yes, it is
an immense market potential). savedroid’s users are looking for an easy-to-use,
lifestyle-oriented and even fun way of micro-saving to fulfill their wishes, like their next
vacation or new notebook. And who does not need to save some money for bigger ticket
purchases?
Page 11 of 64
savedroid AG

ICO Whitepaper v1.4

26.01.2018

But how does it work? Based on our AI technology, so called “smooves” turn the user’s
everyday activities into automated savings, e.g.: You go for a run – savedroid saves €5.00
for you, you hit the snooze button – we save €0.50 for you, you buy at Amazon – we save
5% for you … and many more.
Via our partner bank Wirecard, we offer every user a free savings account. With every
triggered smoove, a small sum is transferred to the savings account, so that the saved
amount grows day by day.
And the system is working: multiple millions of savings transactions have been triggered
through the savedroid app and multiple millions of euros have been set aside to achieve
our users’ individual wishes and maximize their lifestyle.
Optimization of Spend
savedroid is not only about “saving money” in the meaning of “putting money aside” but
also in the meaning of spending less for everyday costs. Since savedroid’s algorithms
have insight into what kind of transfers the user is making from his bank account, it can
identify what contracts he is paying for. Using this information, savedroid’s self-learning
AI algorithm directly suggest tailor-made offers which are cheaper or provide better
value for money.
Is there a less expensive mobile phone contract available than the one that the user
currently holds, meeting the same or even better conditions? A better electricity or gas
provider? A cheaper credit card? If so, the user will receive a notification together with
an invitation to switch to the new provider, all in-app. This way, savedroid is not only a
micro-savings simplifier but also a personal finance optimizer.
And it is all based on the latest artificial intelligence technology!

2.2. Crypto Services
We will transfer savedroid’s successful and value-adding products into the
cryptocurrency world to enable smart and convenient crypto saving and investing.
In order to eliminate the adoption barriers and make cryptocurrencies accessible for
everyone, savedroid will provide all the tools necessary for its users: tools to purchase
cryptocurrencies, to store cryptocurrencies, to spend cryptocurrencies, and to invest in
cryptocurrencies. Of course, the popular smooves will also be available so that users
can not only save automatically in fiat but directly in cryptocurrencies without any
further hassle!
The final design of the following crypto tools is at savedroid’s sole discretion and may
be adjusted or not offered at all depending, among other factors, on new technical
trends, user demand, availability of business partners, and changes in the regulatory
environment.

2.2.1. Convenient crypto saving
savedroid will extend its proven self-learning AI saving algorithm from fiat to
cryptocurrencies. App users will not have to worry about selecting and registering at a
crypto exchange, selecting and maintaining a compatible wallet, and handling private
keys. After registering in the savedroid app, users can start saving in cryptocurrencies
(Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other Altcoins) right away. They will automatically receive
a virtual, fully secured wallet and all fiat funds that the user wants to covert to
cryptocurrencies will be converted magically in the background to the selected
cryptocurrency.
The crypto saving targets all current savedroid users and young to middle-age mobile
app users who would like to start with cryptocurrencies and value a great user
experience (UX) over a large set of customization options or technical details. So
savedroid will eliminate all currently existing technological adoption barriers and will
finally provide typical mass market users – like our existing user base – with easy access
to cryptocurrencies.

2.2.2. Smart saving and spending in and across cryptocurrencies
savedroid’s self-learning AI algorithm will enable users to smartly switch their savings
between cryptocurrencies and to also conveniently spend their crypto savings to fulfill
their desired wishes at their preferred merchants. Users can, therefore, trade
cryptocurrencies at their fingertips without the need to worry about cumbersome
crypto exchange orders or outrageous bid-ask spreads. The goal is to build an
ecosystem where users can swap cryptocurrencies within the savedroid community at
the lowest cost and best UX available. Also, to make it easier to spend cryptocurrencies
in shops that do not yet offer payment in cryptocurrencies, savedroid will offer its users
a credit card, the “cryptocurrency credit card”, from a major card scheme, to purchase
their wishes. This will significantly extend the functionalities of savedroid’s existing fiat
credit card. Whenever the user makes a purchase with the cryptocurrency credit card,
his cryptocurrencies will be auto-converted to fiat and transferred to the merchant.

savedroid AG

ICO Whitepaper v1.4

26.01.2018

The easy crypto trading as well as the cryptocurrency credit card can also be connected
to users’ external wallets and is thus open for a much broader audience. Hence, both
the crypto trading and the cryptocurrency credit card do not only target the savedroid
crypto saving users but also more experienced cryptocurrency users.

2.2.3. Smart investments in cryptocurrency portfolios, derivatives, and ICOs
To provide cost-efficient and diversified return opportunities, savedroid will enable
users to easily invest their savings in cryptos. Therefore, savedroid will upgrade its AI
and offer a self-learning algorithm to invest in cryptocurrency portfolios, derivatives,
and ICOs directly in the savedroid app. Hence, users can diversify their portfolio in
multiple cryptocurrencies, crypto derivatives, and ICO coins and tokens and profit from
the best risk-return profiles available on the market. This will complement savedroid’s
exceptional crypto value proposition with state-of-the-art crypto investing and cater for
the needs of even the most advanced crypto users.

With this three-staged roadmap, we will consistently leverage our existing core assets
of latest AI technology and great UX to build an AI fueled crypto ecosystem to massively
simplify the usage of cryptos from everyday micro savings over trading and payments
to return optimized investing. Below the line, the savedroid offering will drive crypto
adoption by average mass market users and, thus, help grow the crypto community
even faster and bigger.

2.3. Partner Ecosystem
savedroid has built a very strong ecosystem of renowned partners3, many of them
leaders in their respective field of operations. With these partners, savedroid can not
only offer the best services to its users but can also benefit from the reach, trust and
reliance of its strong partners. We choose our partners based on capability of
innovation, implementation speed, reputation and user focus.
Let’s start with Deutsche Börse. As operator of the trading platform Xetra and the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Deutsche Börse calculates the DAX share index and is listed
with their shares on the DAX. When the Deutsche Börse opened its Fintech Hub in
Frankfurt in 2016, savedroid was one of the first tenants. Together with four other
startups, savedroid uses the infrastructure of the incubator. This includes access to the
network of Deutsche Börse AG. savedroid is thereby part of the Deutsche Börse Venture
Network with over 400 members from all over Europe. The Deutsche Börse brings
together young growth companies and investors on this platform. Since its founding in
2015, approximately 1.4 billion US dollars of investment were collected via the venture
network.
The smart saving app by savedroid is implemented with the support of the Wirecard
Bank. Wirecard manages the technical and banking law requirements for the savedroid
savings account, into which the users of the app, with the help of the so-called
“smooves”, transfer money. Wirecard, based near Munich, is a publicly-traded
international technology and financial services company with approximately 4,000
employees, over one billion euros turnover and a market capitalization of more than 10
billion euros. Wirecard is one of the top five stocks on the German technology stock
index TecDAX.
Another savedroid partner in the top five of the TecDAX is the telecommunications
company Drillisch, located near Frankfurt. Drillisch is one of the largest high-flyers on
the German stock market and its share price has increased by a factor of 80 since 2009.

The company is one of the most aggressively priced discount cell phone providers in
Germany and is active with the brand yourfone. For savedroid, Drillisch comes into play
when recommending more affordable cell phone services to users of the app.
Our second partner for the optimization of cell phone contracts is Freenet, a company
with nearly 5,000 employees and more than three billion euros turnover.
When it comes to the optimization of electricity contracts, savedroid cooperates with
Check24. Check24 is Germany’s largest Internet comparison portal with a turnover of
more than EUR 500 million.
savedroid will release an all new feature in the next weeks that allows to convert savings
in Amazon gift cards to get discounts on Amazon and thus realize wishes even earlier.

2.4. Team
savedroid's team combines long-time industry experience in AI, UX, Tech, Finance, and
Marketing with the right start-up mindset and user centricity. With this skill set,
savedroid can deliver financial innovations faster and in a particularly user-friendly way
which is unmatched so far.

3. The savedroid Token - SVD
We create an ERC20 utility token with a built-in deflation mechanism as suggested by
Vitalik Buterin4 to support the future value of the savedroid token. The savedroid token
– with the short name “SVD” – can be used to purchase the crypto services within the
savedroid ecosystem. Users of our automated crypto saving and investing will use the
savedroid token to pay the fees of these crypto services. Once, a savedroid token has
been used for a purchase within the savedroid ecosystem we will burn a certain
percentage of these tokens to support the future value of the tokens. You can also sell
the SVD privately, in supported token exchanges, or hodl [sic] it.
Moreover, using the SVDs within the savedroid ecosystem will provide additional user
and network benefits to further stimulate savedroid’s growth, as described in more
detail below.

3.1. Value and Strategy
The intrinsic value of SVDs derives from its functionality within the fast growing
savedroid ecosystem of AI based crypto saving and investing. Therefore, the savedroid
token offers a highly attractive opportunity and may increase in value based on the
financial model as outlined in more detail in chapter 6 below.
savedroid, for the first time ever, provides average mass market users with easy access
to cryptocurrencies without technological adoption barriers. Within savedroid’s unique
AI fueled ecosystem, users will profit from convenient AI-based crypto saving plans in
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, IOTA, Dash, Stellar, etc. and superior
crypto investment opportunities, such as portfolios, derivatives, and ICOs. savedroid will
create a smart UX which conveniently auto-converts savings to cryptocurrencies,
securely stores them, and makes them easily accessible, tradeable, and spendable. We
will offer all of these crypto services for a reasonable fee (we might adjust the fees over
time to address latest market developments). Our users will be required to purchase all

4

http://vitalik.ca/general/2017/10/17/moe.html

Page 29 of 64
savedroid AG

ICO Whitepaper v1.4

26.01.2018

consumed crypto services within the savedroid ecosystem using SVD. Hence, more
users of the savedroid ecosystem will translate into a higher demand for savedroid
tokens.
When a user takes his savedroid tokens to pay for a crypto service, we collect his
savedroid tokens and automatically burn a percentage of these tokens. Thus, the
number of available savedroid tokens will decrease over time. Below the line, this will
support the future value of the savedroid token.

In other words, a percentage of the savedroid crypto service fees will automatically be
removed from the pool of available SVDs by every single purchase. Thus, the more the
savedroid ecosystem is used, the further the supply of SVD will decrease.
So, eventually, our user growth will drive an increasing demand for savedroid tokens on
the one hand and, at the same time, a decreasing supply of savedroid tokens on the
other hand. Hence, the value of the savedroid token depends, among other factors, on
our future user growth.
A token holder that decides to hodl SVDs, though it may be subjected to exchange
market fluctuations, might enjoy a protective layer that links the value of SVD to
savedroid’s sustainable crypto ecosystem. This so called intrinsic deflationary
mechanism makes SVD a valuable utility token. It should be stated however, that the
value of the SVD will be driven by market supply and demand and will not be derived
directly from savedroid’s activities. Please note that holding SVD does not trigger the
right of redemption cash or cash equivalents or the payment of a fixed or determinable
income by savedroid. Token holders must not reasonably expect to generate profits
through the sale of SVD to other persons. The savedroid token will grant legal rights of
access to crypto services only within the savedroid ecosystem. Any other forms of
financial incentives token holders may or may not receive by holding a SVD are outside
of savedroid’s control and will only be derived through their own efforts.
As the savedroid token is not paying any interest or dividends it also qualifies as a
Sharia-compliant Islamic investment opportunity.

The flow of SVDs is illustrated below.

Figure 3: SVD flows

An ITS participant can buy savedroid token during our ITS. He can then either use his
SVD to become one of the first savedroid crypto saving and investing users and pay for
the crypto service fees or hold on to his savedroid tokens and maybe privately sell them
at a token exchange.
A savedroid user, who has not participated in our ITS will have two options after our ITS:
Either he directly buys SVD at a token exchange or, conveniently, directly within the
savedroid mobile apps. The savedroid token can be stored in a wallet and used to pay
for the consumed crypto services within the savedroid ecosystem. So, in the end, the
price of the savedroid token will always be determined by the actual market supply and
demand at the token exchanges. We will adjust our service fees denominated in SVD
within the savedroid ecosystem according to the free market price of the savedroid
Page 31 of 64
savedroid AG

ICO Whitepaper v1.4

26.01.2018

token. This will ensure that our service fee will stay attractive for all savedroid users over
time, so, for example, a higher SVD price will eventually result in a lower service fee as
quoted in savedroid token.

Please also have a look at our “The savedroid token” video:

https://youtu.be/CN4UZ1zIr2A

3.2. Token Supply and Specification
A total of 10 billion SVDs will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain using a smart
contract. SVD will comply with the ERC205 standard and will be freely transferable on
the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum was the natural choice for this project due to its
broad adoption and industry-standard for issuing custom digital assets. The
compatibility with the ERC20 standard leverages upon the existing infrastructure
advantages of the Ethereum ecosystem, namely in terms of development tools, wallets,
exchanges, and human resource expertise.

Page 32 of 64
savedroid AG

ICO Whitepaper v1.4

26.01.2018

savedroid will build a sustainable ecosystem for the crypto community that grows fast
with the community and their network effects. Hence, a contribution to SVD is a
contribution to the future of the savedroid ecosystem. Our deflationary mechanism
creates intrinsic value and a relationship between our ecosystem growth and SVD value.
The purpose is to mitigate the effects of earlier ICOs, in which the tokens had a large
demand in the first months but which then flattened over time.
Whenever SVD is used for savedroid ecosystem purchases and a percentage of it is
burned, the remainder will be allocated to the discretionary Monetary Reserve Pool
(“MRP”) – held and managed by savedroid. All SVD held by savedroid are allocated to
the MRP. savedroid can sell SVD of the MRP on token exchanges or directly to app users
within the savedroid ecosystem. The MRP can be used to a) ensure sufficient SVD
liquidity and b) prevent an overheated market by selling SVD.
The proceeds of such SVD sales will be used for the development and extension of the
savedroid ecosystem. Recirculating SVD at market price helps to raise their value while
at the same time engaging the whole community. As the savedroid token grows in
popularity, more and more users pay for savedroid services and, thus, higher proceeds
will allow the continuous development and release of new crypto saving and investing
features within the savedroid ecosystem. This will further increase the appeal of the
savedroid ecosystem for the crypto community, which will in turn again lead to a further
increase in the value of SVD.

3.3. Benefits of SVD Usage for Users and within the Ecosystem
SVD will be used by the savedroid ecosystem users to purchase the savedroid’s AI fueled
crypto saving and investing services as outlined below.
Leveraging technical support processes, savedroid will enable all users, especially those
who have not originally participated in the ITS, to conveniently buy SVD on the market
through the savedroid ecosystem. Therefore, users will grant savedroid powers of
attorney as part of the crypto service purchase to buy SVD at market price from third
party exchanges or from the MRP and savedroid will forward these directly into the
Page 33 of 64
savedroid AG

ICO Whitepaper v1.4

26.01.2018

crypto service payment channels, i.e. they are used automatically to pay for the crypto
services.
Since the exchange rate of SVD as measured in fiat and cryptocurrencies may fluctuate
over time and thus the value of the savedroid tokens varies, it would be unattractive for
new users to keep the price for the crypto services as denominated in SVD flat, because
then new savedroid users might have to pay a much higher price for their consumed
crypto services than early adopters who have joined the savedroid ecosystem right from
the beginning. Therefore, savedroid will adjust the price of crypto services as
denominated in SVD to keep the purchasing power of the savedroid token within the
savedroid ecosystem approximately constant over time. This means, that, for example,
if you will have to pay 100 SVD for a respective crypto service within the savedroid
ecosystem after the ITS closing, you might have to pay only 50 SVD a few months later
if the value of the savedroid token had doubled.
The offered crypto services include:
Convenient crypto saving
All offered crypto saving services, including savedroid’s self-learning AI saving algorithm,
auto-conversion from fiat to crypto and vice versa, and secure wallet storage, can be
purchased with SVD. The crypto saving will be available for a monthly base fee plus a
percentage transaction fee for every conversion of fiat to cryptocurrencies and from
cryptocurrencies to fiat.
Smart Saving and Spending in and across Cryptocurrencies
These features include AI based switching of savings between cryptocurrencies and
conveniently spending crypto savings to fulfill wishes at the preferred merchants.
savedroid will charge a percentage transaction fee for smart crypto trading. The
savedroid cryptocurrency credit card will be available for a monthly fixed fee.
Smart investments in cryptocurrency portfolios, derivatives, and ICOs
All AI based crypto investing services, such as smart investments in risk-return
optimized cryptocurrency portfolios, derivatives, and ICOs, will also be charged in SVD.

Page 34 of 64
savedroid AG

ICO Whitepaper v1.4

26.01.2018

For these crypto investing services, a monthly base fee and a transaction based
percentage fee payable in SVD apply.
Exclusive Beta-Program and App-Features for ITS Participants
Moreover, ITS participants will receive exclusive access to further privileges and
premium features within the savedroid ecosystem free of charge: All savedroid token
holders who have bought their SVD during our ITS may participate in savedroid’s beta
program and benefit from new features first. Beta program participants will also have
much stronger influence on the future development of the savedroid ecosystem by
providing early feedback and having exclusive feedback channels directly to our
development team.
In addition, savedroid will also release premium app features exclusively to SVD owners,
such as “ITS community only smooves” (automatic saving rules), limited crypto
investment opportunities, fee discounts, and many more.

figure below:

Figure 4: Fee Structure

As stated above, these crypto services and fee models are subject to change at the sole
discretion of savedroid.

3.4. SVD Price Variations
It is important to understand that the price of SVD will vary over time, based on different
factors, of which the most prominent ones are listed below:
•

change in demand for savedroid’s crypto services,

•

change in competitive landscape,

4. The Initial Token Sale
4.1. Token Issuance
savedroid is up and running fast for more than 2 years, has a successful product live
with a strong track record of the latest AI technology and state-of-the-art UX, a massively
growing and highly engaged user base, and relevant revenue streams. Now integrating
cryptocurrencies is a logical and very important leap forward to consistently expand the
savedroid ecosystem. Further extending our AI technology, integrating B2B partners,
growing our talent pool with the right developers, UX designers, marketing
professionals, setting up the legal framework, and, of course, driving significant user
growth through targeted performance marketing requires substantial additional
investments.
By launching an Initial Token Sale (“ITS”, often also referred to as ICO – although a token
sale is not the offering of coins), we would like to give the crypto community the amazing
opportunity to participate in savedroid’s success story, instead of limiting access to a
small number of traditional venture capital funds. Besides, an ITS is quick, transparent,
and efficient and, thus, empowers savedroid to expand its ecosystem and launch the AI
fueled crypto saving and investing features much faster.
Issuing SVD also allows savedroid to be backed by participants from all over the world,
who will have access to SVD right after its creation and can help to spread the word of
savedroid’s new crypto services to facilitate user growth and create additional value for
the savedroid token. After the ITS, savedroid will aim to list SVD as soon as possible on
relevant token exchanges. We will communicate the exact starting dates of the SVD
trading once we have received final confirmation from the token exchanges.
Participants can be part of this immense opportunity to allow everyone world-wide6 to
have their micro-savings automatically converted in cryptocurrencies and profit from
the massive future potential of cryptos.

4.2. savedroid ITS Dates
The savedroid ITS will be structured in two parts, starting with the Pre-Sale and followed
by the Main Sale. The sale price for savedroid token during the ITS is fixed at
1 EUR = 100 SVD, whereas special Pre-Sale discounts will apply as outlined below.
Hence, the price of SVD will fluctuate as measured in Bitcoin and Ethereum during the
time of our ITS.
Starting from the 12th until the 26th of January 2018, we will offer 5% of all SVD (i.e.
5 million SVD) for purchase in a public Pre-Sale with a bonus of 30%. This means that
each Pre-Sale participant will receive an extra 30% of the number of tokens he
purchases on top for free, so if one buys 1,000 SVD he will receive a total of 1,300 SVD
for the same purchase price.
From the 9th of February until the 9th of March 2018, we will offer an additional 55% of
all SVDs for purchase by the public during our Main Sale (i.e., 5.5 billion SVD). In total
we expect to sell a lower double-digit million amount of SVD.
The smart contract of the savedroid token will be published on GitHub in January. We
will release further details on where to find the smart contract on our Website
(ico.savedroid.com).
The SVD distribution ends officially on the 9th of March 2018. At this point in time, the
sale agreement on the SVD between the ITS participant and savedroid will become
legally effective and binding. The token distribution starts latest after the end of the
Main Sale. At this point in time, all unsold SVD (out of the 6 billion SVD for sale) will be
burned (or not minted in the first place) and after this point in time, the number of SVD
will not increase from this effective number of SVD.
There will be no further tokens created after the Hard Cap is reached and the total
amount of 10 billion SVD will not be exceeded in any case. We will not create any new
number of SVDs after the savedroid ITS. All tokens for sale (see SVD Distribution below)
that are not sold by the end of the distribution will be burned.

Page 39 of 64
savedroid AG

ICO Whitepaper v1.4

26.01.2018

All reserved tokens (see SVD Distribution below) will be burned proportionally, so that
the share of reserved versus token for sale, i.e. the free float of SVD, is fixed. Thus, the
maximum number of SVD is determined.
In the event that the Min Cap of 50 million sold SVDs is not reached before the end of
the Main Sale, all payments will be returned, less charges depending on the payment
method (credit card fee or blockchain gas).
Each SVD token will be sold for 1 EUR = 100 SVD. There is a minimum purchase amount
of 1,000 SVDs per purchase.
We will accept a maximum (fixed limit) of 10 million SVDs per ITS participant for
purchase in the savedroid ITS.
The commencement of trading is planned a few days after the end of the ITS depending
on the listing speed of token exchanges. SVD will be transferable on the first day of
trading.
At the beginning, the tokens will not have any features. The use as a means of payment
for crypto services on the savedroid ecosystem will only be possible after the launch of
such features according to the roadmap below. The dates of the roadmap depend on
external factors such a partner set-up or regulation and can thus not be guaranteed.

4.3. SVD Distribution and Allocation Scheme

4.3.1. SVD Distribution
60% of the maximum number of SVD will be offered for sale during the Pre-Sale and the
Main Sale. The remaining SVDs are reserved and will be distributed as follows:
10% will be reserved for community initiatives, business development, and expansion.
5% will be allocated for our bounty program for ITS participants. A further 10% will be
retained for distribution among advisors, community managers, smart contract
developers, and legal. The remaining 15% of SVDs will be distributed to savedroid’s early
equity investors and the savedroid team as an incentive to ensure long-term alignment
of interests and commitment to the savedroid ecosystem and, hence, the savedroid
token and their future value.
All reserved tokens (except bounty tokens) will be locked and vest 1/20 per quarter, i.e.,
linear vesting over a total period of 5 years. This means that, each quarter, the owners
of reserved tokens can only sell up to an additional 1/20 of their effectively allocated
SVD.
All lock-ups will be controlled by a dedicated smart contract (“Vesting Contract”) that will
be publicly available.

Program Page on Bitcointalk (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2700275).

4.5.3. Bug Bounty Program
Although our smart contracts are already audited as described in chapter 4.6.2, we still
set up a Bug Bounty Program to encourage the Blockchain developer community to
review our smart contracts. The smart contracts will be published on GitHub in January.
We will release further details on where to find the smart contract on our Website
(ico.savedroid.com).

4.6. Transparency and Trust

4.6.1. Funds Escrow
All payments in cryptocurrencies received for SVDs in
connection with the savedroid ITS will be held in escrow by
attorney-at-law Axel Hellinger admitted to the German Bar.
He is a well-recognized specialist for cryptocurrency and ICO
law in Germany and owns an established escrow and tax
advising firm (https://hellinger.eu, for his speech on

Mr. Hellinger will hold the ITS funds until the Min Cap is reached and the respective
savedroid tokens are minted. If the Min Cap is not reached until the end of the Main
Sale, he will ensure all funds will be returned. Funds will not be released to savedroid
before the validation period explained below expires and savedroid proves that the
respective savedroid tokens are minted and assigned to the buyers throughout the
whole Pre-Sale and Main Sale of our ITS.
The validation period lasts three days and gives participant the chance to file complaints
if they have not received the savedroid tokens in their provided wallet before Mr.
Page 45 of 64
savedroid AG

ICO Whitepaper v1.4

26.01.2018

Hellinger releases the funds to savedroid. The validation period starts when savedroid
notifies the participant via email that his savedroid token have been minted. During the
validation period, participants can file claims of missing savedroid tokens to Mr.
Hellinger via the contact details on his website (https://hellinger.eu).
All payments in fiat will be processed and managed
by Bank Frick, a renowned family-run private bank
from Lichtenstein which is among the few banks
specialized in providing services for ICOs in Europe.
Bank Frick will also manage returns, e.g. if the Min Cap is not reached.

4.6.2. Security and Data Protection
The savedroid SVD wallet is secured by state-of-the-art security measures following
highest industry standards. Every year, the security and data protection measures of
savedroid are audited by the TÜV Saarland Group, an internationally well renowned
German technical inspection authority.
savedroid runs numerous tests in accordance with best-practices and contract source
code verification. In addition to that, savedroid conducts a smart contract audit with the
help of external partners. This audit will cover the technical aspects of all token sale
contracts to ensure that programmed algorithms work as expected. Furthermore,
potential vulnerabilities will be identified beforehand to mitigate risks, so funds cannot
be easily attacked by third parties. The audit does not guarantee that the code is bugfree, but highlights potential weaknesses and areas of improvement.
In addition, we will set up a special Bug Bounty Program as described in chapter 4.5 that
is going to encourage the Blockchain developer community to report all bugs and any
security issues that may be present. Due to a strong desire to put forth the best systems
possible, we are continuously considering to add even more members to our team to
cover all relevant areas, like crypto security experts.

6. Financial Model
savedroid’s crypto saving and investing business case may offer significant growth
opportunities based on maximum simplification, to provide average mass market users
with easy access to cryptocurrencies and to drive fast user adoption. Based on these
prosperous market opportunities, our financial experts have prepared an Excel
spreadsheet for you, which you can use to easily simulate various SVD value scenarios.
The Excel sheet can be downloaded on the Website using the following link:
https://ico.savedroid.com/savedroid%20tokenmodel.xlsx. Please consider the risks
stated below when working with the financial model and interpreting the results.
The model is based on a micro-economic model that simulates possible price
developments of SVD on third party token exchanges. The model includes parameters
for possible future prices and revenues of the savedroid crypto services, assumptions
for ITS sales, sell pressure, and savedroid token burn percentage. For more information
about the savedroid token economics, please refer to chapter 3 above, where the supply
and demand model behind the forecasted SVD price development is explained in detail.
In the charts below, we simulated a possible outcome to illustrate the functioning of the
model.
