THE DECENTRALISED ART GALLERY

THE DEC ENTRALIS ED A RT GALLERY

“A new online marketplace promises to give art lovers
the chance to buy shares in famous paintings.”
- The Telegraph
VISION
Investing in a Monet has always
been beyond the reach of most
people; purchasing a Rembrandt the
privilege of only a few… until now.
The opaque world of auction houses
and banks, which allows them to
charge exorbitant fees, has cut off
fine art investment from efficient
modern markets.
But it does not have to be that way.
With help from visionaries like you,
we can democratise access to fine art
by creating a decentralised art
gallery — a truly open platform
where anyone can own a piece of a
Picasso. We are building a global art
blockchain market where assets are
traded quickly and fairly on a liquid

exchange. Creating portfolios and
trading shares in masterpieces will
be available to everyone. We will
convert million-dollar artworks into
smaller digitised financial units that
can be bought and sold easily —
literally at a fraction of the cost.
For the first time, technology will
allow investors, collectors and
owners to exchange shares in
paintings and sculptures instantly,
akin to the way stocks of a company
are traded today. Plus, top emerging
artists will have a showcase for their
work, free from the interference of
middlemen.
For years, we have been building a
secure and robust technology

1

foundation for Maecenas, the
world’s first blockchain-based fine
art trading platform. This has been
possible because we have assembled
an exceptional team of experts and
have built crucial relationships with
galleries,
collectors
and
authenticators. Now, with your
support, we will be able to launch
the platform, nurture this new
investment network and turn a
centuries-old industry mainstream.
Thanks to its resilience in
downturns and to its capital
appreciation, fine art has long been
an attractive multi-billion asset class.
Now it will be open to all.

THE ART MARKET OPPORTUNITY
There is an estimated $3 trillion
worth of fine art in safe storage, of
which circa $65 billion are traded
annually through auction houses
and art dealers.
i

Fine art is considered a reliable and
safe store of value. Wealthy families
have kept art in their portfolios for
centuries, and trading volumes have
continued to grow steadily over the
last few decades. Interest in fine art
among investors and wealth
managers is on the rise, and younger
generations of buyers are eager to
embrace art-tech.

But the $65 billion annual fine art
industry is in desperate need of open
and fair marketplaces that create
transparency and liquidity. The
antiquated industry is struggling to
see trading volumes reach their real
potential. The problem is that access
to information is patchy, and art
pieces are traded at outdated venues.
Sales are processed manually and
settlement can take weeks. This
opaque and inefficient process
discourages
many
potential
investors, which means art trades
are infrequent and art as an asset is

2

illiquid. In addition, many investors
favour using financial vehicles over
direct ownerships because they
want exposure to art but don’t want
the responsibility of having to care
for the physical art piece.
Fine art remains one of the rare few
markets that have remained
virtually unchanged for the last
three centuries. It has been
impervious to the technology
advances that have been adopted by
the majority of capital markets like
company
stocks,
bonds,
commodities and even real estate.

THE DEC ENTRALIS ED A RT GALLERY

REMOVING INTERMEDIARIES

But now blockchain can provide the
foundation for a secure and efficient
market that enables buyers and
sellers to transact directly without
intermediaries. An open, agile
platform can energise art markets
and bring millions of investors off
the side-lines.
We are named after — and inspired
by — an early patron of the arts.
Gaius Maecenas helped democratise
art in Ancient Rome by financing
poor poets. We want to be the
modern version of Maecenas
(pronounced
“My-seen-us”)
ensuring that fine art is available to
everyone and not just the ultrawealthy.
The lack of innovation within art
finance stems from the dominance of
old auction houses. The largest —
Sotheby’s
and
Christie’s
—
monopolise 80% of the secondary
market volume. They present an
identical fee structure, which can see
art buyers paying up to 25 percent
commission — and sellers are
charged even more.
ii

Auction houses also control access
to information as there is no single
art marketplace that provides a
proper price discovery mechanism.

In other words, it’s nearly
impossible to know the fair price of
an artwork because there are no
reliable means for investors to assess
market sentiment. In other asset
classes, like public company stocks
or even cryptocurrencies, any
investor can tap into historical and
real-time exchange price feeds to
build pricing models.
The fine art industry doesn’t have
any of that. There are no order books
or exchanges, and historical
information is both scarce and
sparse since art pieces are traded so
infrequently.
We will completely remove
intermediaries who profit from
controlling
and
manipulating
information. We will replace
brokers with smart contracts that
transparently define auction rules,
bidding systems and income
distribution.
Masterpieces will be traded briskly
through an open exchange, giving
frequent updates of what the
artworks are really worth. Portfolio
managers will be able to price their
positions more accurately and
diversify their risk by investing in a
range of different art assets. They

3

will no longer need to have their
funds concentrated in a handful of
hard-to-sell pieces.
Fine art should become a first-class
citizen in capital markets and have
rich market data feeds, order books,
indices and even derivatives.
The reason auction houses have
dominated and controlled the fine
art market for so long can be
explained in a single word: TRUST.
Lack of information and reliable
ways of assessing the authenticity of
art pieces means that investors deal
mostly only with centuries-old
institutions that are perceived as
trustworthy. These institutions act
as intermediaries in almost every art
transaction and therefore control the
market.
Blockchains
replace
traditional
intermediaries with decentralised
networks of trust.
By connecting artists, collectors and
investors directly via an open
blockchain platform with smart
contracts, we eliminate the need for
brokers and art dealers to facilitate a
transaction. We replace the need for
trust based on reputation with trust
in the decentralised blockchain.

THE EMERGENCE OF ART-TECH

“Technology-driven businesses have a
clear potential to support the emergence
of Art & Finance, through increased
liquidity, lower transaction costs and
more transparency”
- Deloitte Art & Finance Report 2016
In
recent
years, technology
innovation has started to permeate
into the traditional fine art industry.
According to the Deloitte Art
Finance Report 2016, “increasing
investment in art market start-ups
demonstrates continued confidence
in the growth of the online art and
technology industry”. In addition,
“the level of investment in art
industry start-ups increased from an

estimated US$125 million in 2013 to
an estimated US$505 million in
2015 based on 23 art market startups.”
Other findings by the Deloitte Art
Finance Report 2016 show that the
art market is increasingly more
receptive to the usage of technology
and it anticipates it playing an
important role in the next two to
three years. It also cites blockchain
technologies as an example of an
innovation that could contribute
significantly to the development of
the art and finance industry.
“73 percent of art professionals (up
from 53 percent) and 69 percent of

4

collectors believe that online art
businesses will play an important role
in the art market in the next two to three
years, which signals that art
stakeholders are increasingly waking
up to the potential of technology and the
online art market. New innovations,
such as the use of blockchain
technologies mentioned above, are an
example of how technology and
innovation
could
contribute
significantly to the development of the
art and finance industry.”
- Deloitte Art & Finance Report 2016

COMPETITION
Art investors have limited options
when it comes to investing in fine art
in a secure and trusted way.
Auction houses are perceived as
being the safest channel, and that is
reflected in the high fees which
range between 12 percent and 25
percent. These auctions are mostly
conducted in the traditional way,
and little has changed besides the
usage of TV monitors to track bids in
addition to calling the bids out loud.

after it. This is something that most
investors are uncomfortable with
because they are not qualified art
experts. An estimated 90% of buyers
see art as an investment, and nearly
half of them would prefer to have
exposure to fine art through a
financial vehicle instead of a
physical purchase. So the traditional
approaches offered by galleries and
auction houses leave a huge part of
the market under-served.

Art galleries and other art dealers
charge lower fees to buyers, in the
range of 6 percent to 10 percent.
However, these are perceived as less
trustworthy, and their art selection
is quite limited. In addition,
galleries dictate prices instead of
market participants.

One alternative to these two
traditional approaches is to
participate in an art fund. The way
this works is that a qualified art
expert acts as the art fund manager.
They identify a collection of art
pieces that are of good value and
have potential to appreciate.
Investment from investors is
solicited, with a minimum of
$500,000 typically being required,
and larger ticket sizes being the
norm. The art expert then uses the
funds to buy the collection, and sits

Besides the lack of liquidity, lack of
transparency and the high fees, both
of these approaches also require
having to physically acquire the
artwork, store it, manage it and look

FEES
CHARGED

on it for between 5 and 10 years
until they can find suitable buyers
willing to pay a premium for the
pieces. After the last art piece is sold,
the fund is dissolved and investors
finally get their money back, plus
any returns. The art fund manager
typically charges investors 2% per
annum of any cash invested plus 20%
of any profits made. This means that
on a ten-year horizon, investors will
lose out on about a fifth of their
investment in commissions, and on
top of that lose another fifth of any
profits made. In other words, there is
no guarantee of making money even
if the art appreciates, and it’s not
uncommon to make a loss if the fund
fails to perform as expected.
The high fees combined with the
large minimum investment and the
lack of liquidity (minimum lock-in
period of 5 years) makes these art
funds unsuitable for most investors.

ART AND THE BLOCKCHAIN

There are non-financial blockchain
initiatives in the fine art space which
don’t have an investment focus.
Instead, they attempt to solve issues
around provenance of traditional art
pieces and protection of digital
artworks. A prominent example is
Verisart which provides permanent
digital art provenance for actual
artworks that would typically be
stored in galleries. Another start-up
is Ascribe, which focuses on
providing a secure way to trace
digital artworks and control how
they’re shared.
But fintech start-ups are beginning
to
emerge
with
innovative

alternatives to invest in art. Arthena,
based in the US, is one such example,
which uses a typical crowd-funding
approach to create art funds. This
new model is proving to be popular
with investors as it reduces the ticket
size to $10,000 and waives the 2%
management fee (although it still
charges the 20% performance price).
Although this is definitely an
improvement over traditional art
funds, this approach still fails to
address the fundamental issues of
art investment, namely the lack of
transparency, lack of liquidity, and
most importantly the fact that trust
is centralised. In addition, Arthena is
not a true open platform as they’re

6

only able to accept accredited
investors due to regulations
associated
with
traditional
investment funds.
Maecenas, on the other hand,
leverages blockchain technology to
fully democratise access to fine art
investment. By tokenising art, the
platform converts million-dollar
artworks into smaller financial units
that can be bought and sold easily by
anyone
globally
through
a
transparent crypto-exchange. This
provides investors with liquidity
and a much-needed market-driven
price discovery mechanism.

THE DEC ENTRALIS ED A RT GALLERY

OUR PLATFORM
Maecenas
uses
blockchain
technology to create tamper-proof
digital certificates linked to pieces of
art. These certificates are highly
secure and impossible to forge
thanks to the cryptographic
properties of blockchains. A single
artwork is broken down into
thousands of certificates, similar to
how a public company issues shares.
Investors can then purchase these
certificates to own a percentage of a
given artwork, and they can sell
them back to other investors at any
time via the Maecenas exchange.
New artworks are continuously
listed on the platform after passing a
strict due diligence process. This
involves
verifying
the
art
provenance, insurance policy, safe
storage, independent valuation,
artwork condition and verification
on the registry of loss and stolen art.
Only high-quality artworks with a
pristine track record will be listed.

Once listed on the platform,
artworks go through a bidding
process following a Dutch auction
process whereby investors submit
private bids stating how many
shares they want to purchase and at
what price. This is essentially a
confidential and cryptographically
secure book-building exercise. This
process not only gives investors
bargaining power but it also
provides them with a much fairer
and transparent pricing mechanism.
In addition, it is harder to
manipulate compared to traditional
auctions or fixed-price listings.
The auction process does not
happen instantly but rather it takes
place over a number of days or
weeks to allow everyone to
participate. Artworks can be listed
in any fiat currency (e.g. USD, EUR)
or cryptocurrency (e.g. BTC, ETH).
Conversely, investors may also
prefer to invest in fiat currencies or
in cryptocurrencies, effectively
creating
a
multi-currency
conversion scenario. Utilising a

7

native currency-independent token
as proxy for all currency conversion
allows us to eliminate currency
conversion risks.
This token will be called ART.

OUR TECHNOLOGY
The platform’s design provides fault
tolerance and simple recovery
mechanisms. The system is also
highly scalable, resilient and easy to
upgrade. It has a high degree of
reusability and allows us to be agile
in our development.
For instance, when we need to
integrate Maecenas with an external
service (e.g. a payment processor) we
just create a new micro-service to
handle that and link it to the rest of
the services via message queues.
This has the benefit of letting our
developers simultaneously work on
different
tasks
and
makes
integration and testing relatively
simple.

THE DEC ENTRALIS ED A RT GALLERY

THE ART TOKEN

ART – The currency of the Maecenas
economy.
ART is a digital token that is
required by all Maecenas functions
that are exposed on the blockchain
via smart contracts.
We believe that the art market is in
desperate need of transparency and
fairness. Therefore, we’ve decided
that all sensitive business logic
dealing with money or assets will be
run on a public and decentralised
blockchain. This ensures that our
processes can be publicly audited
and known upfront.
The main and most significant
function of our platform is the Dutch
auction. This is the process that
receives bids from investors and
issues digital shares of paintings.
Running such a critical part of our
system on an open and transparent
platform like Ethereum allows the
entire community to scrutinise our

operations.
It
also
protects
Maecenas itself from any potential
internal manipulation or insider
trading.
These smart contracts that we’re
creating, including the Dutch
auction contract, require ART to
operate. ART is like the fuel of the
decentralised Maecenas machine.
Any fiat or crypto amounts being
invested through smart contracts are
converted to ART first. Having our
own token allows us to collect
income from these smart contract
activities. The utility of these tokens
is that ART can perform different
platform functions.
In the case of our Dutch auction,
ART acts as a clearing and
settlement
mechanism
that
Maecenas uses to issue digital shares
of paintings.

However, the economy of Maecenas
is not limited to just running
auctions. For example, artworks in

8

our platform can be leased to
museums for exhibitions. The
income generated by this activity is
then distributed proportionally to
holders of fractions of paintings or
sculptures. This leasing and income
collection function is also performed
by smart contracts and therefore
requires ART tokens to work.
Besides, as the Maecenas ecosystem
grows, we anticipate creating
additional
income-generating
processes. Many of these will
require smart contracts to operate
(for the reasons stated above), and
ART is required to provide the
utility for this smart contract
operation.
ART plays a crucial role within
Maecenas. It provides the utility
mechanism which enables our
platform to operate transparently
and openly in a decentralised space
while at the same time deriving
revenue from those activities.

THE DEC ENTRALIS ED A RT GALLERY

THE DUTCH AUCTION PROCESS

1.

An art owner decides to sell an artwork on the Maecenas platform, and chooses in which currency to receive
the proceeds. This could be ART tokens, cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies.

2.

Investors participate in the auction by submitting ART tokens to the auction smart contract. For those
investors wanting to participate with fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies, deposits are kept in a perinvestor fully-segregated virtual bank account having a unique IBAN or in a secure multi-sig cold-storage.

3.

The Maecenas platform, upon reception of monies, allocates an equivalent amount of ART tokens to the
investor and pledges the tokens on the smart contract on behalf of the investor. Maecenas uses its ART reserve
funds to guarantee liquidity, and converts the submitted funds into ART seamlessly to ensure a good user
experience.

4.

When the Dutch auction process finishes, the smart contract proceeds to analyse all bids to determine the final
share price and the amount of shares each successful investor ends up purchasing.

5.

The smart contract settles the transaction by issuing artwork crypto-shares to investors. The artwork seller
receives either the ART tokens or the equivalent amount in currency depending on what they chose before the
auction started.

WORLD-CLASS FINE ART
We have worked very hard to build
a strong shortlist of flagship
artworks that qualify to be listed on
our platform. We now have access to
a diverse pipeline of art pieces by
blue-chip artists that collectively is
worth in excess of one-hundred
million dollars. This initial lot is an
excellent starting point that will
allow us to have good volume and
traction when we launch.
These are some of the names that
could make it into the initial
collection.
• Impressionist and Modern:
Picasso, Monet, Braque, Pissarro,
Giacometti, Brancusi, Modigliani,
Renoir, Chagall, Munch, Sisley.
• Post-War and Classical
Contemporary: Warhol, Basquiat,
Lichtenstein, Soulages, Beuys,

Duchamp, Bacon, Sam Francis,
Dubuffet, Bourgeois.

LEGAL & COMPLIANCE
One of the challenges that we faced
when we started defining the
business model of Maecenas was to
figure out how to structure the art
investments in a way that would not
infringe financial regulations, while
at the same time provide security
and protection for investors.
For that purpose, we engaged
numerous art finance experts, law
firms and investment professionals
worldwide to seek advice and to
determine the best legal and
financial structure to enable secure
co-investment
in
fine
art,
underpinned
by
blockchain
technology.

10

Since this has never been done
before, the process required
extensive research and validation
carried out over a period of nearly a
year. We've covered all top financial
jurisdictions and explored a number
of different financial structures,
weighing all pros and cons for each
approach.
The result of this effort is a very
comprehensive global view of how
our blockchain-based art shares
would fit on each of the top financial
jurisdictions worldwide, which has
allowed us to strike the right balance
between flexibility and simplicity.
The diagram below shows a highlevel structure for the adopted
model of ownership.

THE DEC ENTRALIS ED A RT GALLERY
KEEPING ART SAFE BUT
NOT HIDDEN
Every artwork listed on the platform
will be kept in purpose-built safe art
storage facilities.
These high-security vaults actually
also operate as galleries whereby
dedicated rooms are allocated for
viewing purposes. Maecenas, in its
effort to democratise access to fine
art, will allow investors and their
nominated guests to arrange visits to
appreciate the artworks.
These art storage facilities typically
sit within international designated
areas next to airports so that the
valuables kept in storage do not
attract local tax when they're
transacted, making it attractive for
investors.
Known as freeports, these facilities
are available in most tier-1 art
trading hubs and we have already
established relationships with many
of them. One such facility is Le
Freeport in Singapore where
Christie's operates their Fine Art
Storage Services (CFASS).

MARKET VALIDATION
A by-product of the extensive
product validation exercise that
we've done is the opportunity to
engage with active players in the art
finance industry, namely insurance
companies, asset managers, banks,
art lenders, galleries, collectors and
even auction houses. The result of
these interactions is number of key
partnership
and
collaboration
opportunities which will allow
Maecenas to have a strong position
in the market and to have global
reach.
The following list shows some of the
entities that we've been in touch
with to validate Maecenas and shape
it into a viable product. In most
cases the interest generated by our
platform bumped us up to deal
directly with C-level executives.

TARGET SEGMENTS AND
TRENDS
Maecenas' target market is sizeable
in its own right. In addition, we
capitalise on a number of recent
investment trends which are set to
continue:
The Shared Economy:
Maecenas allows investors to
syndicate and jointly own a piece of
art. This model has been validated at
large by the continual increase in
popularity of the many property and
equity crowdfunding platforms
available.
Cryptocurrencies:
Investment in cryptocurrencies and
crypto-assets
has
grown
exponentially over the last few years.
The value of many of these digital
assets has increased 50x in less than
a year. Trading volumes at cryptoexchanges are at all-time highs and
show no sign of slowing down.

50

The
value
proposition
of
cryptographic tokens is simple:
democratise access to wealth.
Blockchains allow investors to be in
full control of their digital assets
without having to rely on
intermediaries or be exposed to
central counterparties.
Maecenas capitalises on this trend
by opening up trillions of dollars’
worth of fine art to the crypto
investor community.
Investment in Art Finance
Innovation:
The investment in art-related startups quadrupled in the last two years
reaching over $500m a year.
Art as Collateral:
Art finance is expected to grow
significantly. The US art-secured
lending market has grown an
estimated 15 to 20 percent annually
for the last five years.

REVENUE FORECAST
(IN MILLIONS)

45

Self-Investment:
Over the coming years, more and
more money will be handed to
younger generations, who are
actively looking to participate in the
decision
making
of
their
investments. The behaviour of this
digitally native generation favours
digital-first platforms and the ability
to self-invest. Millennials are going
to be the largest adult segment by
2020.
Alternative Investments:
The younger generation of investors
favour
tangible
assets
over
traditional capital market products,
such as government bonds and
stocks. These products are currently
offering negative or very low
interest rates, making alternative
assets even more attractive.

BUSINESS MODEL
Our business model is based
primarily on two revenue streams:
issuance and secondary market.

• Issuance: Artworks listed on
Maecenas attract a one-time
issuance fee of 6% which is
charged to asset owners.
Investors
participating
in
auctions pay a 2% one-off fee.
These fees are charged on settled
transactions only.
• Fine Art Exchange: Shares of
artworks will be tradable on
Maecenas Fine Art Exchange.
It will always be free to sell your
auction-acquired shares, while
buyers will pay a commission.

TOKEN CROWDSALE
The issuance of the ART token will
be controlled by a smart contract
deployed on the Ethereum network.
The token will conform to the
ERC20 standard.

A total of 100,000,000 tokens will be
issued, and they will be allocated in
the following ratios:

• 30% sold in the crowdsale.
• 30% kept as reserve liquidity
fund
• 20% allocated to incentivise
partners and client acquisition
• 20% retained by Maecenas
The crowdsale seeks to collect ETH
equivalent to US$ 3 million (soft cap)
which will allow Maecenas to
launch the platform and operate in
our first market, which is highly
likely to be Geneva, Switzerland.
There is a further milestone of
US$ 10 million which Maecenas
will use to accelerate growth and
operate in additional markets in top
art cities worldwide (e.g. New York,
London,
Paris,
Luxembourg,
Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore).
There is a further stretch goal of
US$ 20 million (hard cap) which
Maecenas will use to create its own
art fund of high-grade artworks to be
listed on the platform.

13

Some collections that we have in the
pipeline are Blue-Chip Artists,
Contemporary Art, Undervalued
Old Masters, and Rising Emerging
Asia.
In summary:
•
Soft cap: US$ 3M (platform
launch)
•
Milestone: US$ 10M
(additional markets)
•
Hard cap: US$ 20M (art fund)
This target prices each ART token at
US$ 0.66. The actual price in ETH
will be set a few days before the sale
starts.
The implementation of these caps
aims to achieve a broad, diversified
distribution.
ART tokens will be transferrable 7
days after the end of the crowdsale.

THE DEC ENTRALIS ED A RT GALLERY
TOKEN ALLOCATION
30% of the tokens will be sold during
the crowdsale and therefore will be
allocated to buyers.
The number of ART tokens is a fixed
supply of 100,000,000. Demand for
ART tokens will vary. Tokens are
required by Maecenas’ smart
contracts to operate. ART tokens
will be locked in for the duration of
the Dutch auctions and therefore its
supply will decrease. The more
artworks are auctioned through
Maecenas the greater the demand
for ART tokens will be. These
market dynamics are likely to play a
role in the price of the token in the
crypto exchanges.
A further 30% of the tokens will be
kept in a liquidity reserve fund to be
used by Maecenas to guarantee
liquidity during the art auctions.
Liquidity is a key element for
marketplaces to succeed and
therefore we're reserving a large
portion of the tokens for this
purpose. Maecenas may purchase
more tokens from the open
exchanges to top up this fund on a
discretionary basis.

We plan to create a healthy and
inclusive ecosystem and therefore
we anticipate using the ART tokens
to incentivise galleries, museums,
art asset managers and other
partners. We are setting aside 20% of
the tokens for this.
Finally, the last 20% chunk of the
token issuance will be utilised to
reward and incentivise the current
and future Maecenas team of experts
and advisors. The team tokens will
have a 24-month vesting period with
a 6-month cliff. We're putting this
structure in place to ensure that the
incentives of the team and Maecenas
supporters are aligned. Tokens
won't be transferable until vesting
(on a monthly pro-rata basis).
