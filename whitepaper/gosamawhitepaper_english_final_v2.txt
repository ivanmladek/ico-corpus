Executive Summary
Gosama was built to revolutionize the sales management of retail chains by ​redefining the O2O
(Offline to Online) sales process​ and identifying the way companies build and manage
relationships with their customers.
We will create the Gosama Token and Gosama Sales Management platform with the first
automatic mechanism based on a blockchain and a cryptocurrency where it can be used and
spent.
As far as you may know, previously everyone had to buy cryptocurrency or invest heavily in
mining to earn cryptocurrency. But now, with Gosama Token, consumers can earn Token in
three simple ways:
-

Self-managing and exchanging personal and behavioral information to receive desired
advertising from partner companies.

-

Investing time, attention and good-will to advertise the companies and redeem the
Token as a reward from the company.

-

Joining our customer loyalty program and shopping in the tech-com shops based on
Gosama platform to exchange the Token.

So what can you do with the Gosama platform when you have the Gosama Token?
This is important for most of the investors who are interested in cryptocurrency and expect the
growth of its value in the future. Gosama Token will have a large market for businesses and
consumers to use. For example:
-

The enterprise pays service fees for the platform with its own preference for Gosama
Token

ico.gosama.io
Omnichannel supported sale management system
With integrated spenable cryptocurrency.

PAGE 5 ​OF 29

-

Enterprise pays for marketing campaigns in the Gosama platform

-

Enterprise creates bonus packages for consumers using Gosama Token when consumers
participate in marketing activities and promote programs of those enterprises.

-

Consumers exchange Gosama Token to get discounts and bonuses from the businesses.

-

Consumers use Gosama Token for payments at businesses using the Gosama platform.

Therefore, the Gosama Platform will provide tremendous value to both businesses and
consumers by building a comprehensive ecosystem of:
-

Omni-channel business management platform- a seamless, consistent and intensely
focused on customer experience that improves business efficiency to a new level.

-

Target marketing system for the consumers- based on shopping behavior on the Gosama
platform that has been approved to share by the consumers.

-

The customer loyalty system that establishes a new way of cooperating between the
enterprises and the consumers to promote a great value they are getting from each
other.

-

The payment system that easily integrates many convenient payment methods such as
mobile payment, QR Code and- in the future- Gosama Token.

As a result, businesses are provided with an efficient sales management platform that extends
support for Offline to Online with a variety of payment channels integration and ability to reach
more consumers. Consumers will be receiving marketing relevant to what they care about and
use the value of their loyalty, spendings, attention and activities. It will become worthwhile to
invest their time and money to become a real brand ambassador for the business.
The customer loyalty programs have been in use since the 1700s but it proved to be ineffective
as they only reach around 10-15% of the customers at the end of the campaign.

PAGE 6 ​OF 29

Many customers subscribes to a dozens of programs but rarely receive benefits from them
because loyalty points they gain are scattered among all the businesses. It is difficult to profit
from them without being regular customer at all of those places. On Gosama platform all the
loyalty points will be gathered and counted together for the customers quicker benefit gain.
Implementing, managing, maintaining and collecting customers information manually makes
many business owners confused with its complexity and discouraged by how time-consuming it
can be. Without any other- better- solution they are forced to apply it. We would like to change
that situation for their benefit.
In addition to Gosama future vision, we are working on making the linkage of these shops to a
broad ecosystem much easier and convenient. In particular focusing on Gosama Token and
Gosama Wallet services as the basis of general point accumulation instead of requiring
consumers to use different traditional payment methods to accumulate points at each and
separate store. At the same time the points can be spent on the e-commerce market of the
system. The value of Gosama Token will increase and stabilize due to the high transaction
demand in the entire ecosystem.
Gosama has developed the Omni-channel Sales Management Platform- previously known as
GoStore- demo operated in Vietnam that in the first 3 months of its existence has attracted
more than 600 retail outlets (with full range of products such as Fashion, Electric Appliance,
Grocery, Mother and Baby products …). With the desire to develop and bring even bigger
ecosystem to the businesses and consumers, we have extended our Platform with the
Blockchain technology and hosted new premium features such as Intelligent Marketing
Systems, Customer Loyalty Systems, Customer Care Systems, Cryptocurrency payment
systems, together with the mechanism letting users to control their personal and behavioral
data across the platform. All of these will bring Gosama further than what the market has seen
with opportunities far beyond what is described in this Whitepaper.

Introduction
Omnichannel
Currently, to promote their products to the sale channels, an enterprise may apply these
separate methods:
1. POS - traditional stores
2. Website - an online store, contact page of the business
3. Social network - sales channels and community development
4. E-market (can be considered as market, supermarket online)
5. Mobile app (sales through an app)
6. Affiliate sales (using a network of collaborators or other websites)
Nowadays Omni​-channel sales have become a trend in retail business. Instead of selling via
traditional channels separately, business owners and marketers can use one, centered software
on a variety of channels to expand the reach to their customers more effectively. This solution
provides a great experience to the shop owners making their marketing actions less of a hassle.

The Problem
At the moment there are millions of small and medium enterprises operating on the market, not
using tools for sales management and online sales yet, or using inefficient ones.
There are many sales management softwares available but those are mainly in-store
applications which lead to ineffective training, difficulty in updating the software, customer
support problems etc. With other softwares there are big issues especially in the management
and development of the goods chains / branches because of the geographic location. There is no

ico.gosama.io
Omnichannel supported sale management system
With integrated spenable cryptocurrency.

PAGE 8 ​OF 29

good enough warehouse solution on the market for stores separated by the distance. Beside
that, the investment in such software remains relatively high.
There are many issues that the traditional retail businesses are facing such as:
-

They own a large quantities of goods making management of it difficult. If there is no
reasonable plan a confusion and sale loss are inevitable.

-

It is very time-consuming and difficult for shop owners to control all the records of
imported and exported goods, to create bills for the customers and deal with orders.

-

The management of employees is bringing some difficulties, especially for chain model
businesses.

-

Promotion and marketing campaigns for the whole chain are difficult without good
management system. It is easy to make mistakes and lose customers trust for the brand.

-

Expansion of sale channels, goods data, customers data and billing is not well
synchronized due to use of many third parties products.

There are many avoidable situations that may happen to a business that is on the rise and want
to expand their market if they do not choose a right system. Also, when customers can not tell if
the brand is transparent there may be serious consequences of such management leading to
`harming or even ending the business ability to exist on the market.

PAGE 18 ​OF 29

Business Model
Our revenue model
Our revenue will consist of two main streams: the Gosama platform service fee and
direct-to-customer marketing programs.
With the desire to expand a community on Gosama Platform we provide a free package with a
limited data volumes for the start-ups. For those who have done business and want to expand
their it with different sale channels and support their customers better, they can pay Gosama
platform service fees flexibly and economically. Gosama service is the only platform on the
market that allows customers to select individual functions and build Gosama sales system
according to their enterprise scale and current needs.
With the motto "You will not pay for the functions you do not use," Gosama platform will bring
the lowest cost and create an environment the most suitable for your business.
The second major source of the revenue will be from the direct-to-customers marketing
payments. Businesses will pay consumers for viewing their marketing and the Gosama platform
will partly debit the payment to maintain and operate the system.

The opportunity
The Gosama platform operates in a rapidly evolving and innovative marketplace where retail
businesses always need a good and effective sales management system. The global point-of-sale
(POS) terminals market size is expected to reach USD 116.06 billion by year 2025
(​https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-point-of-sale-terminals-market​).
Meanwhile, the mobile marketing market is expected to grow nearly 30%, compared to the
same period last year and triple to more than $ 99 billion by 2021.
(​https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/mobilemarketing.asp​).

ico.gosama.io
Omnichannel supported sale management system
With integrated spenable cryptocurrency.

PAGE 19 ​OF 29

The market for Gosama will gain $ 11 billion for the platform service fee and $ 9 billion for
marketing service fee.
The market pull is huge- mainly because of the increasing number of mobile users and high
Internet speed leading to a high amounts of mobile browsing and mobile applications.
Enterprises that need to apply digital transformation- using technology platforms into the
management of sales and marketing- began to increase in amount. Their current solutions are
not catching up with the needs of the consumers quickly enough and can not neither provide
consumers with desired consumer experience, nor provide traceability and user data security
that the Gosama platform will provide at an extremely affordable cost.
Top research companies, like Forrester Research, strongly advise E-businesses to invest heavily
into mobile platforms to meet consumer’s demand and prepare platforms for AR, VR, Chatbot
and voice-based interface that are coming soon. All the future urgency and market expansion
are real and will continue to drive the demand for a comprehensive platform like Gosama.

Our target markets and go-to-market
We mainly target growing SMEs businesses that have annual sales over $ 10 million. Priority
markets are Fashion and Food & Beverage, as both have a great mobile users community that
wants to connect both online and offline. Future markets will be other services such as: Mother
and Baby, Electronics, Refrigeration, Medicine, Small Supermarkets, Flowers and Gifts,
Furniture. While we are not targeting them at this time, our platform will serve all industries and
businesses that view mobile phones as an indispensable consumer’s communication tool.
Our future campaigns will be done through a direct sales in Southern East Asia regionespecially in the quickly developing countries such as: Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia,
Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. After the success in Southeast Asian market we will be
expanding into the Asian and European markets.

Soft-cap is set at $2 million, which allows us to launch our Blockchain platform. To meet the
milestones stated in our roadmap, our goal will range from $ 5 mil to $ 7 mil. Our hard-cap will
be set at $ 10 million. Reaching the hard-cap target will enable us to accelerate our market and
global growth.

Why Gosama?
Gosama was built to revolutionize the sales management of retail chains by redefining
the O2O (Offline to Online) sales process and identifying the way companies build and manage
relationships with their customers.
We are expecting a huge growth in the upcoming 2 years of building it and expanding to
more and more customers in Asia as well as world-wide. However, it is important to have a
support at the start which will make that growth easier and more efficient. Without investors
who support our idea we won’t go as far as fast as we would like to.
We would appreciate you to considering to join us in that process as it is truly exciting
adventure that will revolutionize the way we pay for things and use cryptocurrency in the retail
business. We realize that the time for this idea IS NOW as nowadays the blockchain technology
is a popular topic and investment. We would like you to become a part of the Digital
Transformation to help both consumers and business owners gain from the cryptocurrency we
create.
