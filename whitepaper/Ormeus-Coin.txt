B U I L DING ON T HE GOLD S TANDARD O F CRYPTO CURRE NCY

ABSTRACT

Ormeus Global announces the release of Ormeus Coin (asset symbol
‘ORME’). The real-world value of this new token is secured and
cryptographically linked to a publicly verifiable reserve of Bitcoin, the
‘gold standard’ of cryptocurrency1. The bitcoin reserve known as the
Ormeus Reserve Vault (hereafter “ORV”) is a multisignature Bitcoin wallet
funded by the ongoing industrial bitcoin mining operations of Ormeus
Global. These operations have an initial baseline hashing power of 30
PH/s. This hashrate will be continuously upgraded by allocating
proceeds derived from the sale of ORME tokens. Unlike other static or
semi-static bitcoin-backed cryptocurrencies (which are historically
highly speculative in nature and backed by token sales alone) Ormeus
Coin will be backed both by token sales and a geographically diverse
industrial cryptocurrency mining operation. This predefined mechanism
to facilitate the continual accumulation of hashing power will result in
the ORV having a constantly increasing reserve store of bitcoin which
effectively

1 I N T RODUC T ION
In 2008, the paper: “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” penned by the pseudonymous
Satoshi Nakamoto appeared online. By now, all know of Nakamoto’s historic achievement: he
married the mathematical science of cryptography with the digital world to create what we now
know as blockchain technology. Over the last few years the world has started to grasp the full scope
of Nakamoto’s genius as the applications of Bitcoin’s blockchain technology filter from the fringes
into the mainstream. Indeed, blockchain has gone from an interesting but obscure concept to the
premiere financial technology du jour explored by the likes of Dell, Microsoft, Google,
Goldman-Sachs & J.P. Morgan2 and other major financial and investment companies for its ability to
facilitate secure, encrypted, decentralized and anonymous transactions directly (without
intermediaries) between parties .
Since the advent of that first white paper exploring the realms of digital cash and the blockchain and
its application to the creation of digital currency, numerous coins and tokens have been created. To
date, none have surpassed the popularity of the first, Bitcoin.
Bitcoin (BTC) is considered the “gold standard” of cryptocurrency3. The first BTC transaction from
Nakamoto to Hal Finney occurred on January 9, 2009. Since then, approximately 240,000,000 BTC
transactions have taken place around the world. BTC can be used for purchases ranging from a new
Dell computer to a box of groceries from Whole Foods Market or saved in a virtual wallet until the
owner is ready to sell, exchange it for another currency, or buy something new. Bitcoin has become
its own currency in a new world that sees no bank, no government, as the ultimate authority and
arbiter of its currency. In this brave new Bitcoin world, people ARE their own bank; each of us has the
potential to become our own source of security.
It is into this world that a new coin appears: Ormeus Coin. The name Ormeus is a play on the
Medieval alchemist’s term, orme, which refers to turning base metal into gold. From archeological
finds, biblical references, the recorded histories of ancient Egypt and others dated conservatively
from the 5th millennium BC4 through today, gold was and continues to be a desirable currency and

store of value worldwide. For centuries, people sought gold for its beauty and scarcity, which in turn
made it valuable. The earth yielded its gold reluctantly, and only at great cost; time, effort, and
strength were required to wrest this precious metal from the earth and refine it to its soft sheen.
Gold became the coin of the realm, the object to barter if you needed to purchase food, a night’s
lodging, a new horse, a home. Gradually, gold was replaced with paper currency as well as other
base coins, made from metals such as nickel and silver, which were valuable, although never as
valuable as gold. Paper currency, backed by gold, symbolized the value of a bar of gold but was
easier to carry for the average person. As recently as 1973, paper money in the United States. was
“pegged” to gold. In other words, the ‘gold standard’ both ensured and insured the value of paper
currency. When the U.S. dollar and other global currencies were divorced from the gold standard,
problems emerged. Inflation (a decline in the real-world purchasing power) began to devalue money;
people found the dollar wouldn’t stretch as far as it once did. The gold standard, with its promise of
security, of solidity, of backing - this is what gave paper money its intrinsic value.
What if, among the world of emerging cryptocurrencies, a new “gold standard” emerged?
That gold standard is, of course, Bitcoin. Due to the ongoing decline in value caused by inflation of
standard world currencies, Bitcoin has continued to rise inexorably from 10¢ around the time of its
launch to all-time highs of over $4,5005 (as of this writing). Not surprisingly, it is expected to climb
even higher in the coming months and years6. As other cryptocurrencies within the marketplace
scramble for acceptance and relevance within the community (and the world at large), it continues to
be Bitcoin that analysts from companies such as Goldman Sachs7 and other major banks, financial
news networks8 and media cite as an example, rubric and yardstick by which the others are measured.
Bitcoin sets the bar high and others strive to reach it. Ormeus Coin (ORME) is a new cryptocurrency
secured, backed and cryptographically linked to the gold standard of crypto: Bitcoin.

2 A B O UT ORMEUS COIN
Ormeus Coin is the name of a new cryptocurrency assembled a team of cryptocurrency experts,
programmers, and developers.
Ormeus Coin brings the “gold-standard” of Bitcoin together with the programmable smart contracts of
Ethereum in order to create a coin that has never been seen before in the history of cryptocurrency. A
cryptocurrency that is backed by Bitcoin mining and is designed to outpace the growth of Bitcoin.

3 W H AT MA KES ORMEUS CO IN UNIQ UE
Ormeus Coin presents a unique and powerful proposition of value as a cryptocurrency by
strategically leveraging the individual advantages of both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.
Benefits of Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that allows users to transact value without requiring them to trust a third
party - such as a clearing house or bank. This shift into “proof-based” transactions is accomplished
using the well-known mechanisms of public key cryptography. The fundamental transaction
specifications are summarized in the following illustration from the original bitcoin white paper:

The impeccable design of Bitcoin prevents double spending and minimizes the risk of attack by
making it computationally impractical to attempt unauthorized alterations of the ledger. Not only is
Bitcoin designed to be a secure method of transacting value, but it is also designed to increase in
value. Unlike the Dollar, Bitcoin experiences deflation instead of inflation. There is a limited quantity
of Bitcoin - 21 million to be exact. Because there is a limited quantity, when more people buy Bitcoin
it drives the price up because Bitcoin becomes more and more scarce as a result. These fundamental
attributes of bitcoin combined with the “first adopter” advantage of bitcoin as being the first of such
technologies to exist, has led to the widespread acceptance and adoption we see around the world
today. This large scale adoption of bitcoin and its continued exponential growth in acceptance has
made bitcoin the benchmark of monetary value transfer in the cryptocurrency economy.

Benefits of Ethereum
In the Ethereum Whitepaper, Vitalik Buterin (the inventor of Ethereum) writes that Ethereum is
designed to improve upon the pre-existing (Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies) concepts of
scripting, altcoins, and on-chain meta-protocols. These improvements allow developers to create
arbitrary consensus-based applications that have the robust scalability, standardization,
feature-completeness, ease of development and interoperability offered by these different paradigms
all at the same time. Ethereum accomplishes this by building a foundational layer that contains a
built-in Turing-complete programming language that allows anyone to write smart contracts and
decentralized applications where they can create their own rules and functions. Smart contracts are
cryptographic “boxes” that serve a purpose or contain value. Smart contracts are locked until a
predefined condition has been met. While Bitcoin offers similar functions, Ethereum’s smart
contracts are more powerful due their Turing-awareness, value-awareness and blockchain
awareness capabilities.
Ormeus Coin - A Synthesis of Both
Ormeus Coin will be backed by Bitcoin and company revenue. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that are
pegged to the value of Bitcoin, Ormeus Coin already has Bitcoin and BlockBox Bitcoin mining rigs
that will back the token. One BlockBox Bitcoin mining rig is capable of producing $500,000 of
Bitcoin every 30 days. Ormeus Coin is currently in possession of two BlockBox Bitcoin mining rigs
and will be purchasing more as time progresses. 40% of all Bitcoin generated by the BlockBox mining
rigs will be reinvested into purchasing more. Ormeus will be providing a way for token holders to
profit off of both the increase in Bitcoin value and the company revenue. Ethereum based smart
contracts will contain predefined quantities of Bitcoin from the Bitcoin mining profits. Ormeus tokens
will act as keys that will unlock corresponding smart contracts that contain Bitcoin. All Ormeus Coin
activity and smart contracts can be viewed and confirmed on the public ledger in order to provide
transparency and security to Ormeus Coin holders.
The synthesis of the powerful attributes of Bitcoin as a reliable cryptocurrency with a proven track
record along with Ethereum’s revolutionary smart contract capabilities is the solid foundation for
Ormeus Coin which will allow continued scalable, and self-propelling growth far into the future.

4 H OW ORMEUS COIN IS BUILT
Ormeus Coin is built as an ERC-20 Compliant token on the Ethereum blockchain. The Ormeus
mining rig servers are located in Hong Kong. The company has invested heavily into state of the art,
industrial-scale mining rigs and staff to ensure smooth transactions with Ormeus Coin (ORME).
The ORME Enhanced Smart Contract (currently in development) will provide built-in functions to support:
Verification of regular mining deposits from the Ormeus mine that serves as a “Proof of Mining” to
validate the ongoing robust operation of the Ormeus mining operations.
On-demand verification of the Ormeus Reserve Vault (ORV) BTC balance through direct query of the
Bitcoin blockchain showing the total available reserve.
Functionality to “lock” and “unlock” the bitcoin deposited to the ORV by the Ormeus Miners.

7 PRI VAC Y & SEC URIT Y
The elements of privacy and security are of key importance and priority in the realm of blockchain
and many of the various implementations of the technology exhibit a diverse range of
methodology and schools of thought.
Privacy
Often the notion that blockchain-based assets contain automatic anonymity is talked about and is,
quite frankly, not often the case. The implementation of ring signatures12 (such as the
cryptonote-based blockchain Monero), while having various potential weakness is one of the strongest
privacy protecting measures yet discovered in the blockchain space. The blockchains which have
strong privacy protection unfortunately lend themselves to being used for nefarious purposes such as
the popular13 Monero mining malware. These negative applications are ones which Ormeus Coin
effectively avoids by operating on the Ethereum Blockchain as an ERC-20 token. While complete and
total anonymity is not available using the Ethereum blockchain, this does not mean that privacy is not
available. In fact, with both the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains, wallet addresses contain no explicit
PII (Personally Identifiable Information). This helps to ensure a reasonable balance between the
security of privacy and accountability of transparency.
All transactions performed in Ormeus Coin are clearly visible and the balance totals of all Ormeus
Coin owners is clearly visible. To view a list of the top Ormeus Coin wallets (also known as the “rich
list”), navigate to the EtherScan page located at the following address:

To read more about privacy as it relates to blockchain technology, read this article written by Vitalik
Buterin, the founder of Ethereum: Privacy on the Blockchain.14
Security
Ormeus Coin is fully secured with the same standards as are employed by the Ethereum blockchain.
The primary principles behind Ethereum security leverage the technology of public key
cryptography15 16 17 to carry out all manner of functions. This form of cryptography is implemented
in numerous ways to accomplish the desired functions of the smart contract.

exchange and the many challenges presented by the traditional systems of money, followed by a
description of how Ormeus Coin connects into this timeline of money and how Ormeus Coin will
provide a newer and more modern solution to some of the age-old challenges faced by the old
currency systems. Next, a general introduction to Ormeus Coin was given along with an overview of
the production process and issuance of tokens. Then we examined the official development
roadmap which describes those tasks which have been completed and those which are pending. We
also examined the technical nature of Ormeus Coin as being a fully compliant ERC-20 Ethereum
token and we examined the elements of privacy and security which are provided in the Ormeus Coin
smart contract token. Then finally we discussed the bitcoin backing of Ormeus Coin
