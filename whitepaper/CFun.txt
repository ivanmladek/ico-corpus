Background
The vision of CFun, in the 24 months to come, is to subvert all existing
ways of creation, till that of socializing! Everyone may build their own
community via CFun, of which content is body and token is blood. Each
individual, company and product would build homeland exclusive to
themselves. CFun is to reshape tokenized online community, redefine
content-oriented social intercourse through Blockchain; redefine the value
of members of community by means of token, i.e. Tokenize Individual
Creativity.
Many brands, entertainment companies, gaming companies have strong
demands for IPs that meet their needs. Marketers want their customers to
remember their brands as vividly as they do for “Three Squirrels” (a
popular Chinese snack brand that promotes its brand with three cute
cartoon squirrels) and are willing to pay for suitable IPs. At the same time,
creators are actively digging for gold by creating new IPs, for instance,
internet video producers eagerly working to create the next “Princess
Promotion” (an internet drama series in China with great popularity and
financial returns). Suitable IPs can attract users, help personalize the
brand and bring customers closer, especially the younger generations.
Currently, the so-called Top IPs, which only accounts for less than 1% of
the total IPs, hog the spotlight and trade at sky-high prices; however, the
remaining 99% non-Top IPs (many are of high quality) are significantly
undervalued and difficult to be monetized. On the other hand, a vast
number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs, numbered about 40
million in China now) cannot afford and sonetimes do not need the Top
IPs; but it is difficult for them to find suitable IPs that fit their specific
needs. The concept of Intellectual Property (IP) has been distorted by the
traditional market — in fact, any created content with fans can be called
IPs, not just the Top 1% only.

Why is the IP market distorted and in bad shape? There are two reasons:
First, a mismatch exists between the massive IP demands and numerous
undervalued IPs.
There is no a general measurement to value an IP. A same IP may have
different values for different users (just imagine Barbie dolls for men
sportswear!). For the demand side, it is hard for potential buyers to judge
whether a new IP in early creation can actually meet their or their customers’
demands. SMEs typically set IP licensing/purchasing budget around 1000
USD, thus cannot afford to work with a large number of creators. Meanwhile,
creators often lack self-promotion and sales negotiation skills, thus business
negotiation becomes a waste of their time, both in result and opportunity
cost. The traditional solution resorts to intermediaries (such as design
companies and advertising agencies) to bridge creators and buyers, but this
incurs high costs that effectively shut out the SMEs and non-Top IPs. The
result is what we see today — most potential buyers fail to obtain suitable
IPs and most creators are hardly rewarded.
To solve this mismatch, CFun Project will use its patented algorithm
(Method and System for IP Evaluation Based on Audience Behavior
Statistics) to record the behaviors of contributors and readers on blockchain
and evaluate the market value of the creative works.

Second, the cost of PGC (Professionally Generated Content) is too high.
In order to improve the ROI, companies (e.g. in gaming, entertainment,
design and comics) often have no other options but to adopt PGC
(Professional Generated Content), concentrating significant resources in the
hope of producing a small number of Top IPs. If successful, producers and
creators may obtain a huge amount of instant wealth. However, for those
who fail to strike Top (the remaining 99%), the creators struggle to make a
living and many will soon give up their creating activities. In today’s world,
creativity work is more like a gamble — not all good work pays off.
To lower the IP production cost of PGC, companies sometimes resort to
UGC (User Generated Content), in which companies source or crowd
source ideas and creativity works from individual users who may not be
professional creators. The cost is indeed lower, but it is difficult to create
long, large and complex works due to limitations of skills and abilities of any
individual.
Our Solution — CoGC Platform
To solve this problem, CFun proposes the concept of CoGC –
Collaboratively Generated Content. CoGC is decentralized self-organized
crowd creation, which allows creators of different skills from different fields
to collaborate together in the same group in order to produce complex
works of high-quality. Essentially, CFun is a CoGC platform that supports
decentralized autonomous creation groups by providing a series of core
functions (authorship verification, contribution calculation, rewards for
audience/patrons, evaluation of works, popularity data verification, matching
buyers, etc. More details are below in the white paper).

CFun has already established initial success in Chinese market, and will
extend existing operation overseas first and then expand into other CoGC
fields in the future. CFun first established its CoGC platform in China in
2015 in a niche domain – ACG (Anime, Comic and Games) Language
Cosplay. After numerous tests and operations, the procedures, methods,
models and transaction requirements of CoGC have been well tested,
verified and proven. CFun’s operation in China is successful and achieved
major milestones of success — by now, CFun is already the largest
platform for crowd creation of creative writing in China.
CFun’s next step is to integrate its CoGC platform with blockchain
technologies and expand into overseas markets, including Japan, Korea,
United States, United Kingdom, France. The major focus is still on CoGC of
creative writing. Eventually, CFun will include all areas of CoGC, including
comics, music and movies.
The mission of CFun is to link creators globally, provide them with
blockchain-based CoGC tools,

help individual creators tokenize their

creativity and enjoy individual value transactions.

CFun Project Introduction

2.1 Introduction of CFun Project
CFun is a DApp (Decentralized Application) built on Qtum Blockchain and
serves as the support platform that links global creators together. To
facilitate self-organized collaborative creation, CFun records authorships
onto blockchains, predicts the market value of creative works and matches
buyers with patented algorithms, calculates contribution among co-creators
and completes IP transactions through smart contracts, etc. The mission of
CFun is to tokenize individual creativity and realize socialized content
creation as well as facilitate value transactions of these personal digital
assets.

Core Mechanisms of CFun

2.2 Problems to Be Solved by CFun
2.2.1 Record Authorships for Huge Quantity of Works
CFun has already become a platform holding tens of thousands of stories.
However, these digital assets can be easily replicated, thus creators find it
hard to protect their rights and trade their works.
CFun will solve this problem by recording every stage of the creation (from
initial inspiration to the final work) onto blockchains thus rendering creation
logs undeniable and unmodifiable. Tracing and assertion of IP rights can be
executed and regulated via smart contracts.
2.2.2 Quantify the value of new IPs under creation and how well they match
buyers’ requirement
For an idea under development that is just a few hundred words in length,
how to evaluate and predict its value so that it can become tradable? Utilizing
the unmodifiable and traceable features of blockchain, CFun records
creators’ creation process and readers’ behavioral data, including reading,
commenting and sharing. After data collection and analysis, CFun uses its
patented algorithm — Method and System for IP Evaluation Based on
Audience Behavior Statistics to assess the market potential and appeal of an
early-stage IP to specific targeted consumers. In addition, the IP buyer can
easily select the most suitable early-stage IP thanks to the patented
algorithm. This method also facilitates transactions with Smart Contracts.

2.2.3 Credibility of Popularity Data
Popularity data (such as the number of reads or likes) on IPs can easily be
faked and fabricated in current copyright market. Therefore, the buyers
cannot tell whether the data of their interested IPs are authentic or not. In
order to reduce the cost of trust and improve transparency of the system,
CFun brings in blockchain technologies to rebuild the trust system. All metrics
and statistics that may impact the value of the IPs will be recorded regularly
onto the blockchains. The traceable, unmodifiable and up-to-date data
significantly boosts buyer’s confidence in IP transactions.
2.2.4 Unstable Income of Grassroot Creators
For most (90%) grassroot creators, their incomes are mainly from the
subscription or tips of readers, meaning that many of them may have no
income at the beginning stage of their creations. CFun will solve the problem
by using its patented algorithm to provide trustworthy prediction of IP value
and target audience to potential buyers, so they can get involved and make
investments at the earlier stage of these IPs. In this way, creators may
receive income earlier and also be incentivized to further develop their work
due to quantifiable expectation of their future work.

2.2.5 Motivate and Reward Readers/Patrons
Participation of readers (or audience, viewers, fans, supporters, patrons,
etc.), such as reading, voting, sharing and commenting, has critical valueadding effects on IP values. However, there are few incentives and
systematic reward distribution mechanism offered to readers in the current
system. Thanks to blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies, CFun will
now record readers’ active participation and reward them in the form of CFun
Tokens. Based on the Qtum Blockchain, CFun aims to build a large CoGC
ecosystem with big data that can evaluate real-time popularity of an IP, match
IP requirements through Smart Contracts, audit and settle transactions, and
reward creators and readers.
Readers and creators are rewarded in the form of CFun Tokens through
reading and creating respectively. Readers and creators who complete
special high value-adding tasks can get extra CFun Tokens as bonus. When
an IP from CFun Platform is sold, its creators and co-creators will receive the
sales proceeds according to CFun’s contribution algorithms. At the same
time, a specific token feedback mechanism will be triggered to reward CFunTokens’ holders including all creators, readers and other token holders.

2.3 CFun Eco-system
Starting from the niche sector ACG (Anime, Comic and Games) Language Cosplay in China,
CFun has already established a network of self-organized crowd creation groups in creative
writing. CFun is now further expanding its eco-system of decentralized autonomous crowd
creation in Japan and Korea, with IP incubation as its core. Different participants of the CFun
Eco-system are interrelated and connected by demands, content and IP values, and shall
collaboratively create, develop, communicate, and gain.
Then, a collaborative relationship is built based on demand of members, content and IP
values.

CFun Ecosystem

2.3.1 Collaborative Creation and Mutual Benefits
Creators refers to IP creators and copyright owners. Creation of a new IP (a new story,
project, etc.) is usually initiated by a creator or by a buyer with specific needs, and then more
creators can opt in for subsequent CoGC. Every stage of the creation process will be
recorded in real-tine onto the blockchains, providing proof of authorship and serving as
evidence for potential earning distributions in the future.

2.3.2 Reader Participation in the Fans Economy
Readers’ participation, like reading, voting, sharing, commenting, has a value-adding effect
on IP values. These value-adding actions are rewarded with CFun Tokens by Smart
Contracts. Centering on community-based CoGC, CFun closes the loop of IP creation, IP
distribution and IP consumption, thus motivating creators for their works, encouraging
readers for their participation, and providing more opportunities for the entire CoGC ecosystem.
2.3.3 Method and System for IP Evaluation Based on Audience Behavior Statistics
The patented algorithm calculates the IP Value of a creative work (α) by combining the
Popularity Index (β) and the weighted average of a series of parameters including theme,
word count, page views (θ) together. (The application of a new patent for this method of IP
evaluation has been submitted)
IP Value α = β + θ
IP Value = Popularity Index + Weighted Average
2.3.4 The Popularity Index
By collecting and analyzing data on users’ digital content consumption behaviors, CFun has
invented the Popularity Index as one key indicator of IP value and as the critical
performance metric to compare different works.

Popularity Index

The further down a line is in the story, the fewer readers remain and the more CFun Token
offered to readers as rewards.
The Popularity Index is derived from the churn rate curve invented by CFun based on the
analysis of reader behaviors. The shape of the churn rate (the rate at which readers drop out
line by line) influences and determines the value of the creative work. Based on empirical
user data from CFun’s database, the churn rate curve can be summarized and described by
a single numerical metric, the Popularity Index.
The simplified formula showing the concept of the Popularity Index is as follows:

Among the variables,
（1）r is the number of words read and is a function of p, the number of readers who have
read the rth word. The larger the r, the smaller the p. In an idealized model, relationship of r
and p are such that the above formula yields a fixed β, regardless of the values of r.
（2）R is the total number of words of the created digital work and is fixed at the time of
computation. R should always be larger than r.
（3）p is the number of readers who have read the rth word.
（4）P is also a fixed term, which accounts for the maximum value of p when r is relatively
small (i.e. the number of people who read the first few lines). P should always be larger than
p and R should always be larger than r.

The Popularity Index is a crucial component of the evaluation tool to assess the prospects of
a given creative work. It has three functions:
（1）For a given IP, a higher Popularity Index means a lower reader churn rate. It
demonstrates the IP’s attractiveness to retain existing readers and win new readers,
facilitating the discovery of potentially popular IPs.
（2）For creators, the Popularity Index can help them better understand the preferences of
their readers and avoid unattractive contents. In this way, reading activities from readers
become an assistant for future creating activities from the creators.
（3）For IP buyers, combining metrics like theme, Popularity Index and number of fans
together helps them identify the best IPs to purchase and also show the good purchase
timing.

2.3.5.IP Selection and Pricing
（1）IP Selection
People can be divided into different categories. Members within one category tend to share
common values, community awareness, brand loyalty, and other behavior tendency related
to brands with other members, thus may exhibit common reading preferences and evaluation
standards. Setting up reader tags helps quantify the value of a particular IP and assess
whether it matches a specific demand. Even before an IP grows popular enough to establish
its fan base, the IP selection algorithms of CFun can predict the IP’s future prospects and its
“category tags” based on the behavioral patterns and tags of its existing few readers. This
helps IP buyers in purchasing decision-making
（2）IP Pricing
By collecting and analyzing data on reader behaviors, CFun’s patented algorithm — Method
and System for IP Evaluation Based on Audience Behavior Statistics calculates the value of
a specific IP real-time, thus presenting the worth of the IP to buyers in an obvious manner.
2.3.6 IP Transaction
IP buyers select the creative works that matches their demands through smart IP screening,
and proceed to negotiate licensing or purchasing prices with the creators (CFun may also
serve as the broker). IP buyers can also customize their own IP requirements and tags, and
solicit creators to collaborate — all through CFun’s Smart Contracts with objectives and
reward schemes formulated by IP buyers.
2.3.7 Copyright Rules
Creators collectively own the copyrights of their works by default. However, the initiating
creator of a project can set the rules of his/her work and implement the rules with Smart
Contracts.
2.3.8 Content Tags
By analyzing data of readers, creators and IP buyers, CFun creates tags for every work and
entity in the CFun Eco-system, making their avatars fuller and richer.

2.4 Technology Solution
CFun is a mobile decentralized application in the field of collaborative creation
built on Qtum, with the features of large data volume and high concurrency. In
order to adapt the features of blockchain e.g. data cannot be recorded and
confirmed at real time and it has to be charged， a behavioral chain algorithm
has been specifically designed. To efficiently utilizing blockchain, the data to
be recorded on chain in accordance with time, identity and information related
will be correlatively stored and compressed.
Based on the content classification rules in CFun, the behavioral chain
algorithm divides the data storage unit from high to low according to content
category, subject, title, chapter etc. The user's creation and other behaviors
will be uploaded to the server and cached to the respective classified nodes,
which will be searched for the data nodes reaching the upper limit from low
level to high level and will be compressed and recorded on chain, afterwards
triggering the corresponding functions of Qtum smart contract.
All the information of user behaviors is stored in the CFun server. The server
will generate behavioral tags in the light of behavioral content, time, and user
information with the addition of behavior related factors. Afterwards, the data
will be recorded on chain using the behavioral chain algorithm.
CFun users' creation and other meaningful behaviors are regarded as part of
the content creation value. On the basis of the content classification rules, the
server will implement the data query service and collect the behavioral data
sorted out. User contributions and benefits will be shown in the interface of
CFun light wallet.

2.5 Business Model
2.5.1 Participants
CFun Eco-system is centered on its community. With the goal of generating original creative
works, CFun aims to incubate creative writings of high quality with respect to work styles,
number of fans, profile of fans, market conditions, etc in the first stage. The next stage is to
expand into other categories of creative works such as comics, radio plays, movies & TV,
games, ACG periphery products, etc.
Participants of the CFun Eco-system can simultaneously assume different status and
exercise different rights so as to obtain benefits corresponding to their assumed status.

（1）Creators
Creators earn CFun Tokens by continuously updating their creative works. They can also
benefit from value appreciation and sales of their IPs.
（2）Readers
Readers earn CFun Tokens for their active participation such as reading, voting,
commenting and sharing. The more they participate, the more values they add to the IP, and
the more rewards they receive.
（3）IP Buyers
IP Buyers publish their request for IP via Smart Contracts and identify valuable IPs through
the Popularity Index and other IP evaluation mechanisms.

2.5.2 Circulation Model of CFun Tokens

CFun Token Circulation Model

CFun Platform facilitates IP transactions of two types: Request for Customized IP
and Purchase of Original Creation.
1.Request for Customized IP
Through Smart Contracts on CFun DApp, IP buyers deposit rewards (e.g. CFun
Tokens) into the contract and set up a series of requirement metrics including
themes, word counts, page views, targeted readers for the final work. These metrics
can be either publicly visible or invisible (invisible metrics are set to prevent users
from cheating on the system). When created works and reader behaviors match the
requirement metrics, Smart Contracts will automatically trigger and complete the
transaction by paying the deposited rewards to the creators and readers in
proportions to their respective contributions as calculated by CFun’s patented
algorithms.

2.Purchase of Original Creation
Creators spontaneously create their original works on CFun based on their personal
ambitions and interests, and readers read the works on CFun. When a work attracts
enough reads and accumulates enough fans, it becomes a so-called IP. The
copyrights of this IP are automatically transferred to CFun by default agreement with
the creators to facilitate potential transactions (in the event that the IP is not traded
two years after its creation, its copyrights will be returned to the creators). If the IP is
later licensed or purchased, CFun will distribute revenues from the transaction to the
creators based on their respective contributions via Smart Contracts.
3.CFun Token Reward Mechanism
CFun Foundation plans to reserve 100 million CFun Tokens (10% of total) in an
Award Reserve Pool and distribute them to creators and readers as contributionbased

rewards

over

four

years. If the

works

of original

creation

are

licensed/purchased, 80% of the proceeds will be given to the creators. The
remaining 20% will be used to purchase CFun Tokens from secondary markets in
order to replenish the Award Reserve Pool.
When CFun Tokens are distributed from the Award Reserve Pool, the distribution
amount will be adjusted dynamically in accordance with key factors including the
total number of creators, total number of readers, total daily reads, and total daily
words created on CFun, CFun Token prices, remaining CFun Tokens in the Award
Reserve Pool, and IP transaction volume.
The ultimate goal is to strike a dynamic equilibrium between the input into and the
output from the Award Reserve Pool. In other words, the number of CFun Tokens
deposited into the Pool at any given time interval should be equal to the CFun
Tokens distributed out.

Experiences and Vision of CFun

3.1 A Flying Start - Successful Experience in the Chinese Market
At the moment, Chinese internet companies have leading experiences compared to Japan,
South Korea and Southeast Asia with respect to internet venture operations. Despite the
ultra-competitive internet landscape in China, CFun has proven its market leadership by
demonstrating superb strength in product design, user experience design, market
development, business-demand analysis, user activity improvement, incentive schemes
design, etc.
CFun Project first started in 2015 and has achieved major milestones over the past two
years:
1. CFun has successfully enlisted 210,000 creative writers on its CoGC platform. With
overall marketing cost below 100,000 USD, the average acquisition cost per user is less
than 50 cents. This is achieved mainly via community management and social campaigns.
This method is effective in building and maintaining a stable user base and can be applied to
other countries like Japan and Korea.
2. Cfun’s unique multi-person collaborative creation mode, with strong social attributes.
Social interaction brings fun and inspiration to creation; meanwhile, social relations among
creators increase intrinsic motivation of creation making each role in the work more vivid and
solid. Social relations between readers and creators not only shorten the distance between
readers and works, but also allowed the works to swiftly attract a large number of fans.
3. The joining of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) boosts the continuous increase of user
number on CFun. Not only can these KOLs promote their works, their needs to interact with
their fans can also be fulfilled on CFun.
4. Content serves as topic, as classification, as mapping clue to categorize different people.
Using big data and content screening, CFun attracts targeted people with quality content and
retains them as loyal users.

5. A sense of achievement is as important as financial payment.
Though CFun chose not to pay the creators for their works, it still
emerges as the top platform for collaborative creative writing in
China. The main reason behind that is CFun’s deep understanding
of user psychology. Certainly, if CFun chooses to reward quality IPs
with financial incentives, it will attract more talents to create great
works.
CFun’s successful operation in the Chinese market has earned us
enormous resources and for it advantages to expand into overseas
markets, especially in Japan and Korea.

3.2 Vertical Extension – Entering Overseas Markets
The “Nijigen” culture (or ACG: Anime, Comic and Games）
originated from Japan, and has gained significant market shares in
South Korea, Southeast Asia and the United States. The recent
surge in Nijigen popularity is largely due to the development of
mobile internet. More people can read anime, comics and novels in
short intervals of their spare time, thus many works and characters
become popular. Many anime characters and fictional heroes have
become idols of teenagers. In addition, as smart phones become
ubiquitous, applications that focuses on social interactions become
the mainstream. Nijigen culture spreads virally and reinforces itself
quickly via social networks, driving more original creative works into
popularity.
In the first phase of its global expansion, CFun plans to focus on the
Asian market, especially Japan and Korea. In addition to leveraging
its experiences in the Chinese market, CFun will also take the
following steps:

1. Redesign and adjust CFun’s product according to Japanese and
Korean users’ preferences, including interface style and interactive
modes. The current user interface of CFun was designed by our
Japanese art consultant Kuroda Hirohito. From his design we can tell
that user preferences are quite similar across Japan and China.
2. Establish partnership with KOLs of the Nijigen communities in
Japan and Korea. This will attract local seed users to join CFun
Platform.
3. CFun plans to focus its resources on marketing and promotion
during the hundreds of various ACG/Nijigen conference events in
Japan and Korea.
4. IP demands in China have been huge in recent years. In 2016, the
culture and entertainment industry reached RMB350.5 billion (55
billion USD), an 11.8% increase compared to 2015. With the surge
of IP demand, an increasing number of Chinese IP buyers are
shifting their attention to Japan and South Korea. According to
current market statistics, Japanese and Korean IPs have strong
potential and advantages in the Chinese market in terms of price,
content, quality, viral capacity and scalability. Huge demands of IP in
China will also attract overseas readers and creators to join CFun.
5. CoGC knows no borders. IPs created by young Chinese writers
can also impress IP buyers overseas.

By taking advantages of its experience in Chinese market, blockchain
technologies and CFun Token system, CFun Platform aims to generate over
3000 new IPs through CoGC every month in Japan and Korea within the
next 18 months. Meanwhile, CFun will start exploring the markets in Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Singapore with the goal of becoming the biggest CoGC
platform in Asia Pacific in the near future.

3.3 Horizontal Expansion – Broadening the Fields of Creation
CFun will also horizontally expand its CoGC platform to cover other fields of
collaborative creation, such as comics, music and movies.
The concept of collaborative content creation applies not only in creative
writing. CoGC also applies to comics (e.g. storyboarding, line drafting,
coloring, etc.), music (e.g. lyrics, music composition, vocal, accompaniment,
etc.) where multiple creators with skills in different areas collaborate to
create the final work. An initiator can set up a project group and other
creators may then join. Every creator of this collaborative community utilizes
individual expertise, contributes to the progress of the work, grows his/her
fan base, and shares the benefits together.

4

Application Scenarios of CFun Tokens
4.1 Intellectual Property Transactions
IP buyers publish their Requests for Customized IP and associated CFun
Token reward plans through Smart Contracts on CFun, and evaluate the
submitted works according to the Popularity Index. Interested creators then
participate in the collaborative creation according to the rules set by Smart
Contracts. When IP buyers acquire the content they need, they have also
obtained the fans at the same time.

4.2 VIP Membership
Readers and creators can pay CFun Tokens for VIP membership, which
entitles them to obtain exclusive services and rights. For example, VIP
creators are entitled to have priority display for their works and VIP readers
can get more rewards than non-VIP users when reading the same content.

4.3 Fees for Reading
Creators can choose among four payment methods for reading their works
1. Free Reading: in this default mode, readers read creators’ works for free
and are rewarded with CFun Tokens by the CFun Platform for their reading
activities.
2. Paid Content: readers pay CFun Tokens to unlock more contents
3. Limited-time Free Reading: in order to attract more readers, creators allow
readers to read some contents for free within certain time limit
4. Paid to Read: creators pay readers extra CFun Tokens to attract them for
reading their works

4.4 Invitation for Co-creation
By offering CFun Tokens as rewards, creators invite other creators to further
develop their works. For example, to transform a writing into comics, voice
recordings, videos, games, etc.

4.5 Bounty Tasks
CFun Platform enables direct interaction between IP buyers and creators. IP
buyers can set up special-purpose topic groups, where users complete tasks
to earn CFun Tokens from the IP buyers. The tasks can be questionnaires,
content schemes, innovative ideas, etc.

4.6 Interactive Notification
Users can send notifications to others by paying CFun Tokens. They can
also decide whether to receive paid notification from other users and the
amount paid.

5

Issuance & Distribution of CFun Token

5.1 Issuance
CFun Project plans to issue a digital token called CFun for the purposes of activating
and facilitating the operation of reward system and the profit distribution within CFun
platform. With the issuance and circulation of CFun Token, transactions can be
concluded in a more convenient and transparent manner on the platform. In addition,
transactions will be executed and regulated automatically through Smart Contract,
which further guarantees the fairness of transaction without the warranty of a third party.

5.2 Distribution
The initial issuance volume of CFun is one billion, among which 500 million (50%) is set
to be distributed through ICO. BTC, ETH and Qtum are acceptable for exchange as per
certain rates. The raise target is set at 15 million USD or cryptocurrency equivalent, and
the specific conversion rates of different cryptocurrencies will be confirmed before the
official ICO.
If the ICO does not hit 30% of the target, namely selling 150,000,000 CFUN, it will be
deemed as unsuccessful offering. In such case, the offering will be terminated
immediately and amount raised refunded to the investors. However, when the amount of
CFun sold through ICO reaches 500,000,000, the ICO will be closed immediately.

Detailed distribution scheme of CFun is as followings:
500 million (50%) CFun will be distributed to the private placement investors and ICO
participants; ;
100 million (10%) CFun will be locked as development reserve and will only be issued
when necessary. In such case, the price and amount shall be determined through
community poll.
200 million (20%) CFun will be distributed to the team as long-term incentive. To make
sure the continuous execution of development roadmap after Crowd-funding, this part of
CFun will be gradually unlocked in 3 years. 5% CFUN will be released after finishing the
ICO; 5% will be released in 1 year later, and the next two years will release 5%
annually.
100 million (10%) CFun will be awarded to authors and readers as users incentive in
about 4 years.
100 million (10%) CFun will be used for commercial promotion of CFun project.
