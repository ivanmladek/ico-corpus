EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In recent months, there has been growing concern among advertisers over brand
safety and a call for transparency in terms of exactly what kind of content their ads
will appear next to.
This is driving a shift in thinking about digital advertising.
“There is not one definitive way to address the issues surrounding brand safety and
transparency” says Simon Stone, commercial director, Collective.
Recent incidents when brands have appeared in context and next to inappropriate,
distressing, damaging content has swung the pendulum back towards the research
for premium placement.
Companies do not control if their advertisement will appear in a well-known
premium title.
For brands that want to appear next to several premium placements in one go, there
is not really a quick-and-easy way of doing so since today’s marketplace is not
geared up to this way of working.
What advertisers need is something that has been talked about quite a lot before, but
never fully realized – A PREMIUM DECENTRALIZED AD MARKETPLACE.
As of today, several attempts to achieve this utopian ideal have failed. The
establishment of clear ground rules and strict membership criteria to ensure all
publishers pass the premium and transparency test were led by giant ad networks
trying to push their own agenda and personal interests.
But over the last few years, Blockchain has emerged as a potentially disruptive
technology based on the concept of a decentralized and distributed consensus ledger.
Thrive is strongly convinced that this new paradigm will be the enabler that defines
the future of digital marketing.
Thrive Labs ambition statement is to “build a better internet”, together.
Thrive’s ultimate goal is to establish the first meritocratic & community based
Premium Advertising Market Place, where all participants become strong
contributors in defining clear publisher interests, commercial benefits and self-

reinforcing processes to make joining the group a no-brainer.
Thrive believes the community is the backbone of its business model, therefore all
main actors who are actively contributing to the Ad Market Place development such
as Consumers, Reviewers, Advertisers and Publishers are eligible to improve their
economic performance.
This game changing concept in the digital advertising industry is strictly regulated
by a Transparent and Meritocratic reward model ensuring the full reserve token redistribution upon the ramp-up phase gets accomplished.
Thrive Labs is a Weboom LTD company, the #4 value-added services merchant in
Italy with a vast array of experience in the digital advertising domain.
In 2015, Weboom LTD was mentioned among the AdWords top 10 spenders in digital
advertising making its first appearance in the digital advertising industry.
The experience gained in running high margin, online and web-based marketing
services across 9 international markets over the past years guarantees solid

MARKET OPPORTUNITY & POTENTIAL GROWTH
Global advertising spending has been constantly increasing since 2010, and is
forecasted to round up to nearly 228 billion U.S. dollars in 2017. Due to advances in
technology and consumer preferences, not all mediums are as heavily invested in as
others.
Digital advertising spending worldwide – which includes both desktop and laptop
computers as well as mobile devices was estimated to be 198.4 billion U.S. dollars in
2016. This figure is forecast to constantly increase during the coming years, reaching
a total of 310 billion U.S. dollars by 2020.
Mobile internet advertising is a heavily invested sub-sector of the digital advertising
industry. Mobile internet advertising spending is forecast to increase from an
estimated 109 billion U.S. dollars in 2016 to just over 247 billion U.S. dollars in 2020.
Following this pattern, mobile advertising spending in the U.S. is also forecast to
double between 2015 and 2019. US data are taken as reference since indicative for the
overall advertising industry.

VALUE PROPOSITION
Strategic Framework:

On the supply side, publishers are seeking low fees and transparent ads rules. This
can be found in Thrive, provided that publishers ensure that their content is
premium and clean.
Reviewers’ community, thanks to their reports will be meritocratically rewarded,
which will guarantee publishers are going to represents a premium placement for
advertisers.
On the demand side, advertisers care about brand protection and effective
retargeting to maximize their ads conversion.
While brand reputation will be ensured by the premium content reviewers’ process,
predictive retargeting and high conversion will be possible thanks to Thrive Data
Platform Management. Consumers’ behavioral anonymous data, meritocratically
rewarded, will feed Thrive DMP with best in class information across the whole
customer journey.

5 | THRIVE WHITEPAPER V 11.0

Thrive’s platform, supported by Blockchain & Smart contracts is the backbone of this
integrated ecosystem.

Value Proposition:
a) Built from community consensus.
A private survey, collecting 100+ responses, has been circulated among top players in
the advertising industry (300k average yearly views).
The response can be summarized as follow:

THRIVE SURVEY
Number of Participants:

103

AVG yearly views per websites

339'345

AVG # of banners per websites

3.8

AVG Publisher CPM (€)

3.84

Interested in data sharing data

67%

Interested in sharing data if rewarded 0.5 € CPM

83%

AVG # of professional report requested yearly

3.8

Thrive joiners with adv. fee between 3% and 7%

83%

Thrive joiners with adv. fee between 8% and 12%

67%

Thrive joiners accepting Crypto currency as payment method 67%

6 | THRIVE WHITEPAPER V 11.0

Survey results show a wide interest and potential adoption of Thrive Market Place
among advertisers and publishers.
Thanks to Blockchain low transaction costs and full ledger transparency, Thrive will
be able to lower its fees between 7% and 10%, reaching around 80% survey
consensus.
Looking at current fee ranges applied by other competitors (from 32% to 49%) it
translates into a huge value creation for the industry.
The survey also demonstrated that publishers are interested in receiving
professional reports on how to improve and optimize their web content every
three/four months.
The token incentive for data sharing, highly supported by the 83% of publishers &
consumers (Thrive Survey), is thought not only to speed up the platform rampup/adoption but also to ensure reviews questionnaires get constantly improved and
tailor-made for each specific website.
For the first time, both Publishers and Consumers willing to voluntarily share
anonymous data will get monetary rewards helping Thrive community to steadily
support the market.
Something today everyone is already doing for free, ignoring all risks related to data
storage security. (See Case Study 3)
b) Reviewer Reward. Meritocracy as the core value for services rewarding.
Plenty of websites promise rewards for users test or users review. Looking at the
major ones (e.g. TryMYUI, User Testing, Analysia) the average monetary reward can
be assessed at 8€ per test for a maximum of 3 available tests per week. A web tester
can earn today up to 1’150 €/year.
Thrive’s meritocratic model will assign a token equivalent prize of 10€ to each
winning reviewer plus 5€ to be shared among the 20% top contributors. (Among 25
concurrent reviews needed for each website)
The meritocratic model is based on the concept that a web site report needs several
concurrent reviews before being considered reliable.

7 | THRIVE WHITEPAPER V 11.0

This means 25 reviews needs to be submitted before the A.I. engine can establish the
winning one assigning:
- 10€ tokens equivalent prize to the winning reviewer
- 1€ tokens equivalent prize to the 5 non-winner best contributors.
In case the equilibrium ratio is broken, the difficulty index may vary dynamically
from 0.25 to 2 regulating the number of concurrent reviews from 6 up to 50, while
maintaining a constant distribution of tokens among participants.
This is translated in a potential reviewer yearly income up to 27K€ in tokens
equivalents, increasing the value creation for reviewers by a factor 25 compared to
existing offering.

c) User Reward. The value of consumers’ data sharing.
In the digital advertising world, once you have an idea of the customers, you should
further drill down to explore them in more detail.

What are their media consumption habits? What are their expectations and
aspirations? What are their priorities? How much disposable income do they have?
What are their buying habits? Are they likely to have children? How many holidays
do they take a year? How can you help them?
This information was in the past obtained in a variety of ways, from commissioning
a specialist market research agency, to examining sales patterns or social
interactions.
Nowadays with the development of internet, mobile and social media platforms,
consumers’ information is owned by very few giant companies that are fully
benefiting from the good faith of consumers.
Today, in fact, consumers’ addiction to popular social platforms and search engines
is triggering an unconscious sharing of their behavioral information. In most of the
cases without any self-awareness and without perceiving any benefit.
Thrive is the first Adv. Marketplace platform rewarding consumers’ anonymous data
sharing.

8 | THRIVE WHITEPAPER V 11.0

Considering both the latest statistics on internet traffic average cost per GB (1.5
EUR/GB) and the average monthly internet consumption traffic per user (3 GBs), see
appendix references, Thrive’s Blockchain is going to reward up to 3GB equivalent of
anonymous data sharing per user/month.
Enough to entirely pay or highly contribute to consumers’ mobile internet
subscription.
All data will be treated fully anonymously in respect of all GDPR 2018 laws and
regulations. Once segmented and profiled, data will be permanently deleted.

d) The Anti-patronage advertising marketplace, reputation based.
More and more publishers are continuously investing in relevant and valuable
content. But unfortunately, they often get cut out of major adv. platforms due to
unclear policies regulated by a monopolistic market of few.
This phenomenon, together with humongous advertising fees applied by major
platforms, can be considered the main root cause failure of many newborn web
products, despite their real value.
Thrive is going to guarantee all publishers to:


Access the new marketplace with equal rights, with clear and transparent
rules for joiners.



Receive up to 3 detailed reports provided by Thrive on how to improve their
website's content and effectiveness per year.



Benefit from transparent and extremely low market place fee (10%).



Achieve up to 3% fee discount in exchange for anonymous visitor’s data.

Within Thrive’s ecosystem, it is in publishers’ interest to provide premium content
to remain in the ecosystem.
A reliable, transparent and sustainable reputation management mechanism will
minimize the risk of fraudulent behavior.
Publisher’s reputation is being regulated by two parallel mechanisms:


Reviewer’s reports as described above

9 | THRIVE WHITEPAPER V 11.0



Anti-fraud mechanism.
The algorithm will analyze Thrive’s Blockchain transactions parameters such
as the volume of confirmed/paid/not verified transactions to automatically
adjust the level of publisher credibility.

COMPETITORS & BLOCKCHAIN ADVANTAGES
The digital-advertising industry is growing strongly, with revenues increasing
sharply over recent years, leading to a consolidation of big players in the ad
exchange market like Google DoubleClick, AppNexus, Criteo, OpenX or AOL’s
Marketplace.
Recently, a few ICOs have been announced on this topic such as AdEx , Ad Shares,
Basic Attention Token, Papyrus and Bitclave.
While the dynamism of digital advertising world would not prevent any users from
simultaneously using several innovative new products, majority of legacy companies
will not have enough flexibility to suddenly dump fees from one day to another
without hugely impacting its current organizational structure. Thrive Labs is going
to disrupt the Ad industry becoming the cheapest Premium Ad Market ever.
Despite of none of the Blockchain products have yet reached a relevant product
maturity, it’s already possible to analyze the competitors’ pain points both on
technology and business model.
-AdEx. Initially based on Ethereum blockchain, announced recently a migration to
NEO.
AdEx is sorting out the limited # of transactions per second handling issue but not
the gas requirements one. In fact, continuous gas requirements may lead to Ad. price
rising.
NEO is a Chinese blockchain and as of today there is no assurance it will be blocked
by the great firewall anytime.
User’s profiling is based on forms filled up by users themselves and therefore is less
reliable than Thrive’s profiling which is based on behavioral data tracking.
How much of (or if) the users will get rewarded and how much Ad fees will be
applied is not clearly declared.
-Bitclave. It’s considered the anti-Google decentralized search engine. The project is
very solid on data collection point of view and data transparency, but the blockchain
usage for data storing purposes seems to have some limitations.

11 | T H R I V E W H I T E P A P E R V 1 1 . 0

The data storage itself may become too heavy to be handled by the blockchain.
BASE system, Bitclave is adopting, is meant to work currently on Ethereum.
Ethereum blockchain current # of transactions per second handling is far too low for
the purpose. It can be considered a show stopper for the project.
How much users will be rewarded according to the usage of personal data by the
advertisers is not clearly stated and Ad fees are also not declared.
-Papyrus. It’s the closest competitor in terms of positioning and leveraging of DMP
revenue stream. However, profiling seems is less effective than Thrive’s since data
collection is not systematic and there is no mention to behavioral patterns analysis.
This key point could potentially put at risk the success of the project. Papyrus is
running on Ethereum Blockchain claiming to use state channel technology to sort
out scalability issues. Since no state channel implementation has been done yet, the
whole assumptions on scalability remain a big question mark.
In terms of transparency, Ad fees and users’ reward details are also not declared.
-AdShares. Very interesting project from blockchain point of view since leveraging a
high performing platform able to handle 10k transaction per second and over 100k
transfer per second.
But apparently no profiling is in scope. Therefore, unlike Thrive, it cannot be
considered a premium service.
Once more, Ad fees and users’ reward details are not stated.
-BAT. It’s a very powerful network with many profiling possibilities, aimed to fight
against ad-blockers and banner-blindness issues.
Users will be rewarded according to the measurement of their “attention”. We feel
that this is very hard to forecast. This project is based on Ethereum blockchain.
Ethereum blockchain current # of transactions per second handling is far too low for
the purpose. It can be considered a show stopper.
Ad fees are not declared. It seems fees calculation will be done according to the
measurement of the attention as well.
-MAD Network. Analysis cannot be done at this stage. The whitepaper shows a
complex and vague business flow that is not backed up by any detail. No information

12 | T H R I V E W H I T E P A P E R V 1 1 . 0

about Blockchain technology used for the project (in the competitor analysis chart is
assumed to run on Ethereum blockchain).
Thrive Labs project is going beyond the decentralized Ad Market Place concept, since
building and integrating an active community around it, with clear and transparent
engagement rules.
Thrive is a company based on Blockchain and smart contracts with all competitive
advantages this technology brings in, ensuring full transparency, 100% data security
and safety.
Thrive Tech team duly analyzed major blockchains available on the markets
considering all the threats stated above in terms of # of transactions handling,
speed, gas requirement and data storage capability. After this analysis has decided to
move on building his own proprietary blockchain tailored made on marketing needs.
Ethereum blockchain will be used only for crowdsale purposes. A token swap will be
provided once Thrive proprietary Blockchain is deployed.
Heavily reducing the cost of advertising (cutting off most of the profit for
middlemen) will make advertisers and publishers eager to switch to Blockchain
platforms.
To fully differentiate from competition, still leveraging all Blockchain competitive
advantages stated above, Thrive conducted extensive market research and launched
private surveys to clearly understand if its value proposition was both fully in line
with industry needs and self-sustainable from a financial point of view.

How many ICO projects have a sound business plan behind?
- The Thrive team is backed up by a solid business plan, based on months of surveys
and market research.
- The Thrive team is working in the industry since years as part of an existing and
profitable company.
- The Thrive team understands technology, and therefore spending time selecting
the best scalable blockchain solution to fully support and deliver the project.
- The Thrive team is the only project declaring AD FEES applied and

USERS/WEBSITES REWARDS in a transparent and clear way to its community.
- The Thrive team has a clear strategy to ramp-up its platform before opening the
market place and becoming profitable.

CASE STUDY
a) CASE 1 - ADVERTISERS
ARE YOU IN CONTROL OF ADVERTISEMENT PLACEMENT?
IS YOUR BRAND REPUTATION RISKLESS?
Today this is not always the case.
7 months ago, major brands including Verizon and Walmart pulled their ads after
they were found to be appearing next to videos promoting extremist views or hate
speech. Both, the telecom companies AT&T and Verizon, as well as the
pharmaceutical company GSK, Pepsi, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson and the car rental
firm Enterprise, have all pulled advertising from Google’s video-sharing platform.
“Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from
Google’s non-search platforms” an AT&T spokesman said in a statement.
“So, when there’s a problem with advertising like this, it’s a big problem,”
Krasodomski-Jones said (researcher at the thinktank Demos).
The row highlights an uncomfortable fact about advertising in the digital age: most
brands don’t know exactly where their online advertising is running. Black box
machines are now largely responsible for the placement of ads online.…when an ad
appears alongside a piece of content, it’s not always clear whether it’s been shown
based on a person’s previous browsing behavior, interests, or demographic data or
because the brand is affiliated with a particular content creator*.

Thrive Labs Platform goal is to deeply decrease the risk of brand reputation damages
by providing premium placements reviewed by its community.

b) CASE 2 - PUBLISHERS
FED UP OF RUNNING YOUR SITE EXACTLY THE WAY GOOGLE WANTS AND PAYING
CRAZY FEES?
DEVELOPED A GOOD CONTENT BUT SUDDENLY BANNED BY ADSENSE FOR UNCLER
REASONS?

“Idris Sami is a 19-year-old French-Moroccan entrepreneur who set up a website
that lets people text their friends for free.
MesTextos isn't going to threaten WhatsApp anytime soon, but in Europe and the
Middle East, where alternative messaging services are more popular, free texting is a
nice little niche to occupy.
Sami was running Google's AdSense advertising system on his site. It allows website
publishers to display search ads powered by Google and take a cut of the revenue
(estimated between 32% and 49%).
By December 2013 so many people were clicking on MesTextos' ads that Sami's
Google account hit $46,000.
But then he learned that if you're an AdSense partner and you don't run ads on your
site exactly the way Google wants, the search giant will punish you. Sami was
banned from Google's ad programs until further notice and without any detailed
explanation. He lost his $46,000.
Although this is an extreme example it does typify one of the frustrations Google's
clients have dealing with opaque and complicated rules**.

Thrive Labs Platform content judgment is regulated by its community with
transparent and simple rules. With fees from 4.5 to 7 times lower than existing ones.

16 | T H R I V E W H I T E P A P E R V 1 1 . 0

c) CASE 3 - USERS
ARE YOU IN CONTROL OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
ARE YOUR DATA SECURED?
ARE YOU GETTING REWARDED FOR UNCONSCIUOSLY SHARING THEM?

Absolutely not.
Recently Facebook has been fined 1.2 million euros ($1.4 million) for allegedly
collecting personal information from users in Spain that could then be used for
advertising. The fine stemmed from an investigation into the social network
company conducted alongside similar probes in Belgium, France, Germany and the
Netherlands, the AEPD authority said. AEPD said it found three cases in which
Facebook had collected details such as the gender, religious beliefs, personal tastes
and browsing history of its millions of Spanish users without informing them how
such information would be used.
According to the AEPD, the tech giant did not sufficiently inform users about how it
would use data collected on third-party websites, and did not obtain consent to use
it.
Facebook’s privacy policy contains generic and unclear terms, the authority said in a
statement.
The social network uses specifically protected data for advertising, among other
purposes, without obtaining users’ express consent as data protection law demands,
a serious infringement.
It said it also found evidence the network kept information for more than 17 months
after users closed their accounts”***.

In Thrive Labs Platform, everyone will be fully aware of anonymous data sharing,
because users voluntarily decide to do it and get rewarded for it. Thrive Labs is
utilizing Blockchain technology, which is the most secure place from malicious
attacks.

17 | T H R I V E W H I T E P A P E R V 1 1 . 0

Only data anonymized, profiled and segmented are stored in the Blockchain to limit
the data storage size. The original data provided by the user is destroyed after this
operation.
A networks of independent entities and complex cryptographies for communication
prevent the possibility of falsifying data on transactions that are public by nature
and completely open to users, this is what makes Blockchain into the best
framework for data security.

18 | T H R I V E W H I T E P A P E R V 1 1 . 0

COMPANY STRATEGY
Thrive is initially targeting publisher websites with at least 65K yearly views and 3
banners spaces available for ad placement, targeted to increase over time towards a
portfolio of websites with an average of 100K annual views. This positioning is
justified by the concept of building a market with powerful network effect that
benefits all. Its value to its clients lies in measurable performance, sales, and profits
delivered at a very large scale.
As of September 2017, the number of existing online websites counts 1.2 billion
unique hostnames. Considering a 75% discount factor for non-active websites due to
parked domains it reduces to an applicable base count of 300 million active websites.
As per Thrive market positioning explained above, our extended research highlighted
that websites having more than 100K yearly visits, represent 40% of the overall
internet market.
This boils down to a baseline for market penetration which will be roughly 120
Million sites.

a) Ramp-up phase
Analyzing the current Digital Advertising landscape, mainly dominated by Google
and Facebook with over 60% market shares, the average market penetration for
entering high potential digital marketing emerging companies is between 0.01% and
0.02% in within the first years (see reference in appendix).
Thrive targeted this threshold to be reached during the ramp-up phase.
To achieve this target, the token reserve (refer to token allocation page) will be
entirely re-distributed to Thrive’s community before officially opening the Ad
Market place. The reserve will be fully utilized for rewarding interactions and data
gathering within the platform’s ecosystem (See chart below)

19 | T H R I V E W H I T E P A P E R V 1 1 . 0

The ramp-up phase will ensure the platform reaches the critical mass needed for a
smooth start:


260K websites subscriptions.



Website data points coming from 16 billion page-views (up to 0.44€ per CPM
token equivalents reward).



Consumer data points equivalents to 10000 TB (1.5€ per GB token
equivalents).



Fully tested features by industry insiders.

77% see a DMP solution as a critical/major player in expanding the performance of
long-term AD and Marketing strategy.

Globally, 79% of agency-side media buying professionals use DMP technology. This
figure can be viewed as very strong, especially given that research we conducted in

23 | T H R I V E W H I T E P A P E R V 1 1 . 0

July 2015 showed 53% of media buyers had a DMP solution in place – representing
an increase of 26% in just two years. This is symptomatic of agencies’ desire to
increase their competitive edge.
Globally, DMPs are primarily used by agencies for audience targeting (62%),
audience insights and analytics (53%), and data unification (33%).

Looking at Industry verticals, overall 41% already use a DMP and 39% are planning
to implement one within the next 12 months.

However, DMP adoption is no longer enough for agencies to achieve differentiation,
with such a high percentage of competitors having very similar technology.
Therefore Thrive Labs is aiming to deeply change the paradigm on how DMP works
today.
Currently DMPs available on the markets collect data about customers directly from
digital advertisements, websites and mobile applications.

Most of the time these touch points represent only the last click of the customer’s
journey.
Thanks to Thrive’s DMP, for the first time, Advertisers will experience first DMP
fully leveraging customer data collected along the whole customer journey.

THRIVE LABS BLOCKCHAIN
Blockchain is a communication protocol that identifies a technology based on
distributed database logic (a database in which data is not stored on a single
computer but on multiple machines connected to one another, called nodes).
Blockchain is a database made of blocks that store valid transaction blocks correlated
by a timestamp. Each block includes the hash (a non-invertible algorithmic function
that maps an arbitrary length string to a predefined length string) of the previous
block, linking the blocks together. The linked blocks form a chain, with each
additional block that reinforces the previous ones.
Blockchain is also a public and shared registry consisting of a number of clients.
Blockchain is organized to automatically update to each of the clients participating
in the network. Every operation performed must be automatically confirmed by all
nodes through encryption software that verifies a private key or seed data package
that is used to sign transactions. By guaranteeing the digital identity of those who
have authorized you.
Thrive Labs Blockchain will be ruled and its transaction will be validated by Proofof-Stake, instead the traditional Proof-of-Work system.
Proof-of-Stake is an innovative way to validate transactions and achieve the
distributed consensus. The first digital currency to use this method was Peercoin in
2012, together with ShadowCash, Nxt, BlackCoin, NuShares/NuBits, Qora and Nav
Coin. Unlike the Proof-of-Work, where the algorithm rewards miners who solve
mathematical problems with the goal of validating transactions and creating new
blocks, with the proof-of-stake the creator of a new block is chosen in a
deterministic way depending on its wealth, also defined as stake.
Since the digital currency is entirely created in the beginning and kept constant, in
the Proof-of-Stake system there is no block reward. Therefore, the miners are
rewarded by the transaction fee. Thanks to a Proof-of-Stake system, validators do

27 | T H R I V E W H I T E P A P E R V 1 1 . 0

not have to use their computing power. The only factors that influence their chances
are both the total number of coins owned and current complexity of the network.

a) Key features of the Blockchain:
Reliability: by giving all the direct participants a control over the entire chain,
Blockchain becomes a less centralized, less alterable, and at the same time a safer
and more reliable system (e.g. malicious attacks).
If only one of the chain nodes undergoes an attack and gets damaged, all the other
distributed database nodes will still be active and operative, welding the chain and
not losing important information.
Transparency: Blockchain transactions are visible to all participants, thus ensuring
transparency in operations.
Solidity: The information already stored in the Blockchain cannot be changed in any
way. In this way, the information contained in the Blockchain is solid and reliable.
Irrevocability: With the Blockchain all transactions are irrevocable and at the same
time more easily traceable. This ensures that the transactions are definitive, without
any possibility of being modified or canceled.
b) The software packages
Thrive Labs software packages basically are of two types: The data mining software
package and the client software package.
The data mining software package is needed to collect and send data either to the
Blockchain for rewarding activities and to AI module for the processing stage. It is a
combination of the three components described below.
a) The JavaScript file: this fulfills the dual task of counting publisher’s visitor’s
views for reward attribution and collecting data to be sent to Thrive Labs AI engine.
The JavaScript file will contain a "lite" version of the Blockchain, in order not to
heavily affect the host's memory capacity of the site itself.

28 | T H R I V E W H I T E P A P E R V 1 1 . 0

The JavaScript file will not contain the ledger as a "full" client, but will use the
"full" client network to draw and store data into the ledger.
The JavaScript file is built to prevent the use of bots and any other type of fraudulent
way to alter data. An algorithm created by Thrive Labs has been tested to detect any
fraudulent activity.
b) The browser extension: available for major browsers, is enabling consumers to be
rewarded while navigating (1.5 EUR/GB equivalent).
A wallet balance will be displayed in the GUI.
c) The mobile browser: in order to track user’s behavior on mobile devices (iOS,
Android) Thrive Labs is developing a mobile browser based on Chromium mobile
project. Once installed the browser will anonymously keep track of the user behavior,
temporally store them on client-side storage and then send to Thrive Labs with
asynchronous calls in JavaScript (Ajax, RPC).
The client software package is the core of Thrive Labs Blockchain.
To be installed by reviewers consists of three different components such as a wallet,
a ledger and the site review form handling engine. The client is a typical Blockchain
node, the wallet has a coded address that identifies the node itself and the ledger
contains transactions data.
The reviewer GUI is used to manage the forms and to provide another type of
statistics that are useful to reviewers, such as the number of sites to review, mining
difficulty and Thrive platform KPIs.
All components of the client are coded using python (or GO language) script
language plus a framework for the Graphic User Interface.

31 | T H R I V E W H I T E P A P E R V 1 1 . 0

The participants’ personal information and identity proofs are then computed and
compared to a legal database.
USA and China residents or citizens are not allowed to participate to Thrive TGE.
All tokens will be generated and distributed only once the KYC/AML is completed and
the TGE is over. Minimum amount to claim tokens is 1000 THRT.

will be distributed and exchanged 1:1 with TRHT Tokens.
Thrive’s Coins are native to Thrive, it is the only currency used in the marketplace.
THRT Tokens do not represent company shares or give rights to revenue sharing.
From token economics point of view, the Thrive Coin is a utility token therefore
there is not any guarantee of future value of the THRT token.
