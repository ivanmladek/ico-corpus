ABSTRACT
Today, shipping industry accounts of
around 90% of the value of the World
Trade. Shipping is the life blood of
the global economy. Without shipping, intercontinental trade, the bulk
transport of raw materials, and the
import/export of affordable food and
manufactured goods would simply
not be possible. This hugely valuable
industry has been troubled for years
by challenges like overcapacity,
highly variable freight rates, security
threats and increasing regulations.
On the other hand, local producers,
charterers and shippers, especially
the ones operating from developing
countries, are facing several problems when it comes to shipping, like
the high number of intermediaries,
the expensive freight rates, the lack
of transparency, the limited number
of sea lines, and the difficulties in
shipping small cargo.
It’s a well-known fact in the industry
that global shipping has to increase
efficiency, improve processes and
perform a fundamental digital transformation, to ensure future profitability for the ship owners, and to
provide more opportunities for the
4

charterers and producers all over
the world.
To solve the industry critical problems, we are creating BitNautic, a
distributed platform, based on the
Ethereum Blockchain, for matching
demand and supply of shipping services, for all the industry stakeholders: producers of goods, ship owners, charterers, brokers, importers
and exporters.
In our vision BitNautic contribution
to the digitalization and decentralization of the shipping industry, will
contribute to the growth of developing countries, in an open market and
free trade, increasing international
trade and cooperation, public-private partnerships within the industry, knowledge sharing, and bridging
the gap between government regulators and the shipping industry.
BitNautic has started his operations
with a focus on the emerging countries of the Africa continent.
BitNautic development and expansion will be funded with the Crowdsale of the BitNautic Token BTNT,
used to access the BitNautic platform.

Shipping
and the World Trade
The shipping industry is the backbone of globalization and international trade.
Seaborne transportation plays a major role in the world’s industries and
society, enabling the transport of
large volumes of raw and processed
material, as well as food, water and
technological products.

Ships are technically sophisticated,
high value assets and the operation
of merchant ships generates an estimated annual income of over half
a trillion U.S. Dollars in freight rates.

Shipping
and the World Trade
Today, still experiencing a slightly
slower growth rate compared to the
longer-term historical average, global waterborne trade is forecasted to
double in 2035.
Continued population growth in Africa, Asia and South America and
rising urbanization will be one of the
strongest drivers of the growing demand for waterborne services during
the coming decade.

6

Growing cross border e-commerce
and the fourth industrial revolution
(Industry 4.0), will also have the potential to sustain the growth and
further reshape maritime trade patterns.
But to sustain that growth, and, on
the same time, ensure future profitability for the ship owners and easy
access to shipping services for charters and producers in developing
counties, the global shipping industry have to increase efficiency, improve processes and perform a fundamental digital transformation.

Challenges Facing the
Shipping Industry
Most of the world’s manufactured
goods and products are transported
by container ships, but the industry
is facing a tough and unpredictable
future.
Overcapacity, trust issues and outdated systems plagued by human
errors, missing and inaccurate documents and even substandard goods
have a fundamental impact on the
industry’s prospects. These challenges, along with higher demands
from society for transparency, accountability, and responsibility in the
logistics chain, drives the industry
towards exploring new solutions.

increased costs or wrong deliveries.
Moreover, a hazard striking to shipment is thievery, which is not only
armed robbery but the latest security threat to the maritime industry
comes from hackers.
As far as it goes back, the whole shipping community has never been on
the same platform for the issues related to payments and transactions.
Lack of information prevails among
importers and exporters regarding
the type and cost of ships and transport fees. The challenges facing the
shipping industry are many, the major ones listed below.

Shipping industry is facing high administrative burdens of managing
and writing claims with a lot of paperwork requiring signatures multiple times. Despite all this stress, a
small service disruption or insufficient capacity anywhere in the network could result in shipment delays,
7

Challenges for Carriers
Security threats
The high number of incidents of piracy and armed robbery against
ships off the Somalia coast and in
the Gulf of Aden is something that
the whole world is aware of, and is
a growing concern for the maritime
industry that is heavily affected by
these incidents. Though the acts of
piracy have been controlled to some
extent, ship owners still use private
armed security guards on their vessels while commuting the dangerous
pirate zones in West Africa.
Not only armed robbery, the latest security threat to the maritime
industry comes from hackers. Automated and technologically advanced ships have become vulnerable to cyber-attacks with hackers
being successful in accessing the
GPS, AIS – marine Automatic Identification System, and ECDIS – Electronic Chart Display and Information
System (a system for viewing digital
nautical charts).

Environmental Regulations
Maritime transport emits around
1000m tons of CO2 annually and is
responsible for about 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. These
emissions are predicted to increase
up to 250% by 2050 in absence of
installation of newer energy-saving
technologies. There is a growing concern over the impact of global shipping activities on the environment
8

– greenhouse effect and danger to
aquatic life.
The industry is working towards finalizing the framework for the monitoring, reporting, and verification of
CO2 emissions from maritime transport. However, in the absence of universally approved regulations and
fully reliable technologies, there is
uncertainty in the industry.

Overcapacity
The latest report from UNCTAD (The
Review of Maritime Transport 2017)
say that the seaborne trade grew by
2.6 per cent in 2016, reaching 10.3
billion tons.
Although this was a welcome improvement to the 2.1 per cent growth
recorded in 2015, the boost in demand was offset by a 3.2 per cent
increase in the industry’s carrying
capacity, which reached 1.86 billion
dead-weight tons earlier this year.
A supply-demand imbalance continued therefore to weigh down
industry profits, with the container shipping market, the largest in
terms of value, reporting a collective operating loss of US$3.5 billion.

But as world seaborne trade continues to gather steam - forecasts
show a compound annual growth
rate of 3.2 per cent between 2017
and 2022 - the situation could improve relatively soon if the industry
could shed its excess weight.

This could be done, the report says,
by building fewer ships, by scrapping more, or by increasing “capacity sharing” - essentially the pooling
of cargo among carriers to improve
economies of scale and reduce operating costs.

Lack of
Transparency

Labor Disputes
and Job Cuts

Bad tracking is caused by equally harmful gaps in transparency.
While tracking issues are systemic
and inherent to the task of moving
goods, the failures of transparency
are largely due to bad data handling
practices (or worse, due to parties
being incentivized not to share accurate data).
Often, due to fragmentation, uncertainty, or to protect the exclusivity
of their arrangements, brokers can’t
or won’t tell a shipper exactly what
carrier and driver are carrying their
freight.

Who can forget the month-long West
Coast dockworkers slowdown, which
brought shipping industry business to
a standstill in February 2015? Or, another incident in Dec 2015 when the
Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) held
the ship of global mining giant Alcoa,
hostage for two months, disrupting
the operations of the port of Portland?
Repeatedly, labor disputes and strikes
have disrupted the shipping industry
and created huge gaps in profitability and product rollouts. The shipping
rates increase, and the supply chain
becomes more overloaded.

Challenges for Shippers
Finding the best
options

Preparation and
documentation

Cargo can be moved from point to
point in a number of different ways.
While it’s convenient to have options,
many shippers are overwhelmed or
simply unaware of the many different choices they have. Understanding the shipping landscape could
save time and money at the end of
the day.

Shippers sometime aren’t prepared
to take on the process. From filling
out the bill of lading to identifying
freight classes, one misstep can result in surcharges, delays, or customs
holds when shipping internationally.
Shippers must be sure to prepare
ahead of time with the necessary
knowledge to get the job done.

Finding the best
rates

Shipping demand
exceeds forecast

Looking for the best freight shipping
rates can be time-consuming when
not equipped with the right tools or
processes. Most of the times, shippers have contracts in place (hindering flexibility) or have to make
multiple phone calls just to find the
best rate for one shipment. Having a
transportation management system
in place could provide a solution to
this problem.

Exporters and Importers often find
themselves short on containers or
bulk shipping capacity when they
need them most. This leads to delays, additional costs, potential penalties and strained relations with
clients as well as partners. In addition, shippers of time-definite or
sequenced cargo flows risk delays,
performance penalties, and lost
business when they can’t deliver on
time, compelling some to resort to
air freight or other alternatives in
order to prevent penalties but the
cost often outweighs the penalties.
In general, finding the right balance
between annual service contracts
and the spot market is difficult and
comes with financial impacts.

INTRODUCING
BITNAUTIC

Global
Ship Owners, all over the world, can
list their Ships and update the positions. Cargo Owners, in a similar way,
can list their cargos, with detailed
requirements. All users are able to
follow the actual conditions of the
world freight market, with real-time
positions at any port of the world.

From the experience of our founders,
confirmed by surveys and reports,
we know the significant challenges
faced by the maritime industry.
BitNautic address those challenges with an open decentralized platform that will enable all stakeholders, such as importers, exporters,
shippers, ship owners, carriers and
agents to come on the same page
and negotiate their own terms,
therefore, avoiding the long chains
that arise due to multiple parties’
involvement. All of this will happen
with the security and the transparency of blockchain.

Reliable
Shippers and Carriers benefit from
a Reliable booking system based on
effective digital contracts, backed
by the Blockchain. Users execute a
contract then, and there that locks
in space, equipment and rate up to
6 months in advance. Carriers’ offers
are all-in, and the rates are fixed.
Shippers never have any surprise accessorial and their rate never change.
Invoices always match the contracts
with 100% accuracy.

Shipping, the way
it should be

Secure
Contact information, ship name, and
private data about assets are only
available to the respective owners.
BitNautic users decides when and
with whom to share valuable information.
11

Easy to Use
Shippers just enter cargo origin and
destination, ship dates and equipment type, then instantly receive
binding offers directly from carriers
along with service performance and
all the details they need to make
an informed decision. Ship Owners just enter the Ship location and
date, then instantly receive leads on
matching cargos.

Transparent
Public data representing the asset and contracts are stored in the
blockchain, accessible and auditable to all the parties, provided they
have the required privileges. History
of negotiations on each contract are
always available on the Blockchain
and easy exportable. This helps to
avoid mistakes and guarantees the
honesty between the parties.

Intelligent
To find best fit for cargo and ships
and to optimize the use of naval assets, BitNautic is developing an advanced AI engine designed for the
shipping industry. The AI optimization will help shippers and ship owners to do a better use of the shipping
resources, reducing the costs, by optimizing cargo pooling, and sharing
of shipping capacity.

Multi-Currency

Inexpensive

fee, paid by Ship Owners/Carriers, to
make the connection and manage
the contract execution.
12

To hold equipment and space on a
vessel, Shippers submit a nominal
deposit that gets credited toward
their balance which is due before
cargo is loaded. Any freight, chartering, sale and other services can be
paid with cryptocurrency or BitNautic Tokens (BTNT).

15

Shippers and Ship Owners (Carriers)
will be able to list specific opportunities for shipping consolidation. They
will provide the place of loading, the
place of discharge, and the details of
the availability, in terms of container free space or ship hold free space
(for Bulk shipping).

Wholesale E-Commerce Tracking system
BitNautic offers to his users the possibility to advertise and trade wholesale goods.
Producers will have the opportunity
to list directly sell their products, in
association with their specific place
of loading. Thus, cutting out several
middlemen, increasing his revenues
and offering business opportunities
to international traders.
On the Wholesale E-Commerce platform, users come together and have
trade deals, negotiating their own
terms. The payment system is based
on cryptocurrencies, is fast, easy, and
secured by escrow service.

Escrow Services
BitNautic, offers a specific Escrow
service. When Buyer initializes an escrow transaction, his BTNT tokens
are locked in the smart contract.
Once Buyer confirms the Seller’s obligations are fulfilled, he can release
funds to Seller. BitNautic, acting as
Escrow Agent, oversees the transaction. If a dispute occurs, the Escrow
Agent can intervene and refund the
Buyer, or release funds to the Seller.

BitNautic will provide a state of the
art ship and cargo tracking system

include:

Ship Tracking
This feature is specifically designed
for ship owners and customers for
booking cargo. A customer would be
able to see the status and position of
his ships in real time. Moreover, the
mobile application would allow ship
owners, specific details regarding the
status of the ships including a total number of containers and cargo
type. BitNautic would use the tracking system to transport goods quickly and efficiently by keeping track of
every ship.

Cargo Tracking
The same tracking functionality
would be extended to cargo owners
as well to see their cargo location in
real time. This feature can solve crucial issues of lost cargos, delays in
delivery and would increase customer ease and trust.

BitNautic
Architecture
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and immutable database
with potential to revolutionize
the way various records are being
stored. Blockchain is a perfect solution for pet records storage, as the
key features would enable transparent, immutable and trusted real-time data source.
Functionality, features and huge
community of developers around
the Ethereum blockchain suggests
it as the most suitable option for
BitNautic. Ethereum introduced
new opportunities that Bitcoin and
like Bitcoin protocol blockchains do
not have. Ethereum enables code
execution in a decentralized way.
This means that utilizing blockchain
technology it is possible to do more
than just exchange or store value. It
is also possible to implement rules,

according to which that value can
be moved, and specific data modified.
Ethereum users do not need to
trust any central server and can
simply trust blockchain consensus
algorithm and output of the system.
Smart Contract is a piece of code
which is stored on the blockchain
network (in each full node’s database on the network). It defines the
conditions on which all parties using
the contract agrees and certain actions described in the contract can
be executed if required conditions
met. As the smart contract is stored
on every computer in the network
they all must execute it and get to
the same result. This way users can
be sure that the outcome is correct.

18

Central server and authority can be
removed or its impact (e.g. single
point of failure) minimized with the
help of smart contracts.
As for shipping industry, blockchain
holds the promise of transparency
and efficiency for global trade.
To transport a container by sea
from Mombasa, Kenya to the Port
of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, requires
around 200 different communications steps involving around thirty
different interested parties. These
crucial steps take time and moreover, such a system is prone to frauds
or accidental miscommunications.
Fraud protection arises since no single party has the ability to modify,
delete or append any record without the consent from others within
the network.

BitNautic Token (BTNT)
Utility of Token

Technology
The BTNT Token, an ERC20 token,
will be issued to create a decentralized shipping and cargo platform
built on top of Ethereum blockchain and wholesale e-commerce
platform based on the Ethereum
blockchain and smart contracts for
trading goods and services.
The ERC20 protocol is based on
Ethereum, a technical and market
standard, which defines an interface for smart contracts that need
to execute token emission.
The most crucial technical component of BTNT Tokens is the Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contract,
which regulates token distribution,
transactions, and rewards securely

and transparently.
Using dedicated token (BTNT) to facilitate transactions in the BitNautic
(BTNT) Ecosystem provides many
advantages, including:
•it can be used across any number
of jurisdictions, retaining a single
uniform method of settlement;
•using a blockchain based token
makes it possible to perform settlements automatically and irrefutably within smart contracts;
•it makes it possible to manage incentives in a way that drives Ecosystem effects for the benefit of all
participants in the BitNautic (BTNT)
Ecosystem.

Token Type
BTNT is a hybrid token, having the
nature of utility, as well as the nature of payment token. BTNT is the
final token that will be used with-

in the BitNautic ecosystem (Cargo
Booking, Brokerage System, Tracking System, Wholesale E-commerce
platform).

BTNT is designed to facilitate efficient transactions of a wide range
of services on BitNautic platform,
whilst also operating as a medium
of exchange and a store of value
that could become more valuable in
line with the growth of users and increasing use of the platform.

Best Practices
for Participating in
an ICO/Token
Generation Event
Make sure you avoid mirror site
scams by trusting only the https://
bitnautic.io domain. The best practice to avoid mirror site scams is to
manually type the https://bitnautic.
io domain into your browser, then
bookmark the page for when you
want to come back to the site on the
day of the token sale. This helps you
avoid clicking on lookalike links that
may send you to malicious phishing
websites.
•Only send ETH to the wallet address
listed on the bitnautic.io website.
•Never send ETH from an exchange,
only from an ether wallet such as
the following:

Contributors can participate to the - Ethereum Wallet (from the Ethereum Project – thereum.org)
BitNautic ICO, using the following
- MetaMask (Chrome browser addchannels:
on); or
•Direct registration at the BitNautic - MyEtherWallet (in-browser version
available, download recommended)
ICO website (www.bitnautic.io)
•Registration at BitNautic ICO
Partners:
Citowise Wallet
(https://citowise.com)

•For extra security, double check that
you have the correct smart contract
wallet address before you send ETH
by using a tool like EtherAddressLookup.
