1. Executive Summary
Today’s evolving blockchain technology allows companies to run marketplaces (B2C or B2B) for
faster and cheaper than ever.
But there are still problems with the current atmosphere.
For one, the speed and cost by which online marketplaces are developed and run can be improved.
Secondly, at this moment in time, escrow payments are still very expensive and far from accepting
crypto-currencies as payments.
Lastly, the review process for online marketplaces contains several major flaws that must be
addressed before marketplaces can be truly decentralized.
Origami Network is an all-in-one decentralized protocol that solves several existing problems
related to online marketplace development and maintenance, escrow payments, and reviews.
The Origami Network has a working product and several customers already on board benefitting
from its technology. The Origami Network is based on three self-sufficient platforms:
o Origami Marketplace
o Origami Payment, and
o Origami Review.
These ​complementary platforms can be used in a modularized fashion or together.
The Origami Network is the only B​lockchain-Powered protocol that builds decentralized online
marketplaces faster and easier than current models allow, while also utilizing blockchain-based
escrow payments and improving review systems. The result is faster, easier, cheaper, and more
reliable marketplace experiences for both consumer and business owner.
Decentralized marketplaces allow to redistribute value to the people who actually contribute the
most value in the network.

2. Summary
The Origami Network protocol is a p
​ rotocol​ for b
​ uilding decentralized marketplace.
The main idea of this protocol is to give to our clients (eg : companies that want to launch their
online marketplaces or sharing economy platforms, major accounts who want to build their online
marketplaces) the ability to build their online marketplace easily and get the benefits and power of
the decentralization through the Ethereum Blockchain.

2.1. Problems the Origami network solves
The main problems targeted by Origami Network are:
-

Fees on the centralized escrow payment systems are usually high, and cut the margin of
the marketplace operators. O
​ rigami Network will reduce these fees, thanks to the ORI
tokens. M
​ ore informations on fees can be found o
​ n chapter "Reduced Fees"​.

-

Customer reviews are a huge problem in the online marketplace industry. We need to give
back the power to the customers and sellers through a ​more secure and trustworthy review
system​. Decentralization will make this possible through: A
​ n unbiased system in which
fake reviews are impossible and moderation transparent.

-

Shipping is also a big issue in the online marketplace industry. We will secure the shipping
tracking retrieval through Oracles to avoid these issues. For example returned or not sent
packages will trigger an automatic refund to the customer.

-

Payment disputes : as on server-centric payment, sometimes there are problems with
refunds, or payments. With the Ethereum blockchain we are resolving those issues.

2.2. What is the blockchain marketplace
Blockchain Marketplace is a decentralized peer-to-peer network that directly connect consumers
and sellers without any intermediaries.

BLOCKCHAIN-BASED MARKETPLACE

TRADITIONAL MARKETPLACE

Origami Network

Traditional Platforms

Origami Marketplace + Origami Payment + Origami
Review

Amazon or Airbnb

Network Model Decentralized. Supported by
users

Owned and regulated by a third party

Direct payment by cryptocurrencies with
Origami Payment and offer low fees

Personal information is required and can be
hacked and stolen

Payments are instant and don’t require any
intermediary.

Traditional marketplaces lack transparency

Validation by network prevents security
problems.

Payments go through third-party financial
services with high fees

Personal information isn’t required

Charges a percentage of every transaction
(example Amazon ~15%)
Must comply with terms set by the third party

Smart contract are unbreakable and executed
automatically
Origami Reviews will decentralize reviews
management and improve the reputation
management system of sellers on any
marketplaces.

Manipulate reviews, post fake reviews, delete
negative reviews, or post negative reviews on
their competitors’ pages.

6

2.3. Why Ethereum
We have chosen the Ethereum blockchain because of those different benefits :
1. ERC20 token standard that can be easily used on wallets and exchanges.
2. We know that scalability as it is a major issue of the Ethereum blockchain at the moment,
will be enhanced regarding the technical roadmap of Ethereum chain.
3. We can connect to decentralized oracles on Ethereum to get informations from real world
APIs (such as carriers…). We have many more use cases to develop on this particular point.

2.4. About our company
2.4.1. A team with experience
Our three co-founders are entrepreneurs since 2012 and worked during 5 years in the trading and
financial area (Customers: NYSE, NASDAQ, Euronext…)

2.4.2. Backed by two French banks
We are backed since January 2017 by two french banks, CIC (sixth biggest French bank) and BPI
France (An investment bank).

2.4.3. Proven Track Record
Already have several customers. Our greatest advantage is that we have existing customers that
will quickly join our platform.

2.4.4. Huge potential
Sales on online marketplaces cross $1 trillion in 2016 yet they still have to solve a lot of problem
inherent to centralized marketplaces 1.

3. Use Cases
In this part we will present to you several use cases of Origami Network.

3.1. Online Payments
Origami Payment is a decentralized payment system powered by the Ethereum blockchain with
decentralized escrow for secure payments.
Using the power of the E
​ thereum smart contracts​ technology, escrow payment management is
automatized, and no third-party is needed to control the flow of money. The result is lower fees
than any other escrow system (cf 4
​ .2.6.1. Reduced fees​).

8

3.2. Decentralized reviews
User reviews have a dramatic impact on the level of trust on marketplaces.
This is a ​major challenge of marketplaces as they scale​ akin to the 5-star problem Uber drivers
encounter—skewing results until they are unreliable as metrics of actual service or product.
(​source​)2
Origami Review will solve this major problem with a blockchain-powered review system.
Every review is authenticated, and solely users who have conducted a prior transaction can post
reviews. They do this by signing with their own private key before posting their review.
Also, a review can be posted only when the order is delivered (information from Oracles).

9

3.3. Secure shipping management
Origami Review will check the shipment tracking code on the carrier of the order APIs using
Oracles (for example Chainlink).
Oracles easily connects the Origami Review smart contracts and critical external data from
carriers.

4. Origami Network Protocol Modules
4.1. Origami Marketplace
4.1.1. Overview
4.1.1.1. Summary
Origami Marketplace is the easiest all-in-one way to create a beautiful online marketplace.
Our solution is based on​ 4 modules​:
● The core API: RESTFUL API
● Front-office: Open-source
● An administration portal for sellers
● An administration portal for operators

11

4.1.1.2. Actors
Operators:​ They are the people from our clients’ team. They manage several aspects of their
online marketplace. Even if the reviews and the payments are decentralized, at the beginning of
the life of an online marketplace, operators need to recruit sellers that will sell on their
marketplace. They need to work on the marketing and advertising of their marketplace. Operators
are an important part of the launching of an online marketplace.
Sellers: ​They are the companies/individuals that will sell on the online marketplace.
Customers: ​The users that will use and buy (goods or services) on the online marketplaces.
The blockchain technology will eliminate any intermediaries in the management of trusted
reviews and escrow payments.

4.2. Origami Payment
4.2.1. Summary
Origami Payment is a decentralized ​payment ​system powered by the Ethereum blockchain and
​ORI, ​an ERC20 ​token. This payment system ​ ​enhances ​the ​buying/selling ​process ​with
​decentralized ​escrow ​for ​secure ​payments, ​third-party ​dispute ​resolution, ​and very ​low ​transaction
​costs.
Origami Payment can ​be ​integrated ​into ​new ​or ​existing ​marketplaces ​and ​can ​also ​be ​used ​in
​marketplaces that ​don't ​directly ​handle ​payments ​yet. Origami Payment is ​designed ​specifically
​for P2P ​marketplace ​transactions ​where ​trust ​between the ​buyer ​and ​seller ​might ​be ​limited.
This payment solution helps online marketplaces businesses to add a decentralized payment with
escrow on the blockchain. We will give to our customers an escrow payment service with very low
fees compared to other classic systems without blockchain and smart contracts.
Using the power of the E
​ thereum smart contracts​ technology, escrow payment management is
automatized, and no third-party is needed to control the flow of money. The result is lower fees
than any other escrow system.
Our payment solution provides an easy-to-use app and a secure and easy to integrate API.
Crypto currencies are the future and it is our belief that users might often choose to pay with a
crypto currency instead of the fiat. Origami payment will accept Origami tokens, Ethereum and
Bitcoin (ORI, ETH, BTC), and eventually other cryptocurrencies, as well.

21

4.2.2. Why Ethereum smart contracts ?
You can refer to ​2.3. Why Ethereum​ .

4.2.3. Presentation of the payment workflow

4.2.4. Origami Payment API
Our API covers the operational cycle needed for an online marketplace, including
●

Payin and Payout transactions and wallet statements.

●

Agile escrow rules and payments upon delivery.

●

Buyer insurance for the delivery

22

4.2.5. Technical details of the solution
4.2.5.1. Accepted currencies
Origami payment will accept several crypto-currencies:
●
●
●
●

ORI Token
Ethereum
BTC
FIAT

4.2.5.2. Architecture
4.2.5.2.1. Chain

The Origami Payment module will be based on a smart contract on the Ethereum chain (see ​why
ethereum chain​)​.
At the beginning, accepted currencies on the smart contract will be ORI Token and Ethereum.
Other currencies are discussed on the following chapters.
4.2.5.2.2. Payment overview specifications

Specifications of the Origami Payment smart contracts will be set as follow:
● Payin function: function to pay a good / service on the marketplace. The payment is locked
in an escrow wallet preventing sellers to spend it before the order is delivered to the buyer.
● Transfer function: when the package is shipped, the payment is transferred to the seller
wallet.
● Refund function: if there is a problem in the selling process, the payment is transferred back
from the escrow wallet to the buyers’ wallets.
● Dispute function: if there is a dispute running between buyers and sellers, the payment is
locked up in the escrow wallet until an agreement is reached.

23

4.2.5.2.3. Other currencies accepted

By its deployment on the Ethereum blockchain, Origami Payment will not accept BTC and FIAT out
of the box.
To communicate with Bitcoin chain, our team will be using the B
​ TCRelay protocol
(​https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay​).
The idea is that BTC payment will be done on the ​BTCRelay smart contract​, then transaction
informations will be relayed through the Origami Payment Smart contract.
FIAT Payment will be used at first out of the Ethereum chain (classic fees / classic broker), then a
smart contract (currently on discussion) will be set to accept those currencies.

4.2.6. Advantage of the solution
4.2.6.1. Reduced fees
Escrow fees are a big issue in the actual world of online marketplaces.
The following table displays the fees paid by online marketplaces for the escrow payment system:

4.2.6.2. Buyers insurance with oracles
Origami Payment will connect to decentralized Oracles (e.g Chainlink) to validate that packages
are really delivered to unlock the payments.
Also, buyers can subscribe to an insurance for late delivery. A partial refund will be automatically
sent depending on the delay.

4.2.6.3. For ORI Holders
By paying with the ORI tokens, the fees will be lower than with any other currencies. The discount
will be distributed as a cashback to the buyers.

4.2.6.4. Confidence
Compared to centralized solutions, our payment method will add confidence and security to the
payment processing.
Through our past several years of experience creating online marketplaces, we have detected
major issues with the centralized escrow payment systems:
- Buyers did not receive refund
- Sellers did not receive payment
- Fastidious disputes resolution
Those issues will be tackled, as every transactions are saved on the Ethereum blockchain.

25

4.3. Origami Reviews
4.3.1. Summary
As mentioned earlier in this white paper, research proves that one negative review from a buyer
(justified or not) correlates with an average decrease of the growth of a specific seller’s weekly
sales from +5% to -8%4. (​Source​).
The unregulated nature of reviews, combined with their importance in the success of a
marketplace, leads to abuses from both buyers and sellers.
Origami Review will solve this major problem with a blockchain-powered review system.
Any review will be authenticated, and solely users who had actually been through a prior
transaction would be able to post reviews by signing reviews with their own private key before
posting them.
Origami Review will check the shipment tracking code on the carrier of the order APIs using
Chainlink. ​Chainlink easily connects the Origami Review smart contracts and critical external
data from carriers.
A smart contract from Origami Review will then authorize the reviews from buyers. This will solve
the review problems that all marketplaces have as they scale.
Origami Reviews will decentralize reviews management and organize the ​reputation
management of sellers on any marketplaces.

26

4.3.2. Origami Review vision
Origami Review will:
● Create a global network of trust
● Increase trust on each of the platform individually

The paradigm shift associated with mass adoption of Origami marketplace would see sellers go
from having separate identities and reputations across multiple platforms to sellers having a
single identity that is owned, controlled, and stored—immutable—in the blockchain.

27

4.3.3. Presentation of the Review workflow

4.3.4. Reviewing system biggest issues and how to tackle them
There are big issues on e commerce reviewing :
● Fake reviews to lie on buying experience
● Buyer does not always submit review, more often when the process was flawless (people
tends to review the bad experience)

28

4.3.5. Origami Review features
4.3.5.1. Unbiased system
With the use of the ethereum blockchain, no fake reviews, moderation is transparent and open.

4.3.5.2. Connected to Oracle
Chainlink easily connects the Origami Review smart contracts and critical external data from
carriers and other data feeds.

4.3.5.3. Seamless integration
Marketplaces will integrate the review system through open API, without worrying about
underlying Smartcontract and Blockchain.

4.3.5.4. Rewards
The customer is rewarded with ORI when its review is validated. He can uses ORI to buy products
with​ O
​ rigami Payment​.

4.3.5.5. Built for marketplaces
Marketplaces are very different from classic e-commerce, our review system is designed for
multi-vendors systems.

29

5. What is the Origami Network Token?
5.1. Technical informations
The Origami Network token will be the first usable ERC20 token on our payment platform and the
only form of payment where the fee of 0.8% to 1% does not apply.
The ORI tokens will have multiple usage on our platform :
● Through Origami Payment, the ORI tokens will be a payment method (without fees) and a
cashback asset,
● Through Origami Review it is part of the reward system. The customer is rewarded with ORI
when its review is validated, and
● Through Origami Network, it will allow ORI holders to be a part of the project, by getting
voting rights on next features
●

5.2. Benefits of the token
5.2.1. No payment fees + cashback
Since the payment in ORI will be free of fees, the sellers can decide to redistribute the normal fees
(0.8 to 1%, fees collected by ETH, BTC payments) to the buyers. This will lead to better conversion.
The sellers can also use their ORI tokens to attract more reviews for their shops.

5.2.2. Participation in the project decisions
ORI Holders will have a set of tools to follow and participate in the project decisions. Origami
Network will be built with the community.

5.2.3. Usable on a large set of marketplaces and sharing economy platforms
As Origami Network spreads, the ORI Token will become usable on a very large set of
marketplaces and sharing economy platforms.
You will be able to pay on a large set of websites without fees and easily.

5.2.4. Existing customers
Our greatest advantage is that we have existing customers that will quickly join our platform.

30

5.2.5. Increasing demand
As Origami Network will be installed on new marketplaces, the ORI demand will grow (needed to
pay transaction fees by seller, to pay transaction with cashback by customers, to get rewarded
with the review system). Since the ORI is not mintable, its real value will increase.

6. Origami Network Business Model
The Origami Network Business Model is based on several incomes:
● Origami marketplace subscriptions
● Origami Payment fees

6.1. Origami Marketplace subscriptions
To build and operate a marketplace, a marketplace operator pays a subscription fees.
The pricing is as follow :
Note that set-up fees for Origami Marketplace are non-existent.

6.2. Origami Payment fees
By paying with other currencies than ORI, payment fees are applied. Those fees are separated into
two ways :
- Ethereum network fees
- Origami Network company
The ORI Tokens are made to be seen as fuel for both our reviewing system and payment system.

7.4. Why Origami Network?
We decided in the summer of 2016 that we could use, package and sell to other companies the
marketplace protocol we developed for our own usage through our marketplace
CommentSeRuiner.com.
We started to work on Origami Marketplace at the end of 2016. Origami Marketplace was
commercially launched in April 2017.
But escrow payment is an expensive area (around 2% to 4% fees + flat fees per transaction) with
actual issues (payment disputes are hard to solve).
So we wanted to add to our Origami Marketplace technology the possibility to have ​a blockchain
escrow payment with smart contract technology with low fees​ (around 0.8% to 1% per
transaction) and a
​ guarantee of transparency​: This is Origami Payment.
Origami Network is a protocol for building decentralized marketplaces using the Ethereum
blockchain

Q2 2017 - Launching of Origami Marketplace.
We work on the Origami Network since more than a year now. We already have a working product
with Origami Marketplace, one of the three parts of our protocol to decentralize the online
marketplace stack.
Q3 2017 - First customers of Origami Network - R&D on Origami Payment
As soon as Origami Marketplace was launched we signed multiple customers in France and
Europe. We built their online marketplace using our protocol.
In parallel we started our R&D on Origami Payment. We wanted to anticipate the Token Sale and
be able to talk in details on this part of the Network
Q4 2017 - Preparing the Origami Network Token Sale
A Token Sale is a beautiful project but also a hard one. We strongly believe in our project and we
know our customers are happy with it but we also have to convince a group of contributors to join
us in this project. We had to prepare and manage the launching of our Token Sale.
At this time our team also developed our own Token Sale platform directly connected to the
Ethereum Blockchain (https://get.ori.network) with KYC and whitelisting. This platform can also
be a good example of what our team is capable of because we are a strong tech team that master
the blockchain technologies.
We also developed the Smart Contract for the Token Sale.
