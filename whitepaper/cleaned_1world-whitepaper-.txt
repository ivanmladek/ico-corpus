?as? ?possible? ?to? ?make? ?their? ?business? ?model? ?work. like many other traditional industries, the media business struggling and going through major transformation powered new technologies, implemented via new user experiences and supported proper business models drive such change toward real and sustainable solution and not solution that goes create another set problems (as has? ?happened? ?with? ??native?? ?and? ??programmatic?? ?advertising? ?approaches). among many challenges, the media industry and overall the online publishing, advertising, and? ?internet? ?services? ?sectors? ?are? ?facing? ?the? ?following? ?issues: retention readers who increasingly are switching social media their primary source? ?of? ?news? ?and? ?other? ?daily? ?information? ?of? ?interest; fast? ?growth? ?of? ?ad? ?blockers?,? ?especially? ?among? ?millennials? ?and? ?other technology-advanced? ?readers? ?in? ?general? ?that? ?are? ?not? ?hesitant? ?to? ?install? ?such? ?browser plugins? ?on? ?their? ?desktop? ?and? ?now? ?mobile? ?computing? ?platform; extensive ?fraud problems monetization within the adtech industry, usually attributed bot traffic (sometimes called ?arbitrage traffic?) that many publishers buy knowingly not; this problem increasingly causing brands and advertisers redirect their budgets away from sites running just classical display campaigns, which? ?in? ?turn? ?causes? ?major? ?financial? ?setback? ?for? ?those? ?relying? ?on? ?this? ?business? ?model; questionable practices such ?pay-to-play (or guaranteed cpm approach) that are causing asymmetrical relationships with providers technology and causing short-term? ?wins? ?but? ?long? ?term? ?losses? ?for? ?publishers? ?who? ?entertain? ?them; top this comes the most ?fundamental problem online publishing?: eternal conflict between, one hand, the need create and maintain good content encapsulated within good user experience (ux), and the other hand the need make money via advertising (especially programmatic) which very hard, almost impossible, balance and sites usually do? ?well? ?either? ?one? ?or? ?the? ?other,? ?but? ?rarely? ?both? ?simultaneously. people who use blockers are now dealing with soft hard warnings that content will available only they turn off their blockers, which creates ?no win? situation between publishers? ?and? ?their? ?audiences. with the introduction blockchain into the media industry, including the first wave pilot implementations various cryptocurrencies for attention, advertising, engagement etc., certainly step the right direction and serves the ultimate goal establishing new type relationship, where all three parts the ?industry triangle? (?readers ?publishers ?-- advertisers?) are motivated and have proper incentives, enabling true win-win-win environment. world firm believer motivating readers the web sites come visit more often via giving them incentives for their engagements and contributions, and offering choice being exposed not the ads the site. all these elements have come together make? ?the? ??reader? ??? ?publisher? ?--? ?advertiser?? ?triangle? ?work. the world platform has been providing the tools and the network for deployments since and the next step further decentralizing and introducing world (wo) tokens that will circulating this triangle and bringing benefits all parties involved: namely, readers earn for engagement, publishers get new revenue streams, and advertisers receive discounts? ?and? ?access? ?to? ?wide-spread? ?diversified? ?and? ?attractive? ?inventory. the future this industry decentralized models where the economy interactions built very natural principles where people are legitimate active participants with rights their own rather than just being treated cookie-tagged ?subjects advertising?

?to? ?them. the? ?experience? ?no? ?reader? ?really? ?wants! world? ?vision? ?&? ?execution world online silicon valley company headquartered and operating san jose, california since with mission build global software platform supplement online content with interactive tools (such polls, surveys, quizzes, insights pages, interactive maps and other formats) that help answer the question ??what people really think?? this done via contextual, relevant, organic, and highly engaging data collection with analytical insighst? ?on? ?site? ?and? ?across? ?network? ?of? ?participating? ?sites. believe that any business objective online services centered around content publishing should accomplished via organic experiences where conversation with readers has established first (e.g., via presenting poll widget related the article that the reader will motivated vote and express their opinion), then the publisher learns more about this user (not only the immediate response, but also history previous responses various questions and other engagements observed and captured the world tools), this analysis helps provide better content (e.g., next question the rotation suggested articles read next) and better promotion, such targeted advertisement?

?claims,? ?with? ?numerous? ?dependent? ?claims,? ?are? ?as? ?follows: insights page dynamic ?second page? web mobile pages, along with new ad? ?inventory smart profiling data presentation system creates psychographic profile for each respondent matrix, that then triggers intelligent presentation data each?

results, putting web pages data through filter depending their psychographic outlooks and worldviews (smart profiling data presentation system), and all three these inventions can applied simultaneously. the expected result using these innovations even higher engagement, positive spiral where publisher editors, web site readers,? ?and? ?monetization? ?goals? ?all? ?benefit. web publishers have keen interest raising engagement rates their content. the shift the publishing industry from print format online publishing medium has brought revolution the way news produced and consumed. but along with this transformation the publishing industry comes challenges. the low entry barrier, outdated tools, declining revenue, and the decimation the once profitable classified sections newspapers, and continuous change search engine algorithms, combined with short-attention span the online audiences has caused major industry problems. has forced many online publishers out business desperately search ways increase online engagement rates stay business, either content subscriptions from avid fans (committed readers) the content provider online advertising readers their website mobile app. these innovations listed above all are meant address the problems facing web publishers helping them increase their engagement rates with each individual end-user web visitor, and in? ?turn? ?generate? ?more? ?revenue? ?and? ?profits. world? ?cryptocurrency? ?&? ?use? ?cases world online will introducing its own cryptocurrency called ?wo ?(pronounced one-world?). token internal cryptocurrency circulated inside the ecosystem that world online has created and continues grow. all payments inside such ecosystem will conducted only via tokens. for convenient exchange tokens into fiat and various popular cryptocurrencies there will references external marketplace such coin? ?exchanges? ?where? ?wo? ?coins? ?will? ?be? ?listed? ?after? ?the? ?ico. the issuance currency capped million tokens and additional issuances are? ?planned. from the very beginning the issued token mass designed support the growing volume transactions inside the ecosystem during the scaling, which implies ongoing organic growth?

?be? ?converted? ?into? ?wo? ?tokens? ?as? ?soon? ?as? ?the? ?user? ?registers? ?and? ?creates? ?a? ?wallet. then spending and use earned tokens can done either inside the world system outside? ?of? ?it.? ?inside,? ?users? ?will? ?be? ?offered? ?a? ?few? ?pre-defined? ?choices: use coins for ?micropayments disable advertising ?and still enjoy the content. this case solves the fundamental problem when readers with blockers are warned the site they are visiting that content isn?t available until blocker turned off subscription payment received. world will make such micropayments seamless and establish proper user experience that works for both? ?the? ?publisher? ?and? ?the? ?reader. use coins purchase advertising space and ?initiate data collection service (mini-surveys) via world widgets. this operation handled via built-in marketplace? ?with?

?following? ?diagram: the beginning tokens will implemented combination public on-chain ethereum blockchain, and off-chain solution like raiden, plasma state channels (or private blockchain? ?solution? ?like? ?exonum). users (brands, publishers, researchers, readers) who want transfer tokens will able interact with the public ethereum blockchain, which will serve the currency?s decentralized? ?settlement? ?layer. implementation? ?based? ?on? ?ethereum? ?erc the ethereum blockchain currently the industry standard for issuing custom digital assets and smart contracts. one the main reasons using existing ethereum?s infrastructure instead building entirely new blockchain. the latest and most popular erc token interface the best choice compatible with the existing infrastructure the ethereum ecosystem, development tools, wallets, and exchanges. also erc allows for seamless interaction with other smart contracts and decentralized applications the ethereum blockchain. current? ?ethereum? ?limitations blockchain general (and ethereum blockchain particular) decentralized network. decentralization critical because eliminates single points failure control that makes downtime, censorship, fraud third-party interference impossible. these advantages and active ecosystem make ethereum good choice for the world decentralized economy. but, the other hand, the nature blockchain decentralization (signature verification, consensus mechanisms, redundancy, etc.) leads some disadvantages comparison with centralized databases. the biggest ethereum disadvantage for proposed world economy ethereum? ?scalability. the well-known fact the current ethereum proof-of-work blockchain has scalability bottlenecks: ?fee? ?to? ?be? ?paid? ?for? ?every? ?single? ?transaction ?transactions? ?confirmation? ?takes? ?tens? ?of? ?seconds? ?in? ?average number transactions per second (transaction throughput) that small enough process? ?increasing? ?number? ?of? ?applications these limitations make micro-transactions, such the ones the world online platform performs for typical use cases, not economically viable put the public ledger and charged. example would tokens reward end-users the site for their engagements? ?and? ?content? ?contributions. ?if? ?a? ?public? ?ethereum? ?blockchain? ?is? ?used? ??as? ?is?? ?for? ?these? ?transactions,? ?then: ?fee? ?for? ?transaction? ?would? ?be? ?comparable? ?or? ?even? ?higher? ?than? ?reward? ?amount? ?itself; end-users? ?would? ?wait? ?for? ?tens? ?of? ?seconds? ?until? ?transaction? ?is? ?confirmed; huge number transaction would congest the ethereum?s throughput capability. that?s why world online could not use the existing version public ethereum blockchain ?as is? for some kinds transactions and has find some solution. there silver bullet here and now, but ethereum new technology, lot efforts are made solve these ethereum?s limitations. for example, the core ethereum team understands the limitations and trying solve them: recent ethereum metropolis hard fork first step transition from proof-of-work proof-of-stake. moreover lot other solutions the top ethereum are progress. and most experts agree that this only the question time: some solution combination solutions will developed often the case with evolving? ?technology. this concerns not ethereum blockchain only. the similar issues for the bitcoin blockchain, crypto currency network older than ethereum, have been successfully solved ?lightning network?. there are several solutions that are going solve these blockchain bottlenecks like machinomy?, ?toy state channels and other, but few them are worth mentioning detail: raiden? ?network plasma smart? ?contracts exonum raiden? ?network raiden network similar bitcoin?s lightning network off-chain high speed asset transfers network for ethereum erc tokens that has been under development now for nearly two years and close release. uses network off-chain state channels securely transfer any erc token without the requirement transact the blockchain. the raiden network will provide payment system based payment channel technology that scales with the number its users: the bigger the raiden network becomes, the higher its? ?maximum? ?throughput? ?will? ?be,? ?with? ?practically? ?no? ?upper? ?limit? ?in? ?sight. one more important thing: unlike ethereum public transactions, raiden transfers will private between the payer, the payee, and the nodes forwarding the transfer. when channels? ?are? ?settled,? ?only? ?the? ?sum? ?of? ?transactions? ?will? ?become? ?visible? ?to? ?the? ?entire? ?world. plasma the ?plasma solution was recently announced joseph poon and vitalik buterin; framework that scalable significant amount state updates using the proof-of-stake method. plasma works top root (main) ethereum blockchain. its idea eliminate the need generate on-chain transactions for every state update leveraging coalesced state updates that are comprised the bitmaps which the transactions are composed. the root network contract processes only very small number commitments from child blockchains that are able large number computations. commitments are broadcasted? ?periodically? ?to? ?the? ?root? ?blockchain? ?from? ?the? ?child? ?blockchains. state? ?channels addition open-source solutions like plasma raiden, world online could implement their? ?own? ?solution? ?that? ?utilizes? ?state? ?channels? ?for? ?appropriate? ?transactions. state channels are design pattern which signed messages representing transactions are exchanged between two parties. any party can choose any time broadcast the last message the blockchain, updating state representative the sum all exchanges between? ?the? ?two? ?parties. state channels are important technique for allowing some blockchain operations conducted off the blockchain, while retaining even improving the underlying security guarantees? ?that? ?a? ?blockchain? ?offers. particular, state channels can used significantly improve the performance interactions between designated group people, while significantly reducing transaction costs.? ?they? ?can? ?be? ?applied? ?to? ?payments,? ?smart? ?contracts,? ?and? ?many? ?other? ?scenarios.? ?[] exonum exonum open source enterprise-grade blockchain framework developed the bitfury group. allows build private permissioned blockchain. the moment, exonum-based smart contracts can handle transactions per second with clearing time seconds (and transactions per second custom situations), that significantly faster than any other public blockchain networks. uses custom-built byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm that excludes any single point failure, making blockchain? ?resilient? ?to? ?nodes? ?crashes? ?or? ?bad? ?actors,? ?without? ?needing? ?to? ?mine? ?blocks. exonum seems perfect solution for world?s micro-transactions, but there one significant obstacle: anchors (periodically saves cryptographic hash reflecting the state exonum blockchain) data the bitcoin blockchain order protect data against history revisions. but ethereum token and thus this will require develop some extra module? ?that? ?allows? ?to? ?use? ?exonum? ?together? ?with? ?ethereum? ?blockchain. smart? ?contracts world will utilize smart contract for appropriate transactions, both for engagement and services? ?delivery? ?(advertising? ?and? ?research)? ?use? ?cases? ?as? ?described? ?in? ?this? ?document. current? ?implementation? ?plan highly expected that there will others solutions that also could used for world online purposes. the common idea switch from saving all transactions the public blockchain (on-chain) saving them off-chain but ultimately enforceable on-chain. moving transactions off the chain leads significant improvements cost and speed. anyway, there strong confidence that there will least one solution top ethereum the near? ?future? ?that? ?allows? ?highly? ?scalable,? ?low? ?latency,? ?and? ?cost? ?effective? ?decentralized? ?systems. use? ?cases? ?for? ?wo? ?tokens for further consideration, makes sense separate world transactions based their size,?
