Business Overview
Qvolta is a global P2P exchange platform that allows users to quickly and easily convert cryptocurrencies into the fiat
currencies, and vice versa. We have created Qvolta as a direct response to a huge market problem that exists in the
global cryptocurrencies market. In the majority of countries around the world individuals are not able to quickly (within
5-10 minutes) and conveniently convert cryptocurrencies into fiat money. While some exchange platforms are available,
most lack the scale and offer unsophisticated tech solutions, that lack security and are challenging and complicated to
use.
in contrast, Qvolta will provide individuals a reliable and convenient platform to quickly buy or sell cryptocurrencies with
help of the most popular payment methods for the fiat currencies available in the country of his/her residence. Initially two
cryptocurrencies will be available for the exchange - Bitcoin and Ethereum, with later envisioned addition of Monero and
other altcoins.
In order to ensure the best user experience as well as protect the users, Qvolta will act as a guarantor for the trades
executed on the platform. Security will further be provided by services as Qvolta Wall and Qvolta Security. Qvolta solution
will be available both as a desktop and mobile applications (iOS and Android).

The problem we are solving
Nowadays converting cryptocurrency into a fiat money and vice versa is extremely inconvenient due to the following
reasons:
Burdensome and time-consuming process. Fast addition of fiat currencies to exchanges is extremely challenging due
to the difficulties in connecting merchant accounts to enable acceptance of the major payment systems. Furthermore, it
takes on average a full day to transfer funds from a user’s bank account into to the exchange platform account; making
instant trades challenging.
The requirement to participate in trades. In order to be able to buy cryptocurrencies, user has to participate in trades
without the ability to quickly make the purchase at fixed price and in one click only.
High costs. Cryptocurrency wallets that offer the options of cryptocurrencies purchase overcharge the users, with high
commissions and added fees.

Our solution
With the help of Qvolta, any resident from any country in the world will have an opportunity to:
Sell cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies using their preferred local payment methods;
Buy cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies using their preferred local payment methods;
Take advantage of the guarantor services to protect the transactions and secure the trades.

4

Our target audience will be people who want to quickly buy / sell cryptocurrencies at a fixed price without taking part in
the exchange trades. Qvolta solution will enable these people to complete the transaction within 5-10 minutes – making it
the most time-efficient and convenient exchange platform to date. Guarantor services will be provided to secure the
transactions; and user accounts will be protected with our proprietary anti-fraud system.

Our value proposition
Qvolta solution will provide a number of benefits over other exchanges in the market, ultimately offering an unparalleled
value proposition for the users:
Convenient & easy-to-use interface
Low commission rates and no hidden fees
Availability of mobile application, and easy integration for the user between desktop & mobile
Fast support for all of the operations, including dispute-resolution; and strong emphasis on 24/7 customer service
Guarantor system and high security of the platform
Global reach and presence in all countries globally

Market analysis
The market of cryptocurrencies is one of the fastest-growing and most promising industries globally. Using the insights
from 2017 Global Benchmarking Study conducted by Cambridge University, and supported by additional analytics from
key industry organizations, we have outlined below some of the key industry facts and trends.

Cryptocurrency market value & growth
While the markets have long been sceptical about the growth of cryptocurrencies due to lack of regulation and security
concerns, 2017 has proven to be a year that clearly shows cryptocurrencies will a crucial part of the future.
Since early 2016, the total cryptocurrency market capitalisation has increased more than 3x, reaching nearly $27 billion in
April 2017. As of July 2017, total capitalization of cryptocurrencies has increased to over $100M, posting an
unprecedented increase.

The trend has been universal with most of the cryptocurrencies gaining value on the back of the overall positive trend. As
of 2015, 0.87% of US consumers are estimated to have owned cryptocurrency, which amounts to around 2.8 million
people in the US alone. Based on calculations using their own user data, Coinbase and ARK Research estimate that in
2016 around 10 million people around the world have owned bitcoin.

6

Currently, the core value of the market continues to lie with Bitcoin; followed by Ethereum and Ripple. However, in the
future other cryptocurrencies are expected to consistently grow further, eventually gaining greater share of the overall
market.

The volume of cryptocurrency wallets & users

7

The total number of wallets is difficult to estimate, though Global Benchmarking Study calculates it using the data
collected from study participants; together with the available data on the number of software downloads of major wallet
providers and Bitcoin’s reference implementation. Using the conservative assumption that one software download is
equivalent to one wallet created, it is estimated that the total number of wallets globally has amounted to 35 million in
2016, a 4x increase over the 2013 level of 8.2 million. In reality, the figure is expected to be significantly higher given that
one cryptocurrency user would potentially have more than one wallet; and that the calculation excluded data opensource wallets.
Among these, the study estimated that the percentage of active wallets ranged from a low of 7.5% to a high of 30.9% of
total wallets, depending on the type of provider; and therefore it can be assumed that the number of active wallets is
currently between 5.8 million and 11.5 million in 2017.
The number of users of cryptocurrency wallets was calculated based on the number of active wallets, assuming that an
average user owns two wallets (and excluding people who used exchanges as a wallet or those who use the services of
payment operators, or platforms, which have the ability to store cryptocurrency). According to the Global Benchmarking
Study, based on the assumptions underlined the current number of unique active users of cryptocurrency wallets is
estimated to be between 2.9 million and 5.8 million, as illustrated in the figure below.

Payments using cryptocurrencies
The Global Benchmarking Study has surveyed 48 companies that use cryptocurrency as a payment method, in 27
countries. 79% of these payment companies have existing relationships with banking institutions and payment networks,
however, they cite the difficulty of obtaining and maintaining these relationships as the sector's biggest challenge.

8

Merchant services, which mainly consist of processing payments for merchants that accept cryptocurrencies, is the most
widely offered payment service (52% of survey respondents agree). 21% of payment companies exclusively process
national-to-national currency payments, whereas half of payment companies do not process any national-to-national
payments at all. Also, the report underlines that the bitcoin network is used by 86% of surveyed payment companies as
main payment rail for cross-border transactions.
Licensing for cryptocurrency companies is much more common than the absence of such requirements, and 54% of
payment companies have a formal government license; of all payment type activities, platforms providing B2B payment
services are most likely to have a license (83%). Besides, 86% of payment companies perform KYC/AML checks.

Cryptocurrencies exchange platforms
Globally there are currently 51 cryptocurrencies exchange platforms in 27 countries of the world. According to the study,
52% of small exchanges hold a formal government license compared to only 35% of large exchanges. 85% of all
exchanges in Asia-Pacific region have no licenses, which comes into the sharp contract to North-American exchanges
where 78% of exchanges have such licenses.
73% of exchanges take custody of user funds, which can attract hackers while 23% let users control keys. For better
security 92% of exchanges use cold-storage systems; on average 87% of funds are kept in cold storage. Also,
multisignature architecture is supported by 86% of large exchanges and 76% of small exchanges
Most of the exchanges follow a traditional architecture, and there is only one global P2P exchange platform –
LocalBitcoin. While still relatively small it has recently seen a significant increase in the trade volume, reflecting generally
higher demand for cryptocurrencies (volumes reached all-time highs since early 2017, particularly in high growth
emerging countries located in Asia, Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe.

Outlook and future value of the market
While the growth of the market is very challenging to predict, according to Saxo Bank, Bitcoin could make up 10 percent
of the $5 trillion average daily volume in the foreign exchange market in 10 years. Its market capitalization could grow to
$1.75 trillion which would make each bitcoin worth $100,000 – an enormous growth potential market.

Why now is a perfect investment momentum
Improved security and technology
The security of Bitcoin has now been proven by eight years with no downtime and no breaches of the public open source
codebase. Furthermore, an additional driver of this latest growth in the crypto space can be explained by the increase in
smart contract awareness and anonymous block chain technologies, with more and more sophisticated solutions
emerging in the market.

9

Increasing investment wave and rising interest in the market
The growth is further supported by the enormous investments inflow in practically all cryptocurrencies. The adoption of
cryptocurrencies has been universal, with multiple large companies, banks and funds now working on or investing in
Block chain projects. IBM alone has 300+ Block chain projects underway with corporate companies.
Changing regulation
Once being a key obstacle, regulation today is increasingly becoming a positive force for cryptocurrencies growth.
Japanese government has recently formally recognized the Bitcoin in April, giving it greater legitimacy in Asia’s richest
major economy. Other countries are expected to follow shortly, with a steady growth of international money-transfer
services that use Bitcoin daily.
Relatively low competition
While the potential of the market has long been recognized, it has been not until 2017 when the growth of
cryptocurrencies has exploded. Given the currently large capitalization of the market and huge volume there is a growing
number of services and startups trying to tap into the newly emerged market opportunity. However, even with increasing
interest in the sector the number of players is still relatively low, with significant room existing for new entrants. As the
competition is limited yet the scale is already sufficient to minimize the risks, cryptocurrencies sector presents a perfect
momentum for new strong incumbents to enter the market.

10

Competition
There are a number of direct and indirect competitors globally. In a broader sense, we will be competing with multiple
companies worldwide that are offering services related to exchange of cryptocurrencies, either to other currencies or into
cash. These include traditional exchanges like Bitstamp, BTC-e, Bitfinex, Kraken etc. that differ from P2P solutions as your
funds are on hold until the sell or buy order is executed.
In a narrower sense, our competitors will be represented by the P2P cryptocurrencies exchange platforms that currently
exist on the market. The key distinction between the traditional exchange is the business and operations framework,
where P2P platforms do not hold the user funds and instead just match the buyers and sellers; also providing much
demanded privacy for the transactions.
Our key direct competitor is LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer marketplace that matches users wanting to buy or sell bitcoin.
Other solutions exist on the market with a various set of features and functionalities. However, those are relatively small,
lacking the sophisticated technology platform as well as scale and sufficient user / seller volume to complete globally
(Coinffeine, Bitsquare, Bitkan, Paxful etc). With the market being incredibly large and growing, there is clearly room as
well as an increasing need for more quality P2P platforms on the market.
While LocalBitcoins is currently the leader on P2P cryptocurrency exchange market, we strongly believe that our solution
will provide a solid edge over the rival, with unparalleled value proposition for the users and hence an ability to sustain
long-term competitive advantage in the marketplace.
A detailed side-by-side comparison against the LocalBitcoins can be found in the table below:

13

Marketing Strategy
We have devised a well-rounded marketing plan aimed to quickly build awareness of the Qvolta brand and rapidly gain
recognition in the target market. Our user acquisition plan is based on a number of key strategies that will be employed
over the next 5 years; with strong focus on social media advertising and word-of-mouth in the launch phase; and higher
investment budgets for traditional advertising and PR as Qvolta continues to scale and expandе

Influencers & word-of-mouth
One of the key steps of our marketing plan is establishing credibility of the brand early on; while gaining a lot of brand
coverage and heavy exposure to the target audience. This will be done through collaborations with influencers in
various fields attached to cryptocurrencies, who will be promoting Qvolta platform through their blogs, YouTube
channels and social media accounts. Investment in influencer advertising will allow us to quickly unlock multiple
audiences around the world, instantly gaining credibility and trust for the brand thanks to the real, personal and storybased advertising. At the same time, through utilizing influencer reach out platforms and tools we will also be able to
significantly save marketing costs as compared to traditional advertising.
In order to further encourage rapid user sign-ups we will build a referral program where users are encouraged to share
the brand with their friends or acquaintances, in return for Qvolta credit and perks (similar to strategies initially
employed by Dropbox, PayPal and Airbnb). Such a strategy would allow us to achieve a viral effect for the brand,
rapidly growing user base and engagement with the platform.

Events & partnerships
As part of our promotion plan we envision to be heavily involved in the global cryptocurrency ecosystem, securing our
position as a well-recognized player globally. This involves presence at the important industry events and creation of the
mutually beneficial partnerships with other market players.
Key strategies to build visibility of the Qvolta brand would involve attendance and sponsorship of the key industry events,
as well as participation in Bitcoin or Blockchain Conferences as attendees and later speakers / experts. Similarly, a
fundamental step in our marketing strategy will be creation a network of partners that would be interested in promoting
Qvolta solution for the referral fees; or similar promotion on Qvolta website. Our key target would be companies that
either offer complementary business services or are interested in a reliable partner providing cashing our opportunities
for their users (such as cryptocurrencies gaming companies).

SEO & content marketing
One of the key steps in building visibility early would be creation of the blog on cryptocurrencies that would be driving
traffic to the Qvolta website. We will focus on publishing engaging content that answers important questions for the users,
or otherwise covers new developments in the cryptocurrencies market.

14

The blog writing will be lead and supported by high quality marketing professionals, ensuring that the content is not only
interesting and visible in the search engine results, but also is written creatively enough and has interesting elements to
have a potential to go viral.
In order to ensure visibility in the search results we will have an external SEO team promoting the blog and blog articles;
and ensuring presence in targeted discussion lists, online forums, and groups for people with particular interests (e.g. Sub
Reddit, Facebook groups and Bitcoin Talk forum).

Social media & Advertising
One of the key communication channels for Qvolta brand will be presence on social media platforms (Facebook,
Instagram, Twitter) to ensure continuous interaction with the key audience. Facebook will be further utilized for the
marketing ads and campaigns. While we envision investments in Google Adwords as a medium to reach target
audience, over the recent years Facebook has been found to be a more cost-efficient channel to reach potential users;
and thus particularly in the earlier stages the focus will be on Facebook campaigns and re-targeting tactics to drive
users back to the Qvolta website.

Email Marketing
An essential part of our strategy would be building out the email subscriber list and sending weekly personalized
newsletters with special offers and product updates to sustain the engagement levels.

PR
We plan to engage PR specialists early on to build reputation for the brand and ensure we have strong coverage in the
press, including relevant industry publications, tech resources and important business destinations (Business Insider,
Forbes, TechCrunch).
Each of the strategies will be utilized in the go-to-market plan over the next 5 years, with some strategies being more
heavily employed based on the stage of company’s development. Our vision in this respect is outlined in the graph
below:

15

Referral program
Our referral program will benefit both senders and recipients of invitations. There will also be a system of welcome
bonuses, so a trader can try to trade on the cheapest tariff plan for the first time completely free of charge.

Verification
We will have two categories of users-verified and unverified. Users will decide themselves with whom to conduct
transactions - with verified users or unverified. We will use verification to maximally protect our users from
fraudulentschemes.
Also verification of users is necessary for compliance with the KYC and AML rulesin those jurisdictions where Qvolta
platform will work.

19

Qvolta Wall and Qvolta Security
Qvolta Wall is a security of your account. It means that you will receive a notification when you sign into your account,
information from which device and from which address was made a previous sign-in.

Qvolta Security is an app that gives you a personal and unique code each time you entering to the platform and trying to
make operations on the platform.

20

The work scheme of our business
Our service has 2 components (as well as any other working not only with cryptocurrency, but also with fiat money
service has):

1. Payments/Transactions with user's fiat money
2. Payments/Transactions with user's cryptocurrency
If we consider the first component, then we are completely decentralized: the users' fiat money does not go through
our trading platform and users make payments to each other directly, without our participation.
On the second point, of course we could not be called completely decentralized, because orders are processed by a
centralized escrow mechanism.

21
