Community
based video
distribution.

Abstract
On social networks, such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, there is a value that is
transferred between users called “Like”. Whether it is a picture of your dog wearing a
Jedi disguise, a haiku poem about autumn or a short video of a teenager Rihannawannabe singing in front of her cell phone; for every contribution to the community
Likes are expected as a recognition for a good job. And they become an incentive for
creating new content. But as there is an unlimited supply of Likes — no one ever ran out
of them — Likes have no actual value.

What if we could create scarcity value on Likes by turning them into a freely transferable,
tradable token with a limited issuance? What would happen if, to set a hypothetical
scenario, we transformed Likes into Likecoins?

A token such as Likecoin
changes the game of social
interactions, turning social
networks into social
economies.
On one hand, you would have to think twice before handing out your tokens in
exchange for low-quality contributions, because your stock of Likecoins is limited. On the
other hand, you would be able to give away as many Likecoins as you wish to a certain
content that you have really enjoyed. You could earn your Likecoins back, but this would
mean that you should have actually contributed to the social network.
Get involved, participate, be active. There would be no more passive witnesses. A
secondary market of Likecoins would be probably built up, and users who wanted to get

tokens without participating would need to buy them, giving a monetary value to
Likecoins. Anyone could send and receive Likecoins from friends, making a good present
out of it – a treasurable gift.
Today, all social networks are turning to video as the dominant tool to create
engagement with users on their platforms. Facebook is about to spend $300M to
produce their own content, while Warner is planning a $100M budget for creating
original content on Instagram. Around 70% of internet traffic is video, and this number is
increasing to reach more than 80% in 2020. This business currently belongs to only a few
big players, as traditional video platforms rely upon huge costs on storage and
bandwidth.
These companies have monopolized the market, creating an advertising-centric
ecosystem in which authors don ́t monetize, users can only reach the content that
leaves the biggest revenues for the platforms and, ironically, advertisers cannot
effectively showcase their content to their audiences. No one ever dared on confronting
this model, because there is no way of competing in the infrastructure battle which such
giant companies.
Instead of Likecoins, we have our token, Flixx. By implementing Flixx on top of a social
video distribution platform we can engage users in helping us improve the network by
lending their storage and their bandwidth in exchange for tokens. Users will spend Flixx
for consuming the content they really want to watch, and will earn Flixx back for
participating, for being social.

Whether it is on a smartphone, a tablet, a computer or even on a smart tv, a video
distribution community could smartly use a decentralized, incentivized peer-topeer network, having no structural costs and unlimited scaling possibilities.

On top of that, users can earn more Flixx if they choose to watch advertisement. This
disrupting revenues-flow model creates a new ecosystem in which users decide how to
monetize their attention and personal information, and then transfer those earnings to
the authors of the content they really enjoy. Within this model, consumers reach the
content they want to watch, authors monetize and deliver better quality content and
advertisers find a way of effectively showcasing their content to their audiences.

Introduction
The rise of internet based streaming services (also called "OTT" – short for "Over the top",
or “VOD”, for “Video on Demand”) is fundamentally changing the way video is being
produced, sold, distributed and consumed. Most streaming services will offer you, as a
customer, the chance to select what to watch and when and where to watch it. This
disconnection from the traditional linear programming attributes of what we refer(ed)
to as "TV", is a fundamental shift. Besides, more and more movies, TV shows and live
events are being watched on tablets, cellphones, computers and smart TV ́s, radically
transforming the whole audiovisual industry.

But as technology moves forward, production companies and content authors tend not
to find a compelling revenue model for their work, and consumers find themselves
committed to VOD services that don't satisfy their demand for audiovisual content, so
they seek that content on illegal, unlicensed networks.

The gigantic costs associated with the infrastructure necessary for storing and
distributing content, in addition to the endless lines of intermediaries, result into an
unreasonable final price for consumers and an inefficient revenue model for the authors.
Today, all the revenues are in the hands of the platforms.

By creating a distributed and incentivized peer-to-peer network where every user turns
itself into a distributor of content, and by providing a decentralized payment channel,
Flixxo gets rid of the middle-men and the infrastructure costs, building up a platform
and a community where every author is able to upload content and set the rules of the
distribution (such as the price and the incentives for users to share the author’s work),
developing new effective business models for his/her content, and where consumers
may reach the content they ŕ e looking for in a legal manner, paying a fair price or even
nothing if they are socially engaged with the community.

Flixxo will also educate its community, teaching its users that in this new internet era
value can be held and transferred online without intermediaries, a value that can be

earned back by participating in a community, by contributing, being rewarded for every
single social interaction.

Decentralized payments: Blockchain and the
Internet of Value
When you send some information through the internet you are not actually sending the
information but a copy of it (whether it is a spreadsheet, a PowerPoint file, a Word
document or an email, all of them will be copies).

If someone wants to send $100 to another person or business, then it’s important that
they no longer have those $100 or a copy of them. Similarly, when an artist distributes an
original piece of work, then it’s important that its commercial value is not undermined
by that distribution.

The information-centric medium of the web, which after all is based on an interlinked
page model and publishing language (HTML), was never designed to handle the
exchange of actual value. Anyone transferring money online, for example, is not actually
moving the value directly. Instead they are sending instructions to an intermediary —
whether through a bank, a credit card company, PayPal or the Western Union — to pass
on the value. Even when someone rents a spare room via the sharing-economy platform
Airbnb, they are still not doing it directly over the internet but via a third-party broker.
And the involvement of such third parties in the exchange of value naturally comes at a
cost.

Blockchain – the technology
behind Bitcoin - enables the
peer-to-peer exchange of
assets, something that has
been largely absent from the
information publishing
nature of today's webdominated internet.
The peer-to-peer exchange facilitated by blockchains has its basis in some pretty
complex but powerful IT architecture. In essence, blockchains are cloud databases,
decentralized over a large number of devices that maintain a global distributed ledger
of transactions (encapsulated in blocks), whose integrity, permanence and nonreputability are assured by the running of regular comparisons across chains of those
interconnected blocks. The underlying technology is open source, leaving companies
free to innovate; and it maintains security through the use of heavy-duty encryption.

Decentralized distribution: The BitTorrent
protocol
BitTorrent is a communication protocol of peer-to-peer file sharing ("P2P") which is
used to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet. BitTorrent is one of the
most common protocols for transferring large files, such as digital video files containing

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

7

TV shows, video clips or digital audio files containing songs. Programmer Bram Cohen,
a former at student Buffalo University, designed the protocol in April 2001 and released
the first available version on July 2, 2001, with the most recent version being released in
2013.

The BitTorrent protocol can be used to reduce the server and network impact of
distributing large files. Rather than downloading a file from a single source server, the
BitTorrent protocol allows users to join a "swarm" of hosts to upload/download from
each other simultaneously. The protocol is an alternative to the older single source,
multiple mirror sources technique for distributing data, and can work effectively over
networks with lower bandwidth. Using the BitTorrent protocol, several basic computers
such as home computers, can replace large servers while efficiently distributing files to
many recipients. This lower bandwidth usage also helps prevent large spikes in internet
traffic in a given area, keeping internet speeds higher for all users in general, regardless
of whether or not they use the BitTorrent protocol.

Every day there are 45M users looking for content on BitTorrent networks because,
sometimes, it is the only way to reach it. And these users find it. BitTorrent turned out
to be an incredibly effective way of distributing files in a p2p fashion.

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

8

With +200M monthly users
the cost associated with
storage and bandwidth is
zero. Compare this with the
billion dollars that Netflix
spends on a yearly basis for
storing and distributing 1PB
of content.
Netflix doesn’t even have its own servers – they can ́t afford that. Instead, Netflix uses
Amazon cloud computing services (AWS) to host and deploy its content.

Unfortunately, on audiovisual content, more than 90% of the downloads come from
unlicensed sources. However, contrary to many beliefs, BitTorrent users are more likely
to pay for content than the average guy (1). Most BitTorrent users also pay for streaming
or cable subscriptions, but they look on p2p networks for content they don't find on the
platforms they are paying for. For example, Otto pays a monthly $8 Netflix subscription,
but when he wants to watch HBO ́s Game of Thrones, the options are either paying a
new subscription – this time to HBO – or legally downloading every single episode from
iTunes or Amazon at $4 per piece (which is a very elevated cost in comparison with the
average $0,20 that users pay per hour of Netflix content). Digital streaming of GoT is
even more expensive than buying the six seasons on BluRay, although the costs of
manufacturing and distributing a beautifully printed box filled with blu-rays are
obviously much higher than the costs of streaming that content. Therefore, Otto finally
decides to get GoT from a BitTorrent network.

Improved video quality, better engagement
Sourcing from a local mesh network enables higher bitrates and minimizes
rebuffering.

Distributed network for infinite scale
Scale to audiences no matter where servers or viewers may be to build a truly global
platform, providing the capacity to accommodate increasingly large, unpredictable
audiences

p2p Content Distribution meets p2p
Payments
Nowadays, centralization on data storage and bandwidth turned to be a faulty model. It
has been shown that peer to peer models, such as the BitTorrent protocol, have
become a much better paradigm for a healthy internet. However, the battle on piracy
between major studios and bittorrent networks has kept these technologies from
becoming mainstream.
Just like BitTorrent, Bitcoin was first associated with black markets and money
laundering, but then the technology developed was adopted by banks and financial
institutions as they learned the real value of these new models.
The movie industry has been engaged in a battle against BitTorrent for the last 15 years.
The digital distribution has changed 100% and in the online streaming industry, which
is worth more than twenty-five billion dollars a year, the losses for not knowing how to
adopt these technologies instead of fighting them are estimated to be more than four
billion dollars a year.

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

10

However, in order to have the BitTorrent network working, users have to keep in their
devices the files they have downloaded, so they can share those files to the rest of
users. Those who do that are called “seeders”. As the content tends to be illegal, there
can’t be incentives for users to seed, and a lack of seeders can spoil the network.

We know about p2p payments, we have developed decentralized ways of settling
value on a blockchain, we have learned how to set rules on that value by
implementing smart contracts. Therefore, we have the tools to connect peer-topeer payments to peer-to-peer content distribution. We can merge both
technologies to make a social experience out of it.
This is the main idea behind Flixxo.

What we need in order to achieve our goal is to create a token with a value that is
inherent to the network we are using for distributing content. We call this token Flixx.
Through this token, users can earn incentives for seeding legal content and get a
channel for connecting directly with media producers. It is a two-way system, in which
producers pay users for improving the network, and users can give authors a
recognition for their work.
This token also prevents piracy and spam content, as authors have to time-block
tokens in a smart contract (set as a warranty) in order to upload content. This contract

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

11

will also handle and block their earnings for a certain period of time, so that in the case
of a dispute the unfair-uploader may lose those tokens.

Our solution
Flixxo combines BitTorrent and smart contracts to create the first legal, decentralized
content distribution network.
Flixxo creates a P2P network where authors can distribute and monetize their own
content. They incentivize the distribution of their media and remove unnecessary
intermediate parties by sharing their revenues with the “seeders” – a term coined in the
torrent environment that refers to those who have downloaded content, kept it on
their computer and share it again with the rest of the users. Flixxo allows true end users
to pay a fair price for watching licensed content in a friendly and safe environment.
Flixxo is an open network, a friendly and intuitive platform, a BitTorrent client, a token
and a wallet. As the network grows, so does its bandwidth and its storage space,
making it more efficient and able to handle more users. The more content is being
shared, the better bandwidth it will have for being distributed and streamed.
The content spreads across the network, and a final user gets it from many seeders at
the time. However, the payment channel is decentralized and the consumer is able to
pay directly to the producer, without any intermediary party being involved. The
content producer chooses whether he/she wants to share part of its earnings with the
network or not, and in which conditions he/she would do that.

An organic market for Flixx
A July 2017 report by the ad agency Jun Group examined value-exchange placements
for 15- and 30-second video ads in its network. (According to Jun Group, a valueexchange placement is a user-initiated digital ad placement that is viewed—or
engaged with—to unlock things like points, access to Wi-Fi, music or other digital
content.) This mechanism is mostly used on gaming platforms.

The firm found out that most people within its audience network in the US were

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

12

more likely to complete a video if they received some type of reward for doing so.

As we reach a critical-mass of users, brands will look for new opportunities of
advertising their products on Flixxo. We will offer them the chance to show their
sponsored content to our users if they give away Flixx. Then, users have four ways of
getting Flixx: by producing content, by buying those Flixx or getting it from friends, by
sharing content or by giving some seconds of their attention to sponsored content.

As advertisers pay incentives in Flixx to our users, they will have to reach contentcreators, who are the biggest stakeholders in the Flixxo ecosystem, and buy Flixx from
them, building-up an organic market and a healthy flow of Flixx.
Flixxo will take a Flixx commission of 10% on sponsored content, on an advertisement
market valued in more than $20B a year. Our team has expertise in developing AI use
cases, and we will use those skills in order to understand who our users are, based on
the content they have watched.

This is a fair distribution context for the revenues built on advertising, which tends to be
one of the biggest complaints of content producers on other platforms. Here, as Flixxo
Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

13

takes no fees on content, the revenues built on advertising go straight to the authors:
advertisers pay to the final user, who chooses which content to watch and to whom to
pass that revenue.
With 1 billion users, YouTube is the most popular platform in which the advertisement
model works. Taking the biggest piece of the market share, their revenues on ads are
about $6B a year. Duplicating this model, with 1 million users, Flixxo ́s net earnings on a
most effective model (both for advertisers and producers) would be around $10M a
year. By reaching 100 million users (like Netflix or Popcorn Time), the net ad revenues
for Flixxo would be $1B a year.

Scarcity, social engagement and legal content
Flixx is an asset backed on the ability to play videos or buy users’ attention on
advertisement. Also, Flixx is freely tradable and transferred without middle-parties
involved, paying only a very marginal fee in the form of gas for the Blockchain that runs
the basic token contract. In order for Flixx to have value outside the platform, they must
be felt as valuable within the platform.
The value of an asset is relative to its scarcity and its demand. With a fixed all-time
supply of one billion Flixx (1.000,000,000 Flixx), we count on scarcity as a way of social
engagement with the platform. Users need tokens in order to watch videos and
advertisers need them to get users’ attention on their sponsored content. What about
content producers? If they turn to be the largest stakeholders of the ecosystem, we
need to create incentives for them to hold on to their tokens instead of dumping them
into the markets. In addition, we need warranties on the content they make available
on the network. With this in mind, we devised a mechanism for locking Flixx on the
Distribution Contract. We will require a fixed amount of Flixx to be locked for a fixed
period of time when a user tracks his new content to the network, and a variable
amount set by the content producer as a bid for gaining visibility on the platform. Every
new content will have a grace period of seven days in which all earnings by the
producer will be locked, preventing withdrawal. One of the purposes of this is to help
prevent spam content. Also, the locked Flixx will serve as collateral in case of a dispute
for content ownership and license.

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

14

The optional variable bid will be locked on a user defined interval of time. The longer
that interval is, the more the relative value of the tokens. This means that 100 tokens
blocked for 3 months will be equivalent to 300 tokens blocked for one month. The
more value a producer is holding on his/her content, the more visibility it will have on
the platform (being placed on the top of the main page, etc.). Visibility will also be
granted to content with the highest community engagement (more seeders, better
rating).
Making producers decide whether to sell their tokens or hold them for granting
availability to their content on the network – just like users who have to decide whether
to trade their tokens or use them to watch videos – ensures scarcity and gives a
community engagement value to Flixx.

Multiple authors, one piece of content
There can be productions in which a content has multiple owners (such as
crowdfunded content or cooperative productions). Nowadays, a single producer
collects all the earnings and shares them with his team on a preset time-basis (such as
monthly payments). With Flixxo, multiple authors are able to set how to split the
payment for every single view of the content. It means that the uploader could set,
along with the price and the percentage of the earnings that will be shared with the
network, how to split the earnings on several addresses (for each of the producers’
teammates wallets).
Also, an author may set rules for others to produce derivative works, and decide how
the earnings will be split with the new co-author.

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

15

Uncensored content vs inappropriate content
Although there is no way for third parties (such as governments) to censor content –
which means that anyone has the chance of making any piece of media available on
the network – Flixxo will develop tools for filtering inappropriate content. Flixxo could
be a revolutionary tool for uncensorable and untraceable media, making it possible, for
example, for free independent journalism to have a voice even in social situations in
which there is a censorship environment, but it is necessary to assure that every user
gets the media he/she wants to watch and avoids the media he/she doesn’t. We know
there is a thin line between filtering or curating content and censorship, and it is a fact
that we have an open network for everyone to upload any content. However, Flixxo as a
platform will apply certain filtering based on clear rules – there should be a behaviorcode for uploaders in order to offer the right content to the right user. It is a two-way
deal, in which users agree to watch certain content and content producers serve that
kind of content (e.g. violent content not suitable for kids).
The curation will have a progressive decentralization and we will set a roadmap for
delivering this responsibility to the network, but at a first stage this will be a centralized
function of Flixxo. As we build up a solid network, we will rely this curation on the hands
of delegates elected by the community. This curation will have a cost, paid in Flixx, and
will be collected from the warranty blocked by the content uploaders.
Flixxo will not apply filters based on geographical location; however, these could be

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

16

applied by the author. It means that if the author decides that his/her piece will be
distributed worldwide it will reach every user in every location. He/she may also choose
to have his content only shown in certain areas or countries.

Flixxo White Label
As Flixxo is a network of users and authors who interact without intermediaries, that
network could serve multiple platforms (in addition to Flixxo). If the whole network (or
part of the network) chooses to help other platforms improvement, they have to be
rewarded with Flixx. It is like creating private channels and setting a reward on Flixx for
the distributors, who may or may not be able to watch the content they ́re distributing
or just act as peers.
A fee of 10% will be applied by Flixxo on behalf of the served network.

Platform Design
Flixxo’s development will include an app for smartphones and tablets, and also a
desktop and a web version. It will stream to the most popular cast products, such as
Chromecast, and will have an app for smart TV ́s.
The platform is being designed to be Frictionless.
There is no need of having Bitcoins (nor any other cryptocurrency) or a credit card in
order to start using Flixxo.
As the community of Flixxo users grows, Flixxo will seek to introduce additional
features whereby users will be able to offer goods or services that are associated with
the content available
Flixxo could be a killer application, with the potential of bringing a bunch of new users
to the cryptocurrencies ecosystem.
To have an incentive program that will decrease on time.
We will give away Flixx to the distributors. Incentives for seeding will result in incentives

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

17

for content creators. Early adopters, both distributors and creators, will be rewarded.
This will help develop a true decentralized network for content distribution, and will
attract authors for making their content available and choosing their own business
model.
To be easy to use and intuitive.
Anyone who had used any streaming service before will understand the platform in the
blink of an eye. There will be a learning curve for users to understand the use of the
Flixx token, and we will make this process as easy and friendly as possible.
To be a gaming and a social experience.
Gamification is the practice of applying game mechanics in non-game situations.
These typically include points, achievements, high score table and other trappings of
modern gaming. The game industry has spent a great deal of time refining what
makes a game engaging and entertaining, and applying these principles to other
business contexts. Then, earning Flixx and participating in the community has to be
seen as a game, there are benchmarks on your social engagement that will be
rewarded with incentives. It pushes members towards a behavior that benefits the
community. Tailoring the rewards set up for the Flixxo community can allow us to
reward things like good behavior, reaching a certain amount of shared videos, strong
contributions, inviting friends, posting material that receives positive feedback and
many other things. Providing both an extrinsic (such as merchandise, movie tickets,
etc.) and intrinsic (tokens) rewards for the behavior we want to see is a great way to
build a positive community culture.

Go-to-Market Strategy: how we will reach our
first 1M users
“The disconnect between internet fame and financial security is hard to comprehend
for both creators and fans,” states YouTuber Gaby Dunn on her blog post Get Rich or
Die Vlogging. She runs a YouTube channel that serves more than 2M views a month,
and faces a hard reality: She can ́t make a living out of that. She continues “Platforms
like YouTube mirror the U.S. economy’s yawning wealth gap, and being a part of

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

18

YouTube’s “middle class” often means grappling daily with the cognitive dissonance of
a full comments section and an empty wallet”.
It is another story for YouTube personalities such as a gamer Pewdiepie, who makes a
monthly profit of $4M out of his 56M followers, or a fashion vlogger Michelle Phan who
often raises more than 250K a month backed on her 9M followers.
Just like Gaby Dunn, there are thousands of vloggers “too visible to have “real”
jobs, but too broke not to.”
Flixxo will subsidize their shows (on a co-production model), allocating batches of $5K
to $20K for covering production budgets, allowing them to try our platform in
exchange for their original content. By Inviting 20 YouTubers followed by 50K to 200K
fans each, we could easily bring a bunch of fresh users to Flixxo.
During the first three to six months, access to Flixxo will be granted by invitation.
Having the responsibility of deploying good quality video and satisfying content
demand, we must control the flow of users until reaching a massive amount of media.
On the side of the incentives and economics of the platform, such a mechanism will
allow us to reward with Flixx those users who invited new active users.

How it works – Using Flixx token on Flixxo
Meet Jean-Paul. He is a French director and producer, and he has decided to give Flixxo
a chance. He has connected his computer to Flixxo and has told the network he had
made available his last movie, called “French Toast” in high quality and with options on
subtitles in many languages. He has set a price of 100 Flixx (Flixxo tokens) and has
offered to share 50% of his earnings with the network. He has also set a warranty of
5000 Flixx blocked for two weeks in the Distribution Smart Contract.
Otto, a guy in Finland, has been looking for Jean-Paul ́s new film without success on his
streaming app, and then on BitTorrent networks, where he had only found a bad
quality copy of the movie dubbed to Russian with Spanish subtitles, and got his
computer infested with some funny viruses. Otto sends those 100 Flixx straight to JeanPaul and enjoys a great quality copy of the movie, streaming French Toast from his cell
phone straight to his TV using a Chromecast device.

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

19

Even though Jean-Paul has already earned his first 100 Flixx, those funds will be
controlled by the Distribution Smart Contract and will be held for seven days, in order
to assure there are no licensing conflicts nor disputes.
After watching French Toast, Otto decided to seed it (in fact he was seeding it from the
moment he had downloaded a single piece of it). Lionel in Argentina is also looking for
French Toast. Lionel has no credit card so he can ́t pay for a subscription on the most
popular streaming platforms. A friend of his invited him to participate in the network,
and sent him a welcome reward of 100 Flixx. Lionel is keen to pay straightly those 100
Flixx to his favorite French director. In this case, as there is – along with Jean-Paul –
another seeder from which Lionel is downloading the movie, Jean-Paul shares 50% of
its earnings with both seeders. By now Jean-Paul has already earned 175 Flixx and Otto
has 25 Flixx for watching new content.

Now Otto wants to watch Jeannine ́s content. She ́s a famous YouTuber with a lot of
followers (really, A LOT) but she is tired of the unfair revenue model of that platform.
She has already allocated her content on the Flixxo network, setting a price of 30 Flixx
per view and sharing 75% of her earnings with the network (although this amount
might sound a little bit too generous, she will earn much more per view than on any
other platform). As Jeannine has a partner who shoots and edits her videos, they have
decided to split the revenues 60%-40% straight on the Distribution Smart Contract.
Since Otto doesn’t have enough Flixx for watching the content he wants, and he

Flixxo, Community based video distribution.

20

doesn't want to buy more Flixx nor wait to earn more credits by sharing Jean-Paul ́s
movie, he asks for Sponsored Content.
Mr. Fox is the Marketing Director of a car manufacturing company in Germany. They
spend millions of dollars each year on digital advertisement, and they have found that
the actual models are not working anymore. More and more, consumers use adblockers or they skip video ads as fast as possible on most of the platforms. Mr. Fox has
heard of the new model of Flixxo, and gives it a try. Elizabeth has been publishing her
videos long enough on the platform – so she already has a lot of Flixx – and Mr. Fox
reaches her in order to buy her tokens for his Ad campaign. He pays 1ETH for 33,000
Flixx (1 Flixx=$0,01), setting a market price for Flixxo ́s token.
Advertisers spend an average $0,10 per an effective and complete view of their content.
Content creators reach only a small portion of that amount, as there are a lot of
intermediaries (cut of the platform, taxes, exchanges).
Mr. Fox – along with other advertisers – sets an organic and fair price for Flixx tokens,
creating a real market. Not a speculative one.
Back to Otto; he has asked for sponsored content and gives 30 seconds of his attention
to Mr. Fox new commercial. At the end, Mr. Fox gives away 9 Flixx to Otto as a reward,
and pays a commission of 10% to the platform (0.9 Flixx) He has spent $0,10 for a more
effective way of showing his AD.
Now Otto has reached 34 Flixx and is able to watch Jeannine ́s new video on Flixxo.
Furthermore, he is really interested in buying a new car. Even though Jeannine has
given away 75% of her earnings to the community (distributors), she (and his partner)
had earned 7,5 Flixx for this unique view. Set the price on $0,01 per Flixx, she has earned
USD 0,075, which is seven times the average $0,01 she would have earned on YouTube.

Flixx token generation event and sale
Flixx is an ERC20 standard token. The supply will be fixed at the beginning and no
mining — or any kind of token creation — will be possible after the initial contract
setup.

As Flixx is a token needed in order to use Flixxo platform, the purpose of the presale is to grant priority and early access to those who participated in the event.
Flixx tokens are not an equity representation of the company.

A total of 900,000,000 (nine hundred million) Flixx tokens will be issued. A maximum of
200,000,000 (two hundred million) tokens will be sold. Some of these tokens (not more
than 33% or 66,000,000 Flixx) may be sold with anticipation of the token allocation
event to strategic investors.

Flixxo Token Sale (ICO) will start on OCTOBER 24th, 2017 14:00hs CET. Crowdsale
will run for 30 days.
DEPOSIT ADDRESS WILL BE ONLY DISPLAYED AT http://www.flixxo.com/ and
http://www.icofunding.com/

Flixx price will be set at a fixed rate of 1 Flixx = 0,00025 ETH (1 ETH = 4000 Flixx). Hard
Cap is set in tokens (200M) With the bonus rates applied on the first days of ICO we
expect to have a Cap of around 35K ETH. With that sum we would be able to develop
the platform, incentivize the production of original content and deploy a worldwide
marketing strategy.
Minimum CAP of 5,000 ETH would let us develop the platform, incentivize content and
build up a digital marketing and communication campaign. In case of not reaching the
soft cap, all the funds will be returned.

TOKENS NOT SOLD AT THE TOKEN SALE EVENT WILL BE BURNED.
Tokens will be sent immediately to the same ETH address from which the
contribution has been made, but they will remain locked until November 24th.
Tokens from the Presale will be sent on November 24th and will be released
together with ICO tokens.

ICO Bonus Program
Bonus for early adopters are offered to incentivize participation in the token sale.

From day 8to day 14 — 20% bonus (1 ETH = 4800 Flixx)
From day 15 to day 21 — 15% bonus (1 ETH = 4600 Flixx)
From day 22 to day 30 — 10% bonus (1 ETH = 4400 Flixx)

Distribution of tokens
Flixx 200,000,000 (two hundred million Flixx) will be sold and distributed over the
Token Sale.
Flixx 100,000,000 (one hundred million Flixx), will be allotted for the development team,
vested proportionally in two years.
100,000,000 (one hundred million Flixx) will remain for the company (Flixxo Limited,
Gibraltar), covering the costs of the Token Allocation Event, advisors, bounty program,
and future partnerships with authors. Tokens allocated for partnerships are only
intended to be set as a warranty for uploaded content and are not to be cashed out. As
authors need tokens in order to upload content, these tokens will be seen as a lean
while they earn more tokens from further contributions.
Flixx 500,000,000 (five hundred million Flixx) will be distributed in a predefined and
regulated manner via smart contract as an incentive for users and contributors to join
the platform. Those incentives will decrease to zero over the first ten years and will be
given away to users who join the platform and share content, as well as a reward for
reaching certain social goals (basically as a way of building a strong community).

Conclusion
In the next five years, hundreds of authors will find Flixxo as an option for distributing
and monetizing their content. This new income source will allow a smarter audiovisual
market as the new artists and producers will be able to develop rich content and
distribute it by their rules. New business models will emerge for both content creators
and advertisers/affiliates. The smaller producer will be able to play on an even field with
the biggest companies, by making their production competitive on a usually closed
market, choosing the price of their content or sharing more revenues with the
community – the more earnings they share, the more seeders their content will have.
Big players will also find a platform (or a network) where they can monetize content
that tends to be seeked on illegal networks. Piracy will not disappear, but it will
decrease as users will get away from non-incentivized BitTorrent networks. More
spectators will be able to reach the content they are really looking for.

Smart contracts are not just for banks and money – license agreements are
contracts and licenses are a value that can be attached to such contracts.
There are more than 1 billion people downloading and streaming content on their
computers, TV ́s and phones every day. Flixxo will develop a social economy for
bringing them all together.
