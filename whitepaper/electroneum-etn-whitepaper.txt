Electroneum, built on its own blockchain, has been developed with the explicit intention of
gaining mass adoption via the 2.2 billion smart phone users. It launches via a token sale on
September 14th and represents a unique opportunity.
The cryptocurrency market, once
so clearly dominated by Bitcoin, has
become fractured and catalysed by
the introduction of new thinking
and new technology. Electroneum
represents another vast leap
forward; it offers purchasers the
opportunity to become an early
adopter of what is likely to be a
significantly disruptive technology.
Where previously cryptocurrency
usage has been almost entirely
the domain of speculators and
the tech-savvy, Electroneum is set
to become the first digital coin to
enter common usage due to its
groundbreaking ease-of-use for the
ordinary mobile user.
Key points of difference for
Electroneum include the following:
• Maximum coin volume of
21 billion, which will mean

transactions have only two
decimal places and have a ‘real
money’ feel that Bitcoin lacks.
• Electroneum wallets can easily be
managed on a smartphone, and
the coins can be generated by the
unique mobile miner running as a
background activity.

behind Electroneum and the
enormous opportunity in
September’s token sale.

• It enables very fast microtransactions and currency can
be transferred between different
apps, games and users.
• It relies on its own purpose-built
blockchain, unlike many other
currencies launched in 2017 so far.
• It has a single-minded

Electroneum

Introduction

Electroneum is a cryptocurrency (see “A simple explanation of cryptocurrencies” on page 19) or “alt coin”. It’s
pronounced “ehlek-troh-nee-um”.
It is named after the electron which all cryptocurrencies rely on.
Electroneum is the first cryptocurrency that is designed around mobile ubiquity.
To put it another way, it is designed for the estimated 2 billion smart phone users around the world.

Planned for summer 2017.

Electroneum is being developed by Electroneum Ltd, which comprises of a small foundation team of 10 people who all started as members of Retortal, and have
worked together for over 3 years. Mostly comprised of coders and developers, you’ll also find an expert at cryptography and an astrophysicist on the team. The
development takes place in the Retortal offices in Kent in the United Kingdom.
Due to the open source nature of our development, the progress and direction of Electroneum is not fully contained within Electroneum Ltd, however our core team
will play an enormous role in shaping, nurturing and developing Electroneum during its early adoption.

A simple explanation of

Electroneum is a complementary
currency that has been developed
to allow anyone, regardless of
technical ability, easy access to
a cryptocurrency. Within a few
minutes of installing the mobile app
any user can see Electroneum being
added to their wallet via the unique
mobile mining experience. Nearly all
cryptocurrencies are “mined” with
specialist equipment. Electroneum
can be obtained via the mobile
mining experience on the app.
We’ve developed a fully functioning
crypto coin with some very
unique features. We’ve identified
multiple enormous markets and
we’ve created a free Apple and
Android app that allows us to start
penetrating those markets from
day one after the token sale (31st
October 2017).

Even though Electroneum utilizes
a tried and tested blockchain (the
same blockchain model as the 9th
largest cryptocurrency by market
capitalization - Monero, and the
12th largest - Bytecoin 1) it has been
developed to have some unique
features which make it far more
accessible for the average person.

Breaking down the barriers to
cryptocurrency entry
Current cryptocurrencies are new
(relatively!) and exciting, but beyond
the reach of your everyday person.
To access cryptocurrencies you have
to make or buy a G.P.U. mining rig
or send copies of your passport and
personal documents to a website that
you have probably never heard of.
Electroneum has all the great security
and anonymity of the leading crypto
coins but it’s controlled by a free,
easy to install app, which
gives instant access to
Electroneum with no
card details or ID.

The Electroneum app also lets you
manage your wallet and send or
receive Electroneum in a secure way.

Mining Electroneum coins from
your phone
Installing the free Electroneum app
(Apple or Android) immediately
gives the user the ability to start
gaining Electroneum in their wallet.
All the time the app is live (even
in background mode) it will be
running the unique
app based crypto
mining experience,
which requires ZERO
technical knowledge.

Overview

The Electroneum Token

Electroneum Market
Context
A simple explanation of
cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies often have
relatively low coin numbers.
For instance, Bitcoin only has a
maximum of 21 million coins.
What this means is that the whole
coins tend to have a large value
and thus real world transactions
for small amounts of money tend
to look rather strange to humans.
We are quite used to swapping
coins for things, but if you bought
a can of Coke with Bitcoin at the
moment (June 2016) you would pay
something like 0.000391 Bitcoin.
This is not a very “human” number.
We have made Electroneum’s
blockchain have 21 billion coins,
which will move the decimal places
forwards.
Electroneum only uses two decimal
places. Everyone is familiar with
a payment system that uses two
decimal places, and it sits more
comfortably with them. We believe
this will encourage adoption rates,
and make transactions easier to
understand and easier to perform

mental calculations with. It’s easier
to tell someone that the price of an
item is 345.67 Electroneum than it is
to say 0.01374 Bitcoin.
With Electroneum that same can of
Coke would cost 99 Electroneum.
That looks a lot more like a human
currency, right?

Easier to mine, easier to
understand.
With Electroneum’s supply of 21
billion coins we’ve made it easier
to mine whole coins and pay with
whole coins. Our studies of non
crypto-literate users showed that
they prefer to see a whole number
in their wallet than fractions of a
coin.
When people in our test groups
saw they were getting coins in their
wallet by leaving the app running,
they rated the experience higher
than when we tested the experience
with fractions of a coin appearing.

followed Bitcoins model would be
very disappointing.
We have deliberately avoided using
a blockchain that can be mined with
super powerful ASICs (the way all
Bitcoin are mined) and created a
blockchain that can be mined with
CPUs, which enables the AVERAGE
person to get involved.
See the Electroneum Technical
White Paper from http://
Electroneum.com for a technical
description of how the Electroneum

to promote CPU mining, which
average users have access to and
reduce the heavy industry approach
of mining that takes place in the
Bitcoin market, and reduce the

become synonymous with Ethereum

The cryptocurrency, crypto tokens and other digital assets based
on blockchain technology are currently experiencing an explosive
growth period.
Blockchain technology allows the first true internationalisation
of a store of value, and recently the adoption rate has meant
explosive growth in both adoption and speculative value.
2017 started with Bitcoin as the number one cryptocurrency with
a market capitalization of 12 billion US dollars. Ethereum, a very
young upstart of a currency was valued at just 700 million USD.
The explosive start to 2017 has seen Bitcoin surge to a market
capitalization of over 40 billion USD and Ethereum has caught up
at an incredible pace and now has a market capitalization of over
28 billion USD.
The market is excited by the opportunities that blockchain
technology and decentralization of currency present.
There are over 800 alternative crypto currencies trading today,
with a new use case for blockchain emerging every week.
Investors need to think carefully before choosing a project to
ensure the team, the technology and the idea are sound.

Blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies are disruptive
and are growing at an exponential rate (https://www.
technologyreview.com/s/607947/the-cryptocurrency-market-isgrowing-exponentially/).
We believe that Electroneum as a new, easy to access
cryptocurrency, will appeal to regular people in larger numbers
than we’ve seen with existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and
Ethereum.
As such, we think that Electroneum will have great appeal for:
• Long-term holders. Those who wish to buy and hold
Electroneum for any potential future value.
• Cryptocurrency enthusiasts wishing to be involved in the
development of the next evolutionary step of the digital coin
market.

Gamers are constantly seeking the
new and following what’s on trend.
The app based Electroneum virtual
currency exchange will allow gamers

to transfer some of their hard work
and time from one game to a new
game by enabling them to monetize
their “in-play” virtual currencies and
take them with them into the real
world. At the same time the game
company develops an exit based
revenue stream and an additional
introductory revenue stream (as
they take commission on entry and
exit of the game).
There are over 2.2 billion gamers in
the world.1
The average lifecycle of a mobile
game includes nearly 80% of its
userbase migrating away from it
within two months after intense
use.2

leave it in search of something else.
In a nutshell, Electroneum will allow
people to keep the value of their
hard work from within one game
and transfer it into their next game.
The game companies will be
incentivized to allow this by sharing
the profit from the BID/ASK spread
(the price difference between
buying and selling), allowing them to
monetize people leaving and further
monetize people joining the game.

More importantly for Electroneum, it
is not just revenue that is increasing.
The user (gamer) numbers are
increasing even more rapidly
with mobile gaming and social
games such as MMOG (massively
multiplayer online game) gaming
responsible for most of that growth.

The computer games industry has
grown steadily year on year and
is variously predicted to reach
between US $90 billion and US $128
billion by 2020.3

Context
A simple explanation of
cryptocurrencies

More than 48% of gamers are now
choosing social games.2
Only 1.9% of gamers make inapp purchases, leaving gaming
companies looking for alternative
ways to monetize players.3

Existing Virtual Currencies
A large percentage of social games
and MMOGs use internal credits
or some form of game based
virtual currency within their virtual
economy.4
Games rely on “money like” credits
or direct virtual currencies (such as
Farmville Dollars or Tencent’s QQ
coins). Some games, such as the
hugely popular World of Warcraft,
which has over 12m subscribers
use a number of different virtual
currencies from relatively obvious
ones such as “brawlers gold” and
“coins of air” to more poetically
named “bloody coins” and “dalaran
Jewelcrafter’s tokens”. What they
all have in common is that they can

all be seen as an in-play store of
value, and just like the real world,
the harder it is to obtain the virtual
currency, the larger its in-game
value.

Current Market for Virtual
Currency Exchange
A black market of unregulated “gold
farmers”5 has developed, nearly
always against the game company’s
terms and conditions, that enables
people that don’t have the time
commitments or skills required to
acquire enough virtual currency
within the game to make external
purchases of virtual currencies with
tangible or hard currencies.

Virtual currency market size
and activity
This black market for virtual
currencies is supported by portals
such as www.g2g.com which enables
people to purchase in-game virtual
currencies for fixed dollar prices.
Game companies have no input into
the way the current unregulated
market operates, and make no
profit from the sale of their virtual
currencies and virtual items.

Since the game companies are
not involved, the system for taking
the payment and delivering the
virtual currency to the new owner is
extremely fragile, and fraught with
uncertainty. The original currency
owner has to agree to meet the new
owner within the game somewhere,
and then drop the virtual currency
or item on to the virtual floor, giving
a few moments to pick them up.
Most gamers would be unaware of
black market sites like www.g2g.
com or worried about using them
for many reasons, such as providing
credit card details to black market
operators and relying on the seller
to arrange to meet within the game.

The Electroneum Token

Electroneum Market
Context
A simple explanation of
cryptocurrencies

By getting some game companies to
integrate directly with our exchange,
there will be no risk to players and
far more exposure of the ability to
trade virtual currencies, as the game
companies will have a financial
incentive to monetize players exit
from the game.
There are no published figures for
the size of the market for in-game
currencies, however figures from
2008 in China alone placed the
figure at several billion Yuan per
year (US $450 million).
Game companies adopting the
Electroneum exchange platform
would grow this market significantly.

allowing players to fast track
their progress within the games
by purchasing virtual currencies
or virtual items for fixed dollar
amounts themselves, this has
slowed the black market operators,
but has not prevented it because
players cannot cash in their old
items with the game companies
when they decide to leave the
game, but they are left with a virtual
commodity that they can sell on the
black market.
If the game company had integrated
with the Electroneum virtual
currency exchange, a number of
things would happen:
1. The player would have a market
to sell their virtual currency on
(into Electroneum coins)

Game companies selling
virtual goods and currencies
direct

2. The game company would earn
commission (in Electroneum)
on the sale

Mobile games struggle more than
online games, with only 1.9% of
players opting to make in-app
purchases.1 Around 75% of MMOG
(massively multiplayer online game)
companies have already started

3. The player would be free to
hold their coins until they
entered a new game, whereby
they could buy new virtual
currency or items with their
Electroneum.

4. The game company would
also earn commission on
the purchase side of virtual
currency allowing them
to monetize the front end
acquisition of players in
addition to any game purchase
price.

Risk to game companies
The game companies that are
already selling their own virtual
commodities for cash might not
want to integrate with Electroneum
as it would reduce that market (not
eliminate it), as players would be
bringing some value from another
game.

Benefits to game companies
However, game companies that
have currently not adopted that
model would benefit from multiple
things:
1. A new entry and exit revenue
stream

we have taken note of and used in

Even game companies that are
currently monetizing their in-play
virtual currencies by taking credit
card payments for currency and
virtual items have been willing to
engage in further discussion.
Game companies in general
appear to accept that blockchain
technologies are coming and they
need to embrace them rather than
ignore them.

This increases the likelihood of
Electroneum becoming the defacto
cryptocurrency for use within
the virtual currency world, and
discourages competition.

The gaming market is not slow to
catch on to a new market and you
will find many gaming companies
in all gaming sectors that accept
Bitcoin.
The problem that they are facing is
the difficulty of obtaining Bitcoins in
the first place.
To obtain Bitcoins for local cash you
have to:
1. Have a bank account.
2. Send copies of your passport
and personal documents to a
website that you have probably
never heard of.
3. Make an international transfer
of funds, which probably
involves sitting down in your
bank and paying a US $30
fee for making the overseas
transfer.

Opening up enormous new
gaming markets
Over 2 billion people in the world
do not have a bank account (https://
letstalkpayments.com/39-of-the-

worlds-population-does-not-have-abank-account/ ).
This is a market that gaming
companies are desperate to access,
but up until now have been unable to.
This market literally cannot make a
digital payment of any kind.
Many developing nations, especially
India and China are of huge interest
to the gaming companies.
Developing countries are
experiencing huge growth
in internet access, mostly by
smartphone. Over 54% of people
in developing countries have some
form of internet access (http://
www.pewglobal.org/2016/02/22/
smartphone-ownership-andinternet-usage-continues-to-climbin-emerging-economies/).
This is a stark contrast from the
number of people with bank
accounts, and shows that there are
hundreds of millions of people who
have internet access but no bank
account.

These people could, in theory, enjoy
the digital gaming market if they
could obtain Bitcoin.
Electroneum solves this problem by
allowing the accumulation of funds
by mobile mining, which means it
could be used for gaming.
Winnings can be paid back to the
users wallet address, allowing
them to play and carry out other
transactions in Electroneum.
The gaming company profit in
Electroneum will be exchangeable
by the gaming company into USD via
a digital asset exchange like Kraken,
Bittrex, Poloniex.

Gaming Market Feedback
We have a consultant on board
from the gaming industry who has
shown the Electroneum concept to a
number of gaming companies with
international interests. The feedback
has been overwhelmingly positive
and we will be taking this project
forwards after the token sale.

A simple explanation
of cryptocurrencies

Imagine a world without money.
Not easy to do. We’ve lived with
money in some form or other
since civilisation began. Money is
a way of storing your hard work in
a convenient way to exchange for
someone else’s hard work.
We’re so used to money in its
modern day form that we don’t
spend much time thinking about it
as a concept.
Modern fiat currencies such as
the US Dollar and the Great British
Pound are based on trust. These
traditional currencies are no longer
backed by anything (the gold
standard ended in the US in 1971
and the UK in 1931). Trust works
well in very large, stable, economies,
however most of the world is made
up of poor countries with less stable
economies.
When a government is short of
money, it is awfully tempting to print
some more.

The problem with printing more
money is that the store of value
is decreased with the increase
of supply. If you don’t already
know about hyperinflation then
Google the “Weimar Republic
Hyperinflation” or “Zimbabwe
hyperinflation” to see what happens
to a currency when too much is
printed.

Electronic Currency
Traditional currencies are made
of paper and metal, however in
most developed nations people
can exchange these currencies
between themselves electronically
by relying on a third party (a bank)
to store ledgers of the money. The
bank stores a digital number (the
amount of currency one person
has) and they inform another bank
that some of that money has been
sent to someone else. One ledger is
decreased and another increased.
All of the existing digital exchange of
money is done by third party trust in
banks.

The concept of a
cryptocurrency is not just
a way to transfer money
between people, it is an
entirely new way of thinking
about money.
The reason we currently need banks
to make digital transfers is because
of something called the Double
Spending Problem. All digital things
can be copied. You’ve heard of the
film industry suffering from pirated
movies. The film industry has spent
years and many millions of dollars
trying to prevent it, but they have
failed. Digital things can be copied.
This means that in the past, any
digital currency suffered from the
ability of users to “print more of it”.
The double spending problem is
solved by cryptocurrency, and in
solving it, has opened up a radical
new way of thinking about store of
value, trust and convenience.
Before you dismiss this and think
“banks do a perfectly good job, we
don’t need this” remember that

A simple explanation
of cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are not controlled
by an any organisation or individual.
We currently rely on banks to
keep that ledger up to date. If the
bank goes bust with our money
on their ledger then we might
well say goodbye to the money.
Certainly the bank will charge you
(or the receiving party) for digitally

is open source. This means that
everyone who is using the currency
is controlling the currency, but
there is nobody in charge. The
cryptocurrency manages itself.
This sounds fantastically
complicated – and it is, however just
as you don’t need to understand
how an iPhone works to gain great
benefit from it, the same is true
of cryptocurrencies, and they are
getting more accessible with each
forward step of the technology.
Electroneum is one such step.

With a cryptocurrency everyone
who uses the currency has a copy
of the ledger. No one person or
organisation is in control of the
ledger.
All the currency rules and
regulations are clearly defined
and the currency system itself

A simple explanation

Being able to transfer money to
someone else without having to
use a bank dramatically reduces
the complexity and increases the
speed of international transfers. This
makes international trade easier
and cheaper.
With the amount of fraud that
is reported online people are
fearful of entering their financial
information to make purchases,
especially for small, low cost
items. Cryptocurrencies can be
anonymous, and protect the payor
and payee.
There are over a billion people in
the world that do not have access to
a bank, and yet they have access to
the internet. There are over 2 billion
people in the world without a bank
account, and mobile devices and
internet access is growing fast.

Why use a cryptocurrency?
Store value securely, privately and
digitally.

Move that money around the world
almost instantly with zero cost.

There are over 210 million people
who use PayPal to make internet
transactions 1 – even though they
have a working bank card that they
could use to make the payment
directly. They chose PayPal for
additional security and convenience.
Cryptocurrencies offer a high level
of security and anonymity without
requiring a bank to be involved.
