The number of coins is limited

There will only be 20 million Steneum coins worldwide.
This resembles an economic system based on deflation
and increasing supply coin. Steneum prices will rise as
demand grows and the number of coin remains.
Steneum is not controlled by institutions

Steneum uses a Blockchain database that is
not controlled by any party. This system
allowing digital information to be distributed
but not copied. It has no single point of
failure. All transactions are recorded live,
transparent, and spread across multiple servers.

more usd 7000, Steneum provides a
great benefit because the price is still
very cheap and you will get an
opportunity to get an ICO price .

2.1 Algotrithm Scrypt

Scrypt is used in many cryptocurrencies as a proof-of-work
algorithm. It was first implemented in Tenebrix (released in
September 2011) and served as the basis for Litecoin and
Dogecoin, which also adopted its scrypt algorithm. Mining of
cryptocurrencies that use scrypt is often performed on graphics
processing units (GPUs) since GPUs tend to have significantly
more processing power compared to the CPU.

A Unique Saving program
Unlike other coins, the steneum is unique. It’s a real project that generates real
benefit for the team and investors. Steneum does not use fiat like $ (USD) on
Saving program, so if you save 1000 STN, you will get back 1000 STN not
$1000.
The daily commission that will be distributed every day comes from Bitsten
market income,
Take an example, you save 1000 STN during the contract period when the price
at $1. When the contract is completed and the current price is $5 then you can
sell 1000*$5 worth STN. The daily commission that will be distributed every day
comes from Bitsten market income
When the Saving contract is completed you can withdraw Steneum or renew
your contract at will
You can save all the coin in your wallet. All the coins in the Saving program then
will be stored in Bitsten market and will not be traded. The purpose of this
System is to diminish the coin circulating in the market. The scarcity will raise the
STN price in the market
For example, 20 million of STN supply has been circulated with 8 million of them
in public (such as mining, bounty and ICO) and 5 million coins on Saving. It
means that the coin circulation on exchange is 3 million
This scarcity will significantly escalate STN price, the fewer coin circulate the
more price increasing will happen

Steneum.com

The amount of coin in Saving program will not exceed the number of coins in
public and the commission of each coin comes from clearly trusted source.
By applying this system there will be no money game takes place on Steneneum
Saving Program.
Steneum is created to support bitsten.com exchange project, it is used to pay
trading fee or enlist new coin and as profit from trading fee on market bitsten.
Saving Program is Fluctuated depends on total coin Saving and market bitsten
volume.
Formula calculation of profit Saving
Daily profit each 1 STN = (MV * FEE *20%) / Total STN on Saving
Example
MV (market bitsten.com volume) = 2000 BTC
FEE market bitsten.com
= 0.3%
Total STN on Saving
=2,000,000
2000*0.003*0.2
2000000

= 0.00000060 BTC each STN per Day

With this estimation if STN price is 0.00005000, the daily Saving profit is 1.2%.
The daily profit Saving results can change according to the number of Saving
and volume market, t h e more bitsten.com market volume the more profit
generated.
