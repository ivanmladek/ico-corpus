Executive summary
Mobilink Coin to Revolutionize Cell Phone Industry with Blockchain Technology!
Technology moves at an incredible pace. Twenty years ago, barely any of us could imagine the world we live in today.
But some visionaries eventually saw the world using the Internet for buying products and interacting with others. The
skeptics, however, predicted that the Internet was too complex, and was for scientists and geeks.
An oft-overlooked catalyst in the technological work we live in today is the smartphone. The advent of the smartphone
changed everything: we walk around with small super-computers in our pockets, with access to all of human knowledge
at our fingertips. We can book a vacation, make free voice and video calls over data, order a pizza, get a professional
consultation, and everything in between.
Technological leaps of this magnitude come in various ways and only arise every decade or so. If the World Wide Web
was the ‘90s, then 2000s were shaped by the advent of the smartphone and slowly moving from a web economy to an
app economy. The Blockchain is the next disrupter, perhaps as disruptive as the smartphone was more than ten years
ago—and it is in the process of disrupting everything from food safety to banking to voting systems. With the
Blockchain, organizations are either excited by the infinite potential, or worried about their market share. We are happy
to be in the former camp, looking ahead at this technology’s amazing potential to reshape our world.
Mobilink is set to disrupt both the mobile advertising and telecommunications industries by using Blockchain
technology, allowing consumers to use their phones and roam seamlessly around the world at no cost, while offering
advertisers an opportunity to get a better return-on-investment for their dollars.
The current status-quo is that there are two large companies who control the bulk of mobile advertising – and in the
process they have made the end-user the product. In telecommunications, large organizations still control a significant
portion of the market and have shifted from charging for SMS messages to charging exorbitant roaming costs and
subjecting users to unnecessary data caps.
We want to change the status-quo in the advertising and telecommunications industries – the time has come to disrupt
them. Our mission is to be a catalyst of positive change in these industries, while allowing the end-user to benefit by
providing unlimited talk, data, and text anywhere in the world. We will also give Mobilink SIM card users the potential to
earn monthly ad revenue – sharing some of the advertising wealth generated with the end-user.

Company information
Mobilink Coin: Based in Manilla, the Philippines: ICO manager, promoter and creator. Responsible for fundraising,
marketing, and token issuance once ICO is complete. This entity will develop the mobile applications and advertising
exchange platform.

Current State of the Telecom industry
The telecom industry has been consistently growing over the last decade while trying to cope with the explosion of data
usage. Users in the US are looking at their mobile phones more than 9 billion times a day. Smartphone penetration is
growing faster than ever, even with the older age groups which have been slow to adopt the technology.
Telecommunication is the backbone of every single form of voice and data transmission which includes but not
limited to the internet, voice communication and broadcasting. It is one of the largest industries in the world, with
annual revenues exceeding 6 trillion dollars. There are almost 5 billion smartphone users and over 8 billion
smartphones in circulation today worldwide that use voice, text and data.
The need for better, more reliable services puts a huge strain on capital expenditures as most processes are still
performed manually and setting up new infrastructure is extremely expensive. Blockchain technologies bring many
solutions to the table:
Identity management and fraud detection
Fraud detection is important in most industries and global telecommunications is no exception. The current annual cost
for fraud in the industry is $38 billion and it is top of mind for telecommunications providers to find reliable solutions to
establish identity. Roaming fraud occurs because there are inefficiencies in the systems interlinking the providers. With
the Blockchain, a simple smart contract deployment can help establish a trust relationship between the user and the
network, instantly validating their roaming rights and ensuring the provider gets paid.
Cost reduction through automation
Roaming consists of using a mobile phone on a different carrier than the one the user is registered with, usually in a
different country. Once the identity of the user is confirmed, roaming goes through a validation process between
different carriers, usually involving multiple third-parties. With the Blockchain, carriers may be able to automate and
simplify functions like roaming, without involving multiple third parties to verify identity and validate roaming rights.
This allows the provider to offer a faster, more reliable service to the user while reducing costs.
Enabling micro-transactions for digital assets
Perhaps the most audacious and most disruptive thing that Blockchain can bring to the telecom world is to help enable
micro-transactions for the purchase of digital assets. The Blockchain and crypto-currencies allow for almost
instantaneous payments of any size with very low or no transactional fees. This would cut out another middle man
(banks and credit card processors) while allowing users to benefit from a global economy for digital assets like video
games, rewards points, music and movies.
Current state of mobile & digital advertising
Digital advertising is a $220 billion global industry with relatively few players. More specifically, mobile advertising is
controlled by Facebook and Google as they own more than 50% of the market (according to the most conservative
estimates). This leaves little room for smaller competing advertising firms, and allows the two large players to dictate
the pricing.
The Blockchain has already started disrupting the advertising market as it helps solve a multitude of problems and opens
new possibilities at the same time. Currently, advertisers collect money from those who want to advertise and send ads
to the eventual consumer. This has been the only viable option, but it comes with a host of issues that need to be
solved.
5

Mobilink.io Whitepaper
Simplifying the process
The current process is too complex and companies do not always get what they pay for. Some organizations have
started to cut out the middleman to directly build their own advertising exchanges. The Blockchain will help enhance
this process, adding more transparency and eventually eliminating the ad buying process all together—allowing the
advertiser to pay the end-user directly to view ads.
Trust, Trust, Trust
Once data enters the Blockchain, it can never be changed, and since there is no central entity controlling the Blockchain,
immutability is guaranteed. The advertising industry is plagued by fake profiles, artificial impressions, fake clicks and
fake followers on Instagram and Twitter. Advertising fraud is set to cost the industry almost $20 billion in 2018. With the
Blockchain, companies can make sure a real user is looking at their ad, and the data can never be manipulated by
hackers and fraudsters.
Allowing the user to benefit
Once trust is established, the Blockchain may end up disrupting the system completely—allowing the consumer to verify
their identity directly to the product being advertised and setting their own advertising preferences. This completely
removes the need for a middle man, and allows the user to benefit by either being directly paid to view ads, or to use
the advertising revenue they generate to pay for a service.

Blockchain Technologies for Telecom and Advertising

6

Mobilink.io Whitepaper
Advertisers and Telecom providers spend very large amounts of money to establish trust and identification – usually
with the help of more than one third party. Global roaming agreements are an example of such a process. With a digital
distributed ledger and a trustless structure, the Blockchain can help eliminate most, if not all third parties.
And as it is irreversible and auditable, the Blockchain provides advertisers what they have been looking for: a simple
inexpensive way to make sure that they are interacting with a person on the other side, and not an advanced program
building fake profiles and getting fake impressions.

Using the Blockchain in a telecom environment for creating an ID and performing authentication:

Mobilink.io Whitepaper

Introduction to Mobilink
The Blockchain is set to disrupt the telecom and advertising industries significantly. As discussed above, many Blockchain
technologies will give the user more power, either by selecting the ads they view or by paying them to view ads as part
of a digital economy based on cryptocurrency.
Mobilink wants to bring back power to the consumer and cut out the many middle-men in advertising and telecom at
the same time. Our goal is to create a digital economy of Mobilink tokens which will be earned by viewing ads, and will
in turn be used to pay for mobile services. Global mobile users are currently paying tens of billions of dollars per month
in subscription fees, while advertising giants like Google and Facebook make billions of dollars by monopolizing the
advertising market and controlling the ads users see on their phones.
Mobilink is already a telecom service provider with roaming agreements in over 170 countries. We have roaming
agreements with the largest telecom providers in the world and have tested the Mobilink SIM card in a dozen countries
worldwide. Since Mobilink works at the telecom service provider level, we will be able to insert advertising without
disrupting the user or adding any software to their smartphone.

The end result? Our users will have a smartphone that works on a global scale without having to pay a bill for voice or
data. Enabled by the Blockchain and our global network, we will be able to generate ad revenues from user cell phone
usage, and use those funds to pay for cell phone coverage for our users. Since our users will always be verified by the
Blockchain and allow direct interaction with products and services being advertised, we can generate much more
revenue per user.
As our platform gains more users and more advertising partners, we expect our ad revenues to overtake our mobile
network operating costs. As we gradually become more profitable, we will share Mobilink tokens with our users,
creating a fully useable utility token and an economy for micro-transactions.

Mission Statement and Vision
To create and operate the first decentralized mobile service provider that will disrupt and thrive within the current
telecommunication industry, offering users a global voice and data services at no cost and without borders. Fueled by
Blockchain technology, the revenues that our ad platform will generate will pay for our global network. As our
advertising operations grow, we will share extra advertising revenues with our users through the issuance of Mobilink
tokens directly to user wallets.
Our vision is to revolutionize the way telecommunications and advertising are used today and be a catalyst for positive
change for consumers and service providers. We intend to accomplish this by becoming a world class service provider
with a six percent global market share by mid-2020.

Key offering details

Every token holder will receive a SIM card that will work with any unlocked smartphone. Using
Blockchain technology, Mobilink will be able to send targeted ads to user smartphones, generating
ad revenues which will pay for voice and data services for the user. With our offering users will not
get any monthly bills!

As Mobilink has global roaming contracts in place, we will be able to offer truly borderless
connectivity for our token holders—no more data and voice roaming charges for travelers! 170+
countries supported!

Through the use of the Blockchain and smart contracts, Mobilink will be able to calculate every
user’s daily earnings and make a monthly payouts as part of our revenue sharing program to those
that own MOLK. Proof of Participation, PoP, grants you access to Mobilink special programs such as
ad revenue sharing.

The MOLK token will be a truly useable token held by a large number of users. Token holders will be
able to convert their MOLK tokens to other cryptocurrencies on public exchanges or on their Mobilink
Wallet application.

Main features

1. Mobilink Network has interconnections with large global mobile carriers, allowing Mobilink-SIM users to use voice
and data services at no cost. It works with any unlocked Smartphone (IOS and Android).
2. The Mobilink Ad-Platform will deliver ads to your phone, allowing Mobilink to initially pay for network usage costs and
share the ad revenue profits in the near future.
3. Mobilink will build an Android and iOS Wallet Application which will allow users to receiveMOLK tokens based on
their usage.
4. The Mobilink Application will have a built-in crypto-exchange where token holders can exchange tokens for other
crypto-currencies and fiat currency.
5. Mobilink will also issue a Mobilink prepaid card to its MOBILINK-COIN holders which will be linked to the Mobilink
Wallet and Exchange application.

PROOF OF
PARTICIPATION
Our groundbreaking concept ensures that ongoing Proof of Participation (“PoP”) intrinsically adds value to the
coin. Mobilink-Coin has built a one-of-a-kind eco-system that utilizes various aspects of cryptocurrency, a
transparent wallet application (Mobi-Wallet) and a built-in crypto-exchange (Mobi-Exchange), backed by a viable,
highly sought-after product and service. Mobilink-SIM cardholders receive their monthly talk, text and data
services at no cost to the end user. What makes this possible are four components that, upon combining, create a
highly dynamic methodology to provide an increasingly stronger valuation as participation increases.
1.Mobi-Card
A percentage of Mobi-Card transaction are routed through the PoP, which provides an overall valuation in
combination with the other three key components.
2.Digital Interface with Servers
The digital interface with servers, aspects involving variables with telecoms, and the switch command structure
10of
linked roaming are a combined naturally occurring industry benefit tied into PoP. The results are a modality that
produces monetary valuation of the coin, is not influenced by exchanges or the market. The value strictly comes
from all the Mobilink-SIM card users within the global network.

Mobilink.io Whitepaper

How does it work?
The Mobilink project is about creating an ecosystem of services that use and drive demand for the MOLK token,
providing enough revenues for the network to operate at no cost to the user, and eventually generating enough
revenues to start sharing with token holders.
The figure below illustrates how our network will function:

Mobilink-Network: Global network operated out of Canada, responsible for the build-out, management and operations
of the Telecom Network, and also responsible for the management of the Mobilink Ad platform.
Mobilink SIM Card: a SIM card provided to token holders after close of ICO for use in any standard smartphone (Android
and IOS).
Mobilink SIM Card user: Any user who owns a Mobilink SIM Card used in an unlocked smartphone.
MOLK Token Holder: After the completion of the ICO, this is any user that is a token holder either through
purchase from an exchange or ICO investor.
Advertisers: Organizations who wish to advertise to their customers in innovative ways, with interactions and identity
enabled by Blockchain technologies.
11

Mobilink.io Whitepaper

Ads and Revenue Sharing
Users will increase the value of MOLK coin based on ads that will be shown on their device. Ad revenues are shared
by buying back MOLK and increasing the market capital of MOLK. You must have Proof of Participation(PoP) by owning
MOLK prior to the Revenue Sharing payout. As we build out an advertising platform that is enabled and empowered by
Blockchain technology, we plan to help solve many of advertising’s pitfalls, including fake accounts, fake followers and
fake impressions.
Mobilink will strive to generate as much revenue as possible through advertising agreements and to share with our users
after covering mobile network operating costs. An example of the revenue distribution is shown below:
$100 Revenue would be split up as follows:
- 45% Telecom Services
- 14% Operating Costs
- 14% fees
-10% Mobilink Share
-21% User Share added to value of MOLK coin
After operational costs Mobilink will keep about 30% of the revenue, and share the remaining ~70% with our users
The below figure illustrates our projections for the next 36 months. We intend to decrease the telecom and
operating costs to eventually be able to give the user 35% of the revenues, which equates to more than 75% of the
Network profit.

* This projection is to be used as only a guideline as it assumes ideal market conditions.

Wallet & Exchange Platform
Mobilink will provide users with a smart phone application for Android and iOS which will include a secure wallet and an
exchange platform. The below diagram illustrates how the process will work and some of the features.

Once the Mobilink Ad Platform generates enough revenues to cover networking costs, we will share the residual
revenues with our users. Through the Wallet API the Mobilink Network will be able to deposit tokens to users based on
their usage.
The main features are:
Mobilink Exchange: An exchange platform which will allow users to exchange their MOLK tokens
for other cryptocurrencies.
Withdraw and deposit: A function designed to enable users to deposit tokens to their ERC20 wallet or withdraw them to
an external wallet.
Full encryption: Fully encrypted to ensure security for the user.
Check ad revenues: Allows user to check the ad revenues generated by their activities.
Coin Balances: Enable users to check MOLK token balances.
Prepaid Card Balance: Allows users to check the balances of their pre-paid credit card.
New apps: As our network and user base grow, we will add more functionalities to bring value our

PROOF OF PARTICIPATION
Our groundbreaking concept ensures that ongoing Proof of Participation (“PoP”) intrinsically adds value
to the coin. Mobilink-Coin has built a one-of-a-kind eco-system that utilizes various aspects of
cryptocurrency, a transparent wallet application (Mobi-Wallet) and a built-in crypto-exchange (MobiExchange), backed by a viable, highly sought-after product and service. Mobilink-SIM cardholders
receive their monthly talk, text and data services at no cost to the end user. What makes this possible
are four components that, upon combining, create a highly dynamic methodology to provide an
increasingly stronger valuation as participation increases.
1.Mobi-Card
A percentage of Mobi-Card transaction are routed through the PoP, which provides an overall valuation
in combination with the other three key components.
2.Digital Interface with Servers
The digital interface with servers, aspects involving variables with telecoms, and the switch command
structure of linked roaming are a combined naturally occurring industry benefit tied into PoP. The
results are a modality that produces monetary valuation of the coin, is not influenced by exchanges or
the market. The value strictly comes from all the Mobilink-SIM card users within the global network.
3.Mobi-Wallet
A percentage is rerouted via the PoP into the collective system that provides valuation.
4.Mobi-Exchange
Just as with the Mobi-Wallet, there is a percentage rerouted via the PoP to flow into the collective
system providing the valuation. It is undeniable that our framework is ironclad and that our platform is
remarkably unique. When we combine the above four components for valuation, Mobilink-Coin builds
tremendous value through PARTICIPATION, INTEGRITY AND TRANSPARENCY.
Participation directly correlates to the value of the coin. We know there is a significant worldwide
population who will enjoy the benefits of having unlimited talk, text and data every month at no cost to
them. These are our users…our participants. As participation increases, the value of the coin increases.
Through our own wallet and exchange, the valuation of Mobilink-Coin becomes an intrinsically
transparent process whereby users benefit from exceptional wallet/exchange rates, no hidden time
delays and no surprise or unpublished fees. The Mobi-Exchange is fully transparent and only allows coins
of equal integrity and transparency. This unique modality utilizes Proof of Participation as its means of
valuation.
Simply put, our success model is based on participation = valuation. As the Mobilink ecosystem is
affected by participation, the collective increase in valuation promotes the overall increased value of the
coin, hence affecting all Mobilink-Coin owners. In the same way, as participation increases, the four
modalities collectively add to the coin’s overall valuation. More users means higher participation, which
translates to higher value of the coins. The value of this project is enormous and is fully contingent upon
Participation. This streamlined program is simple, straightforward and is equally as transparent as the
Mobilink-Coin, Wallet and Exchange.

Token Distribution & Use of Funds

The Mobilink team has allocated the token distribution in such a way that it would allow us to build a global network.
We have reserved 15% of the tokens for our team and advisers. The rest of the tokens will be reserved for token
holders, building out the network and the network reserve. The reserve will be used by the network to pay out Mobilink
tokens as part of our ad revenue distribution model. Unsold tokens in the public sale will be added to the network
reserve.

16

Mobilink.io Whitepaper

In the event that the ICO crowd sale does not hit the soft cap, the project will move ahead regardless of what is raised. It
is projected that there is more than 2 million SIM cards that will distributed by our partners, distributers and agents
after the ICO ends. Coin holders will most likely see the value of the coin increase on exchanges since activity with the
Mobilink Coin will increase via all its users.
Interconnection development (32%)
Mobilink has global roaming agreements set up in more than 170 countries. As we start offering global voice and data
services to potentially millions of users, we will spend over 30% of our budget on building more robust contracts and
infrastructure. This will in turn allow us to provide better services to users while reducing our costs, which will mean
more funds to share with our users.
Operational overhead (21%)
This portion of the proceeds will be used to fund the operations of the Mobilink network worldwide. These funds will be
used for, but are not limited to, mobile network infrastructure, mobile network operations team, customer operations,
logistics and support.
Mobile ad infrastructure (21%)
As we are attempting to disrupt the mobile advertising industry, we will dedicate a large portion of the funds raised to
build our mobile ad infrastructure which will include: Android and IOS wallet application development, ad exchange
platform to work with external advertisers and the revenue distribution platform to distribute tokens.

17

Mobilink.io Whitepaper

Ad platform integration (11%)
This is a critical part of Mobilink as it will play the role of linking our mobile ad infrastructure to the smartphones of our
users. Most of the funds will be used for custom application development on Android and IOS.
Reserve, Administration, Marketing, Legal and General Expenses (15%)
These funds are put aside for standard business expenses.

18

Mobilink.io Whitepaper

ROADMAP
The Mobilink team has already completed substantial work launching the crowd sale. Unlike other projects, we actually
have a working product in the telecom space along with global roaming contracts with working services. The ICO allows
us to crowd fund the network build-out and complete the ad platform and mobile apps.
We expect to ship the first batch of SIM cards for beta testing in later part of 2018. Beta tests of SIM Cards will be
available to USA beta testers after the ICO has ended, and the Beta Testing is outside the scope of this ICO. We intend to
deliver working SIM cards to ICO participants in early 2019.

Glossary
ICO
An initial coin offering (ICO) is a means of crowdfunding centered around cryptocurrency, which can be a source of
capital for startup companies. In an ICO, some quantity of the crowdfunded cryptocurrency is pre-allocated to investors
in the form of "tokens," in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. These
tokens become functional units of currency if or when the ICO's funding goal is met and the project launches.
ICOs provide a means by which start-up companies can avoid burdensome costs of regulatory compliance and
intermediary financial organizations.

Roaming
In technical terms, roaming refers to the ability for a cellular customer to automatically make and receive voice calls,
send and receive data, or access other services, including home data services, when travelling outside the geographical
coverage area of the home network, by means of using a visited network. For example: should a subscriber travel
beyond their cell phone company's transmitter range, their cell phone would automatically hop onto another phone
company's service, if available.
The process is supported by the Telecommunication processes of mobility management, authentication, authorization
and accounting billing procedures.
