2. Executive Summary
The fundamental attributes of blockchain technology are
being leveraged in profound new ways, changing how our
society operates, disrupting old conventions, and creating new
possibilities. These attributes present a foundation for value
creation; providing the potential for significant returns on
investment. Blockchain technology provides the technological
basis for the value creation of most cryptocurrencies, the
platforms on which they are created and operate, and the
networks through which they are transferred.

This small hard cap has been selected as an optimum fund
size that can be responsibly managed to achieve high returns.
As the Fund grows, Invictus Capital will dedicate increased
resources to portfolio management. This will be to ensure
that the size of the Fund, and duty to invest responsibly, never
exceeds the manpower required to do so.
IHF is the token of the Hyperion Fund. The value of the token
is tied directly to the valuation of the Hyperion Fund. IHF is an
ERC20 token based upon the Ethereum blockchain. IHFs can
be acquired during the IHF ICO, which is a once-time, closedend offering.

Cryptocurrencies are digital representations of an entity
or organization with value or utility within the blockchain
economy. The exchange of tokens using blockchain protocols
has provided a new way for people to exchange value with one
another. These value exchanges have enabled entrepreneurs
to raise funding in the form of fiat and cryptocurrencies,
providing tokens specific to their projects in return.

Operating on the Ethereum blockchain facilitates a
transparent, globally accessible ICO and provides IHF token
holders with simple options for transferring, storing and
trading their tokens on exchanges. Following the IHF ICO, the
only way to obtain IHF will be directly from IHF holders on
exchange. No further tokens will be publicly sold or minted by
Invictus Hyperion.

This has been mediated through the development of new
investment protocols like Simple Agreements for Future
Tokens (SAFTs), token pre-sales and Initial Coin Offerings
(ICOs). These protocols have redefined and democratized
early stage investing.

IHF tokens issued will represent a participant’s share of the
portfolio. 98% of the total amount contributed during the
offering will go directly towards acquisition of assets under
management (AUM). A detailed breakdown of Fund utilization
and token distribution is available in Section X.

Through blockchain technology, independent investors
are now able to invest in projects from across the globe
while they are in their infancy — investment opportunities
that, historically, were only available to wealthy accredited
investors and first-world venture capitalists.

No annual management fee is collected by Fund managers.
Fees are strictly performance-based and constitute 12.5% of
realized returns per quarter. When the Fund exceeds 30M USD
at the end of a quarter, token repurchase and burning (buyand-burns) will be triggered. Token buying to the value of 50%
of returns realized each quarter will be effected on the open
market with the acquired tokens being burnt, thus increasing
the token price. Buying will be executed over the following
quarter to minimise short term impacts on prices.

While these developments have provided access to a wide array
of novel investment opportunities, they have also exposed
people to the significant risks associated with early stage
investing. Coupled with the proliferation of ICOs on offer,
performing the necessary due diligence to make informed
investments has become onerous.
Independent investors are simply unable to allocate the time,
energy and mental bandwidth required to understand and
navigate all of the new investment opportunities — and the
corresponding pitfalls.

Token holders are at liberty to sell or exchange their tokens to
third parties at any time. There are no exit fees, broker fees or
advice fees imposed by Invictus Hyperion.
The fund will operate with Invictus’s hallmark data-driven
investment methodology. Predictive models and tools
such as the Invictus Titan AI will be utilized to inform the
due diligence, and evaluate the potential of, investment
opportunities.

Even though blockchain technology has transformed the early
stage investment landscape, the independent investor still
faces barriers. Large bonuses or discounts are often offered
exclusively during private pre-sales to investors or partners
with significant capital and connections to the project’s
founders. Through the power of syndication, the Hyperion
Fund, administered by Invictus Capital, has been designed
to function as a venture fund to access these private pre-sale
investment opportunities.

The size of the Hyperion Fund, a result of the syndicated
contributions made by participants, is anticipated to produces
several favourable advantages for IHF holders. Firstly, the
investing power of the Fund over that of an individual
attracts applications from entrepreneurs seeking funding
that an individual would not attract alone. Secondly, the
size of investments that the Fund will be able to make will
provide IHF Fund managers with the ability to engage with
entrepreneurs for the purposes of performing due diligence
and to negotiate terms of investment on behalf of IHF token
holders in a manner that they could not alone.

The Hyperion Fund is a closed-end, tokenized venture capital
fund designed to provide token holders with diversified
exposure to the returns, and risks of early stage investing in
the blockchain economy.
Hyperion will focus on early stage investments in blockchain
technology through SAFTs, private and public token pre-sales
and ICOs. The Fund will not invest in projects that already
have a listed token.

Security is extremely important and the smart contract
code relating to the issuance of IHF will be audited by an
independent third party, Hosho Group.

Hyperion will focus on early stage investments in blockchain
technology through SAFTs, private and public pre-sales and
ICOs. The fund will not invest in projects that already have a
listed token.

A public IHF ICO will be held from the 30th of April 2018.
Invictus Capital will use the IHF ICO contributions to invest in
SAFTs, pre-sales and ICOs. A full list of Hyperion Fund team
members and partners are available on the Invictus Capital
website.

The soft cap for the ICO of the Hyperion Fund will be 2M
USD. If the soft cap is not reached by the end of the IHF ICO,
investors will have their investments returned to them in full.
The hard cap for the ICO of the Hyperion Fund is 15M USD.

I. Abstract
The Hyperion Fund provides investors with diversified exposure to a portfolio of expertly-vetted early stage investments
in the blockchain economy through simple agreements for future token (SAFTs), pre-sales and initial coin offerings
(ICOs). Through blockchain technology, independent investors now enjoy unprecedented global access to early stage
investment opportunities. However, the associated burden to perform the necessary due diligence is overwhelming, and
public analysis tools are non-existent. Furthermore, the largest pre-sale bonus structures remain out of reach for many
independent investors — venture funds and high net-worth individuals still enjoy preferred access to these investment
opportunities. The Hyperion Fund functions as a syndicated venture capital fund to provide independent investors
access to these bonuses. The Fund will be managed by Invictus Capital who will perform rigorous due diligence on
investments, establish relationships with founders and evaluate the value proposition of target projects on behalf of the
Hyperion Fund. Analysis of projects will rely extensively on data analytics employing an array of proprietary machine
learning tools. The Invictus Hyperion Fund token is an Ethereum ERC20 utility token. The value of the IHF token is
directly represented by the holdings and investments of the Fund. Once the holdings and investments of the Fund has
reached a value of 30M USD, as determined by Invictus Capital, Hyperion will buy-and-burn IHF tokens to the value of
50% of the returns realized quarterly. A 12.5% performance fee, based on returns, will be levied. The remaining 37.5% of
such returns will be either reinvested or utilized for further buy-and-burns, depending on the total size of the Hyperion
Fund. With zero annual management fees, Fund managers’ incentives are strongly aligned with the interests of IHF
token holders.

Blockchain technology and smart contracts have drastically
changed the landscape of early stage investing. Reports
indicate that in 2017, the amounts raised via ICOs far exceeded
that of early stage traditional venture capital2. Further,
ICOs and token pre-sales now provide smaller, independent
investors with an increased degree of access to early stage
investment opportunities across the globe.

Historically, early stage investing—a high risk, high reward
venture—has been dominated by wealthy first world venture
capitalists (VCs). To gain access to funding, entrepreneurs
were required to pitch to VCs who enjoyed preferential access
to the high rates of return characteristic of these investment
opportunities.

-- I n the changing landscape of international cryptocurrency
regulations, specifically regarding ICOs, fundraising
efforts may proceed increasingly through private pre-sales
often involving SAFTs. The Hyperion Fund thus provides
IHF holders access to these raises.1

The Hyperion Fund leverages the power of syndication and
industry presence to provide the opportunities of traditional
venture capital to the independent investor. However, unlike
traditional venture capital investment structures, returns

on blockchain investments can be realized more quickly,
providing increased liquidity and turnover.

This is especially true for entrepreneurs in countries lacking the
presence of angel investors and the communities they foster.
The Hyperion Fund aims to support these entrepreneurs.

It is anticipated that the utilization of data-science and
machine learning tools in the analysis and reporting on
projects along with business insights, marketing assistance
and partner benefits provided by Invictus Capital will
strengthen the chances of successful investment outcomes.

With the large number of dubious projects, scams and frauds
present within the ICO space, legitimate projects require
partners whose investments represent more than simply
financial support. Investments by reputed funds in well-vetted
projects imbue these projects with credibility, distinguishing
them from amongst the rest.

A. Removing Barriers Facing Independent
Investors

IV. Improving Odds of Partner
ICO Success

Early stage funding is provided - typically through private presales - in exchange for tokens often at a massively discounted
price in comparison to the public ICO price. These price
discounts represent a potentially high return on investment
(ROI) following the ICO. These investment opportunities
are often still reserved for VCs and remain off-limits to the
average independent investor.

Invictus Capital successfully launched CRYPTO20, which was
the 22nd largest ICO of all time at its conclusion4. Invictus
Capital will leverage its experience and expertise in support
of projects it invests in through the Hyperion Fund, increasing
their prospects of success. Further, the team behind Invictus
Capital (the “Hyperion Fund Team”) are experienced
developers, providing an edge over traditional VCs when it
comes to the evaluation of projects.

Fig. 2 illustrates a common fundraising structure. Many
entrepreneurs with a vision to launch a successful ICO require
several phases of pre-ICO funding for product development,
legal expenses, negotiating and securing partnerships, and
marketing expenses.

Invictus Capital will issue thorough reports that include salient
due diligence considerations for projects that it chooses to
invest in. These reports will go a long way towards promoting
and legitimizing a project, as they will be distributed via well
established marketing channels.

B. Professional Due Diligence
Hyperion’s fund managers aim to provide peace of mind
through professional due diligence and reporting, removing
the burden from investors.

Invictus Capital will endeavour to further projects it is
partnered with. It will provide, amongst other benefits:

Due diligence on investments will be supported by custombuilt machine learning analysis tools (such as the Titan AI)
to quickly narrow down investment opportunities and detect
scams.

-- A public ICO report
-- Direct market reach via social channels
-- Assistance in listing tokens on exchanges

A drawback of the ICO fundraising protocol is the limited
degree to which investors are able to engage with, and
scrutinize the people they are investing in. The Hyperion
Fund managers will act with aligned interests to those ofund
participants and the community by engaging with pre-ICO
projects.

advisors in specific geographies (Korea, Japan, Russia, etc.)
-- Smart contract review
-- Guidance and strategy

V. Value of Syndication

C. Supporting Blockchain Visionaries

The Hyperion Fund is an example of syndication. Through
the Hyperion ICO, participants will effectively pool their
investments to create a venture fund of size sufficient to
unlock access to the larger bonus structures of private presales, attract the attention of entrepreneurs and produce
bargaining power for negotiating the terms of investment.

The key attributes of blockchain technology provide a basis
for transforming many sectors of our society, such as finance,
communications, logistics, healthcare, entertainment and
education to name a few. The value of the improvements
brought to these sectors underpins the returns on early stage
investments in blockchain technology projects.

Entrepreneurs will preferentially seek out funding from VCs
with expertise in their technological area. Invictus Capital,
through the Hyperion Fund, is capable of understanding the
potential impact of projects and attracting entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurs with the vision, and unique ability to capitalize
on these attributes require financial backing and support to
develop their projects to the stage where they can conduct a
successful public pre-sale and ICO.

professionals and that the Hyperion Fund has the resources to

Open-end mutual fund:
An open-end fund is a mutual fund issuing unlimited shares
of investments in stocks and/or bonds. Investing creates
more shares, whereas selling shares takes them out of
circulation. Shares are bought and sold on demand at their
NAVs, which is based on the value of the fund’s underlying
securities and is calculated at the end of the trading day.
When a large number of shares are redeemed, the fund may
sell some of its investments to pay the investor. Shares are
bought directly from the fund administrators.

The sheer amount of information that needs to be processed
to identify promising early stage investments presents a
significant challenge to investors. Thousands of ICOs have
already taken place, with dozens more launching every
month. Invictus Capital has developed, and will continue
to develop, analysis and insight tools to help process this

enhanced by gaining a high-level perspective of the structure
and behavior of a market. Invictus Capital has developed
the Titan AI tool that utilizes its large, and continuously
growing corpus of white papers to gain an overview of the ICO
landscape - including the trends and sub-sectors that exist
within it.

These metrics will help guide model feature construction.

In this tool, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)7 is applied to
the text extracted from each white paper within the corpus to
generate a set of topics. Each of these topics has a probability
of having certain keywords associated with it. Each document
is then assigned a mixture of the topics most strongly
associated with them and as such can be used to cluster
documents based on their topic mix.

Titan AI Tool. Note that the topics are abstract concepts and the
words associated with them are the words those topics are most
likely to contain. (source: Invictus Capital10)

(source: Invictus Capital8)

This clustering allows for the making of investment decisions
in a faster and more informed way by giving us the information
required to diversify our investments across sectors and
compare projects to their competitors.

In order to accomplish this, data has been recorded regarding
both the details and the performance of past ICOs. These
details include information about the team extracted from
LinkedIn, information about the project itself from the white
paper and any publicly available code repositories (including
code we can extract from the website directly). Performance
information about the ICO raise size and the token’s
performance over time is then appended to the other scraped
information. This information will be used to construct
predictive models using techniques such as Random Forest
regression13 to attempt to predict how successful an ICO is
likely to be.

Additionally, word and paragraph embedding unsupervised
learning algorithms9 are used to create a vector representation
of each document. These vector representations can then
be compared to each other and a quantitative measure of
similarity established. This is used to ascertain the three
most similar projects to one chosen for research by subject
matter (not textual similarity as in the plagiarism detector
- although these can sometimes coincide when a project
is highly plagiarised). These similarity scores are then used
along with the topic information gained from LDA to create
an informative tree representation.

The web will then be continuously scraped for new ICO
projects and the data inputted into the predictive model. The
predictions will then be stored and the Hyperion Fund Team
will be alerted of any potentially promising ICOs for further
investigation.

Predictive Feature Discovery and Analysis
The number of projects available and the rate at which
new projects are being founded necessitates some form of
autonomous screening process to initially review available
early stage ICOs and flag them as potentially promising
projects. This flagging process will not be a necessity for
investment and projects may even request funding directly
via a form. Instead, this will allow for more projects to be
surveyed than would otherwise have been possible.

B. ML Augmented Due Diligence
Early stage investing is a particularly challenging investment
landscape to navigate as the amount of information available
about potential investment prospects is limited. Ventures are
in their infancy and their future performance is difficult to
predict. However, due to the huge returns on investment that
early stage investing offers, it is still an attractive landscape
provided caution is used and extensive due diligence
undertaken. Additionally, many investors lack high-level
market insight and simply do not know which startups to
invest in, or are even aware of the existence of many. Both

Research11,12 has been conducted on the predictors of success
of new technology companies. Although this research was
not conducted on the ICO space, there should be analogous
predictive features. Several metrics indicating promise in
research are:

of the difficulties mentioned above are exacerbated in the
crypto-space where technologies and business models are
new and start-ups abundant.

made publicly available). When appropriate, Invictus’s
engineers will perform simple validations on the software
made available to us (ensuring that the software does what
the owners claim it can do). Full code reviews for many large
projects will be far too labour intensive to perform. For
this reason, we are developing and curating tools to give an
indication of the code quality of large projects autonomously.

Acutely aware of the above challenges, Invictus Capital has
decided to leverage their scientists’ and engineers’ expertise
in data science and machine learning to aid our experienced
VC investors and finance professionals in the early stage
investing process. Machine learning will be used to both
help identify promising investment opportunities as well as
assist with due diligence once a start-up has been selected for
further consideration. These tools will help our analysts make
more accurate decisions and also improve scalability of the
Fund moving forward.

Invictus is developing an AI tool based on a formal symbolic
logic system known as separation logic15 to perform
comprehensive static analyses on bodies of code. This tool is
based on a recently open-sourced project by Facebook known
as Infer16. While under development it is already capable
of automatically identifying many common bugs, and even
violations of coding conventions, in a number of popular
languages. Invictus will tailor Infer to the ICO space—
including development of support for Solidity to review smart
contracts, and support popular web technologies.

Plagiarism Detection
The massive wave of interest in blockchain technology and
cryptocurrencies has led to huge investment cash inflows
and correspondingly, unscrupulous businesses and scammers
have entered the space attempting to take advantage of this
inflow.

If there is enough publicly available code for a project
without us having to first approach targets, Invictus will use
the outputs from the code quality AI tool as inputs for our
predictive models discussed in Section VII B as well.

In many cases, it is easy to determine that these projects are
not worthy of investment, largely due to their poor quality and
hasty construction. However, occasionally these unscrupulous
projects can appear to be of high quality, often because they
have plagiarized content from reputable projects. The number
of projects in this space means that it would be difficult for
even a crypto veteran to recognise plagiarism in every case.

C. Development Roadmap
Development on all of the features mentioned in Sections VII
A and B have either begun or have been completed.
Plagiarism Detection
The plagiarism detection tool has already been developed and
is available for public use10.

It is this concern, along with Invictus’s drive to increase
integrity in the crypto-community and support the ordinary
crypto-investor, that formed the impetus for the development
of the Titan AI Plagiarism Tool. This tool analyzes ICO white
papers and is capable of identifying plagiarized content - even
where word substitutions and re-orderings have been used in
an attempt to obfuscate the plagiarism.

Market Insight via Similarity and Clustering
The market insight tools have already been developed and
are publicly available. Similarity trees are displayed after a
paper is uploaded10, and the clustering tool is also publicly
accessible8.

Titan already contains thousands of white papers in its corpus,
which grows automatically as the community submits papers
for review. The Hyperion Fund Team has also developed tools
that autonomously scrape the web for ICO whitepapers to
update the corpus periodically.

Predictive Feature Discovery and Analysis
The predictive feature discovery and analysis tools are
currently under development and should be completed in
April 2018. These will be internal tools not made available to
the public, but Invictus Capital will make key results produced
by these tools available when finalized.

When a PDF is uploaded, it is pre-processed and the text
extracted. The text of the document is then inputted to a
hash function to generate a unique ID for duplicate detection
and caching purposes. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques are then used to break up the document into
sentences and group sentences into paragraphs. Each
paragraph is then queried against a distributed Elasticsearch
cluster containing the corpus of previously indexed white
papers and candidate results are returned. The Elasticsearch
cluster allows for scalability and strong performance over
a large search-space. Word frequency vectors are then
constructed on a sentence by sentence basis and cosine
similarity14 performed between the candidate sentences and
the sentences from the document being analysed.

VIII. Investment Strategy
The Hyperion Fund will function as a venture capital fund
and will exclusively invest in early stage blockchain and
cryptocurrency based projects and companies. Investments
will be undertaken with a view to constructing a diversified
portfolio consisting of holdings from a wide array of sectors
(such as currencies, platforms, finance, communication,
computing, logistics, energy etc.), this strategy aims to
minimize risk and exposure to a single sector.

A. Minimum Investment Requirements

Results below a certain similarity threshold are discarded and
then grouped by their source (origin document). Additionally,
these final results are cached to allow for faster processing
time for users querying the same document.

To navigate this risk of early stage investing, the Hyperion
Fund will only invest in projects that satisfy a list of
predetermined criteria. The Fund will not invest in projects
based on promising ideas alone.

This tool has already been developed and will become more
comprehensive over time, forming a key part of Invictus’s due
diligence processes.

A non-exhaustive list of investment requirements has been
constructed to capture this investment philosophy.
Requirements:

-- A minimum viable product (MVP)
-- Indication of personal commitment to develop the project
-- A well-defined token vesting strategy
Hyperion Fund managers will evaluate projects in terms of
their originality, value proposition and potential market
capitalization, differentiation from competition, and
knowledge of the industry of application. Learnings and
insights from Section VII, inclusive of identified optimal
raises and sectors, will also be leveraged.

C. Risk and Hedging
Traditional Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) are a useful
analogue for considering the external factors affecting the
realization of returns on investments in ICOs. IPO prices of
shares are set through extended processes of due diligence
and thorough analyses of the existing business. These prices,
however, can also be heavily influenced by prevailing market
conditions. Peer benchmark valuations frequently serve as
key determinants of IPO prices. These prices are typically
highest when equities are overpriced, which happens in times
of optimism or irrational exuberance.

The application form shown in Appendix A will be used to
source and filter potential projects.

B. Investment Horizon
Many early stage investments are structured such that the
purchased tokens vest over time. In these cases, there is a
minimum commitment term based on when assets can be sold
and returns realized. This, together with strategies aiming
to realize long term growth, define the investment horizon.
Typical vesting structures range between three months and
one year.

The analogy is relevant, but not entirely appropriate given
that IPOs are conducted for established businesses and
that tokens do not represent shares in a company. The ICO
landscape is characterized by offerings of tokens related to
the value proposition of significantly younger entities that
often simply possess a MVP.

The Hyperion Fund will view each exchange listing as a key
opportunity for the realization of return. The magnitude of
realization will naturally depend on the investment strategy
and whether the listing is in fact the optimal time to liquidate.

Consequently, token valuations rely far more heavily on
projections than IPOs do. Returns on investments contingent
on the token exchange prices are highly subject to market
behavior in the short and medium terms. It is crucial to
consider that the tokens’ prices offered during ICOs, and the
number of tokens to be minted over a project’s lifetime, are
often predetermined. The market capitalizations that can
be calculated from these inputs provide initial, and highly
speculative valuations of projects. These valuations must be
carefully considered before any investments in presales or
ICOs are made.

In the past, early investors with the ability to contribute
significantly have occasionally used exchange listings too
aggressively and liquidated large volumes of tokens, thus
causing severe negative price actions. Changes to vesting
procedures and other strategies are, however, mitigating these
outcomes. The nature of the technology and distribution
agreements also help in ensuring that the interests of all
parties are catered for.

For many projects it is highly unlikely that these initial
valuations will be realized. In these cases, the token’s values
will eventually decline to below the purchase price at ICO.

Syndication creates the opportunity to communicate
investment goals, ensuring the token distribution and listing
processes align with the Fund’s investment horizon objectives.
Providing enough vesting tokens to recover the initial
investment at first listing will be a priority. This however does
not preclude the holding of assets in longer term partnerships
with projects depending on their fundamentals and the initial
strategy of the investment. Long term involvement would be
based on a deeper partnering by way of support and advisory
services, increasing the odds of future success.

Favourable market conditions at the time of an ICO will likely
have positive effects on the project’s speculative valuation.
However, given the timeframe over which investments mature
it is prudent to plan for changes in market conditions, given
their influence on token pricing. The strategies developed
should not seek to predict the market in any way, but rather,
to establish a convex payoff whereby the downside associated
with market risk is mitigated but upside is unlimited.

The diagram below provides an example of potential exit
strategies. An initial realization of return may take place at
exchange listing, which may be full or partial.
Realizing Returns

Investing

The management of market risk associated with presales and ICO investments is a priority, but more directly
and immediately relevant is the risk associated with the
uninvested funds held in liquid cryptocurrencies. A method
for the management of this risk could be the utilization of
contingent claims. Contingent claims are contracts whose
payoff is determined by the occurrence of a future event. Call
options are common examples in finance where the purchaser
has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a stock at a
pre-agreed strike price, thus making the payoff equal to the
stock price at option maturity less the strike price. If this value
is negative, the option is worth nothing, and only the price of
the option is lost. The option price is the expected value of the
payoff discounted from the future date to the present at the
risk free rate (usually referencing treasury bills). The pricing
of options is non-trivial and employs advanced models of the
underlying return distributions.

public by existing market makers. The Chicago Board Options
Exchange, for example, has communicated its plans to
increase its product offering beyond bitcoin futures17.

The Fund therefore will seek, as far as is possible, to accept
only upside exposure to the market and buy protection against
possible adverse actions. For example, hedging a market
downside risk could be accomplished by selling futures. This
however does not limit the losses if the market moves upward.
The approach could instead move to the utilization of options
which limit loss to the option price and deliver exposure to
the upside. Options are an appropriate strategy under extreme
movements.

Call and put options on cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency
indices are likely to become increasingly available in the near
future given their established popularity in financial markets
and their relative tractability, as compared with the rest of the
contingent claims market.

IX. Portfolio Valuation

Chen et al.18 attempted the pricing of Bitcoin and CRIX (a
Cryptocurrency Index) call options. Their analysis concluded
that it would be appropriate to use a Stochastic Volatility
with Correlated Jumps (SVCJ) model with development based
on the publication by Duffie et al.19, in order to account for
observed non-Gaussian, fat-tailed distributions. This is to
say that prices exhibit a far greater probability of extreme
movements than would be captured by traditional models
(like Black-Scholes) assuming a lognormal distribution.

A. Importance of Portfolio Valuation
The valuation of the assets held affect, among other things, a
fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV) and financial and performance
reporting. Invictus Capital will implement principles to
mitigate challenges that arise when valuing illiquid or
complex financial instruments. This ensures that these values
are not distorted to the disadvantage of Fund investors.

The SVCJ model is described:

d logS t = μdt + √V t dW t(S) + Z ty dN t

Whilst the IHF Tokens do not have a contractual right of
redemption/payment from the Invictus Hyperion at NAV,
management believes that the IHF tokens will be correlated
to the value of the underlying assets on secondary markets.

1

dV t = κ(θ − V t )dt + σ V √V t dW t(V ) + Z tv dN t 2
C ov(dW t(S) , dW t(V ) ) = ρdt

3

P (dN t = 1) = λdt

The following principles will apply:
Liquid investment pool: The liquid investment pool would
consist partially of BTC and ETH, for which market data
and pricing is readily available. The price will be updated
regularly to accurately reflect the value of the underlying
cryptocurrency assets.
Pre ICO & SAFTs: Investments at cost in SAFTs less any
impairment in value recognized by the Company’s investment
committee. Impairments will not be partial. When appropriate,
an investment will be impaired in full.

adjusted by the volatility (described by [eq 2]). The final term

Z t dN t is the jump, with N t the jump process, and Z t the
magnitude. The goal of including this description is to point
out the constituents necessary to produce a mathematical
model with similar properties to a cryptocurrency price.

according to live market feeds.

Invictus Capital)

The picture of the price process painted by the model is a
rich one, and it serves well to show how movements could
be interpreted as a random process. It is important to note
the addition of significant unpredictable jumps in order to
improve the model. This is good guidance for intuition on the
evolution of cryptocurrency prices in that large, unexpected
movements are characteristic responses to the fundamental
drivers. Ultimately, the SVCJ model is unlikely to capture
the complete nature of the underlying process which is
non ergodic, but it does imply caution. It is not reasonable
to assume market risk if it is not specifically part of the
investment strategy.

X. Hyperion Fund Initial Coin
Offering
There will be no token creation, minting or mining after the
IHF ICO period. Tokens will be transferable and tradable once
the IHF ICO is successfully completed. Investment can be
made in ETH or BTC. The USD equivalent amount of any ETH
or BTC invested will be locked in at the time of investment
according to market rates, and this will be considered the
participant’s contribution.

Fund has commenced on-going trading.

The verification tool asks a user to sign a message using
their private key which proves ownership of an address. This
address is then used to confirm that the user currently owns
more than 500 C20.

The 2% operational expense allocation is a once-time
allocation. After the Fund is established, there are no annual
management fees paid to Invictus Capital for managing the
Fund.

The Hyperion Fund performance fee is calculated as 12.5%
of the Fund performance for the quarter, where performance
is defined as the realized gain in the Fund value from a USD
perspective. The fee is only applicable if the closing balance
is greater than the opening balance adjusted for unrealized
gains, buy-and-burns and performance fees paid in respect of
the previous quarter.

B. Token Buy-and-Burn Activation Threshold
The hard cap on the IHF ICO is 15M USD. Once the Fund has
reached an Adjusted Net Asset Valuation (ANAV) of 30M USD

This distribution is envisaged to accelerate the commencement
of the token buy-and-burn provision, when compared with
token distribution by competitors21,22.
Similarly, the Hyperion Fund is preferential to the interests
of investors when compared to the DeHedge Funds that
implement a different token placement strategy. The DeHedge
token placement strategy allocates 20% of all 2.5 billion
tokens invested in pre-sales and ICO for the project team and
co-founders, as well as operation services23.

C. Token Buy-and-Burns, and Performance Fee
As long as the token buy-and-burn threshold is satisfied,
quarterly token buy-and-burns utilize funds from the returns
realized on investments within each quarter. These are
calculated using the ANAV.

In the Token Fund21, investors pay 5% of their tokens during
either entry or exit to reward the Fund managers and
technical support team. An investor also pays, on average,
2.5% of the amount of issued asset tokens as creation fees;
pays management fees of 2% per annum daily; pays an
average of 20% of the funds performance as exit fees; as well
as an unspecified redemption fee in the funds22. However,
the Hyperion Fund charges no additional entry, exit or
management fees.

The Funds’ performance distribution is designed to financially
empower the investors on a long-term basis through the
reinvestment of 37.5% of returns and buy-and-burns of
50% of returns. The IHF Fund’s distribution is expected to
yield higher capital returns compared to other crypto-token
investment projects that reinvest 25% of the income; share
50% of the income to token holders; and receive 25% of
income as performance fees for example22.

XII. Smart Contract
Specification

deposits from cold storage are executed in order to limit Fund
assets held on exchange.

C. Exchange Accounts

The IHF ICO and certain und administration, from a user’s
perspective, will be enabled through a custom smart contract
that adheres to the ERC20 standard24. This ensures that
token ownership and transfer of tokens is transparent and
immutable.

All exchange accounts are secured by two factor authentication
and email verifications for any withdrawals. Trades will be
executed over multiple exchanges at varying times to mitigate
the risk of front-running once funds are moved from cold
storage.

The smart contract enforces an ICO period by specifying an
end block that restricts the minting of tokens to occur only
within a pre-defined period. This guarantees that the Fund is
closed-end. Dilutive token allocation (for Invictus Capital and
the Hyperion Fund Team, see Section X) is pre-defined in code
and verifiable by all parties.

D. Hardware Wallets
Ledger Nano S hardware wallets will be used for the storage
of all supported cryptocurrencies. For all cryptocurrencies not
supported, encrypted storage drives will be utilized. These
storage devices will be held in secure safe deposit boxes with
back-up paper-wallets, which are engraved on brass plates,
and also stored at a secure location. Locations are undisclosed
due to security considerations.

Reasons for choosing the Ethereum Blockchain:
-- S
 ecurity and predictability (as opposed to, for example,
having to run a separate blockchain),
-- Well-established codebase and development tools,

XIV. Asset Transparency

-- H
 igher liquidity - easier listing on exchanges with
infrastructure already in place, and

The Fund aims to have a minimum of 80% of funds invested at
any given time, with liquid funds and returns retained in pool,
as a 50% split between the most supported currency pairs,
such as BTC and ETH, and 50% cash in USD. This provides
increased stability and liquidity and easily facilitates further
investment as the majority of ICOs accept the most supported
coins. In heavy bear markets, Fund managers will aim to open
leveraged short positions on the most supported currency
pairs to reduce the drawdown of holding BTC and ETH in the
liquidity pool.

-- A
 llows for real time tracking of token-holders. See Section
XI and XIV for more information.
In addition to the custom ERC20 compliant contract, there
is a vesting contract that locks up Invictus Capital and the
Hyperion Fund Team’s tokens for 2 years with vesting periods
every 6 months. This aligns the Hyperion Fund Team and
Invictus Capital with token holders. The contract utilized is
a slightly modified version of the CRYPTO20 vesting contract
which can be viewed on Etherscan25.

Transparency in Hyperion’s holdings will be enabled through
the use of view-only wallet addresses. Where possible, this
enables investors to view real-time holdings of the Hyperion
Fund. For investments in projects pre-ICO Invictus Capital
will disclose the name of the project and the amount invested.

Invictus Hyperion reserves the right to terminate the Hyperion
Fund. In the event that the Fund scales down or closes, this
will be announced in advance and a blockchain snapshot of
Token holdings will be taken at the following quarter. All Fund
holdings - or an amount specified - will then be liquidated for
ETH, the sum total of which will be dispersed to token holders
shown in the snapshot in accordance with their percentage
share of the Fund.

Due diligence reports and the Fund’s holdings will be
published as soon as the project has an appropriate publicfacing presence and the token is listed on exchange with a
verifiable market value.

XIII. Security

Proof of ownership of crypto-assets is easily fulfilled
through the use of a public blockchain explorer and public
key cryptography. The Hyperion Fund Team will sign a
verifiable message, or send a token transfer, to prove control
of a particular address. This address can then be seen on a
blockchain explorer to observe the stated holdings.

A. General Control Environment
Invictus Capital has implemented security industry best
practices for defense against Sybil attacks and bad actors.
Strong identity verification and authentication procedures are
in place to ensure secure operations.

This real-time viewership ensures transparency without
compromising the integrity of the Fund. The Hyperion Fund
does not actively trade or follow a deterministic fund strategy
- this means that the Fund is not at significant risk of frontrunning or market manipulation, and traditional obfuscation
of trades and transfers will further mitigate either of those
risks.

Invictus Capital also implements a risk-based approach to
segregation of duties. This includes internal controls which
ensure that more than one person is required to complete
critical tasks. This intends to prevent fraud and error
potentially impacting the Fund’s performance.
Invictus Capital has previously, and successfully, launched
an ICO (CRYPTO20) that has had its holdings and security
verified by a third party auditor (KPMG). The smart contract
and cyber-security were also externally audited. No security
breaches occurred during the ICO, or to date. The Hyperion
Fund Team will continue to enforce best practices for security.

XV. Marketing and Investor
Relations
The Hyperion Fund Team will invest significant time and
effort into post-ICO marketing targeted towards potential IHF
investors in the traditional financial sector via the production
of information sheets, explainer videos and planning
documents that are easily understandable. Token holders will
be able to view detailed information on their holdings and
portfolio composition on the Invictus Capital website. Invictus
Capital will focus marketing efforts solely on non-regulated

B. Cold Storage
All currencies will be stored in cold wallets within a secure
vault together with the SAFTs. The vault is independently
managed with secure access to pre-registered representatives,
and at pre-arranged times only. The location of the cold storage
vault is not disclosed for security purposes. Withdrawals and
15

markets. Promotion and solicitation will be limited where
participation is forbidden or likely to be forbidden in the near
future, in order to remain compliant with local legislation.

cryptocurrencies and the exposure to SAFTs as intangible
assets as opposed to financial instruments. Initial recognition
will be recorded at cost; subsequent measurement can be at
cost or fair value, less amortization (amortization will only be
calculated when the assets have a finite life). Tokens traded on
exchange will be reported at fair value. SAFTs will be reported
at cost less any recognized impairment in value. All fair value
gains will be taken through other comprehensive income
whilst losses will be taken through the profit and loss and
there will be no need for amortization as described above.

XVI. Accounting and
Reporting
Accounting standards for cryptocurrencies remain unclear.
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) will
either create a new standard or change existing standards
to address accounting for investments in intangible assets,
including digital currencies. They are known to set standards
based on successful businesses leading the way in how to
account for their investments, for example in the case of
commodity broker-traders. The IASB may take years to
develop and implement a new standard.

B. Treatment of Impaired Assets
At the end of each reporting period, an entity is required to
assess whether there is any indication that an asset may be
impaired (i.e. its carrying amount may be higher than its
recoverable amount). IAS 36 has a list of external and internal
indicators of impairment. If there is an indication that an
asset may be impaired, then the asset’s recoverable amount
must be calculated.

A. Relevant Reporting Standards
IAS 38 (Intangible Assets)

Due to the nature of cryptocurrencies and the volatility
associated with the these assets, annual assessments will
not be sufficient. Invictus Capital will therefore hold regular
Investment Committee Meetings to assess each asset and
identify any possible indicators of impairment. Investments
will only be impaired in the event that Invictus Capital has
determined, with confidence, that a return will not be realized
on the investment such as the ICO being hacked, funds being
lost during ICO, and the ICO being cancelled.

IAS 38 Intangible Assets outlines the accounting requirements
for intangible assets, which are non-monetary assets which
are without physical substance and identifiable (either being
separable or arising from contractual or other legal rights).
Intangible assets meeting the relevant recognition criteria are
initially measured at cost, subsequently measured at cost or
using the revaluation model, and amortized on a systematic
basis over their useful lives (unless the asset has an indefinite
useful life, in which case it is not amortized).

Invictus Hyperion will report via the following mechanisms:

IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments)

-- T
 he Fund NAV will be updated on the Fund website,
comprising live market data for market traded assets and
investments at cost in SAFTs, less any impairment in value
recognized by the investment committee.

IFRS 9 specifies how an entity should classify and measure
financial assets, financial liabilities, and some contracts to buy
or sell non-financial items. It requires an entity to recognize
a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of
financial position when it becomes party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.

-- Q

uarterly reports will include information on
governmental risk and legislation, risk/return analysis and
portfolio performance.

At initial recognition, an entity measures a financial asset or a
financial liability at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a
financial asset or a financial liability not at fair value through
profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to
the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or the financial
liability.

-- 	Annual reports will be made available on the investor
portal of the Invictus Capital website comprising:
»» Statement of financial position at the end of the period.
»» S
 tatement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income for the period.
»» S
 ummary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory notes.

IAS 36 (Impairment of assets)
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets seeks to ensure that an entity’s
assets are not carried at more than their recoverable amount
(i.e. the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in
use).

XVII. Fund Timeline
Private ICO (Whitelisted Individuals) - 30th April
Public ICO (Open to all) - 2nd May

With the exception of goodwill and certain intangible assets
for which an annual impairment test is required, entities
are required to conduct impairment tests where there is
an indication of impairment of an asset. The test may be
conducted for a ‘cash-generating unit’ where an asset does
not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of
those from other assets.

End of ICO (Should ICO not sell out in previous phases) - 30th
May
First Investments - by June
End of First Quarter - August

XVIII. Conclusion

IFRS 13 (Fair value measurement)

The Hyperion Fund is a tokenized, closed-end fund focused
on early stage investment in projects involving blockchain
technology. The fund provides investors with diversified
exposure to the high returns and risks characteristic of these
opportunities.

IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement applies to IFRSs that require
or permit fair value measurements or disclosures and provides
a single IFRS framework for measuring fair value and requires
disclosures about fair value measurement. The Standard
defines fair value on the basis of an ‘exit price’ notion and uses
a ‘fair value hierarchy’, which results in a market-based, rather
than entity-specific, measurement.

Invictus Capital administers the Fund, utilizing a wide range
of machine learning and data-science tools to assist in both
the analysis of potential investments, and in the analysis of

exchange, providing access to liquidity .

Over 90 countries have signed the OECD Multilateral
Competent Authority Agreement and Common Reporting
Standard (CRS) for the implementation of the automatic
exchange of tax information based on the OECD’s Multilateral
Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax
Matters. The CRS is similar in form and substance to the US
IGA and applies in respect of each “participating jurisdiction”
(as identified in a list published by the Cayman TIA). On
16 October 2015, the Cayman Islands passed into law the
Tax Information Authority (International Tax Compliance)
(Common Reporting Standard) Regulations, 2015, as amended
(CRS Regulations). As a result of this, Cayman Islands financial
institutions, including Invictus Hyperion, have substantially
expanded international tax compliance obligations and will
have substantially expanded reporting obligations from 2017,
with the first reporting deadline under the CRS Regulations
being 31 May 2018. By investing (or continuing to invest) in
Invictus Hyperion, Investors shall be deemed to acknowledge
that: (i) Invictus Hyperion (or its agent) may be required to
disclose to the Cayman TIA certain confidential information
in relation to the investor, including, but not limited to, the
investor’s name, address, tax identification number (if any),
social security number (if any) and certain information
relating to the investor’s investment; (ii) the Cayman TIA may
be required to automatically exchange information as outlined
above with the IRS, HM Revenue &amp; Customs, the United
Kingdom tax authority (HMRC) and other fiscal authorities
(Competent Authorities) of CRS “participating jurisdictions”;
(iii) Invictus Hyperion (or its agent or delegate) may be
required to disclose to the IRS, HMRC and other Competent
Authorities certain confidential information when registering
with such authorities and if such authorities contact Invictus
Hyperion (or its agent or delegate directly) with further
enquiries; (iv) Invictus Hyperion may require the investor to
provide additional information and/or documentation which
Invictus Hyperion may be required to disclose to the Cayman
TIA; (v) in the event a Token purchaser does not provide the
requested information and/or documentation and/or has not
itself complied with the applicable requirements, whether
or not that actually leads to compliance failures by Invictus
Hyperion, or a risk of Invictus Hyperion or its investors being
subject to withholding tax under the relevant legislative or
inter-governmental regime, Invictus Hyperion reserves the
right to take any action and/or pursue all remedies at its
disposal, including, without limitation, compulsory Token
return of the investor concerned; and (vi) no investor affected
by any such action or remedy shall have any claim against
Invictus Hyperion (or its agent or delegate) for any form of
damages or liability as a result of actions taken or remedies
pursued by or on behalf of Invictus Hyperion in order to
comply with any of the US IGA, the CRS Regulations or any
future IGAs or agreements, laws or regulations entered into

Invictus Hyperion is not regulated as a mutual fund for the
purpose of the Cayman Islands Mutual Funds Law (Revised)
because Invictus Hyperion is not issuing equity interests
to IHF purchasers within the meaning of the Mutual Funds
Law. Although the Tokens carry a contractual right against
Invictus Hyperion, a IHF does not represent a share of Invictus
Hyperion’s authorised and issued share capital, a token-holder
is not entitled to be included on the register of members of
Invictus Hyperion and does not have capital at risk in the way
a shareholder does. Therefore Invictus Hyperion is not subject
to the Mutual Funds Law and the potential registration or
licensing requirements that would otherwise apply if equity
interests were being offered and Invictus Hyperion was
subject to the Mutual Funds Law. Specifically this White Paper
will not be filed with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority
(CIMA),Invictus Hyperion is not subject to the supervision
of CIMA and Invictus Hyperion is not required to have its
accounts audited nor submit such accounts to CIMA.

M. The Cayman Islands and the Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act
US Requirements
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) provisions
of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (HIRE
Act) provide that Invictus Hyperion must disclose the name,
address and taxpayer identification number of certain United
States persons that own, directly or indirectly, an interest
in Invictus Hyperion, as well as certain other information
relating to any such interest, pursuant to the terms of the
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and
the Cayman Islands (US IGA) and implementing legislation
and regulations which have been adopted by the Cayman
Islands. If Invictus Hyperion fails to comply with these
requirements, then a 30% withholding tax will be imposed on
payments to Invictus Hyperion of United States source income
and proceeds from the sale of property that could give rise to
United States source interest or dividends. The withholding
tax provisions of FATCA took effect on July 1, 2014 other than
in relation to proceeds from the sale of property, in which case
they have been postponed to January 1, 2019.
Although Invictus Hyperion will attempt to satisfy the
obligations imposed on them to avoid the imposition of this
withholding tax, no assurance can be given that Invictus
Hyperion will be able to satisfy these obligations. In this
regard, Invictus Hyperion may require investors to provide any
documentation or other information regarding the investors
and their beneficial owners that Token Generator determines
is necessary or desirable for Invictus Hyperion to avoid the
withholding tax and otherwise comply with the HIRE Act.
If Invictus Hyperion becomes subject to a withholding tax

or implemented by the Cayman Islands for the purpose of
ensuring and/or enhancing international tax transparency.
Other jurisdictions
It is possible that certain dividends, interest and other income
received by Invictus Hyperion from sources within certain
countries may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by
such countries. Invictus Hyperion may also be subject to
capital gains taxes or other taxes in some of the countries
where it purchases and sells securities or otherwise conducts
business. It is impossible to predict in advance the rate of tax
that will be paid since the amount of the assets of Invictus
Hyperion to be invested in various countries is uncertain.

N. Risks And Uncertainties
Prospective purchasers of IHF tokens (as referred to in this
White Paper) should carefully consider and evaluate all risks
and uncertainties associated with the Fund, the Company and
its business and operations, the IHF tokens, the IHF token sale
and the underlying assets (each as referred to in the White
Paper), and all information set out in this White Paper and the
T&Cs prior to any purchase of IHF tokens. If any of such risks
and uncertainties develops into actual events, the business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the
Fund, the Tokens, and/or the Company could be materially
and adversely affected. In such cases, you may lose all or part
of the value of the IHF Tokens.
