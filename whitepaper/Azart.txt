1. Introduction
Azart is a cryptocurrency for the gambling industry.
Azart comes from the Spanish “azar” - coincidence, game of chance, “dice
game”.
AzartPay platform is a merchant-service with an open API for connecting
payments in Azart cryptocurrency.
One of the goals of Azart cryptocurrency is providing instant, anonymous
and secure payments for users of online casinos, lotteries, poker rooms
and other services in gambling industry.
Decentralized platform AzartPay will become a popular payment system for
many services in gambling. The interest to the implementation of the
platform will be based on the possibility of obtaining additional income, as
well as financing of future projects.

2. Аbout cryptocurrencies
2.1 Peer-to-Peer payment network
Bitcoin is peer-to-peer payment system which uses the same unit for
accounting transactions and the data transfer protocol with the identical
name. Using of cryptographic methods it ensures the functioning of the
system. All the information about transactions between system addresses
is available for everybody.
Since the launch of Bitcoin, many alternative options and currencies have
emerged. In 2015, Evan Duffield published the Dash Whitepaper,
proposing a payment system that improved on Bitcoin by adding a layered,
two-tier incentivized masternode network and various transaction upgrades
including InstantSend and PrivateSend.

2.2 The Blockchain
Bitcoin’s blockchain technology creates blocks by combining chronological
transactions. These blocks are confirmed by a network of nodes. Each of
these blocks contains the necessary information to build on prior blocks
through the consensus of the workers. However, Bitcoin does not reward
node owners and the number of Bitcoin nodes has been dwindling, causing
the network to be slow, unstable and expensive.

3. Cryptocurrency Azart
3.1 Advantages
Azart has advantages over some other cryptocurrencies:
1. Masternodes. Network become more stable because increasing of
number of nodes will be stimulated.
2. Funding from the network. Owners of masternodes will be able to count
on financing their projects.

3.2 How it works
1. Powerful masternode network adds a second tier of computing
decentralization. This tier can perform any mathematical or financial task
that the community implements. Currently, the masternode network adds
two features:
- InstantSend: perform instant transactions that are irreversible and
permanent.
- PrivateSend: improved privacy with automated mixing and chaining.
2. Owners of masternodes can propose their projects to the vote within the
AzartPay platform for subsequent financing.

4. More information about AzartPay platform and Azart
cryptocurrency
4.1 AzartPay platform
The AzartPay platform considered as a payment system for various
gambling services. Platform partners will be able to obtain additional
revenue from its use.
Special motivation system has been developed for partner services. At this
system coins will be accumulated from the work of masternodes installed
for this system. Collected funds will be distributed among partners
depending on their activity at the end of each period. The more partner
accepts payments in Azart's cryptocurrency for a certain period, the greater
profit will be received.
Our partners will be able to raise interest to Azart cryptocurrency by
themselves and this will help them to have additional income, due to the

4

growth of the exchange rate and the overall popularization of the AzartPay
platform.
Regardless of whether you are a partner of the platform or an ordinary
crypto investor, everybody will have the opportunity to receive additional
revenue using the AzartPay platform. To have revenue you need to buy
necessary number of coins and to install masternode.
In addition, owners of the masternodes will have possibility to put their
projects to the vote for their subsequent financing.

4.2 Decentralized financing system of the projects
The Azart block reward allocates 10% into a community-governed Treasury
Fund (starting from 64800 block). This fund is fully open to audit by the
public, providing assurance of the fund’s intended use.
Any owner of the masternode of Azart platform will be able to put their
projects for voting, in order to get financing through the AzartPay platform.
This can be either proposals of improving the platform, or their own projects
that can cause interest in the community and get the necessary number of
votes.

4.3 Reward system
Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake and Masternodes are all ways that various
cryptocurrencies reward workers. These reward systems contribute to the
creation and confirmation of the Blockchain and each new block distributes
the reward among those who perform jobs.
Our team has developed a new formula of reward distribution. Currently the
reward for the mined block will be dynamic and paid with an accuracy of
eight decimal places. The reward will be calculated according to the
following formula:
Reward = (21.000009 - (0.000009 * nPrevHeight));
The reward will smoothly decrease from 21 to 2 coins per block during nine
years. Then it will remain 2 coins per block until the end of the issue.

The Azart block reward is split such that 63% of rewards are allocated
to masternodes, 27% of rewards are allocated to miners and 10% are
allocated to a community-governed Treasury Fund. Azart includes a unique
lucky block system called Lucky Proof-of-Work. This system rewards both
miners and masternodes owners who find a specific block, introducing an
element of luck and excitement to the Azart community.

4.6 Reward calculation for masternodes
The Azart code base dictates that masternode rewards fluctuate based on
the current number of masternodes. To calculate daily masternode
payouts, one can use the following formula:
Reward MN (per day) = ( n / t ) * r * b * 0.63
n = number of masternodes owned
t = total active masternodes
r = current block reward
b = blocks per day
4.7 Lucky Proof-of-Work block reward
The Azart protocol features a Lucky Proof-of-Work block. Similar to a
superblock, Lucky PoW blocks have a special block reward.

Bitcoin and Dash development teams. We highly appreciate their efforts.
We are happy to join the blockchain community and appreciate the
opportunity to contribute to this growing technological field. Also we want to

the project development.

9. Legal
Cryptocurrency investments are inherently high risk. Before using any
cryptocurrency, it is important to consider the nature, complexity and risk.
Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. It is important not to use
coins without taking into account the possible loss, since the type of
change in these currencies is highly volatile and the Azart team is unable to
regulate market-defined prices. We strongly suggest seeking advice from
your own financial, investment, tax, or legal adviser. The Azart
Development Team will always act in good faith and is not liable for the use
of Azart by other community members, persons or institutions.

Additionally, Asia Pacific is expected to contribute a steady revenue stream
in the global online gambling and betting market over the coming years,
