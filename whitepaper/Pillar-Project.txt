DEDICATION
This project owes its existence to the many people who have been supportive
of the concepts in the book ​Pull​, to the incredible team of volunteers at 20|30,
and to Justin Poirier, who reminded us to let our passion guide us.
Please note that this document is written in the third person because so many
people contributed to it. Thanks to all the contributors and reviewers.

SUMMARY
Twenty Thirty, a blockchain innovation company headquartered in Zug,
Switzerland, is ready to embark on one of the most ambitious decentralized
projects to-date: the personal data locker. Here is the key to everything
you’re about to read:
Wallets, browsers, and exchanges will soon merge to create the
dashboard for our digital lives.
Pillar is a platform powered by
its own native token that will
finally fulfill the promise of the
personal data locker.
Eventually, we believe this
wallet will power most devices,
including phones, tablets,
wearables, cars, buildings, and
more. This paper describes our
project to build an
open-source, multi-chain wallet
that will provide a new digital
platform for consumers,
companies, and governments.
See ​the teaser video​. We plan to realize the project in three phases:
Phase 1: ​Build the Pillar multichain wallet and get it integrated into many
systems. We want thousands of software companies to adopt our
open-source wallet.
Phase 2: ​Build integrations (exchange, browser, e-commerce, escrow,
messaging, etc.) that make it easy to build solutions.

Phase 3: ​Begin to provide the service offerings that separate our wallet
from other wallets and creates the personal data locker, leading to a
personal assistant. Continue to offer both account-based and atomic
versions (explained below). Continue to build out more features as the
ecosystem grows. Help our OEM customers transition from accounts to
atomic ownership.
At 20|30, we’re very open. We are not only asking our supporters for money,
we’re also asking them to join us on our journey. We are a grassroots
community of people working to create this future. This document ends with a
call to meet us after the crowdsale and be part of our future.

1. PROBLEM
The world economy is built on institutions that hold clients’ assets centrally:
banks, telecoms, insurance companies, brokers, drug companies,
governments, and more. Every year, hackers steal more than $400 billion and
about 1 trillion records from data centers. ​Most CIOs believe we are losing the
war on cybercrime​, even as we rely on them for more important data like
DNA, prescriptions, life logs, travel & driving history, criminal records,
algo-trading, credit scores, shopping, browsing, reputation, etc.
Our data is getting more and more concentrated in the hands of a few large
institutions. The buyers of big data love getting as much as they can from a
single vendor, so they can predict and monetize our behavior. Companies like
Facebook, Microsoft, ATT, LinkedIn, Experian, and Visa ​all exist to monetize
their users’ data​.
The European Commission’s ​Fire Study of Next Generation Internet​ recently
concluded that ...
1. Internet should ensure citizens' sovereignty over their
own data and protect privacy;
2. Internet should ensure diversity, pluralism and a right
to choose; and
3. Internet should avoid the concentration of data in a
few proprietary platforms.
4. Personal Data Spaces was seen as a very important
technology area for all the above top ranked values.

This is the problem the Pillar project will address. We want to give people a
better, safer digital experience. We have two main objectives:
Replace accounts with atomic ownership. ​We all have dozens of
accounts. With accounts, you log in and all your valuable data is
trapped inside the app or the service. This presents huge concentration
risk. It’s easier to get a divorce than to change banks or stock brokers.
By switching from accounts to wallets, each person owns his/her own
assets and can switch between vendors freely.
Replace apps with services. ​Apps on our phones are miniature
desktop apps. Many of us have dozens of logins for apps that don’t talk
to each other. We believe that the personal data locker will replace iOS
and Android to become the operating system for all your devices.
These two changes will radically transform the way we use data. Do
consumers care? Not as much as they should. But they are starting to, and
governments are helping​. As ​the EU and other jurisdictions adopt strict data
privacy and portability standards​, the current paradigm will have to change.
The decentralization movement and technologies like blockchain will lead to a
fundamental paradigm shift, putting people in control of their digital lives.

2. SOLUTION: THE PERSONAL DATA LOCKER
David Siegel created the concept of the personal
data locker in early 2000 and ​published a book
about it in 2010​. There is an associated vision
video, which you can see here:

Personal Data Locker Vision
Today, we have the technology to make the
personal data locker a reality: blockchains. In
this world, you hold your assets in your own
secure wallet, making it difficult and unprofitable
to attack.
The Pillar wallet is our solution. It will be a
consumer product that looks very much like
today’s digital wallets, but it is just the very beginning of the personal data
locker. We will transform the wallet experience from something you use
occasionally to trade currencies to something you use most of the time as you
go about your day.
We believe that browsers and wallets will converge, and that combination just
happens to describe the personal data locker. The Pillar wallet will let you
manage everything you own, everything you have, everything you want,
everything you consume, and everything you do online.

Key Terms
Atomic ownership​ of private keys means that personal data, currencies, and
assets are not held or controlled by any third party. Only you have the keys to
this data. If you lose your keys, your data or value is lost (there are several
ways to help consumers manage their keys safely).
Accounts​ involve logging in and creating an account with a company you must
trust to back up and safeguard your data, including credit-card info,
passwords, etc.. If your account is compromised, you lose your data, identity,
or value.

The ecosystem as described in David’s book is just starting. Many groups will
build pieces that incrementally fit together. Having seen many such projects
come and go over the years, we are well aware what it takes to succeed. But
first …

3. UNDERSTANDING CONSUMER RESISTANCE
We have been in the personal-data space for many years. Our biggest
challenge isn’t technical, it’s consumer behavior.

3.1 Two Immutable Laws
The following two graphs show why very little progress has been made over
the past twenty years:

As contributors to the World Economic Forum report, ​Personal Data: The
Emergence of a New Asset Class​, and part of the identity community for many
years, we believe these are immutable laws that will not bend or change for
anyone. Our biggest barrier is that most people don’t perceive any problem.

3.2 Solutions, not Tools
But that is not the right way to look at it. We have been trying to give
consumers tools, when we should be giving them solutions. Now that we
understand how to work with blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and tokens, we
can start to give consumers a much better experience. A few g ood indicators:

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

10

The Lykke wallet and exchange​ ​is an easy-to-use mobile app that
looks like a familiar trading app but keeps all customer assets on the
phone itself.
The Brave browser​ is an open-source browser, that will make it easy
to spend or tip for content as you browse, eliminating middlemen.
The Token App​ is a mobile browser with global payments built in.
Sovrin​ is a blockchain-based, permissioned identity system with a
growing group of developers.
Civic​ is a secure identity platform that will soon use its own tokens.
U-Port​ ​is an identity and reputation system you create yourself.
The Internet of People​ is an open-source stack for managing identity
and reputation.
Identity and ​reputation​ have been sticking points in the adoption of the
personal data locker. Blockchain technology is changing that. There are many
upcoming systems for ​preserving privacy​ and increasing ​scalability​. We don’t
plan to choose sides - we will incorporate anything that gets traction.
We know consumers don’t want to work with their own data, but that doesn’t
mean they don’t want to own it. They do want to own it, but they don’t want
the hassle of managing it. They want a software system that does it for them:
●
●

●

●

●
●

When they visit the doctor, they want the paperwork to take care of
itself.
When they drive their car (or their car drives them), they want the data
to go to their personal data locker, not to the manufacturer’s web site
for another siloed log-in.
When they have an airplane ticket and their plans change, they want
their locker to extend their hotel reservation, sell their ticket and buy a
new one.
People want their investment portfolio to manage itself according to
their wishes, not deal with accounts, sales people, and limited
selection.
When looking for a new job, they want jobs to come to them, rather
than having to send applications.
The weather forecast can automatically tell their home or building to
prepare for a storm, without them having to do anything manually.

●

People want their reputation, (KYC package), attestations, and history
to go with them whenever they want to use a new service.
If it’s easy, people want systems that give out only as much
information as necessary to complete a transaction, not more. So you
can order things online and the stores don’t even know your address,
and you can say where the package should go, even if you’re on the
road.

If the system lets them own their own data and their software does the work
for them, people will stop trusting big institutions to do it, because ​that​ will be
more of a hassle. It’s all about the hassle factor.
It ​has​ to be hassle-free. We need to bring a combination of blockchain, AI,
chatbots, and smart interfaces to create an easy-to-use solution.

3.3 Market
With the personal data locker, we are going after a much larger market than
the “native crypto market” - people who want to use smart contracts for
everything. Our markets are technology early adopters and cryptocurrency
early majority.

We will start with early adopters and work our way toward the much larger
early-majority segments later. Customer acquisition will be a mix of retail,
partner, and OEM strategies. With the open-source Pillar wallet as a
foundation, and with further data-protection and consumer-protection
Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

legislation a certainty, we plan to flip the old paradigm of control/push to a
new world of response/pull.
In aiming this product at advanced consumers, we aren’t forgetting the
corporate and white-label (OEM) markets. We will provide our wallet through
many software companies, banks, wealth-management firms, and more. It
will be easy to integrate with their existing systems.

4. THE PILLAR WALLET
In case you haven’t seen or used a wallet, you can watch David’s ​video tour of
the Lykke wallet​ to see one in action. In essence, a wallet is software that
holds the private keys to your assets sitting on a blockchain. You transact by
“signing” orders. The Pillar wallet will hold keys and let you transact with
many blockchains, and it will eventually be the control panel you use to
interact with the digital world.

Using a wallet, there is no account.
You hold the private keys to your
cryptocurrency (bitcoin, ether, etc.)
and you use cryptocurrencies or
digital tokens to “pay as you go,”
for the service using
micropayments. The service may
never know who you are. This is
what the Brave browser will do.
This is how people will pay for
many services in the future. You can think of tokens as tradable API keys.

4.1 What is the Pillar Wallet?
There are many cryptocurrency wallets already. The Pillar wallet will be …
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Multi-chain: able to see hundreds of kinds of tokens and coins.
Open source.
Not tied to any one browser.
Not tied to any one exchange - you can choose your exchange.
Easy for software companies to incorporate into their systems.
Both on desktop and mobile.
Stand-alone and OEM.

The wallet comes in two basic versions:
●

An account-based wallet​ that lets the user see his/her coins and
tokens. This would be similar to what CoinBase recently provided to
Fidelity. We wouldn’t offer this wallet directly but through OEM
companies who want this wallet for compatibility with their
account-based systems.

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

14

●

An atomic version​ that gives the user full control of her assets. This is
similar to the Lykke wallet today but independent of any exchange.

The Pillar wallet is not an exchange. ​Token​, which has a built-in exchange, is
an excellent example of how wallets, exchanges, and browsers are
converging. The ​Jaxx wallet​, which has already integrated many blockchains,
and ​the Lykke wallet​, have many assets, but they won’t focus on our
personal-assistant functionality.
We expect to partner with several exchanges. In fact, we want Pillar users to
put their buy/sell orders into our API and let exchanges compete for their
business. This solves the liquidity problem: any order can now be filled from
any exchange that participates in the network. The Pillar token is a
meta-token, and the Pillar exchange is a meta-exchange.
The Pillar wallet isn’t a browser - a browser is based on search and push, like
the web is today. Even Siri mostly brings you search results in a browser. We
believe browsing will eventually become asking and requesting, and the
information will come to you.
As the Pillar ecosystem emerges, these functions will converge, and we’ll
provide these services to many other platforms …
The internet of smart contracts is an internet
of offers. Our wallet will find and interact
with smart contracts. We will help industries
reformat their data so our wallet can see it
(the pillar token provides the incentive).
We believe the wallet will be the center of
your world. Everything will tie into the
wallet, and we’ll use fewer and fewer apps.
Eventually, we’ll stop calling it a wallet and
call it the Pillar personal data locker.

4.2 Integrations
In the next phase, we will create and/or partner with other companies to
provide ...
Multi-exchange support​ is important, because many of the use cases for
the system require an exchange. We plan to partner with one or more

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

15

exchanges that will plug into our open-source system. As our network grows,
we will create more competition and tighter spreads.
Smart contract aware​ is a new frontier of findability in the web of value. It’s
possible today to invoke a smart contract and send it ether, but finding the
smart contracts in the first place is getting to be more and more of a
challenge. This “searching the web of value” will take some work, but we are
inspired by the ​Userfeeds​ and ​ether ontology​ projects.
A fiat exchange​ that interfaces to the banking system requires licenses. We
will look for partners who want to provide these exchange services to our
platform.
Portfolio and wealth management​ will integrate your coin- and
token-based holdings, give you investing and risk-management tools,
investment advice​, and secure your assets while making sure you have the
petty cash to spend as you like.
Shopping services ​that work with ecommerce sites accepting
cryptocurrencies, will be integrated.
Identity services ​will be provided by several different standards. We plan to
integrate all of them, so people can easily plug into the system and bring their
identity with them. People will likely use more than one identity system, so
they can have different personas in the personal data locker.
Messaging and social sharing​ are already being done by several groups,
most of them are open source. We will integrate one or more of these.
Job matching​ - we expect to offer a revolutionary new job and freelance
matching engine.
Search​ - find offers on the web of value and bring them back.
People search​ - find others and connect your various social graphs.
Calendars and scheduling services​ that interact with today’s most popular
calendars. Ties into various professional schedulers.
Smart contract control center ​shows all your obligations, escrow, assets,
and is tied to your calendar, balance sheet, and other parts to give you a
complete smart-contract management system.
Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

16

All our wallets and extensions will be open-source. Many apps will be free or
open-source, and many apps will have subscription or pay-as-you-go models.
In all cases, you own and control your own assets - no one else has access to
them. Open source is the only way to do this - our token (described later)
provides the business model to make the Pillar ecosystem come to life.

4.3 Personal Data Locker Services
Once the basic extensions are in place, we can start creating vertical
solutions. Here is a sample of the services we expect, many of which are
described in ​Pull​:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Peer-to-Peer lending
Wealth management
Asset management
Classified ads, auctions, and barter exchange
Peer-to-peer currency exchange
Finding contract work
Finding employment
Finding an apartment to buy or rent
Digital birth certificate ecosystem for products
Etc.

These aren’t what you may be thinking. On your phone or desktop today,
these are separate apps. They barely talk with each other. The personal data
locker is a world of pull, where you say what you’re looking for, and the offers
and information come to you. You can have long-standing requests that
match when the appropriate find is made, or short-term requests that
immediately result in a number of offers to choose from. We will focus on
bringing in content and offers. We don’t think of it as a browser, we think of it
as a personal data locker as described in ​Pull​. Everything is on your terms no apps, no web sites, no ads (unless you want ads).

4.4 Stack
As the wallet grows into the personal data locker, it will have more and more
layers of standards, services, and features. For example, you may have
different personas that you can use in different modes and maintain privacy.
You may integrate many features with other members of your family or work.
Our stack isn’t completely fleshed out yet, but here is a general idea ...

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

17

4.5 White-Label Wallets
We don’t have an exchange. We don’t have a browser. Therefore, we can
provide our wallet to many companies’ software systems, either to add
cryptocurrencies to their current capabilities, or to help them transition to
atomic ownership of assets. We will provide a white-label wallet any company
can put their own logo on or integrate into their own system. We will focus on
the extra services you get with our wallet that you don’t get with other
wallets. We hope this will entice many software companies to use our wallet
and get their clients using Pillar tokens.

4.6 Transition to Atomic Ownership
For a long time, we will support both account-based and atomic-based
wallets. The look and feel should be almost the same. As more and more
people are comfortable transitioning to the atomic wallet, the customer
experience will be easy. Rather than logging into a centralized service, you’ll
establish your password and make sure it’s backed up or shared with people
you trust. From there on, your assets will be fully under your control.
We expect atomic ownership will be attractive to our OEM and white-label
customers, both because it will be better for customers and because
regulators will push them along this path.
The wallet is the new operating system​ - a few people have figured this out
already, but it’s still early days in the race. The wallet is everything - in ten
years our wallets will become digital assistants, powered by voice, gesture,
data, and artificial intelligence. The wallet is the new platform that will power
phones, cars, glasses, tablets, interactive displays, and more. Wear your
Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

18

wallet on your finger or wrist and get instant access to everything. This space
is going to innovate quickly, and we plan to be part of it. The Pillar wallet may
be just the right thing at the right time.

4.7 Private Key and Password Management
If you own your own data, you are responsible for safeguarding it. There are
many ways we will help consumers do this. There are also plenty of ​hardware
solutions​. Eventually, we’ll use rings, watches, bracelets, even chip implants
to verify who we are. We plan to give consumers many options.

5. THE PILLAR TOKEN
The native utility token for this system, the pillar, will be necessary for the
system to function and will be independent of any cryptocurrency. It will be
an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be a unit of value within
our system.

5.1 What does the Pillar Token Do?
While the wallet and platform are open-source and free, users will pay for the
various services with pillar tokens (PLRs) as they use them. The token will
power the entire ecosystem, giving an instant business model to many
projects that can tie in. This is the beauty of a token: you may need a service
exactly once and you won’t need to sign up for it, you’ll just pay in pillars and
you’re done.
Many services will be free. For example, most exchanges don’t charge a fee,
they take their fees from the money you’re exchanging. Many more will be
ad-driven, and you’ll be in charge of the ads you see. Importantly, you’ll be
able to “monetize yourself” by asking for offers and providing yourself as a
lead to marketers.
Here’s an example: you go see your doctor, she does some tests and gives
you a prescription for some pills. All the data from that visit, and the
prescription, will be copied to your wallet. Your data can even go to a study
being done - with your permission, and even though you’re anonymous in the
study, if they want to send you a message, you’ll have a choice of receiving it.
Another example: You book a hotel room and rent a car. These are now smart
contracts. They require deposits and some kind of insurance token. The Pillar
wallet handles all these details for you, managing all your smart-contract
obligations, deposits, refunds, etc.
Looking for a new bike? Just specify what you want, using our product
taxonomy or chatbot, and all the bikes that fit that description come to you
for sorting and viewing. The data will come from each source, rather than
from aggregators. You don’t see web sites, you see offers.
More and more services will accept pillars. The average person may pay
$20-$40 per year in such services, and in return be in total control of her
assets and ad exposure. The money goes directly to service providers - we
don’t take a cut.

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

20

We will likely integrate the Brave browser​, so you can use the browser’s
built-in token to pay for content as you consume it. We may integrate other
browsers.
We expect to integrate one or more exchanges.​ It should be easy to pay
for what you want, using whatever currency you like. We plan to make it so
you can pay in pillars for everything. We will partner with several exchanges,
so you can plug in the one you want or use the exchange that’s right for each
transaction. Long-term, we plan to create an exchange marketplace, where
exchanges bid for your transaction in real time.
We don’t have a set scheme for fees. We believe market forces will keep fees
low. Fees will be flexible, possibly like bitcoin’s auction system. Since there
will be competition, you will always see the best market rate for services and
low fees.

5.2 The Pillar Token is a Meta-Token
Brave has a native token for seeing customized ads and monetizing your
browsing experience. Augur has a token for betting. Akasha has one for
messaging. Civic has a token for identity. All these tokens will be native in our
system one level below the Pillar token. Users may only ever use Pillar tokens,
and the system handles all the various tokens needed to do what they want.
Or they may see and use the various utility tokens directly.
So there are five possible levels people may see:
●
●
●
●
●

Fiat currencies only - they will see no tokens at all, even though there
are many tokens at work. It will look and feel more like an account.
Just whatever cryptocurrency they happen to like, or a mix.
A combination of fiat currency, cryptocurrencies, and pillars.
A combination of fiat, pillars, and the native tokens for each service.
Possibly no fiat currency at all - only tokens and cryptocurrencies.

In a reverse way, the pillar token could be used to feed payments in from
around the web. A vendor or individual may offer something for sale
(consulting time, fidget spinners, hotel rooms), and buyers can buy in any
currency they like, but the vendor can be paid in pillars (or any other
cryptocurrency). So pillars are the basic fungible unit of value between all
these systems.

5.3 Marketing & Partnerships
Ask anyone who has created a successful platform — it’s every bit as much
about communication and education as it is about building a quality service.
There are hundreds of wallets on the market. We believe the Pillar token will
be the viral component. The more companies integrate their services and use
our token, the more it becomes a standard, and the more people will want it.
We plan to dedicate serious resources to education, marketing, and
communications. We want the open-source Pillar wallet to be ubiquitous.
We will have a partnership program to help developers and others integrate
our wallet into their software.

5.4 Governance
Token governance is ​more complex than many people realize​. The personal
data locker will become part of hundreds of millions of people’s lives, and the
Pillar token will be making things work. As there are a fixed number of tokens
after the ICO, market forces will determine prices and behavior. However,
anyone with a large supply of pillars will be able to move markets and
influence policy. Therefore, we plan to take stewardship of this token very
seriously and watch for any potential issues that need attention. This is a new
area of commerce. Most open-source projects have governing bodies, but
they don’t have to think about tokens. We hope to show the way forward in
token governance and teach other groups what we have learned.
The biggest risk is forking. As we have seen with the Ethereum project, a hard
fork is a very serious event in the life of a system. Regarding splits, our goal
is to create a self-healing system and have a governance council that will take
all stakeholders into account when making decisions.
There are small things we can do to manage the token’s fiscal and monetary
policies. We could be market makers, we can purchase tokens, and we can
burn or ice tokens. We will be very transparent about our plans and include all
stakeholders in our discussions.

6. EXECUTION PLAN
This section describes the methodology, not the specific solutions. At a
fundamental level, the Pillar system represents the convergence of the
semantic web and the web of value. The combination is far more powerful
than the two separately. Eventually, we will add AI to make the customer
experience easy and intuitive.

6.1 Team Building
We don’t believe in resumes or interviews. We have a community approach to
building the necessary team for all our projects. You may not see the usual
experts on our team - though we have many. Our approach is to invite people
to work with us and see who is aligned with our purpose. Much of the team
building for this project will take place at our summer event in August.
In general, we prefer creative generalists who can go with the flow than
specialists who can only see a narrow problem and narrow solution. We will
hire mostly generalists and hire specialists as consultants.
Want to be part of it? Come to Slovakia in August and you probably will be.

6.2 Architecture
We don’t have a set architecture for our wallet. We plan to keep building and
modifying, throw away code as it gets out of date, and stay market-focused in
delivering small units that work. We first have to build the world’s best
open-source multi-chain wallet as the “trunk” then keep adding as we have
partners and use cases that drive adoption.

6.3 Foundation: Collaboration
We plan to work with several projects we know well and have code we can
start with. We plan to meet and collaborate with everyone in our space. A few
notable projects:

There are others. We are coming from the wallet side. We will have many
options to choose from as we build a community of contributors and partners
for the Pillar project.

6.4 Data Conversion
To transition from apps and web sites, the right data and content must flow in
and out of the personal data locker. This is a huge job - the more you
understand it, the more you see how big the project is. Fortunately, as David
mentions in his book, we can use existing vocabularies, taxonomies, and ​APIs
to bring data in and understand it. The state of the art in AI and big data have
reached a point where it is commercially feasible to work with unformatted
data and reformat it to suit our purposes - this can be seen by the fact that
Google can now tell you whether a store or restaurant is open just after you
type in its name. We are just now at a point where the personal data locker
can make sense of much of the data online.
We will take it one use case at a time and incentivize many partners, who will
want to be paid in pillars. David’s book ​and his recent essay on smart data
describe many of the details.

6.5 Digital Birth Certificates
A chapter in ​Pull​ describes the digital birth certificate - a digital identifier for
every individual person, animal, and item on earth. This is not a new concept.
There are plenty of systems already identifying individual items (as opposed
to a class of items) and their condition and location.
The Internet of Things is bringing to life the concepts outlined in David’s book.
Everything will have a unique identifier, and that identifier will point to its
description, and that description will have a place on some blockchain to
create ​the economy of things​. We will start integrating these new systems and
continue to support the standardization of data in this area.

6.6 Data Security
All the current development around blockchain-based data involves atomic
ownership. This is a very active area of research and development. The Pillar
Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

24

wallet will become the hub for people to aggregate and use their own data.
Data storage options include:
●
●
●
●

Decentralized storage
On blockchain
On the user’s device
In datacenters

All these options already have methods for hashing, storing, managing, and
retrieving data. Increased requirements for data privacy and protection will
accelerate adoption of the personal data locker. The personal data locker is
just the right solution at the right time.
A key concept is the principle of ​least privilege​: giving out just the information
necessary to consummate a transaction. Today, consumers give out far too
much information, leading to the problems we have outlined above. Your
personal data locker will help you manage this process. In many cases, we
can use proxies that prevent vendors from capturing so much personal data,
including physical addresses. This is a new ecosystem of trusted and trustless
partners and data providers. It’s already growing. The personal data locker
will give it much needed momentum.

7. FINANCIALS
While most white papers are very light on financial projections, we want to
explain our thinking.

7.1 Use of Proceeds
We are well aware of the difficulties of large-scale software development and
the failure of most projects to communicate and document clearly what has
been produced. We will need to evangelize and promote our wallet, get as
many customers to use it as possible, and explain the value of the token to
people many times. This project will have its own P&L, which will be available
on the project’s web site and updated monthly. The team will be based in
London to start. This is an agile business. We can’t know or plan how things
will work out. We will have to launch and learn. For that reason, many
parameters of this ecosystem are left intentionally unspecified.

7.2 The Planning Fallacy
It would be great if we could script each month of the next five years and
connect the dots to success. Every new venture is a lottery ticket, a chance to
build a network that may or may not materialize. Most won’t. Too many
Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

25

project plans suffer from overprecision. We keep Eric Schmidt, chairman of
Alphabet’s words in mind:

“One of the biggest reasons for our success, though, is that the plan we
delivered to the board that day in 2003 wasn’t much of a plan at all. There
were no financial projections or discussions of revenue streams. There was
no market research on what users, advertisers, or partners wanted or how
they fit into nicely defined market segments. There was no concept of
market research or discussion of which advertisers we would target first.
[…] We left that out for the simple reason we didn’t know how we were
going to do it.”
That said, it’s worth the exercise to get started. Here is our proposed budget
for five years, realizing that we will learn as we go.

7.3 Budget
Any budget or forecast is a work of fiction. Given the magnitude of the
project, we believe these numbers are realistic and conservative. We are here
to change the world. If we are doing OEM deals, we could double these
numbers:

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

26

7.4 Beyond Budgeting
What we know from start-up data is that running out of cash is one of the
number one causes of failure (for the other three causes, see ​David’s talk on
entrepreneurship​). All companies should do rolling, agile forecasts and
budgets, as described in the amazing book, ​Future Ready​, by Steve Morlidge
and Steve Player.
With that in mind, we believe that to create the world’s most powerful, most
successful wallet takes a combination of spirit, persistence, skill, cash, and
luck. We will have to spend smart and work hard to promote and evangelize
the Pillar system. We can’t be too specific on how the next several years will
play out.
We will use rolling forecasts as a tool and teach other start-ups how to apply
Beyond Budgeting principles​ to their projects.

7.5 Money Management
We expect to raise enough money for five years. We plan to diversify our
holdings. We will purchase ​our own index tokens​, to help diversify. We also
plan to participate in the pre-sale of projects that will fit into the Pillar system.
This will be a small portion of our holdings, but it should help create an
ecosystem around the personal data locker.

7.6 Transparency
We will put all financials and progress on our web site and update it once a
month. We will post a financial report once a quarter. Our Slack is open - feel
free to come ask questions.

8. ABOUT 20|30
Twenty Thirty AG is a corporation based in Zug, Switzerland, founded in
January 2017. It is David Siegel’s 22nd company. We don’t believe in boards
of directors (​been there, done that​). We don’t believe in community voting
unless it’s done very carefully (​voting is easily skewed​). We believe in getting
actively involved, discussing, making agile, rolling decisions as we go. We
have a strong bias for open-source and running code. We expect to run
internship programs, give grants, do pro-bono projects, create educational
materials, sponsor or run events, work with city and national governments,
and partner with other companies and institutions to spread the principles and
tools of decentralization around the world. The Pillar project is our flagship
project. We’re here to change the world.

8.1 Culture
No matter how much money we raise, we will always adhere to our guiding
principles (laid out in an essay called ​The Culture Deck​):
● HOW matters.
● Stay lean - no fat salaries, no fancy offices, set up a dorm for people to
sleep in when they come work with us.
● Work in the same room as much as possible.
● Take care of each other, build a family culture. Employees first,
customers second.
● We don’t look at resumes and we don’t interview. We work with
volunteers until they are ready to transition to part-time, and then
full-time employment. ​Culture fit is more important than skill.​ We can
teach skills. ​We want friendly, eager people who are willing to do what
it takes.
● No HR, no management, no board, no traditional business beliefs.
Measure everything, try new things, learn what works.
● Continuous delivery in one-week cycles. Keep the code working.
● Continuous improvement - make things better every day.
● Use ​Kanban​ - make ​Kanban​ your religion. Create joy at work.
● Invite everyone to join us. Our community is our foundation.
● Give to the crypto community. We plan to give research grants, do free
events, publish, and more.
● Communicate, communicate, communicate. Don’t underestimate what
it takes to get people to learn and try something new.
20|30 has no management structure and no hierarchy. Our model is that of a
hive, with people doing what they love to do and swarming to solve problems.
Join us.

9. CROWDSALE
The Pillar crowdsale will take place over 60 hours, from 8am GMT on
Saturday, July 15 to 8pm GMT on Monday, July 17. During this time, the price
will be fixed in ether. In fact, the actual time of the sale will be measured in
blocks, not minutes, and our web site will keep an updated count of blocks
with an estimated time until the sale ends - it should be between 59 and 61
hours. We will put the price on the web site on July 14, so people can plan
their allocations.
Each token will be an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain — we will use
a smart contract and return tokens to the buyer’s ether address. In the case
of not meeting our minimum, we will return ether instead.
Refer to the Terms and Conditions document for final details. This is a
summary ...

9.1 Token Allocation
A total of 800 million tokens will be issued. This is how it breaks down in
dollars during planning - the actual price in ether is subject to change (blue
means an input):
8 July 2017​: We had to reallocate 42 million tokens from the sale to the
presale as a result of overwhelming demand. Figures below are current:

Here are details of the above chart:

The presale​ will take place using a smart contract and an ether address that
will be sent with instructions by email and may or may not be on a web page.
The presale is limited to 48 million tokens. Several of the people working on
the project will be purchasing at this time. Price per token has not yet been
set.
The token sale ​will offer 528,000,000 tokens to the public. They will be sold
using a smart contract until all 528 million have been sold, or 60 hours,
whichever comes first. The price will be set in ether. Buyers will receive
ERC20 tokens at the conclusion of the sale.
All unsold tokens from both the presale and the sale​ will immediately go
on ice for ten years using a smart contract. They can’t be touched during that
time. We expect they will be transferred to a nonprofit that will govern the
tokens before then, but until that time they will remain property of 20|30.
After ten years, they may be sold, re-iced, or burned according to our
token-management directives, which will evolve along with the system.
The minimum raise for presale and sale combined​ will be around $8
million, set ahead of the sale and priced in ether (approximately 80 million
tokens).
The target ​is roughly $30 million at the sale-time ether price.
The cap​ will be 560 million tokens.
The marketing effort will receive 24 million tokens, or 3 percent. ​This
is to pay all the people and companies who have worked so hard to create
and manage the token sale. 1 percent of these tokens will be tradable
immediately — they are bounty and contest rewards. The other two percent
will be locked up for 9 months after the sale ends.
We reserve the right to use some or all of ​the 15 percent of tokens
reserved for later funding​ as follows:
1. To provide liquidity ​on one or more exchanges. Tokens not being
used for liquidity will be “off the market.”
2. To give to people​ who will develop services for our system.
3. To offer them as prizes​ in contests to help expand the system with
innovative services.
4. For future offerings. ​Assuming a strong initial sale, we don’t plan
another offering for at least three years. If we reach our cap, we will
freeze all these tokens for three years.
Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

35

5. We may burn or ice tokens ​if we feel that it contributes positively to
the ecosystem.
The ten percent of tokens reserved for Twenty Thirty ​will be dedicated
to funding projects that will be built on top of the Pillar system. We will give
them to developers to develop parts that will work with the system. We’ll use
them to fund our own projects. They will be an asset of the corporation. These
tokens will go on ice for three years.

9.2 Token Sale
The sale will take place over 60 hours, beginning on July 15 at 08:00 GMT.
Tokens will be priced immediately before the sale in ether. The sale will take
place at that fixed price over 60 hours (measured in blocks on the Ethereum
blockchain) or until all 560 million are sold. There will be no discounts. At the
end, all unsold public tokens will be put on ice for ten years, as described
above.

9.3 Token Trading
We expect to list our tokens on an exchange as soon as possible after the
close of the crowdsale. We will put this information on our web site as soon as
it is available.

10. SUMMER EVENT
Pillar is a big project. We’re in it for the long run. We are very serious about
involving everyone who is interested in working with us. We don’t care about
your education or resume or interview skills. We invite you to come work with
us.
We have no intention of squandering the money we acquire in our
crowdfunding event. We treat every ether as if it were our own. After the
crowdfunding, we plan to have a grass-roots unconference at ​AquaCity in
Poprad, Slovakia​, to socialize, learn, teach, plan, and hire. Anyone who comes
to Poprad in early August is probably a person we want to hire. Every
morning, we will have blockchain learning and Pillar planning sessions. We will
have tracks for central services, product, and marketing. If you are reading
this, you are welcome to join us.
The event will take place from 29 July to 6 August. Direct flights from London
are available. We have reserved 19 rooms, but they are going fast and people
are finding roommates. Rooms are very limited for the resort, but there are
hotel rooms not far away. We’ll be working in the mornings and trying not to
work in the afternoons. It’s a family event - bring your kids. Big party on
Friday the 4th. To reserve your room, contact ​Tomer@2030.io​. Don’t wait for
our ICO - rooms are going fast. Contact Tomer now to get one.

11. LONDON OFFICE
In September 2017, we plan to open London’s first open blockchain
innovation center. It won’t be fancy, but it will be a community center where
people can collaborate to build the Pillar wallet. We also plan to rent a few
small flats that will become our dorm, where people can stay while they work
with us for weeks or months.
