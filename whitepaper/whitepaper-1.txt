Introduction
It’s hard to trust anyone these days, especially in a world where everything happens online.
The days of meeting people, shaking their hand, doing a deal is long gone. We need to feel
safe when doing transactions online.

This is where Natmin Pure Escrow comes into the picture. We aim to revolutionize the Escrow
industry with secure transactions backed by Blockchain Technology for a fraction of the price
of a conventional Escrow service.

The Natmin Token is built on the ERC223 standard using the Ethereum Blockchain, making it a
widely used and accepted standard.

Our Vision
Our vision is to develop a secure and trustworthy platform where buyers and sellers can
transact, knowing their money is safe. We want to provide an effortless experience with low
transaction fees.

We want to inspire confidence in the platform with the use of a Node voting system. Only valid
and honest votes will be rewarded, thus promoting the truthful assessment of documentation
provided. Points will be given to these Nodes, which will increase their reputation within the
Natmin Platform.

What is a Decentralized Escrow Service?
In a conventional Escrow world, the Escrow company facilitates everything about the
transaction: receiving the money, confirming the buyer has received their items, and releasing
the funds to the seller. Processes like this can take a lot of time.

In a Decentralized Escrow world however, the major difference is the blockchain and Smart
Contracts are the Escrow company. This makes the transactions exponentially quicker, much
more secure and can cost a fraction of the price. There is no corruption and officials can’t be
bought.

For example: In a conventional Escrow world, a simple domain transfer can take days for the
seller to receive their money, but in a decentralized world that process could take a matter of
hours.

Industry Statistics
There has been an influx of online transactions between buyers and sellers over the past
several years, but unfortunately there has also been an influx of fraud in online transactions.
The chart below shows the increase of “buying and selling” related fraud transactions
recorded in Australia alone over the past 4 years.

Recorded Fraud Transactions

Six months into 2018 and the number of recorded fraud transactions has already reached a
staggering $7,387,744. That is 74.1% of the total amount recorded in 2017.
This fraud could have been avoided if a secure and trusted Escrow Service was used to
facilitate the transactions. Natmin Pure Escrow prides itself in providing a secure service to
help prevent the losses consumers otherwise would have faced due to fraud.

What is Natmin?
Natmin Pure Escrow is a decentralized application that provides pure Escrow Services built on
Blockchain Technology. We aim to revolutionize the Escrow industry by utilizing Blockchain
Technology to facilitate Escrow transactions for a fraction of the price of conventional Escrow
services.

Natmin is a self-regulating system that provides secure transactions between the buyer and
seller with extremely low fees. Natmin utilizes smart contract technology to implement and
regulate Escrow transactions. This removes the need for a middleman, thus reducing
transaction costs and the possibility of fraud.

The Natmin Token (NAT) ensures utmost security and peace of mind between the buyer and
seller. It is built on the widely used and accepted ERC223 standard using the Ethereum
Blockchain.

Why use Natmin?
We live in a world where convenience has become the great commodity. Our time is precious,
and anything that cuts down on wasted time is seen as a boon. Unfortunately, sometimes this
convenience can lead to a degradation of quality. It's all well and good to offer a wide variety
of products, but it's a vastly different matter to have everyone involved knowledgeable on all
products. Sometimes the quality of care you receive is not as extensive as what you would get
from someone who specializes in the product you are after.
Would you buy a big-ticket item like a car from a grocery store, or from a dealer whose job it is
to know everything about the product they are selling and compare it to others in the market?
At Natmin Pure Escrow, we believe in a superior quality of service. How we deliver this to you
is simple: our sole focus and specialty is Escrow services. We don't need to tie you down with
unrelated offers or find other ways to grab your business, because our sole concern is Escrow
services. We don't need to insert non-Escrow related services into our platform to make it
more appealing, because that is not why you need us. You need us for Escrow services, and
that is what we deliver. No gimmicks, no loopholes, no wasted time.
All of our time and effort goes into Escrow services. We believe this commitment and superior
quality of service is what sets us apart from our competition, and what makes us the wiser
choice in all Escrow related services.

Some key aspects where we outperform others:





Lower transaction fees.
The easy navigation of our platform.
We enforce AML/CTF regulation, which provide peace of mind for our customers.
Voter reputations inspires confidence in our dispute system.

How does Natmin work?
Natmin has a minimum of 6 steps in the transaction process depending on the outcome of the
transaction.

Normal Transaction
Step 1: Create Transaction

Either the buyer or seller can create the transaction.

Step 2: Agree to terms
Both parties are presented with the terms of the transaction and both need to agree.

Step 3: Buyer funds the account
Once the terms are agreed upon, the buyer will fund the escrow transaction account.

Step 4: Seller sends the items
Once payment is confirmed, the seller will be notified to send the items.

Step 5: Buyer receives the items
The buyer confirms receipt of the items or has the option to open a dispute.

Step 6: Seller funds are released

Once the transaction is settled, the funds are released to the seller.

How does Natmin work? (Continued)
Dispute Transaction
Step 1: Dispute is raised
Either the buyer or seller can initiate a dispute.

Step 2: Provide supporting documents
Parties are required to provide supporting documents about the dispute.

Step 3: Supporting documents validation
NAT Nodes vote on the sufficiency of the supporting documents.

Step 4: Parties can appeal
Either party has the option to appeal the decision.

Step 5: Second round of voting
The dispute transaction is subjected to a second round of voting if an appeal was made. Second round decision is final.

Step 6: Complete transaction
Funds are either released to the seller or refunded to the buyer.

The Natmin Token
The Natmin Token (NAT) is a digital token that powers the Escrow platform. It will be used to
fund transactions between buyers and sellers. It also ensures utmost security and peace of
mind between the buyer and seller.

NAT is an unmineable token built on the ERC223 standard using the Ethereum Blockchain,
which makes it a widely used and accepted standard. The upcoming Token Generation Event
(TGE) will be the only time Natmin Tokens will be created.

NAT has a fixed supply and platform users will be able to acquire the NAT Token directly from
the platform or from various exchanges after the Token Generation Event.

NATMIN PURE ESCROW PTY LTD | ACN 626 770 232 | ABN 37 626 770 232

P a g e | 12

The Token Economy
Just like any other cryptocurrency, we expect to be listed on various cryptocurrency exchanges
to provide the best possible liquidity solutions for our clients. With the increased popularity of
cryptocurrencies, tokens and decentralized applications in conjunction with our marketing
strategy, we aim to increase the popularity of the Natmin Platform and in-turn increase the
value of the Natmin Token (NAT).

We will achieve this in a few different ways, which includes acquiring business partners, our
future development strategy and our token burning strategy.

Our future development strategy includes the implementation of currency conversion from
Fiat to Tokens (for the buyer), as well as the conversion from Tokens to Fiat (for the seller).
This will give the Natmin Platform the ability and means to be widely accepted and thus
increasing the popularity and value of the NAT Token.

Our token burning strategy include the instant burning of all unsold TGE tokens. A token
amount equal to 100% of the unsold tokens will be instantly burned, decreasing the total
supply.

All referral bonus tokens, Airdrop tokens and tokens assigned to the team will be vested for
180 days.

NATMIN PURE ESCROW PTY LTD | ACN 626 770 232 | ABN 37 626 770 232

P a g e | 13

The Natmin Node
Any person can register on the platform and apply to become a Natmin Node. A Natmin Node
is a physical user that can stake NAT tokens within the platform to be eligible to participate in
dispute transactions. A Natmin Node can earn tokens for assessing the supporting documents
in a dispute transaction and then cast a vote accordingly. A Natmin Node will only be able to
earn tokens for doing work on the platform. A Natmin Node will not be able to earn tokens for
purely holding Natmin Tokens (NAT).

A Natmin Node will earn tokens equal to 16.66% of the allotted transaction fee. A Natmin
Node will automatically receive tokens when the transaction ends successfully and the Node’s
vote counted towards the success of the transaction. Please see the section “The Node Voting
Process” for a more detailed explanation. A dispute transaction will have 5 votes and needs a
success rate of at least 60%. That means 3/5 voters needs to be in favour of a successful
transaction.

Natmin Nodes will earn points on their contribution in the voting system. This inspires
confidence in the voting system and increases your earning potential.

NATMIN PURE ESCROW PTY LTD | ACN 626 770 232 | ABN 37 626 770 232

P a g e | 14

Natmin Transaction Fees
A successful uncomplicated transaction (a transaction without a dispute) will be subjected to a
fixed transaction fee. This is payable by the seller and will be deducted from the seller amount
on the successful completion of the transaction. This fixed transaction fee will be paid back to
the Natmin system to cover related blockchain transaction costs and system operating costs.

A disputed transaction will carry a cost of an additional fixed fee which is payable by the party
at fault. This fee will be determined by the system and according to the feedback from the
platform users. This fee can always change at any time without prior notice.

The dispute fee will be distributed according to the table below. For example: If a dispute is
made in relation to a $1000 transaction, the dispute fee will be $12. The $12 will be
distributed as set out below.

explanation on how to qualify for a payment.

P a g e | 15

The Node Voting Process
All voting will be done anonymously, and Nodes will not be able to see what other Nodes
voted. Nodes will be paid 16.66% of the allotted dispute fee. To be eligible to receive payment
for the vote, the vote needs to be on the majority side of the decision.
When the Node needs to assess the supporting documents and vote, the following question
will be asked: Was the supporting documents sufficient to complete the transaction
successfully? The Nodes will then need to vote either Yes or No after they assessed the
supporting documents.
(These are some example votes).
Example 1

Node 1

Node 2

The Node Points System
When a Node qualifies to receive a payment for a vote made in a dispute transaction, that
Node will also receive points accordingly. These points will be viewed as the Node’s
reputation within the Natmin Platform.

A Node will be awarded 2 points for a completed transaction if the vote qualified the Node to
receive payment for that vote. This means the vote result was on the majority side of the
decision (Please refer to the explanation and examples under the section “The Node Voting
Process”).

A Node will be deducted 1 point for a completed transaction if the vote disqualified the Node
to receive a payment for that vote. This means the vote result was on the minority side of the
decision (Please refer to the explanation and examples under the section “The Node Voting
Process”).

If a Node is deducted a total of 3 points, their rights to act as a Node will be revoked and will
not be able to apply again.

This points system is designed to inspire confidence in the voting process and to promote a
truthful assessment of the documentation provided in a dispute transaction.
