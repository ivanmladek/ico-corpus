Abstract

In this paper, we introduce Bodhi, the next generation blockchain based platform that decentralizes
the prediction market. Bodhi leverages the advantages of the state-of-the-art decentralized prediction
markets by integrating third-party Oracles and voting based decentralized Oracles via its Oracle abstraction layer. We intend to develop a novel replaceable Oracle framework where the prediction market
is more effective and autonomous. Bodhi will be deployed on Qtum at the initial launch.

I. I NTRODUCTION

Humanity has developed strong interests towards understanding history and predicting the
future. What will the weather be like tomorrow? Which soccer team will win the UEFA European
Championship later this year? Is Apple stock going below 100 USD per share on the first weekday
of next year? People attempt to predict the results of simple yet non-trivial questions. The desire
to predict what happens next has generated conventional prediction markets which are heavily
regulated, such as lottery systems and stock markets, as well as illegally operated underground
casinos and insider trading. Excessive regulation and legislation, implemented at large monetary
costs, greatly limit the prediction market from performing its market functions. Meanwhile,
conventional prediction markets have been heavily depending on centralized Oracles who set
all prediction results and their fairness and charge a large amount of money. The high cost of
these Oracles has significantly lowered the users’ willingness to participate and prevented the
prediction markets from large scale adoption.
Prediction Markets are platforms that allows individuals or a group of entities to predict
the outcomes of future events, and to be incentivised from the results. Incentives will be

redistributed upon the realization of outcomes of an event in which all parties participated.
The fortune redistribution follows a simple yet powerful rule, that the fortune flows from less
skillful and inaccurate participants to more skillful and accurate participants. In order to succeed
in the prediction, participants aggressively gather information, and apply mathematical modeling
to maximize the chance of prediction accurately. Statistically, the price associated with each
outcome has high positive correlation with each outcome. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the
prediction is largely determined by the number of participants. Starting from the very beginning of
information revolution, people has been devoted to making online prediction markets to minimize
the onboarding barrier for participating in prediction. However, centralized online products have
yet to earn people’s trust while excessive regulation and legal restrictions also greatly limits the
development of the prediction market.
With the deluge of the continuous development of blockchain technologies, there is an increasing trust within communities on enabling public blockchain as Oracle that is fair and
decentralized. Blockchain technology is a perfect candidate to form the building block of prediction market due to its characteristics such as information transparency and data immutability.
The fairness of blockchain makes the prediction market run at low-to-no administrative cost.
The application of Smart Contract empowers blockchain with a programmable and dynamic
decision-making capability. All of the above emerging phenomenon resulted in the creation of
decentralized prediction market.
Bodhi’s mission is to build a credible, autonomous, and scalable decentralized prediction
market that promotes the application of prediction market at a global scale to enhance the
effectiveness of decision-making process [1].

II. R ELATED W ORK

Augur [2] is a blockchain based decentralized prediction market. A user can create a prediction
event using Ethereum’s [3] smart contract, followed by other users’ predicting and pricing the
probability of each outcome through native tokens. When the event eventually happens, Augur
REP holders report to Augur the right prediction result. The REP holders are the building
blocks of Augur platform, where these holders maintain the platform and constitute the arbitration mechanism. However, as the Augur platform scales, a fully decentralized arbitration
mechanism becomes less efficient. When a large group of prediction events have been created,
it is increasingly challenging for REP holders to vote for all events. REP holders might also
have different domain expertise and have been exposed to events at different comfort levels.
The matchmaking process between an event and event-specific expertise has yet to be improved.
Moreover, problems such as high time-cost and low efficiency associated with REP holders result
in a longer cycle to reach a consensus at the end of a prediction event.
Similar to Augur, Gnosis [4] is another common blockchain based decentralized prediction
market that utilizes Ethereum’s smart contract for event creation and prediction. Unlike Augur,
Gnosis leverages a default centralized Oracle for judging prediction results. The advantage of
using such as centralized Oracle solution is that prediction judgment can be performed autonomously and therefore significantly increases the judgment efficiency. However, a centralized
Oracle solution can cause single point of failure in the events of, eg., server failure, and data
being maliciously tampered. When any of such events occurs, all predictions will be locked and
the credibility of Gnosis platform will be decreased.
Bodhi is the next generation blockchain based platform that decentralizes the prediction market
by overcoming the disadvantage of both Augur and Gnosis. In contrast to Augur, Bodhi uses
third-party Oracle to automatically judge the prediction results to guarantee the efficiency of

the decision making process. Different from Gnosis’ centralized Oracle solution, Bodhi enables
BOT holders to take over the voting process and make the final decision of a prediction event
in the event of Oracle failure.

III. B ODHI OVERVIEW

Bodhi, the next generation blockchain based prediction market, leverages the advantages of
the state-of-the-art decentralized prediction markets by integrating third-party Oracles and voting
based decentralized Oracles via its Oracle abstraction layer. We introduce a novel replaceable
Oracle framework so that the prediction market is more effective and autonomous.
Bodhi will first be deployed on the Qtum [5]. As more users around the world are accessing
the Internet from mobile devices rather than from desktop computers, mobile computing will
be increasingly important to prediction markets. Qtum combines the advantages of Bitcoin and
Ethereum to provide better user experience on mobile devices. Event forecast is very timesensitive matter, but smart contract can only rely on the number of blocks to estimate the time.
However, Ethereum has yet to implement the Proof of Stake (PoS). As the Difficulty Bomb
of Ethereum’s current Proof of Work (PoW) starts to take effect, the block time is increasing
exponentially, as shown in Table I, which greatly affects the estimated time of the forecast. Qtum,
which is different from Ethereum, will ensure the stability of the block time by introducing PoS
at the beginning its release. Bodhi will first be deployed onto Qtum to avoid existing problems
with Ethereum. However, as the user base grows, we do not eliminate the possibility to roll out
Bodhi onto other public blockchains.

Bodhi uses third-party Oracle to automatically judge prediction results to guarantee the efficiency of the decision-making process. BOT holders can take over the voting process and make
the final decision for a prediction event if Oracle fails. Algorithm 1 shows how Bodhi works.
As you can see, Bodhi’s Oracle is replaceable. If consensus cannot be obtained through
arbitration, users can continue to make deposits to request the next iteration of arbitration. As
the number of rounds increases, more token deposits get accumulated and BOT holders are
more motivated to maintain the accuracy of the Bodhi platform to protect their token value.
Theoretically, arbitration result will converge to an accurate state. Bodhi leverages the advantages
of the state- of-the-art decentralized prediction markets by integrating third-party Oracles and
a voting based decentralized Oracle via an Oracle abstraction layer. This method combines the
advantages of existing decentralized prediction market.

IV. B ODHI P REDICTION M ARKET P RICING

Bodhi is committed to creating a free-to-participate, low-cost prediction market. On Bodhi,
Oracles serve as judges and BOT holders are maintainers. Incentive (service fee) is provided to
the Oracles on the platform to motivate more Oracles to provide credible and stable services for
Bodhi.
Equation 1 shows how the rate is calculated. Let Fs be the percentage of the service fee
payable to Oracles and Ft be the percentage of the transaction fee payable to the platform. Sloss
denotes the total loss of all parties that failed the prediction and Swin denotes all the gains from
all users that succeed in the prediction.
Swin = Sloss × (1 − Fs − Ft )

(1)

Fs and Ft will be dynamically determined in the future as we plan to create a prediction event
to let all BOT holders determine the best fees .

V. B ODHI T OKEN

The token for Bodhi prediction market is called Bodhi Token (BOT). BOT will be issued
during the contract deployment phase, with a total of 100 million units.
In order to ensure the simplicity and independence of platform logic, Bodhi does not issue
WIZ tokens like Gnosis. At the initial phase when we take Bodhi online, the Bodhi platform
will only support BOT and QTUM. With the rapid evolvement of blockchain technology, stable
coins and cross-chain technologies are emerging. In the near future, Bodhi prediction market is
intended to be flexible enough to allow the use of any cryptocurrency (which is not a security)
to participate in the prediction market.

BOT represents two main interests:
1) Arbitration and Compensation. BOT holders are entitled to initiate arbitration for disputed
results of prediction events and receive incentives accordingly. Before initiating the arbitration, a BOT holder must lock up certain amounts of BOT as deposit. If the arbitration
result is in favor of the BOT holder, the holder is entitled to receive certain amounts of
BOT as compensation from the losing party of the arbitration.
2) Vote and Incentive. BOT holders are entitled to vote for arbitration results of the disputed
prediction events and receive rewards accordingly. Before voting, BOT holders must lock up
certain amounts of BOT as deposit. If a BOT holder’s vote is consistent with the arbitration’s
final result, the BOT holder is entitled to receive certain amounts of BOT as incentive from
the losing party of the arbitration. In addition, BOT holders may shut down illegitimate and
malicious prediction events through the voting procedure.
By definition, BOT is a utility token which may only be utilized on the Bodhi platform.
Ownership of BOT carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use BOT as
a means to enable usage of and interaction with the platform, if successfully completed and
deployed.
BOT is a non-refundable functional utility token, does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Foundation or any other company, enterprise
or undertaking, nor will BOT entitle token holders to any promise of revenue, fees, profits or
investment returns. BOT is not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant
jurisdiction.
As part of the operation of the prediction markets on the Bodhi platform, BOT will be
consumed as service fee (provided to the Oracles) or as transaction fee (paid to the Bodhi
platform).

To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading BOT does develop, it would be run
and operated wholly independently of the Foundation (or its affiliates), the sale of BOT and the
Bodhi platform.

VI. B ODHI R EVIEW M ECHANISM

Bodhi is a blockchain based free prediction market. However, a free market does not mean
that Bodhi is a completely unmonitored platform. It is intended that the Bodhi platform will
provide a decentralized review mechanism where BOT holders can vote to eliminate illegal and
malicious predictions to protect their interests.

VII. B ODHI D EVELOPMENT T IMELINE

Bodhi prediction market token ICO is scheduled near the end of 2017. Qtum testnet deployment of Bodhi prediction market beta version is scheduled around the same time. The MVP,
production and premium versions are scheduled to be deployed onto Qtum main net in 2018
and 2019 respectively. Figure 2 shows the detailed development schedule for Bodhi.

Bodhi Development Timeline

Risks
YOU CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT BLOCKCHAIN AND VIRTUAL CURRENCIES
/ TOKENS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ETHEREUM, QTUM, BITCOIN AND
BOT, ARE NEW AND UNVERIFIED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE BEYOND CONTROL
OF THE FOUNDATION OR THE ISSUER (AS THE CASE MAY BE). THE PLATFORM AND
THE PROJECT ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING RISKS, WHICH YOU EXPRESSLY

ACKNOWLEDGE AND ASSUME:
(a) Risks associated with the Qtum Protocol Given that BOT and the Bodhi prediction market
platform are based on the Qtum protocol and architecture, any malfunction, breakdown or
abandonment of the Qtum protocol or architecture may have a material adverse effect on
BOT and/or the Bodhi prediction market platform. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or
technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing), could
present unknown risks to BOT and/or the Bodhi prediction market platform by rendering
ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Qtum protocol.
(b) Security weaknesses. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to
interfere with BOT and/or the Bodhi prediction market platform in a variety of ways.
(c) Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions The regulatory status of BOT and/or prediction markets, and distributed ledger technology generally is unclear or unsettled in many
jurisdictions. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may
apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and
its applications, including BOT and/or the Bodhi prediction market platform. Regulatory
actions could negatively impact BOT and/or the Bodhi prediction market platform in various
ways.
(d) Insufficient Interest It is possible that the Bodhi prediction market platform will not be
used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be
limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as
the network or the platform). Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the
development of the Bodhi prediction market platform.
(e) Execution. There is the risk that the Foundation and the BODHI team may be unable or
execute or implement the project as set out herein.

VIII. A PPLICATIONS OF B ODHI P REDICTION M ARKET

A. Financial Tool

Conventional financial market forecasting tools have limitations such as high service costs,
professional barrier, poor scalability, limited ability to express, lack of accuracy, low efficiency,
etc. Bodhi prediction market overcomes those limitations by providing a more detailed description
of economic events, where value and risk assessment can be thoroughly made at both macro
and microeconomic level. Therefore, Bodhi reduces service costs, removes professional barrier,
improves accuracy and efficiency and scales easily. For instance, for a simple prediction event
- What is the opening price for Apple stock at January 1st 2018? - conventional financial
market prediction tools need to analyze investment environment, basic corporate information
and their finances to calculate investment returns, before giving an incomprehensive prediction
result. Using Bodhi, however, the prediction result is calculated by the entire network for better
accuracy and efficiency, as well as lowering the cost. The same mechanism can be applied to
predict other stocks at any given time.

Figure 3.

Financial Tool

B. Information Management

Information plays a critical role in the development of society where many decisions are made
based on accurate and reliable information. In order to obtain accurate information to improve
decision-making accuracy, people use a variety of information retrieval methods, e.g., surveys
and paid data. However, these information retrieval methods are considered costly and unscalable.
Prediction markets can motivate people to provide information proactively. In 1988, professors at
the University of Iowa created a prediction market where participants can predict the identity of
the next elected US president. Since then, the same market has collated predictions for every US
presidential election with a prediction accuracy much higher than the political commentators and
the results of public polls. Bodhi enables prediction markets creation as ease. The value flow of
the blockchain is becoming a profound foundation for prediction markets. Bodhi make prediction
result more accurate due to its decentralized characteristics and large-scale user engagement.

Figure 4.

Information Management

C. Insurance

Insurance industry has various effects on society through the way that it changes who bears
the cost of losses and damage. Traditional insurance industry typically has long and complex
claim process due to its centralized management. The massive agent model that is used to drive
the business has introduced high operational cost. Bodhi’s decentralized solution is a natural fit
to solve these problems. Taking flight insurance as an example, passengers can predict and price
the probability of a flight delay before boarding. In most cases, the flight will be on time, so
that the tokens will be locked in the smart contract of the prediction event. Should a flight delay
occur, the Oracle will write the flight number of the delayed flight to the smart contract. The
Bodhi platform will be able to automatically process the claim for the passengers who purchased
the flight insurance on the corresponding flight. The entire process is fully automated so that no
human intervention is needed. Most of the fund will be used to reimburse passengers and the

platform only charges a small portion as transaction fees.

Figure 5.

Insurance

D. Sports Lottery

The global online sports lottery is a huge market with billions of dollars of regulated market
funds. Sports lotteries are highly localized where each lottery market operates individually due
to the difference in regulations among the regions. Accessibility is limited in those localized
markets where data is isolated and fragmented. Data isolation and fragmentation have limited
the accessibility of those localized markets where it is impossible to create new interesting
lotteries in a timely manner. Regulation is a double-edged sword. On one hand, data shows
that the unregulated lottery market is 10 times of regulated ones, which makes fraud and illegal
operation a common regulatory issue of the global lottery market. On the other hand, centralized
service is prone to hacking, system failure and other uncertainties from service providers. These
uncertainties ultimately result in high cost of creating lottery market and user taxation. It further

limits the lottery markets from high user engagement and being free markets. The public has
associated the lottery markets with speculation, due to its high risk profile. Bodhi brings an
innovative way to solve these problems. Bodhi is an open platform based on blockchain where
anyone can be transparently involved. Users can create prediction events without high transaction
fees. This free and open platform will greatly improve market liquidity and thus create objective
odds.

Figure 6.

Sports Lottery

E. Conventional Prediction Markets

Although conventional prediction markets will still play critical roles and involve in decisionmaking processes in all market segments, we foresee the globalization trends in participating
and collaborating in prediction markets. Bodhi is committed to building the next generation
decentralized prediction market platform. In the near future, Bodhi will co-exist with conventional
pre- diction markets and will gradually serve itself as an infrastructure of conventional prediction

markets to lower the operational cost. Bodhi platform provides most if not all logic to implement
prediction markets where it creates alternative solutions that allows conventional prediction
market to operate on Bodhi’s infrastructure. Bodhi significantly lowers the system failure rate
and operational cost, and it enables users to enter the market easily.

Token Sale Fund Allocation

1) Development: Prediction market platform is a sophisticated system that consists of a large
number of subsystems. Sufficient funding needs to be allocated for recruitment, team
building, and research and development.
2) Consulting: Prediction markets involve in many areas across different segmentations where
domain knowledge is needed for carrying out market analysis. We will allocate funding for
consulting domain experts and corporations.
3) Legal: Prediction markets are an innovation which is able to disrupt many industries, but is
also a highly-regulated area and therefore legal service is needed to ensure the regulatory
compliance (in particular, in the areas of gambling and securities law). We will allocate
funding for general legal advice and emergency legal services. In this regard, we have
instructed specialist counsel in Singapore from Tzedek Law LLC to advise on the BOT
token sale.
4) Marketing: Branding and marketing operations are important pieces to promote Bodhi to

potential customers for growth. We will allocate funding for promoting Bodhi platform and
blockchain industry in general.
5) Miscellaneous：Miscellaneous expenses that exclude all above expenses.

X. S UMMARY

Bodhi is a Qtum based platform that decentralizes the prediction market and enables free flow
of valuable information via public wisdom and incentivization. Bodhi leverages the advantages
of the state-of-the-art decentralized prediction markets by integrating third-party Oracles via its
Oracle abstraction layer and a voting based decentralized Oracle mechanism. We introduce a
novel replaceable Oracle framework so that the prediction market is more effectiveness and
autonomous. Bodhi is committed to influencing the Chinese prediction markets through global
engagement.
