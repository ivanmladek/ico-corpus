What Is GlassCoin

driven decentralized cryptocurrency that allow people to
store and invest their wealth in a non-government
controlled currency, and even earn a substantial interest
on investment. This means anyone holding Glasscoin Coin
in their wallet will receive interest on their balance in
return for helping maintain security of the network.

Transfer instant Peer to Peer
Peer-to-peer itself means Glasscoin runs without having a central server. The
storage server is decentralized and distributed-divided into various servers run
by each user connected to the network.

Glasscoin transactions are Anonymous
All the transactions we have done can be seen, but we do not know who the
owner
of the Glasscoin address is if the owner does not tell it. Each Glasscoin user can
actually choose whether or not his name will appear, but even if the user wants
to
keep his identity secret, all of his transactions are still recorded and can be
monitored through blockchain.

Transfer Money Easily
Just like Bitcoin, it can be sent anywhere in
seconds, whenever and wherever you want.
Money transfer with Glasscoin can happen only
with a smartphone's and internet connection.
Transfer fee is very small
Transfer fee can be removed until free, but to
speed up transactions, you can set the cost in
Glasscoin wallet as needed no matter how much
coin is sent.

Transactions are very easy
You can transfer Glasscoin to anywhere in the world as
long as it is connected to the internet. Glasscoin will be
deposited into the Glasscoin Wallet.

opponent and the amount of Glasscoin you want to transfer

The number of coins is limited
Glasscoin supply will only have 29 million coins

worldwide, this resembles an economic system based
on deflation and with increasing supply coin, Glasscoin
prices tend to rise, when demand is high and the
number of coins that remain is not increased.
Glasscoin is not controlled by institutions or governments
Glasscoin that uses the Blockchain
database is not controlled by a party, but is so open to the
public that it is impossible for someone to forge
transactions in Blockchain. All transactions are recorded
live, transparent, and spread across multiple servers.
Those who want to change or falsify Glasscoin transaction
data must hack multiple servers at the same time.
