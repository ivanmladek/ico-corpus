Summary
Sola is the next generation decentralized social platform that incentivizes
and benefits all involved parties — users, third-party developers and the core
team. The name Sola is an acronym for “social layer.”
Sola is an open ecosystem, which means that most of its source code will be
made open source and available for audit, improvement and usage by anyone.
This document outlines Sola’s fundamental principles, structure and its
economic and usage aspects for involved parties.

https://sola.foundation

Background
The most criticized aspect of centralized social networks is the way they
handle user data and privacy. This is unlikely to come as a surprise, given
that almost 100 percent revenue of social networks comes from displaying
ads to their users based on the user data.
We consider this as a symptom and not the root cause. The root cause it that
networks are reluctant to see their largest and most important audience,
users, as their full partners. We think that users shall have the right to
benefit from the networks, as do advertisers and network owners.
There have been a number of attempts (and they are not ceasing) to build
an open sourced or a decentralized social network that pushes the concept
and the business model of social media beyond the existing incumbents. It
is worth mentioning app.net (paid open source Twitter rip-off) and Diaspora
(distributed rudimentary Facebook clone). The most notable contenders
today are Akasha (decentralized rudimentary Facebook rip-off) and Steemit
(Reddit clone powered by cryptocurrency).
We do not consider these and other decentralized social network attempts as
serious contenders in the social space. Despite modern architecture they are
falling short on the two most important levels — comparable or superior user
experience (ideally, of the new users) and a solid underlying business model.
There are two examples that fit into our defined criteria that a nextgeneration social media contender should meet — Status and Kin. However,
both of them use a messenger form factor, while we at Sola use a modified
social network approach.

https://sola.foundation

We think that the social network approach is more likely to succeed than the
messenger approach, as public communications are easier to monetize than
private communications. Furthermore, it requires a lesser user base in order
to become valuable, and the value of a social network grows faster than the
value of a messenger.
Ilya and Pavel, Sola’s co-founders, have been working together since
2011 when they established a new venture for innovative social products
development. The first project of a photo-based social network We Heart Pics
lost to Instagram and was shut down despite its 3M users. The next project
was Plague, a social experiment that was started to find out if people were
ready to communicate and collaborate with strangers in a constructive and
respectful way. It has been running for almost 3 years, and now it is ready to
come out of its infancy phase with a 650K user base.
Sola is successor to the Plague experiment and a major upgrade enabled by
the blockchain capabilities. Sola has inherited Plague’s unique approach and
proven social mechanics, together with all the data and the user base. We
have created Sola in an attempt to succeed in our mission — to democratize
access to the audience and to allow all involved parties to benefit from it.
In this White Paper, we intend to outline our approach to a nextgeneration social network that uses decentralization because this necessary
infrastructure element enables new approach implementation rather than
“decentralize it while it’s hot” approach.

https://sola.foundation

Social Information Network
There are two general types of social media — messengers and social networks.
Messengers are private networks as they are mostly used for private
communications and their content is private by default. Private
communications are not considered in this paper.
Legacy social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) can be categorized as
semi-public networks. Despite most of their content being public, you
are required to establish connections with other users in order to receive
information without which such semi-public networks are useless. By
making connections, you define your content. However, instead of choosing
information directly, you choose sources of information. You effectively
create filter bubbles for yourself. The system is restricted by its own rules,
and it cannot show the content that falls out of filters. Moreover, legacy
social networks were initially intended for communication among friends, so
their feeds are a heavy mix of general and personal content.
Reddit comes closest to our definition of a social information network.
Its content is not intended for friends but for the consumption by general
audience. It does not require users to establish connections to use the service
and it still provides a way to fine-tune the received results. Reddit has one of
the most visited resources on the net despite the fact that it has not changed
a lot in the last 12 years and was not fully aware of the Mobile First concept,
at least in 2011. Thus, there are a lot of possibilities.
Sola is a public social information network with a strong financial incentive
for all involved parties to follow the rules of the network and to develop it
together. Its content is produced by quality-oriented users for the global
audience instead of just the user’s friends.
Summarizing the above written statements, it is safe to call social
information networks as a hybrid of a social and a media network.
https://sola.foundation

Economy Layer
Attention has its price
The amount of information created daily is growing exponentially. In digital
economy, information production and spread cost is close to zero. At the
same time, attention is a finite resource and cannot be stretched — you
cannot read 100 books or look through 1 000 000 of pictures in just one
day. It leads to growth of resource (attention) deficit and subsequently,
a continuous increase of its cost.
Most of the real-sector economy is directly connected to the attention
economy. It is not enough to create information, produce a good or
a service — you need to attract user’s attention. The current model of
attention distribution totally ignores attention producer/owner (aka user),
excluding them from the economy. This will inevitably change in the nearest
future.
Sola economy is built on the principle of ethical use of attention. Attention is
the new currency.
https://sola.foundation

7

SOL Token
To empower Sola economy we issue SOL tokens based on the ERC20
standard. Long-term viability of a platform depends on the viability of
its economy and it is essential to be able to control it and influence its
value with our own growing economy, development and overall progress.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are huge economies in themselves and by using
these currencies, we will become completely dependent on their state and
fluctuations.
SOL is a pure utility token and the only currency used for transactions on
the Sola platform:
• Possession of a token has no benefits other than monetary;
• Sola ecosystem exclusively uses SOL for transactions;
• Revenue in other currencies is converted into
SOL through crypto exchanges;
• Users’ and developers’ earnings and rewards are provided in SOL;
• Third-party services built on the Sola platform should use SOL;
• Purchasing of additional services on Sola app (cards exposed
to more users, action points, ad-free experience).
You can obtain SOL tokens in the following ways:
• Buy during Token Sale;
• Earn tokens by creating quality content
endorsed by other users in Sola app;
• Earn tokens as a node owner, providing for the service distribution;
• Earn tokens by taking part in the Bounty Development Program,
improving Sola platform and Sola app;
• Procure or trade tokens for different currency on the crypto exchange.
Sola economic system is a hybrid of an internal crypto economy powered
by own token and external revenue streams with different monetization
methods powered by a variety of currencies.

https://sola.foundation

8

Our idea is simple: in the current state of the crypto market it is still possible
to make money out of thin air for a while using speculative approach to
ensure token value, but it cannot serve as a long-term sustainable business
model. The bubble will pop someday. To cover our expenses and fulfill our
obligations to customers, partners and employees we have to earn money.
In contrast to the critics of centralized social networks, we do not think
advertising business model is “broken”. It is unequal to the user and it can be
significantly improved with the implementation of a crypto economy, but it
is definitely not broken.

SOL

other currencies

We are not trying to find a substitution for the advertising model;
we converge it with fair treatment of users.

https://sola.foundation

9

Revenue streams
Sola has a number of revenue streams:
• Native advertising (third-party networks at the early stage);
• Pay-per-engagement model (connectors for 3rd-party services that
want to benefit their users for engagement — games, apps;
• Custom ad-hoc campaigns;
• User purchases for services built on Sola Platform (Action
Points, ad-free accounts, additional exposure);
• SOL transactions commission;
• Token sale (limited capacity).
Stack and card format makes Sola app a perfect fit for native advertising. The
frequency of ads displayed will be defined by tests. At the moment we consider
that user will not see more than 2–3 ad cards per day, which is much less than
what other social media can suggest. What makes Sola platform unique is the
fact that users will be interested in boosting advertising on the network, as
this has an effect on their potential earnings and the value of SOL.
Depending on the commercial stage of the platform functionality and its
audience size we forecast the following APRU:

https://sola.foundation

10

The platform suggests an opportunity to create third-party services using
Sola developments, infrastructure and audience. It might as well be existing
business integration like an online shop or a brand new service. Partners
shall use SOL for the transactions within such services with the platform
holding its fee.
Sola app provides a range of paid services including an ad-free version and
Action Points purchase.

Users are Partners
It is critical for a social service to create quality content. This is why we
consider content creators as partners and we share with them a part of our
revenue. Revenue distribution between the content creators is performed
based on the “endorsement” given by other users in Sola app.
To give the content creators additional motivation and to accelerate
platform’s economic development, 18% of all emitted tokens will be
transferred to the content creators using the Sola app endorsement
mechanism. Once the token sale is over, these tokens will be evenly
distributed (transferred to the users) over the next 365 days.

ATTENTION! SOL token ownership does not influence and is not
connected to the platform revenue distribution, interest in revenue,
the rights or the votes regarding any issues, etc. SOL token is the
platform’s currency used as a reward for the content creator and
nothing else.

https://sola.foundation

11

Content Layer
Stacks and Cards
Sola uses a stack of fullscreen containers for information — “cards” instead
of legacy social networks traditional feed format. User always sees one item
of information at a time. Tinder-like gesture-based mechanism is used to go
through stacks. This stack implementation ensures higher user engagement
with the content compared to feed concept.
Card format provides an opportunity to unify user experiences regardless of
the card content and it is flexible enough to present any type of information.
Cards can consist from one to several “pages” allowing the users to portray
large amount of information.

Ubiquitous Cardification
We think that any content can be presented as cards. We were the first to use the
unified card format when the project was launched in 2014. We are happy to see
that other social services are beginning to grasp its value from the point of user
experience as well as good monetization opportunity — Instagram stories for
photos, Twitter Moments for short form content, Medium Series for longreads, etc.
Over these three years we have conducted a series of experiments and have
gathered a significant amount of data which helped us understand the way
the format is used and the way it can be simplified. The latter is critical for
consumer services. ML (Machine Learning) and NLP (Natural Language
Processing) give us an opportunity to automate raw content to cards
conversion in part or in whole. We call this process cardification.
The degree of cardification varies depending on the source content and
user needs. With any kind of cardification, user can edit the result and add
information.

https://sola.foundation

12

Basic cardification is used to convert links and standardized data from third
party services. When you add a link, a card with the link and the title is created
where all relevant source media-elements are stored allowing user to decorate
their card. Third party service data is formatted and cleared of all excessive
meta-data (YouTube videos, Instagram photos, Facebook posts, tweets etc).

LINK WITH CHOSEN PICTURE

Complete cardification is used when the user wants to take advantage of
all source content. When such source is added, the algorithms automatically
make a decision about the type of basic card templates to use, their number
and their arrangement. It is under development now and is not available in
the current public version of the app.

Assisted cardification is the result of AI Summarize work, an algorithm
that we have developed, which is best for medium and large amounts of text
data processing (articles, longreads, etc.). Based on the explicit indication
from user AI Summarize performs the semantic parsing of the source data
and finds the parts which are essential to get the gist of the text. The result
of this processing is ten or less cards containing the most important ideas
of the source text with the least possible loss of useful information. The
algorithm currently supports nine languages: English, French, German,
Italian, Spanish, Czech, Dutch, Turkish and Swedish.

Basic Card Templates
Core platform functionality

The platform supports the following basic data types:
• Text Card (up to 250 characters);
• Link (title with URL);
• Poll (up to 5 options);
• Media (image, video, gif).
These data types can be used in any combination. Card templates are
automatically selected as new content is added to achieve the most attractive
presentation. For example, the font size is automatically reduced as more text
or a media element is added to the card.
https://sola.foundation

14

A card can consist of several pages containing any data in any combination.
The core team has developed various templates which should cover basic user
needs.

TEXT CARDS — THE SIMPLEST FORMAT.
UP TO 250 CHARACTERS
FOR 1 PAGE OF A CARD.

LINK CARDS — THEY ALLOW EXTERNAL
LINK ATTACHMENT TO THE CARD.

MEDIA CARDS WITH EMBEDDED
PHOTOS, VIDEOS AND GIFS.

POLL CARD. UP TO 5 OPTIONS.

https://sola.foundation

15

Custom Card Templates
3rd party developer’s custom card types

Access to the content layer is fully open to third party developers (paperwork
is under development). This means that the platform allows creation and
adjustment of card templates to fit the needs of a particular user and will be
automatically available for all users.
Templates are generic and can be used by anyone and are not limited to the
author.
EXAMPLE 1:
AMAZON’S PRODUCT PAGE

Now the reader can skim-read the essential points of the chosen article using
the cards and there is no need to read through the whole text. If the reader
finds the content of the cards particularly interesting then they can follow
the link to the source article and read it more carefully.

Advanced Card Templates
Core platform functionality + 3rd party development

Our Roadmap includes complex interactive cards development and
implementation phase. These cards will use smartphone sensors and
external data like user location and smartphone movements, time of day,
weather, etc. First of all, such opportunities are aimed at enhancing user
engagement in the card content and then as commercial benefit for the ad
providers and platform partners.

EXAMPLE 1: CARD WITH

PHONE SENSORS

EXAMPLE 3: SHOPPING CARD WITH
ABILITY TO PAY IN SOL

EXAMPLE 4: PAID APP INSTALLS
AND PAY-PER-ENGAGEMENT MODEL

Third party developers will take part in this phase. They will obtain a part
of revenue from these formats commercial use. A number of opportunities
will be open to use within basic and custom templates once support at the
platform level is on.

https://sola.foundation

Distribution Layer
Incoherence Principle
Unlike traditional social networks, Sola does not require user
interconnection. Content distribution is controlled by the algorithms that
uses user overt actions as correctors and amplifiers. The necessity to perform
actions is embedded into the service as its basic mechanics (user needs to
make decision on the current card to move to the next card). This allows
gathering larger amount of data per user compared to other social networks.
This approach gives the platform a huge advantage regarding user
engagement and retention of the new users who can get a quality experience
from the beginning.
Our current proprietary spread algorithm began as simple information spread
for N nearby users and was under improvement based on real data for the last
3 years. Now it takes into account many parameters such as text content basic
analysis, user relationships, geographical location, UTC, language, etc. One
of the key elements of this algorithm is the infection index of the card creator
within the system and of those users who supported in spreading the card.
At the time of writing, users are testing the algorithm while fine-tuning with
priority filters that are aimed at certain users.

https://sola.foundation

21

Neutral AI
Some time ago we started working on the new spread algorithm which uses
neural networks based on deep learning. The end result we are planning to
achieve is called Neutral AI. Its task is to select knowledge domains in the
whole amount of data, understand the structure of the certain knowledge
domain and either reject useless information or suggest the widest possible
range of opinions in this domain depending on the certain knowledge
domain and the set rules.

EXAMPLE 1:

user out of the filter bubble.

Neutral AI logic and code will be documented. It will be open for review
and suggestions for everyone, so that any prejudice and concern about the
algorithm neutrality can be eliminated.

https://sola.foundation

22

Collective Machine Learning
Key problem in Machine learning is lack of marked datasets. Our solution is
the category tree that reflects user’s main interest domains.
Classification algorithms allow us to set up a correspondence to the category
tree for most of the analyzed information and to verify this correspondence
with the help of the users.
The users taking part in the Neutral AI learning program will receive
a certain percentage of all operations within the involved knowledge
domain, corresponding to their contribution to the learning process. We
expect that this will allow us to engage a significant part of the platform
audience into the learning program.
Such category tree compilation requires a significant amount of work and
expertise in each topic and domain. We expect to engage professional
institutions in this process using the above mentioned reward scheme for
each knowledge domain that they can help develop and improve.
Neutral AI can work in parallel or over the existing spread algorithm,
allowing us to perform the learning and implementation by modules,
focusing on those knowledge domains where the platform possesses more
content and in development in which it takes greater interest.

https://sola.foundation

23

Architecture Layer
Launched in 2014 the service involved logical decentralization. This means
that the users independently processed the available amount of information.
An outburst of interest for blockchain technology and its drastic
development has led us to a point where blockchain implementation into the
mass user service is both feasible and justified. This is why we have made
a decision to decentralize the service at the architecture level.

Why decentralize?
All social services that we use are centralized and controlled by a small
group of people which makes them consequently and potentially impartial.
At the same time democratic principles make it inevitable that sooner or
later an independent social service will be created. Moreover, such attempts
are regularly taken (see more detailed info).
From a functional point of view, decentralization has the following main
advantages:
• A decentralized service is better in fighting blocking
attempts and both self and external censorship;
• It can significantly lower platform service charges if wisely implemented;
• It allows restriction of service creators influence, subsequently
becoming better fitting for end users and third party
developers engagement into its development;
• Using cryptocurrencies is much more flexible and less costly
than operating fiat currencies at the payment layer.

https://sola.foundation

24

We are carrying out transfer from the current centralized model to the
decentralized and distributed architecture step by step.
Stage 1 — token issue: which leads to creation and
start of the economic development;
Stage 2 — operations decentralization on blockchain;
Stage 3 — media-data handling decentralization;
Stage 4 — providing distributed operations via nodes.

Decentralized Media Storage
Media data (pictures, video, other card data) can be preliminarily stored via
IPFS, which will allow content to be available anywhere.
IPFS is a good solution for fail-safe systems. The key risk is a relatively low
access speed which will significantly affect user experience and can appear
not to be enough for the highload consumer service.
For quick access to post media and data content available via IPFS, the CDN
server can be used. This could cut data receipt time dramatically.

https://sola.foundation

25

main node

country nodes

Distributed Immutable Service (Nodes)
Country nodes shall be used to build a distributed service. Any user after
the installation of the special software will be able to become a node for the
platform and use excessive power of their PC to provide for its performance,
servicing users located nearest in their country. As a reward, such user will
get a certain percentage of all transactions with SOL within their node.
Nodes give two huge advantages to the platform:
• Platform maintenance becomes significantly cheaper, which
means that costs can be reduced and the freed resources
can be used for user payments and other purposes;
• Fail safe operation in case a node goes offline (including the main
node) and in case of the country node isolation (i.e. service operation
will remain intact when the Great Firewall of China is on).
https://sola.foundation

26

Moderation and Censorship
Our more than 10 years of experience in the social services domain has
shown us that there is no way they can exist without moderation. An
importance of centralized moderation is best shown by the examples of
Facebook and Twitter. Moderation is one of the forms of censorship and
claims of some services that they have no censorship are either evidence of
a populist statement, or of complete ignorance about the basic principles of
social media.
Moderation allows us to ensure safe and non-toxic environment which is
extremely important for a social service that only has public content. To
avoid abuse of power or becoming the blind tool of censorship, moderation
shall be carried out as per publically stated rules.
In case of Sola the two-level moderation model is used:
• Centralized moderation provided by the team’s own forces;
• Decentralized pseudo-moderation at user level, where users can prohibit
publishing the content which they think is improper. This tool can
effectively reduce the audience for improper content like nudity and
violence. Unfortunately, it can be pretty useless when dealing with racism,
bullying and other such content which is often highly supported.
Our view is that ensuring comfortable and safe environment for public
communication should be one of the priorities for the social service even if it
involves certain unpopular decisions.

https://sola.foundation

27

Joint Development
Open for a Purpose
Social services market is one of the most competitive ones. The latest major
players, Instagram (2010) and Snapchat (2011), were founded more than
6 years ago, making use of mass user migration from PCs to smartphones —
a window of opportunities missed by the largest market players.
We think that the drastic growth of decentralized services is comparable to
this window potential. The very nature of a decentralized service suggests
that it ideally fits to attract and develop users and other involved parties own
services.
It is hard to fight for users and talents with the existing services that have
many users and resources. It is not enough to produce a free product equal in
quality and user experience.
One can attract allies by providing them with two kinds of motivation —
financial and ideological, and they go together.
From an ideological point of view, we have created a social layer — an
integrated social space which is defined and controlled by the actions of all,
being owned by none. We are intentionally striving for restricting the core
development team’s influence, keeping all current developments as open
sourced as possible. Our task is to build the system in such a manner that it
could be self-regulated with no external intrusion or as little as possible.
From a financial point of view, we consider it as pure necessity to
acknowledge all involved parties (users, third party developers, and the
core development team) as equal partners and grant every participant
an opportunity to make profit from their contribution to the network
development.

https://sola.foundation

28

User Layer
Users are provided with following three main profit-making scenarios:
• Receiving endorsement for user-created content (cards,
comments) by other users (see more in Sola application);
• Using own resources to ensure distributed immutable service
(see more in Distributed immutable service (Nodes));
• Contributing to Neutral AI learning and data separation
(see more in Collective Machine Learning).

Developer Layer
API documented in detail is the the first major milestone after the launch
of the service. Gradually, most of the existing code will be documented and
open sourced.
Third party developers are also provided with the following three main
profit-making scenarios:
• Content Layer (see more in Custom card templates and Advanced card
templates) and Distribution Layer (see more in Neutral AI) development;
• Core platform and Core App improvement via
Bounty Development Program;
• Own services development based on Sola capabilities
and infrastructure (see more in the next section).
During the first quarter of 2018 we are planning to launch the Bounty
Development Program which will enable the Core Dev Team to act as
a customer and outsource some of the tasks to the experts that are
unavailable or impractical to be hired as permanent team members.
Besides, the program will allow the engaged users to build teams enabling
them to make joint requests for development supported by financial
obligations.

Sola as Social Layer
Being the Core Dev Team, we are focused entirely on platform development
opportunities and the increase of its audience. However, we are completely
aware of the fact that both users and advertisers are interested in
communication as well as making profit.
Open Social Layer concept intends that we grant third parties free and
unrestricted access to the users (the right to address the users, not the right
to deal with their personal data) and the platform infrastructure to create

own services. The key points here are platform reputation and trust and we
are able to provide all necessary elements to build quality relationships:
• Open source code;
• Public API;
• Universal payment layer based on cryptocurrency.
Our own Sola app is the first service built on the platform and its purpose
is to demonstrate platform abilities, attract interest and audience to the
platform.
The only condition to use the platform is an obligation to utilize SOL tokens
as a means of payment. It does not mean that the platform is unable to work
with other crypto and fiat currencies. However, it means that once received,
they are to be converted to SOL. When a withdrawal for SOL is made, it can
be converted into any other currency at the discretion of the service.

Sola App
At the end of 2014 we launched Plague — a decentralized social and
information network where information spread among users as per epidemic
propagation model.
Sola app is an evolution of this service and has inherited its data, audience,
interface and logic which are expanded and upgraded with the Sola platform
resources.

The app is quite simple and crystal clear from the user experience point of
view. Instead of traditional feeds, Sola uses a stack of cards. So, the user
always sees only one card on the screen and is able to switch to the next only
after making their decision on the current card. Gesture-based Tinder-like
interface is used to switch between cards. Every card can either be ignored or
“endorsed” which helps it spread across the network.
The Distribution layer is responsible for cards “assignment” to the users as it
combines its own algorithms with the users’ “endorsement” signals and their
personal settings.

Every user receives their daily allowance of internal virtual currency —
Action Points (basic + variable amount depending on user’s positive
activities). Action points can be spent on user’s own created content
(comments, cards) as well as other users’ content endorsement. When Action
Points are transferred to another user, they are converted into the universal
cryptocurrency — SOL.
In other words, Action Points have no value before they are transferred to
another user as endorsement of created content. To gain the benefit from
the service it is necessary to produce content (cards and comments). Action
Points naturally restrict user’s opportunities and rationalize their behavior.
The app demonstrates an extremely high level of engagement, as everyday
users create thousands of new posts and comments. On average, users daily
spend 10 minutes using the app and look through 87 cards.

User Acquisition
Content Creators and their Audience
Content creators are both the key asset of a social network and one of the
drivers of its development. Sola allows content creators to get direct financial
benefit — money reward, which stimulates acquisition of quality content
creators.
Our aim is to create the most favorable conditions for the largest possible
content creator audience, so that content creators are motivated to create
quality content on our platform which are:
• There is no entrance threshold. You can make money from the start. The
cryptocurrency payment layer allows us to implement both automated
and financially effective logic for paying any amount of reward;
• There is no need to make new connections first, as there is
no such notion — our spread algorithm will take care of that
while assisting the user to utilize the existing audience;
• There is no need to become a “pro” creator to monetize your
content. Any comment or card allow users to make profit.
Many people have large audiences on those services where they are
registered and which they use to spread their content — social networks,
blogs, etc. A lot of these users have thousands and thousands of followers,
but they lack direct monetization tools with the exception of contextual
advertising or direct relationships with advertisers. However, there are no
other direct monetization tools for small and medium “pro” creators, not to
mention regular users.
Amongst other things, the above mentioned creators can also be highly,
financially motivated to use Sola and to attract their followers onto the
platform explicitly or implicitly, benefiting both from the content they create
as well as referral programs.

Automated Referral Program
Mobile phone verification and SOL cryptocurrency allows us to set referral
programs for acquisition of new users, ensuring transparency and effectively
stimulating program members.
As part of this program Sola’s current users are rewarded for attracting new
users who follow their links to the content and the service itself.
A member who is attracts new users receives Action Points for each visit
made by these new users. More Action Points are awarded if the new users
register on the platform. In addition to this, the member of the program
receives a certain percentage of SOL earned by the new user for some time
period.
A big advantage of our approach to referral program’s implementation is that
there is no need of special referral codes or any explicit participation in the
program in general. Any user, spreading information beyond the network
automatically becomes the member of the program and gets a detailed view
of all granted rewards.

Token Sale
SOL tokens are issued and put into circulation for Sola’s platform launch
and functioning. SOL tokens are the only currency which is used for mutual
payments among platform users. Part of these tokens will be sold to the
current and future users during Token Sale. The received funds will be used
for the platform development.
Token sale will last from November, 27 to December, 22 2017. The bonus
scheme will be announced on https://sola.foundation later.
The​​total​​amount​​of​SOL ​token​​created​​w ill​​be​​150 000 000. Token sale hard

platform at the stage of ad and other revenue streams development.
10% of the issued tokens will be reserved for the core dev team with a
1-year lock, they are to be used for the incentive plan aimed at bringing and
keeping highly qualified experts.
2% will be transferred to the user allocation fund for rewards already accrued
to the Sola App users from App’s launch till the end of Token Sale.
All funds raised during the token sale will be used for platform development
as per the following ratio:

Since 2014, the project has been under development using proprietary funds
and funds raised from venture capital investments. As of now, we have a run
rate of about $1M per year. Additional funding will enable us to accelerate
the product development. Besides this, it will give a spur to the development
of the ecosystem and growth of the user base.
