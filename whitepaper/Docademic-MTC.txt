The DOCADEMIC PLATFORM is a single globally-sourced healthcare service
platform for the public that begins with free Human Doctor-AI assisted Video
Telemedicine service (DOCADEMIC APP) already in use in 20 countries by
thousands of users and an associated suite of AI assisted tools and social
network for the medical community (Docademic for Doctors). Combined, these
produce the highest level of free basic quality healthcare allowing any individual
to access the benefits and knowledge of healthcare that technology now
permits.

The DOCADEMIC PLATFORM´s DOCADEMIC APP is built on top of DOCADEMIC´s
existing, patient data routing and AI assisted technologies soon to be blockchain
enabled. With its simplicity of use It becomes the ultimate resource for anyone
who needs orientation in a health-related issue—a one touch system that
connects any patient with a Doctor through Video Telemedicine for free, from
any country a user is located in. All patient information will be secured on a
blockchain and represents a perfect On-Ramp to healthcare services on a
blockchain. In comparison, other healthcare related blockchain projects don’t
have an eﬀective On-Ramp to healthcare services. With our free Telemedicine
service we can get the masses to benefit from blockchain technology in
Healthcare.
The DOCADEMIC PLATFORM´s DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social network oﬀers
Ongoing Medical education, Patient referrals, Tools for doctors everyday
practice, and Real Time Reporting of epidemiological data for our clients and
researchers.
Serving all client sizes and requirements: The DOCADEMIC Platform combines it’s
DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social network to derive
high-end services such as real-time geographic epidemiological data reporting,
Automated AI-Driven treatment and diagnosis suggestions for Doctors in
institutions or private practice, massive access to patient populations for
preventative campaigns, and DOCADEMIC´s advanced proprietary Tools such as
its AI-assisted Electronic Health Record and Digital Vademecum.

A universal native Token: the MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY, MTC is the fuel that will
power all services DOCADEMIC provides. We are already in talks with Healthcare
institutions, Governments and partners to make MTC the preferred Token for
their own upcoming and existing medical services, as they migrate to
decentralized platforms. We envision MTC will be used in the broader Healthcare
industry and any other industries for various purposes including payment and
remittance.
The end goal: DOCADEMIC is building a solid, global Healthcare utility—an
advanced platform the entire patient population and medical community will
use to great advantage; where anyone can participate as users and Token
holders.
DOCADEMIC will become a complete healthcare ecosystem for the
worldwide patient/Doctor population with digital access.

Background

When Satoshi Nakamoto brought Blockchain into the world in 2009, few
visionaries understood the disruptive shock wave that would start to reshape the
Healthcare industry. Like the Internet and Gutenberg press, it promises to
distribute power and control of information among individuals and remove it
from the clutches of the elite.
Since, Bitcoin went from a market cap of zero to $70 billion powered by
blockchain technology. This is just the beginning. The market cap of all Crypto
Tokens combined stands at over $140 billion—with the surrounding
infrastructure and ecosystem likely worth a lot more.
Most Crypto Token value so far has come from speculation and trading. Many are
looking to find the “next Bitcoin”. Almost every day new Crypto Tokens comes to
market to seek fortune on hundreds of exchanges worldwide, and thousands
more will follow. Utility of these tokens is key to their success.
New and old industries powered by millions of individuals and new businesses
will build their entire foundations on these decentralized Crypto Token based
ecosystems. From ordinary payments to important health data sharing, huge
institutional transfers, fundraising and investments, smart contracts and new
services that are just being imagined into existence—disruption is coming at a
rapid rate. Healthcare is a fundamental part of this transition and possibly the
industry that will be benefited the most.
The new way of accessing healthcare is here. Democratization of health has
begun. The power and utility are now in everyone’s hands.
Here’s a few interesting statistics. The global healthcare
expenditure market processes $1–2 trillion in transactions per
day. Cryptocurrency’s daily share in all its industries including
healthcare is relatively smaller at around $2 billion—although it
sometimes reaches $4–6 billion. While there are 58 countries in
the world with universal healthcare, there are over 100
Countries with no universal or free healthcare. Healthcare
services that use crypto-tokens and blockchain are just being
born. When we look at these figures, they indicate that the
MTC

crypto healthcare-market is going to continue an upward trend
as more healthcare services start using blockchain technology.
We as human beings all need this revolutionary innovation.

Enter DOCADEMIC. A successful healthcare technology company with an
impeccable reputation and healthcare industry pedigree. As of September 2016,
we are the first global healthcare technology company in the world to have
launched a free video telemedicine service currently active with verified users in
20 countries. Yes, Docademic has Doctors on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
serving the public in these countries. Our DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR
DOCTORS platforms are the most advanced in the world with the most widely
used service reaching peaks of over 7,000 patients served in a month. With over
two centuries of combined experience in Healthcare and technology,
DOCADEMIC’s team understands the industry inside out. In fact, we understand it
enough to know current healthcare methods are becoming obsolete. Large
healthcare institutions simply cannot keep up with innovation. And we’re only
just beginning—read on to see how we plan to grow this exponentially, and why
our people are the ones to deliver.
THE HEALTHCARE ACCESS PROBLEM
Amid the massive economic activity in the healthcare industry, participants face
many challenges. At DOCADEMIC, we have identified ONE fundamental element
to address. It’s an element so crucial it often gets manipulated to the advantage
of the elite... yet it’s vital to the health and growth of worldwide healthcare
services. That element is: ACCESS. Healthcare Access is the lifeblood of the
healthcare industry.
Access covers short-term health solutions and basic needs of individuals—
whether it’s associated with chronic disease or the common cold. A hospital can
have the largest facilities in the world and the best-run medical service for
patients, BUT, if at any point in time a patient needs immediate care, and is
unable to reach the hospital or pay for its services, then that patient is in trouble.
The history of the healthcare world is littered with such casualties. Its future
doesn’t need to be. Accessibility problems triggered many of the Global Health
MTC

10

Crisis’ most traumatic events. A major recent shock occurred when the Ebola
virus spread throughout West Africa, caused by a lack of knowledge and fear. The
panicked reactions by residents transmuted to local governments, leading to the
viruses further spread.
The Digital healthcare world is pouring its creative energy into this explosion of
new Blockchain and AI Technologies and exciting business models. But access—
that less headline-grabbing yet fundamental element—is getting left behind.
What if an individual´s most significant healthcare service is tied to a specific set
of rules that prevents a patient from considering seeking medical help, or selfmedicates, without quick access to a healthcare provider? They could be in
serious trouble. This issue already exists today. The largest healthcare providers
in traditional healthcare are global hospital chains, governments and other
healthcare institutions such as Keyser Permanente, UnitedHealth Group, and
Aetna. Can DOCADEMIC achieve the same status in the Crypto-Health
economy? We believe we can. Read on to find out how.

Welcome to DOCADEMIC, built to provide free
quality basic healthcare access to the world’s
patient population.
DOCADEMIC is expanding DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS, a
single globally-sourced healthcare platform with an associated suite of services
which will enable the highest level of access and medical advancement. In the
process, this will allow anybody to tap into all the opportunities the new Cryptohealth economy has to oﬀer.
The DOCADEMIC Platform will be managed and operated by Sidrese SA de CV.
established under laws of Mexico.
DOCADEMIC PLATFORM

Currently, the accessibility landscape for patients is fragmented. The top
healthcare providers all oﬀer the same ways to access healthcare, and no one
healthcare provider diﬀerentiates in any one method of access. Furthermore,
accessibility and the best prices for a given healthcare service can shift from one
provider to another. At any time, the best way to get medical attention might be
MTC

13

in a local hospital or government service. The ailment may be avoided with
home treatment but there is no way to find out for sure and internet searches are
questionable at best. The same is true for all patients who have chronic disease.
In a sense, the various healthcare providers are accessibility Silos. They oﬀer
great service in some areas once there, but their accessibility is limited to clients
who have the means to reach them and know of their benefits. While most of the
healthcare providers oﬀer easy access in certain basic services (ER, lab studies,
etc.), there is no real-time convenient and highly-accessible on-ramp into the
healthcare world for patients of minor ailments or with the lack of knowledge to
determine if they need to go see a healthcare provider. Patients such as pregnant
women, patients with stage 1 cancer, young adults, elderly, etc.
Separately, each patient´s needs may be diﬀerent, but collectively they
represent a large untapped source of clients that desperately want and need a
qualified on-ramp into healthcare services.
The DOCADEMIC Platform brings together an entire global network of medical
services and makes them accessible to everybody. The DOCADEMIC Platform
through its DOCADEMIC APP provides an unparalleled and powerful method of
orientating health services and products to Individuals and institutions—as well
as to Token Issuers and Token Holders.

3.1 DOCADEMIC APP
3.1.1 Intelligent medical assistance engine
The DOCADEMIC Platform’s DOCADEMIC APP oﬀers an easy to use interface that
aggregates the services of artificial intelligence’s various analytical benefits and
assists Human Doctors who are present 24 hours a day into a single highly userfriendly application, allowing users to solicit medical assistance in the place and
time of one’s choice as well as follow up on treatments they receive and take and
share their health record through blockchain with doctors of their choosing:
The DOCADEMIC APP solves two important problems that limit patients in the
healthcare world: Accessibility Silos and Underserved Markets.
As mentioned above, Accessibility Silos are pockets of healthcare providers like
hospitals and clinics that exist because access in certain locations is not readily
available to those people who live far away or want healthcare service at hours
when the accessibility silos are not operating. Underserved Markets are markets
that, in isolation, are not wealthy enough to support the cost of traditional
medical services.
People in the countries that only have Accessibility Silos and Underserved
Markets would like to be able to have full access to healthcare services in their
home countries, but there is no highly-accessible on-ramp into the healthcare
world for them.
The Accessibility Silos and Underserved Markets problems are solved by
connecting these healthcare services into a single point of access, and by
allowing patients to be orientated to a cure at home or the correct healthcare
providers and healthcare services.

MTC

15

Under the hood, the DOCADEMIC APP is a composite of two diagnostic services:
Internal AI diagnosis: An artificial intelligence trained by our doctors to
supplement and optimize the diagnosis of a patient’s symptoms derived from
the information it is perceiving from the patient through speech and text and is
constantly improved.
External Aggregated Medical Doctor Diagnosis: A real time team of Doctors
that have all the information we’ve learned from giving the service throughout
several countries. Each Doctor in this service is linked to a system that compiles
the treatments, medications and healthcare providers that are added to the
network.

MTC

16

The DOCADEMIC Platform’s DOCADEMIC APP supports giving medical advice in
the country of one’s choice. To understand how useful this is, it is helpful to
understand that most healthcare services in the world are composed of a Basic
primary care (The first contact with a doctor.), and a Secondary care (the
doctor or service you are referred to after the primary care doctor diagnosis you).
It is also possible to get medical care at secondary care services and bypassing
the primary care service.
For example, a Male European patient wishing to get medical attention for a pain
in his neck can choose to go to a pharmacy and buy pain relief medication. When
he requests medical assistance in the DOCADEMIC APP, He learns that the pain
may be more than just neck pain because the related symptoms of fatigue he
describes to the doctor determine he may have thyroid cancer. While a Woman
from Singapore, using the DOCADEMIC APP, can describe to the doctor her
symptoms of her recent pregnancy and from the diagnosis that is determined
through the internal artificial intelligence and the insight of the Doctor he
acquired through use of the DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social network, it is
determined she has preeclampsia and should go immediately to a hospital or
she runs the risk of losing her baby.

3.1.2 The Architecture
Underpinning DOCADEMIC Platform’s DOCADEMIC APP are three technologies
that are already used by DOCADEMIC daily:
1. User matching Engine (UME)
2. Cross diagnosis HUMAN-AI Engine (CDHAIE)
3. Smart patient Routing (SPR)
User Matching Engine (UME):
Built from scratch by combining decades of experience in programming
technology, the DOCADEMIC APP´s User Matching Engine (UME) can process

MTC

17

several million transactions per second, making it one of the most advanced
patient matching engines in the health industry.
The UME has been engineered to be hyper-scalable to support a very high
number of markets (patients from many countries) and oﬀers native support for
several languages, around which a powerful diagnosis System for these patients
has been built.
All these features, coupled with “built to fail” resiliency, make the DOCADEMIC
APP´s UME one of the best in the healthcare market.
Cross diagnosis Human-AI Engine (CDHAIE)

The Cross-Diagnosis Human-AI Engine allows for quick, eﬀective and clear
diagnosis of patients: When a patient diagnosis is initiated, and the demand for
medical attention on the DOCADEMIC APP is high, the Doctor receives real time
suggestions from the AI for more complete and rapid diagnosis of the patient on
the other side of the Video Telemedicine call. For example, if a patient calls and
starts explaining symptoms such as fatigue, running nose, joint pain the Doctor
has multiple possible diagnosis´ for that patient. The CDHAIE automatically
performs an analysis of the symptoms to narrow down the diagnostic
possibilities so a more accurate diagnosis is confirmed. It is also constantly
adjusting, in real-time, to decisions and corrections as well as the latest clinical
guides of the doctors to reflect the best method of treatment and diagnosis. It
should be mentioned here that this service is not only limited to Medical services
and expands onto psychological services. For example, using the DOCADEMIC
APP´s emotional service (Cool Emotions) for psychological treatment, it
becomes possible to provide treatment between a patient and a Psychologists.
Furthermore, adding a Psychological service allows for matches between
Medical and Psychological treatments for wartime trauma.
Smart Patient Routing (SPR):
The Smart Patient Routing Technology maintains quick referrals for all major
healthcare providers throughout the countries where the services are given.
When any of those healthcare providers changes, it’s reflected in DOCADEMIC
Platform’s DOCADEMIC APP´s patient referral services database.
MTC

18

When a patient referral is given on the DOCADEMIC APP, and no match is
available locally, the Smart Patient Routing Technology checks to see if there is a
match for the service needed available in a nearby area. If so, it automatically
routes the patient in to the service of the neighboring region.

3.2 DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS
The DOCADEMIC Platform’s DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social network is
comprised by a suite of services that provide users with tools to receive ongoing
medical education, reduce diagnosis errors and increase ROI since it lowers costs
for Doctors and patients. DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS includes an electronic
health record, Digital Vademecum, and over 600 medical journals and a social
network exclusively for Doctors as its core oﬀering.
Users are now able to share their insights, receive patients, learn from the latest
clinical procedures and use tools that integrate AI, without even having to pay for
these services and tools or depend on their medical institutions to provide it for
them.
DOCADEMIC PLATFORM users will gain the following benefits:
1. Reduction of Counterparty Risk: DOCTOR users of the DOCADEMIC
Platform will rest assured that the information available is compliant
with regulators. DOCADEMIC is regulated in the United States of America
known as one of the strictest health regulators in the world.
2. Increase in Eﬀiciency: DOCADEMIC Platform´s Doctor users will be
able to update their knowledge of other treatments without having to
search for the world´s medical journals directly. Journal updates will be
done via DOCADEMIC´s real time posting technology, and should be
instant for Doctors as soon as the articles are published.
3. More Accurate diagnosis for their patients: Doctor Users of the
Docademic Platform will have the ability to view and select diagnosis
suggested by the integrated AI, derived from the diﬀerent oﬀicial clinical
guides. This will allow Doctors to better take advantage of ineﬀiciencies
in the sometimes-slow integration of recent developments in treatments
in the healthcare system.

MTC

20

3.2.1 Direct Market Access
The Docademic Platform allows its users to leverage DOCADEMIC Smart Patient
Routing (SPR) technology and connectivity to all reputable medication and
medical device providers, and get Direct Market Access through our Docademic
Marketplace to the best retailers and wholesalers of medication and medical
devices.
With our state-of-the-art ecommerce dashboards, users of the DOCADEMIC
Platform will be able to purchase consumables, place orders of home delivery of
medication, buy equipment for their practice, and keep an eye on all new
products and services oﬀered in medicine 24/7.
Our Order Management System (OMS) and User Matching Engine (UME)
provide unparalleled banking-level performance. Our OMS will provide both
common and advanced order types like programmed purchases of consumables
for doctor’s oﬀices. The DOCADEMIC Marketplace will be a one stop shop for all
medical and health related products and services that both patients and doctors
can use.

3.2.2 Data Management
Data Management is one of the most diﬀicult (and restricted) constraints when it
comes to providing medical services to the market. Moving health data between
providers is convoluted, expensive and time consuming – which is one of the
reasons Blockchain is the future of Healthcare.
Over the past two years, DOCADEMIC has built an extensive network of
relationships with Hospitals. Part of our integration strategy has been to colocate our health services with those of other health institutions, by oﬀering
software integration as a standard part of our service—and in many cases further
than HL7 standard requirements—to health institutions.
We have also begun working with major governments to provide health service
optimization. This will allow us to replicate patient-institution data transfer
globally. This service will also be available to private practices using DOCADEMIC
MTC

21

FOR DOCTORS` AI assisted Electronic health record. DOCADEMIC is planning to
obtain any other permits or licenses when required.

Why is Blockchain technology important to the DOCADEMIC
Platform?
Docademic gets patients health records on a blockchain starting with their first
contact with a doctor through our DOCADEMIC APP. Like previously mentioned,
the Docademic APP service is openly available to the public and is already in use
in 20 countries and is completely free. This is the best way to get people onto the
blockchain. If needed, the patients can be referred to further healthcare services
or products after their first contact with a Doctor on the DOCADEMIC APP. All
patient data secured on a blockchain. Eventually the Docademic Blockchain will
be accessible by third party healthcare providers and they will be able to build
apps and dapps on the Docademic Blockchain. More in section 4.5

Why This Innovation Matters
for Healthcare Access
There are many third-party healthcare providers that provide
only limited services. The access to their services and eﬀiciency
are substantially constrained by the nature and cost of their
services. By providing access to these service as part of our
DOCADEMIC Platform, third party Healthcare providers will be
incentivized to use the platform—because it will allow them to
better monetize their capital by reaching more patients in an
eﬀicient manner targeted to their services. Patients data will
already be on the blockchain and third-Party healthcare
providers can benefit by having access to the patients data
through the blockchain with smart contracts. In the end this
provides more security for patient health information in the

MTC

long term. The correct way healthcare information should be in
the world.

3.2.3 Crypto Token Credit
The DOCADEMIC Platform’s DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS network will extend its
Crypto Credit facility to users to leverage their existing balances for enhanced
purchasing opportunities. Crypto Credit facility allows Doctor users to borrow
using MTC Crypto Token as collateral. For example, when buying equipment for
their practice.
MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY (MTC) can also be used by patients as collateral for
purchasing certain products or services in the DOCADEMIC marketplace. (more
on our Token in the following sections.)
DOCADEMIC is also in the process of creating and oﬀicial Provider of Care (PC), to
expand the range of services we can oﬀer our users in the US. DOCADEMIC will
also obtain any other permits or licenses when required.

3.2.4 Real Time Reporting
The DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS users will have access to customized patient
activity statements, to view detailed information about their patient’s
treatments including progress, previous treatments, most common medication
taken, and more. They will be able to run reports to view all aspects of their
complete patient portfolios

3.3 Other Services
3.3.1 Geo-Location System
Our DOCADEMIC Platform provides geographic health monitoring (GHM) of
population in real time as well as our powerful direct targeted notification
system (DTN)—or near constant statistical public health monitor within our
network to our public health partners.
We provide support for epidemics and tragedies. Users of the DOCADEMIC
Platform will be able to be contacted by public health oﬀicials with up to date
MTC

24

information pertaining to their specific health need in the case of an emergency
or receive information from preventative health campaigns.

3.3.2 Automated Follow up of treatments
Our DOCADEMIC Platform provides follow up to the most recent treatments given
to patients. Users can select from scale of automated one touch treatment scores
to evaluate their progress, then have their health monitored by our Doctors using
these strategies. New strategies will be published and will be accessible by our
users. Historical health records, performance and other details derived from
these treatments follow up strategies will be available to users to aid them in the
improvement of their health or the improvement of their patients’ health.
Initially, these follow up and health monitoring strategies will be provided by
DOCADEMIC. However, the platform, certain data, and tools we use will be made
available to data scientists with MTC throughout the industry, allowing access to
any individual or teams with the talent/skill to design and oﬀer their own health
monitoring strategies.

MTC

Examples of follow up strategy use cases:

25

1. MTC token holders can use automated treatment Follow up strategies
to save on purchases of medications pertaining to their treatment.
2. Talented Doctors can design their own treatment combination
strategies for their patients and then use them to improve their own
patient’s health—or share them publicly for a share of the profits and/or
a fee in case other doctors or healthcare providers want to adopt the
treatment strategy.
3. MTC Token holders can select one or a basket of Treatments strategies
and then have their treatments automatically monitored.
Automated Treatment Strategies will be provided only to the extent permitted by
the applicable laws, regulations and rules and medical ethics.

4.1 Token Overview
The Crypto economy has given us a whole new way to build new distributed
infrastructure using Crypto Tokens. People are coming together to contribute to
something they truly want, something they truly believe in. And as Token
Holders, they are benefiting from the growth in its utility and value.
DOCADEMIC, through MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY (MTC), is building a
healthcare utility—a platform that the entire Crypto economy and Healthcare
economy will benefit from and where people can participate in as both users and
token holders.
MTC will be issued by Sidrese Sa. De CV. and may be distributed by itself and/or
designated distributors. Please note that MTC does not represent any equity in
DOCADEMIC and does not entitle holders to any voting rights, dividends or profitsharing of any entities of DOCADEMIC. MTC is a Crypto Token that can be used as
the fuel that powers all services provided by the DOCADEMIC Platform and
DOCADEMICS’s existing services (DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR
DOCTORS).
MTC has two main functions:
1. as Crypto Token users can pay for products and services on all our
platforms;
2. as a tradable Crypto Token on the open market.
On top of these, MTC will open to all healthcare, financial and any other
industries. DOCADEMIC will not limit the usage of MTC nor business entities that
would like to use MTC for their business. Therefore, any companies or
organizations, individuals may be able to utilize MTC as a Crypto Token such as
Bitcoin, Ethereum’s ETH and Ripple’s XRP.
As the demand for the DOCADEMIC Platform grows, the utility of MTC will
increase and will allow MTC holders to use its value to “pay for” all services and
functions DOCADEMIC and its partners will provide.
MTC

We envision MTC could even become the preferred standard
Token used to pay for all services provided by the broader
Healthcare industry, as participants gradually migrate to
decentralized platforms.

28

DOCADEMIC is already in discussion with multiple healthcare institutions, Digital
Health startups, and partners to make MTC the preferred payment Token for
upcoming and existing Healthcare services.

4.1.1 Token Utility
Initially, MTC value will be used for services provided by the DOCADEMIC Platform
and DOCADEMIC—to cover fees, as credit collateral, and to participate in further
development of services like the DOCADEMIC Marketplace.
MTC holders can use value in return for:
Medical prescription transaction fees and referral commission Fees
DOCADEMIC Platform
DOCADEMIC APP
DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS
DOCADEMIC MARKETPLACE
Direct Access to healthcare products and services
Other Services
Direct population Health monitor
Automated targeted health messaging system
Advertising Tools for the healthcare industry

4.1.2 Listed Tradable Assets
MTC will be tradable on popular trading platforms. Having MTC listed on various
exchanges is another way we expect the Token utility to increase with liquidity.

MTC

29

4.1.3 Exclusive Owner Benefits
Finally, as an added incentive, MTC owners will receive periodic promotions,
discounted fees, preferential access to new products/services, and opportunities
to contribute in future ICO/Token Sales that DOCADEMIC will help launch.

4.5 Docademic Blockchain
MTC token will initially be built on top of Ethereum’s ERC-20 Token Standard.
By Q2 2019, Docademic will create its own blockchain (Docademic BLOCKCHAIN)
that will have specific Healthcare industry requirements already built in.
Currently, none of the existing blockchains (including Ethereum) oﬀer
sophisticated tools to build any meaningful or scalable Healthcare services on
top of their blockchains (other than basic services such as payments and
transfers).
All DOCADEMIC services will be migrated to the Docademic BLOCKCHAIN and the
existing ERC- 20 based MTC will also be exchanged to the newly created MC
(Medical Cryptocurrency) on the Docademic BLOCKCHAIN.
The Docademic BLOCKCHAIN will provide a more sophisticated Healthcare
industry programming language for the design and construction of smart
contracts that will allow Healthcare institutions and Digital Health startups to
build decentralized Healthcare services on top of the Docademic BLOCKCHAIN.
When we launch in Q2 2019, the Docademic BLOCKCHAIN will have the following
features:

MTC

1. KYC/AML
2. Node Management (Region Restrictions)
3. Healthcare Service Features

33

Docademic is creating a Healthcare services based blockchain that will be
powered by MC. As more Healthcare services utilize the Docademic blockchain,
we anticipate MC becoming the cryptocurrency of choice by a growing
ecosystem of healthcare service providers thus causing the utility of MC to grow.

Who Benefits

MTC

35

5.1 Individual and Institutional investors
Access to Great Technology
Over the years, Docademic has built state-of-the-art, high-availability, and highperformance technology for free accessibility to basic medical healthcare and
Services. This includes Smart Patient Routing (SPR) and Order Management
System(OMS) technology to Match patients with our doctors 24/7 through Video
Telemedicine, in addition to a powerful suite of tools with integrated AI for the
medical community covering all relevant Medical Specialties. Individual patients
now have a free quick easy to use option to get basic medical attention face to
face with a Doctor and Doctors have tools that help them in their everyday
practice.
Access to the worlds health services and products.
The ever-increasing number of Digital health services presents both a significant
opportunity and a challenge to reach these services for investors and traders
alike. Between USD 1 and 2 trillion in transactions are done daily in across
millions of healthcare providers. This presents a sizeable opportunity for traders
and investors who want to tap into the value that can be obtained with
decentralized healthcare services.
The chart below shows healthcare spending in the worlds markets according to
the world bank.

MTC

36

Reduced Risk
The challenge lies in having access to all healthcare services in an eﬀicient and
secure manner, with as little diﬀiculty of data transmission as possible.
At the time of writing, it is quite diﬀicult (even impossible) to fully take advantage
of these opportunities due to several factors. These range from technology
limitations, healthcare data restrictions, unreasonable prices, capital
ineﬀiciency, and an overall lack of clear integration.
DOCADEMIC through its integrated plan to use its current technologies and MTC
tokens provide a solution that takes advantage of Blockchain and Artificial
intelligence to achieve an eﬀicient on-ramp for customers to healthcare products
and services.
Access to Professional-Grade Services
The services that the DOCADEMIC Platform oﬀers are already powerful when
used on their own, but they can have a much stronger impact when coupled with
our Medical ecommerce platform, direct targeted notification system, and
sophisticated reporting tools.
Access to all health services the DOCADEMIC Platform provides will no longer be
the exclusive privilege of the few.
We are launching a fully open, super-connected platform that will allow
anybody, anywhere to participate and benefit from the Healthcare services that
new digital health markets and current Healthcare providers have to oﬀer.
This is real democratization of Health.

5.2 Token Holders
The DOCADEMIC Platform will also provide token holders with the following
additional services:
Crypto Lending
Token holders may lend their Crypto Tokens for a fee at DOCADEMIC. Doing so
adds liquidity to the MTC market, by providing the necessary inventory for
MTC

37

Healthcare providers such as Doctors who require purchasing goods and services
related to their practice. This increases the overall liquidity of MTC.

5.3 Financial Services Innovators and Society at
Large
Cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain/distributed ledger
technologies are a key facilitator for many of the applications, products and
services being introduced as part of the irreversible wave of innovation currently
taking place in the Healthcare services and Digital Health industries.
This wave of new innovations, sometimes referred to as, “the Digital Health
Revolution”, promises to completely disrupt traditional Healthcare services on all
fronts. It will ultimately.
Bring better, faster, cheaper healthcare services to everyone, including the
world’s estimated more than 4 billion with no access to healthcare at all. There
are also countless Doctors and health services who can’t get credit using
traditional banking, due to lack of credit histories and other reasons.
DOCADEMIC’s global network of Health services and healthcare industry
connections, regulatory licenses, and compliance/security frameworks can fill
the gaps for many of the existing Digital Health models for intra-country and
international health services.
We envision MTC to become the preferred token that can be
used in the broader Healthcare industry to power healthcare
services as they migrate to decentralized platforms.

DOCADEMIC’s
Competitive
Advantage

MTC

39

6.1 World Class Team
We have assembled a world class team with over 200 years of combined
experience in Healthcare and Technology.
Our team has a proven track record in IT, Hospital management, Pharmaceutical
Industry, Emergency Care, Clinical Research, Legal and regulatory—all combined
with expertise in Internet and mobile technology.
Most notably, we have built DOCADEMIC APP—one of the largest Video
Telemedicine services in the world with users in 20 countries. It is fully aligned
with the requirements of most regulated markets around the world.
DOCADEMIC’s management team has worked at the following companies
and institutions:
• Healthcare Institutions: ISSSTE, Stanford Research Institute,
COFEPRIS, Astra Zeneca, Nestle Pharma, Carnot Laboratories
• Internet and Technology: NETMARK, IPN
• Others: SEP, Televisa

6.2 Product Readiness
Our core product development is already completed. There is zero risk on core
product development.
The DOCADEMIC Platform:
• Is on the App Store and Play Store and currently has users in 20
countries with medical assistances of over 7,000 on peak months.
• Provides an unparalleled and powerful suite of AI-assisted tool for
Doctors and a social network for the medical community.

MTC

The world needs free basic access to healthcare and we are
solving a fundamental problem. We will continuously improve
our products using our cutting-edge technologies.
We know how to scale. We built DOCADEMIC APP to become one
of the most widely used Video Telemedicine services in world.
Our Product-Market fit is clear.

40

As is the case with all startups, though, 90% of companies will unfortunately fail
during product development and product-market fit stages. However,
DOCADEMIC is already past that risk zone.

MTC

41

6.3 Healthcare provider and Government
Relationships
Over the past four years, DOCADEMIC has built and connected with global
healthcare companies and governments—which the DOCADEMIC Platform is able
to leverage. The amount of work (resources, regulation, professional services)
makes our DOCADEMIC Platform truly unique.
We have been able to build these relationships as we are fully compliant,
regulated, and have never experienced any significant incidents of information
theft on any of our existing platforms (both DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC
FOR DOCTORS).

6.4 Regulated in the USA and LatAm and soon Rest
of World.
DOCADEMIC’s parent company Sidrese Sa. de CV. operates a fully-regulated Video
telemedicine service and we were the first global Telemedicine service to have
users in 20 countries.
DOCADEMIC’s regulatory team from Foley Lardner (Top Tier Healthcare law firm)
ensures we are within regulations in the US. Foley Lardner was Named "Law Firm
of the Year – Health Care Law" for three Consecutive Years by U.S. News.
DOCADEMIC’s team from international Law firm Hogan Lovells ensured the
correct legal and regulatory compliance in LatAm.
Combined these two world Class firms with International reach process and
design our legal and regulatory compliant structures for the rest of the world.

MTC

42

6.5 Compliance and Security
We are proud that DOCADEMIC’s products are compliant services in the Digital
Health and Telemedicine space. With Foley Lardner and Hogan Lovells as our
team of compliance counsel, an independent internal auditor, compliance
training for all employees, and an annual compliance plan agreed by our Risk
Management Committee and carried out by our entire senior management team.
we have built a culture of compliance within DOCADEMIC.
We recognize the risks of medical malpractice and low-quality healthcare
services, and we continuously strive to enhance our program to be the leading
example of best practices in the Digital Health world.
This culture is what allowed us to oﬀer our services and receive stellar reviews
from people from multiple countries, where others have not. No other Digital
Health company has this much reach and depth, especially in Video
Telemedicine.
DOCADEMIC strictly complies with clinical guidelines when we operate in
jurisdictions where telemedicine is not yet subject to specific regulation. We
comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we
operate.
On the Security and Privacy side, we took our years of experience working with
government-grade security and combined it with the most up-to-date tools and
techniques to leapfrog traditional Digital health institutions.
We have achieved a new healthcare-grade security program covering all the key
security domains.
These are:
1. Access Control.
2. Cryptography.
3. Information Security Governance and Risk Management.
MTC

4. Legal Regulations, Investigations and Compliance.
5. Operations Security.
6. Physical and Environmental Security.
7. Security Architecture and Design.
8. Telecommunications and Network Security.

43

In addition to our internal team, processes and tools – plus the state-of-the-art
external security tools and services we use—we will engage specialized external
penetration testers and even crowd-sourced penetration testing services to stay
ahead of would-be attackers. This protects the confidentiality, availability and
integrity of our systems, information—and ultimately our users.

At DOCADEMIC, security is a 24/7 activity. It’s everybody’s
responsibility, managed by our Risk Management
Committee which is comprised of our senior managers
from all areas of the business, and supported by state-ofthe-art technologies and tools.

LEGAL
GENERAL INFORMATION
This whitepaper describes the initial sale in which the MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY (MTC) is sold. MTC is a crypto token that is
designed to be used for all services provided by the DOCADEMIC platform as explained in this whitepaper. MTC also can be
used as a Crypto Token to pay for any other services provided by other business entities. DOCADEMIC will generally not limit
the usage of MTC or the types of business entities that would like to use MTC for their business.
MTC is not intended to constitute a security in any jurisdiction. This white paper is not a solicitation for investment and does
not pertain in any way to an oﬀering of securities in any jurisdiction.
Please note that purchases of MTC are final and non-refundable.
Individuals, businesses, and other organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring MTC.
LIMITATION OF THE PURCHASERS
You are not eligible to and you shall not purchase MTC through its token sale if you are a citizen or resident (tax or otherwise)
of any country or state where the purchase of MTC or similar Crypto Token may be prohibited, or the token sale is deemed to
be not compliant with the applicable laws and regulations. If you are a resident of People’s Republic of China, or The United
States of America you cannot purchase MTC through the token sale.
Purchases of MTC should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have extensive experience with, and
understanding of, the usage and intricacies of Crypto Tokens and blockchain based software systems. Purchasers should
have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other Crypto Tokens. Any entities of
DOCADEMIC and oﬀicers and employees thereof will not be responsible in any way for loss of any Crypto Tokens, MTC or fiat
currency resulting from actions taken by, or omissions of the purchasers. If you do not have the required experience or
expertise, then you should not purchase MTC or participate in the sale of MTC.
You should carefully consider the risks, costs, and any other demerits of acquiring MTC, and, if necessary, obtain your own
independent advice in this regard. If you are not in the position to accept nor to understand the risks associated with the
token sale of MTC (including the risks related to the non-development of the DOCADEMIC platform) or any other risks as
indicated in this whitepaper, you should not acquire MTC, until such that you have received the necessary independent
advice.
RISKS
The purchase of MTC carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing MTC, the purchaser should carefully consider the risks
listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professional prior to determining whether
to purchase MTC.
(a) MTC will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password selected by the purchaser. If a
purchaser of MTC does not maintain an accurate record of their password, this may lead to the loss of MTC. If
your password protection is weak and it is cracked or learned by somebody else, this may also lead to the loss of
MTC. As a result, purchasers must safely store their password in one or more backup locations that are well
separated from the primary location.
(b) The purchaser recognizes that some of the services under the DOCADEMIC PLATFORM are currently under
development and may undergo significant changes before release. The purchaser acknowledges that any of its
expectations regarding the form and functionality of the DOCADEMIC PLATFORM may not be met for any
number of reasons.
(c) The purchaser understands that while DOCADEMIC will make best eﬀorts to connect the DOCADEMIC
PLATFORM to most of the major healthcare services in the world, it is possible that some healthcare services
may decline the connection with the DOCADEMIC Platform, which may result in the less sharing of patient data
and oﬀering of certain health services in certain regions provided through the DOCADEMIC PLATFORM than
expected in this whitepaper.
(d) The purchaser understands that while DOCADEMIC will make best eﬀorts to release the next wave of services
of the DOCADEMIC PLATFORM on time, it is possible that the oﬀicial release may be delayed.
(e) As with other Crypto Tokens, value of MTC may fluctuate significantly and become reduced in value for any
number of reasons, including but not limited to, supply and demand, overall Crypto Tokens’ market conditions,
political or geographical reasons, changes of regulations in any jurisdictions, and technical reasons.

MTC

56
(f) MTC will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, any malfunction or unexpected functioning of the
Ethereum protocol may impact the purchaser’s ability to transfer or securely hold MTC. Such impact could
adversely aﬀect the value of MTC.
DISCLAIMER 1.1
To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable laws, regulations and rules, MTC, any entities of DOCADEMIC and oﬀicers
and employees thereof shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other losses of any kind, in
tort, contract or otherwise (including but not limited to loss of revenue, income or profits, and loss of use or data), arising out
of or relating to any acceptance of or reliance on this whitepaper or any part thereof by you.
Any entities of DOCADEMIC and oﬀicers and employees thereof shall not be liable for your loss of MTC after it is transferred to
you by any reason including but not limited to your failure to maintain or backup an accurate record of your password or
password cracking by somebody due to your poor maintenance of your password.
DOCADEMIC will do its best to launch its operations and further develop the DOCADEMIC PLATFORM. Any person undertaking
to acquire MTC acknowledges and understands however that DOCADEMIC does not provide with any warranty as to the
release of newer services of the DOCADEMIC PLATFORM. They acknowledge and understand therefore that DOCADEMIC (incl.
its bodies and employees) assumes no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage that would result from or relate to the
incapacity to use the MTC.
Regulatory authorities are carefully scrutinizing businesses and operations associated to Crypto Tokens in the world. In that
respect, regulatory measures, investigations or actions may impact DOCADEMIC’s business and may limit or prevent it from
developing its operations in the future. Any person undertaking to acquire MTC must be aware that DOCADEMIC’s business
model may change or need to be modified because of new regulatory and compliance requirements from any applicable laws
in any jurisdictions. In such case, purchasers and any person undertaking to acquire MTC acknowledge and understand that
neither DOCADEMIC nor any of its aﬀiliate shall be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or damages caused by such
changes.
This whitepaper and any other materials or explanations made by DOCADEMIC and its oﬀicers and employees shall not and
cannot be considered as an invitation to enter an investment. They do not constitute or relate in any way nor should they be
considered as an oﬀering of securities in any jurisdiction. This whitepaper does not include nor contain any information or
indication that might be considered as a recommendation or that might be used as a basis for any investment decision.
Neither DOCADEMIC nor any of its oﬀicers and employees are to be or shall be considered as advisor in any legal, tax or
financial matters.
Acquiring MTC shall not grant any right or influence over DOCADEMIC’s organization and governance to the purchasers.
