1. Abstract
This paper outlines the case for the implementation of a decentralized virtual gifting protocol to
incentivize and monetize content generation by individual content creators worldwide. The
protocol may be deployed on various existing content publishing platforms on the internet,
such as YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook, among others, and can be used to complement
conventional revenue streams which are primarily derived from advertising.
Asia Innovations Group (“AIG”) is a leading mobile entertainment company in Asia. It has
demonstrated that virtual gifting system is a highly effective monetization method for content
creators on its flagship live video platform, Uplive. Virtual gifts on Uplive not only drive
significant revenue for global content creators, but also enhance interactions and relationships
between creators and their fans. Since its launch in June 2016, the Uplive community has
rapidly expanded to 20 million global users, and the platform will generate more than USD $100
million in revenue for 2017. In September alone, over 25 million virtual gifts were purchased
and sent on Uplive.
The Universal Gifting Protocol draws from the positive Uplive experience, and seeks to enable
content producers across any content platform to receive gifts from their fans. These virtual
gifts will exist independently from any platform and retain their properties without any
centralized controlling mechanism.
Each virtual gift will be implemented as a smart contract on Ethereum blockchain, enabling the
virtual gifts to exist, be owned, and be transacted independently from any particular content
platform or system. This will serve to reduce the dependency of content producers on their
publishing platforms to secure revenue for their work, and, by extension, reliance on
advertisers. The proposed currency for transacting in the virtual gifts is GIFTO Tokens, which
will be deployed as an ERC20-standard token on the Ethereum blockchain. GIFTO Tokens will
also be used to incentivize and motivate an ecosystem of participants to help create, curate,
and redeem virtual gifts.
The Alpha version of GIFTO Protocol will be tested by end of 2017, and the Beta version is
targeted for testing in Q1 2018, with full commercial launch in Q2 2018. GIFTO Protocol will
leverage on Uplive’s existing 20 mln user base and 60,000 content creators to test, iterate, and
jump-start mass adoption, towards the vision of empowering millions of content creators
worldwide.

2. Executive Summary
The Pain Point for Content Creators
Global social media and broadcasting platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook have
allowed anyone to easily create content and build a fanbase of followers and consumers.
However, the bulk of revenue generation on such platforms remains heavily dependent on
advertising revenue. As a result, the incentive model which drives the ecosystem is largely
centralized and dominated by either the platform or the paying advertisers1, often at the
expense of content producers and consumers. Since advertisers and marketers typically place
greater value on reaching as broad an audience as possible, the present incentive system ends
up disproportionately favouring the most popular 1% of producers with the largest viewer base,
subscribers, or “hits”. So long as less popular content producers continue to be deprived of
representation and opportunities at the sustainable end of the revenue-split table, the
monetary incentives generated purely by advertising revenue will continue to be swallowed by
the top few percentage of content creators with the most traffic. The overall quality and
diversity of content on the platform may suffer because the vast majority of content creators
are simply not able to command a reliable income stream under the present incentive scheme,
regardless of their value to the users. The consequence is that due to the massive influence of
advertisers on the type of content that ends up being rewarded, a large catalogue of high
quality content may end up never being produced simply because it would be unsustainable
purely by advertising revenue. This represents a critical problem for both the platform and
audience.
The Solution: Uplive
The idea of generating revenue through virtual gifts or assets has been used extensively in the
digital gaming industry. However, AIG’s flagship product, Uplive, has demonstrated that a
sophisticated virtual gifting model can also work to create a sustainable ecosystem for
mainstream content creators. As an attestation to this point, the Uplive platform has already
been generating millions of dollars of income for over 60,000 content creators every month.
This constant income stream is generated directly from the ever-increasing dedicated viewer
base. AIG has enabled the “gig economy” as termed by the South China Morning Post, where a

1

5

broadcaster can generate significant, sustainable revenue simply by doing a few hours of
broadcasting a day2.
Examples of Uplive’s virtual gifts are presented below, while actual videos of these virtual gifts
in action can be seen at www.up.live.

The diagram below shows the positive feedback loop that virtual gifts create, and why it is such
a strong revenue driver. When a viewer sends a gift to a broadcaster, he or she receives visual
delight and appreciation from the gift. When the broadcaster responds with thanks, the viewer
feels the recognition and gratitude. This in turn encourages more gifting, and enhances their
social relationship, in a way that a simple monetary tip can never do. In essence, this mirrors
real life gifting behavior and psychology, generating a reinforcing positive feedback loop.

To truly unleash the transformative potential of the virtual gifting model, we must transcend
the boundaries of any platform, including our own. We understand the immense benefits of
allowing the audience to reward producers directly, without intermediaries such as the
platform or advertisers dictating how producers should be paid. Therefore, we have been
working on expanding the deployment of such a model to any content producer around the
world, regardless of which platform they choose to publish on. Our objective is to advance our
monetization system for the benefit of the millions of content creators worldwide, while
allowing meaningful relationships to be built directly between the content creators and their
fans. Uplive has already demonstrated that this revenue model is possible. Now, we want to
bring this immensely rewarding and effective system to the entire world.
We do, however, recognise that there are multiple challenges in bringing our vision to reality.
These include the following:
● There is no universally immutable and trusted ledger recording values, transactions and
characteristics of virtual gifts, which are assets with significant economic value;
● Virtual gifts are susceptible to sabotage, such as duplication of a limited edition gift,
falsifying transactions, unauthorized changing values of their properties, among other
vulnerabilities;
● There is no organised framework to manage the high number of participants required to
create, categorise, control and run a sophisticated virtual gifting system;
● Without such a cohesive framework, it is difficult to attract and retain the number of
participants required to service content creators and their fans on a global scale;
7

Creating high quality and large variety of creative virtual gifts involves a combined and sizeable
team effort involving many participants following a pre-set workflow which has been
implemented internally at Uplive , as illustrated by the process below:

This process works well for Uplive, however, it relies on a few key centralized functions and
often results in bottleneck of the speed and quality of the end products. For example, our
curators have to manually test and trial each virtual gift for each content creator, and from an
idea to a high monetization and popular gift, it often takes weeks to create. There is also lack of
direct incentives for participants to apply their creativity to the gifts as it is difficult to track how
much of their own effort contributes to the end result of the gift created.
Finally, combination of virtual gifts and content creators can have different revenue shares, i.e.,
a gift with an IP, such as Mercedes virtual car, will have revenue share with the brand. And
more experienced creators can command higher revenue share. This complex matrix of
revenue share is calculated by Uplive’s internal management system and verified by a team of
analysts, and the effort increases as Uplive’s scale expands.
Therefore, we have identified the need to build a more decentralized ecosystem, that involves
the online community in all aspects of creating and maintaining the system. We need to
implement clear rules and an incentive system that results self-governance, with minimal
centralized management.
Our model must also motivate its participants to create high-value virtual gifts for content
creators in sufficient quantity to meet the existing demand. Gift creators, as crucial components
of the ecosystem, will eventually produce a wholly new content interaction experience for
content producers and audiences alike. As illustrated in the above diagram, each party in the
8

ecosystem will be incentivized to participate and contribute in the workflow. For example, the
Gift Creator, Reviewer, and Content Creator will each receive a share of the value of the virtual
gifts that have been purchased by the Fan. This way, this ecosystem is able to scale more
organically, without being subject to the monopolization or dictation of revenue flow by any
centralized entity.
The Solution: GIFTO Protocol - The Universal Gifting Protocol powered by blockchain
Blockchain technology offers two capabilities that are critical for our needs:
● Blockchain enables creation of a virtual asset that holds value across any platform and is
immutable.
● Blockchain enables rules to be built into a decentralized system with defined roles that
can be utilized by community participants to drive a workflow. Their actions can be
incentivized and enforced by the blockchain, creating a self governing ecosystem. In
particular, revenue share of the virtual gift’s value to different participants can be
written directly into the gift.
GIFTO Protocol - The Universal Gifting Protocol aims to utilize the above two capabilities of
blockchain technology to create a decentralized ecosystem where a community of participants
can come together to create, curate, and customize a rich variety of high-quality virtual gifts for
global content creators.
In seeking to make a virtual gift immutable and independent of any content platform, we plan
to implement it as a smart contract asset.

9

GIFTO Protocol will also build a series of rules and incentives to drive the workflow of virtual
gifting, including the process of creation, curation, selection, and purchasing. These rules and
incentives will also be implemented using blockchain, so anyone can participate in the workflow
and be rewarded for it.
GIFTO Tokens are compliant with ERC-20 standards on the Ethereum system, and will be
created for audiences to purchase virtual gifts to reward content creators. The virtual gifts,
their properties, and workflows will be codified in an ethereum smart contract.
Finally, in order to ensure frictionless adoption, A Web-based gifting system will enable virtual
gifts to be sent by users to content creators on YouTube, Instagram, or any content/social
media platform, by just using a Web link, without any plugin or any additional technical effort.
Implementation and adoption
We have already begun implementation of GIFTO Protocol, leveraging our substantial
experience in building virtual gift systems and mass market consumer products. The Alpha
version of GIFTO Protocol will be in testing by end of 2017, and the Beta version will commence
testing in Q1 2018. Recognizing that high transaction throughput rate on blockchain is a key
obstacle to mass adoption, we are actively evaluating several leading technology projects.
We will leverage our existing user base of 20 millions users and 60,000 creators to test, iterate,
and jump start mass adoption. They will be the first adopters and testers of the Alpha version
of GIFTO Protocol.

3. Motivation: A First-Hand Experience
3.1 Why Current Content Monetization Model Is Broken
Platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, have made it easy for anyone to create
content with their mobile phones and reach theoretically anyone in the world. Youtube has a
Monthly Active User (MAU) count of 1.5 billion users3 while Instagram has 700 million MAU4.
Any one of these users can become a content creator. However, as easy as it is to create
content, it remains difficult for the vast majority of content providers to make a meaningful
living from doing so.

11

The fact is that the vast majority of online content creators today are simply not able to make a
sustainable living from their work. We have observed that an over-reliance on advertising
revenue across many major centralised content platforms has led to the creation of autocratic
incentive systems which disproportionately favour mass-market content and “top-tier”
producers. This model has created an epidemic of systematic revenue deprivation, orphaning
the vast majority of budding online content creators, and stifling the diversity and quality of
content being produced. The problem is that many content platforms have not adapted their
products and services to generate value for the bulk of content creators - who, ironically,
continue to drive traffic on their platform.
Statistics show that only 0.33% of all videos on Youtube have more than 1 million views5, with
videos of 1 million views earning only a measly USD $2,000.006. This epidemic of systemic
revenue deprivation is highly concerning to us. Many deserving content creators are completely
neglected by this immensely lopsided system, which disproportionately favors mass-market
content over niche, tailor-made content, which may be of equal or higher value to a viewer. The
under-representation of the overwhelming majority of creators on many global platforms today
paints a worrisome picture of the content production industry as a whole. While we believe
that all artists, producers and writers should be able to make a decent living, there is simply no
impetus to change this crippling model.
In addition, since many content platforms rely so heavily on advertising revenue, they often
have little choice but to cater to the whims, demands and expectations of the advertisers. For
example, in 2017, some advertisers advanced concerns about their advertisements are being
shown next to what they deemed to be “unsafe” content, and pulled the plug on many
advertisements. The end result profoundly affected the earnings of many content producers,
even significantly decreasing revenue for many of the “top-tier” content creators.

“Phil DeFranco, who has about 5.6 million
subscribers on YouTube, saw ad revenue
drop by 30 percent within the first month.
H3h3Productions, which has about 4.7
million subscribers, said it was only making
15 percent of what it typically makes month
on month via YouTube”
● Sep 7th, 2017, DigiDay
https://digiday.com/media/advertisers-may-have-returned-toyoutube-but-creators-are-still-losing-out-on-revenue/

At AIG, we have a deep understanding of this painful issue. We are intimately familiar with the
perils of using advertising revenue as a livelihood crutch, and know what this can mean for
producers when the crutch breaks unexpectedly. As an example, within our portfolio is BigCat,
the leading original content creator on Youtube in South East Asia, with over 150 million views
every month. BigCat has created many long running video shows, each, on average, producing
2 episodes per month. The average number of views for each episode is over 3 million. Ghien
Mi Go is one of BigCat’s most popular channels, with the most popular video amassing over 69
million views.

However, with even with a staggering 150 million views and 11 million unique viewers per
month, BigCat can only make USD $20,000 per month via YouTube advertising. All these views
and users are just brand showcase for Bigcat, with custom brand videos becoming the main
revenue driver. If this is the case for a top content creator, we can only imagine the level of
impoverishment for the other 99.99% of creators who do not reach any where close to 150
million views a month. This problem is not just on YouTube, but endemic across many leading
content platforms today.

13

3.2 A Better Monetization Model: Virtual Gifting
On the other hand, AIG’s flagship product, Uplive, provides an alternative through its virtual
gifting solution. After its launch in June 2016, Uplive quickly became the highest monthly
revenue international live streaming platform. As of August 2017, Uplive is receiving over USD
10 million per month of gross revenue from millions of users across 50+ countries, and at the
same time, generating millions of income for the 60,000+ broadcasters spread across these
countries. In essence, Uplive is now one of the largest user-generated content platforms that is
powered directly through user contributions, and not advertising.
Uplive serves the needs of the global community. With real-time translation support in multiple
languages, an Uplive user can interact with broadcasters from around the world, from Japan to
Morocco, all from the comfort of their own home. The Uplive platform enables users to
transcend traditional physical and language barriers, forging meaningful interactions between
people across cultures, languages and races. Perhaps most crucially, Uplive also demolishes
revenue barriers for content creators.

The key to Uplive’s strong, sustainable revenue model lies in its highly optimized virtual giftbased monetization system. The system is based on proven business models in Asia and the
team’s deep understanding of game mechanics. Uplive’s founder, Andy Tian, was one of the
earliest social game makers in 2008, who later headed up Zynga China and parts of Asia
operations. Throughout his career, Andy contributed to building more than 20 games that

14

collectively grossed over USD 500 Million of revenue, being played by over 50 millions users
around the world.
Uplive enables content creators to generate significant revenue directly from their fanbase. The
top broadcasters on Uplive regularly make over USD $50,000 a month, for broadcasting only 12 hours per day. On a monthly basis, Uplive’s 60,000+ broadcasters receive over 25 million
virtual gifts from users around the world. As Uplive grows, we expect the number of
broadcasters to surpass 100,000 in Q1 of 2018.

3.3 Why Do Virtual Gifts Generate High Revenue?
Virtual gifts are not just beautiful animations on the screen. Their ability to generate significant
revenue comes from sophisticated implementation of game mechanics and social psychology
which have been deeply considered and methodically executed by Uplive.
Visual expression is essential to make it “fun” for senders and receivers of gifts
Beautiful, expressive virtual gifts dramatically increase willingness of users to send gifts to
broadcasters. For example, after an upgrading exercise of our gifts from simple graphics to
more expressive animations, revenue from gifts increased five times. As we are veterans in the
gaming industry, our artists, who have previously worked on some of the best international
games, created some of the most beautiful virtual gifts ever in the live streaming industry. We
have observed that users and broadcasters on Uplive find it incredibly “fun” and rewarding to
send/receive gifts.
Virtual gift is critical in enhancing social relationships
The concept of “tipping” a content creator has been around for a long time, and there are many
such services in the West, from Twitch credits to crypto tips on Reddit. However, we have
observed that virtual gifts are much more powerful and evocative than cash. Gifting is a basic,
universal human social behavior, built on the psychology of reciprocity. A direct monetary tip
simply cannot supplant the flow of positive emotions generated from receiving a more
expressive, personalised gift. In addition, there is only one way to send someone 10 dollars, but
infinite ways of sending someone gifts valued at 10 dollars. In the physical world, care,
appreciation, and adoration are expressed by the process of selecting, packaging, and delivering
of a gift. That is how people build social relationships of significance, and this is what Uplive
brings to the virtual world.
In Uplive, the emotional reward of receiving visually exciting and fun virtual gifts greatly
enhances relationship between the broadcaster and his/her fans, in a way that a monetary
“tip”, be it $1 or 0.01 BTC, can never do. The diagram below shows the positive feedback loop
15

that virtual gifts can create. When a viewer sends gift to a broadcaster, he/she receives visual
delight and appreciation from the gift. When the broadcaster responds with thanks, the viewer
feels recognition. This leads to more gift sending, and enhances their social relationship in a
multitude of ways that a simple monetary tip (and much less, advertising revenue) can never
do. In essence, Uplive brings real-life gifting concepts, along with all its attendant benefits
directly into the virtual world. The result is that both the content producers and their audiences
are rewarded in their own way.

Users are willing to pay significant real money for virtual gifts.

Our sales statistics have demonstrated that users are willing to pay as much as USD $1,471.00
for an “Around the World” gift, one of our most expensive and elaborate gifts. Because these
gifts have real meaning within our Uplive platform, users begin to attach real value to them,
and therefore are willing to pay for them. This concept has been proven true time and time
again in online games, and we have simply adopted this concept to our content platform.

17

Virtual gifts are an integral part of a larger gamification framework
In Uplive, we control all aspects of the gifting experience by crafting a rich, intriguing variety of
tiered virtual gifts for use on the platform. The following are some of the characteristics of
Uplive gifts:
● Scarce: only 100 of this special gift is available
● Customized: some VIP users and broadcasters have gifts that are customized for them
with their special requests and taste
● Transient: this gift must be used in 5 days, or it will expire
● Combinable: 3 gifts can be combined to form a new, more valuable one
● Special-occasion-based: gifts for Christmas, Easter, Valentine’s Day
● Collectable: 12 types of horoscope gifts can be collected with rewards
● Tradeable: this gift can be traded once to others
● Variable-pricing: this gift has a defined discount just for 5 days
● AR: gifts of crowns, flowers, sunglasses can be worn by broadcasters to enhance their
appearance
● Interactive: users can interact with gifts for game like fun
● Randomly generated: some gifts when opened will randomly generate more valuable
ones
For anyone who has built large scale, virtual goods
driven online games before, these categories would
look immediately familiar as in game items. We have
adopted the core concepts from the digital gaming
industry and implemented a similarly intuitive but
sophisticated gifting system, which works well for users
who have never played games before.
Virtual gifts lead to engaging new advertising
Uplive has worked with many leading brands to create
virtual versions of their products, which users actively
engage with. In the example on the left, Uplive has
worked with Mercedes in Taiwan to create a unique
SLC gift that was a part of the Valentine’s day event.
These virtual gifts are extremely popular with users,
and also represent a new type of highly engaging
advertising value.

3.4 Blockchain: Decentralized Virtual Gifts
As we steadily grow our Uplive network, we have come to recognize the underlying potential
for our system to serve countless content creators residing on other content platforms. There
are millions of such content creators in the world. Yet, some may have already invested too
much into their content platforms to justify a migration to Uplive, while other creators may
produce content that is just not suited for live broadcasting. We thus encounter numerous
technical and economical challenges in exporting our native system for the benefit of these
content creators. While our virtual gifts are a powerful and effective monetization tool,
currently they can only be used specifically on Uplive. Outside of our centralized system, and
without a well-defined, unalienable set of rules, these virtual gifts quickly lose their meaning
and value, and will ultimately fail to benefit content creators.
We have established that for a virtual gifting system to exist independently of any centralized
system such as Uplive, it must have following features:
● Trusted continuity of value: it must have a well-defined and universally accepted value
that is trusted regardless of any platform.
● Lifetime: must be able to define how long this gift is valid for. This is commonly used for
special occasion gifts such as holidays, where a Santa would not be appropriate any
more after Christmas.
● Immutable transaction records: it must permanently record all actions performed on the
gift, such as
o The identity of the sender and the receiver
o Changes in value
o Changes in any identifying properties, names, visual asset, etc.
● Creator/owner: it must record who created this gift, and who is the current owner
● Customizable properties
o Allow anyone with creative ideas to create their own customized gifts
We have identified blockchain technology and smart contracts as the basis for deploying a
universal, decentralised virtual gifting system which can be deployed and usable by any content
creator. This technology will extinguish the continued reliance on any centralised platform, and
yet allow content creators to reap significant commercial value directly from their fans, while
simultaneously enhancing the overall experience and social relationships.
We note that the concept of virtual asset transmission on blockchain is not a novel concept. In
fact, there are already some early implementations of collectible virtual assets, such as Rare
Pepe virtual trading cards, which uses counterparty.io to ensure the uniqueness of each card.
The social value of these items can be seen in the vibrant Rare Pepe trading community.
19

Now, we want to capitalise on the inherent capabilities of the blockchain, along with our deep
expertise in gamification and virtual gift systems, to introduce a universal gifting system for the
benefit of content creators worldwide, across any platform. Empowered by blockchain
technology, we will create the first, truly decentralized universal gifting protocol. We name it
“GIFTO Protocol - The Universal Gifting Protocol”.

4. GIFTO Protocol - The Universal Gifting Protocol
GIFTO Protocol - The Universal Gifting Protocol is envisioned to be a self-governing and selfsustaining ecosystem for virtual gifts to be created, curated, tracked, bought, sent and
exchanged across any content platform such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Uplive.
For it to truly be a self-sustaining ecosystem for all contributors, GIFTO Protocol will have the
following components:
● Gifts - GIFTO Protocol’s Virtual Smart Gifts, self-executing virtual assets based on smart
contracts that live on the blockchain
● Gift Store, where a fan can buy a gift for the content creator
o The Gift Store will be displayed when a fan clicks on the gifting link for a content
creator (see section 4.1), and will show gifts customized by this content creator
● Gift Inventory, holds gifts for a user who can be either a fan or a content creator
● GIFTO Tokens, an ERC20-standards token used to buy/redeem virtual gifts.
● GIFTO Wallet, a wallet to hold GIFTO Tokens for a user
● Gift Portal, a management system for gifts to be created, curated, and managed by
GIFTO Protocol contributors

20

The Gift Portal is the interface through which all the participants in the ecosystem conduct their
actions on the virtual gift workflow:

21

4.1 Enable Virtual Gifting On Any Content Platform
Our experience with building and deploying large scale consumer products has revealed that
frictionless interfaces to technology tend to lead towards higher success rates of mass
adoption.
We envision the GIFTO Protocol to enable any content creator to receive gifts on any content
platform. Therefore, in order to successfully induce mass adoption amongst users, the
blockchain technology has to be implemented and deployed a seamless and easy-to-use
manner.
In response, we have created a broad HTML5-based gifting interface, meaning that only a link is
needed to send virtual gifts to any content creator on any platform. We have eliminated the
need to download any further plugins or other clumsy technical integration tools.
Using Youtube as an example, the basic gift-giving flow is as follows:
Step 1: The content creator selects Step 2: A Web link is created for the
the gifts appropriate his or her content content creator that will show the gifts
project
to her fans

22

Step 3: The content creator can paste
the link in her Instagram, Facebook, or
YouTube channel

Step 4: a fan clicks on the link, opens
up the customized Gift Store, uses
GIFTO to purchase and send a gift

Once a content creator receives the virtual gift, it is stored in inventory, he or she can then
choose one of two actions:
● Redeem the virtual gift and convert it into GIFTO Tokens; where the virtual gift then
disappears from inventory, or
● Keep the virtual gift, which can be sent at a later time to others.
○ Limited edition gifts are especially valuable

4.2 The Ecosystem Of Virtual Gifting
The creation and maintenance of a high-quality and high-demand inventory of virtual gifts is a
manpower-intensive task. Our team of over 300 highly skilled game artists, designers, engineers
and operational staffs can only create 50 new gifts a month. This number clearly falls short of
what we want to achieve for all the content creators across the multiple content platforms.
23

Therefore, we need to build a proper ecosystem of active participants who will work together
to create a system that is scalable and self-sustaining. Our vision of the key participants is
outlined below:
-

Content creators: The producers or creators of any content around the world that has
his or her fan-base, be it video, music, art, or any other communicative medium
Virtual gift creators: The contributors/artists who create the virtual gift assets, from
images to animations; they can also be content creators themselves
Curators: The panel to review and curate virtual gifts for quality, categorization, and
pricing
Fans: The fans, fan-base of content producers or creators

Our Uplive platform has implemented this concept, and truly refined the process of how each
actor performs its role and complements the others in this highly dynamic virtual ecosystem.
Our constant dedication to fine-tuning every aspect of the gifting cycle is how we ensure that
we have one of the most sophisticated and valuable virtual gifting systems in the entire live
streaming industry. Now, we can finally combine the power of this proven system with the
immutable and decentralised capabilities of blockchain technology to better serve the needs of
millions of deserving content producers and creators all around the world. Our virtual gift
system will connect creators and consumers in ways never experienced before.

A few things to note:
1. It is crucial to have a centralized forum where ideas can be pooled and improved
upon, because even the best gift creators do not have all the best ideas.
24

Furthermore, some ideas will tend to be iterative in nature, hence the gift ideas’
pool must constantly filter out unoriginal or repeated gift concepts. A gift creator
can access the pool to see what has already been created as gifts or to get inspired
to create new ones.
2. A Gift Creator is often a visual artist, who creates an image or animation as a virtual
gift. The Gift Creator can also use trademarked IPs once he/she has obtained
permission from the IP holder. For example, to create a virtual Chanel handbag, the
gift creator must have obtained prior permission. Whether the created gift has an IP
component should be marked in the gift record. IP owner can grant permission with
a pre-agreed fee to gift creators. Curators and users can report an IP violation,
which will cause the gift to be taken out of circulation and its creator notified with
relevant action(s) taken where necessary. Lastly, being a Gift Creator does not
preclude the same person from being a content producer as well.
3. The Curator plays an important role. One key learning we had when dealing with
user-generated content is that a solid curation framework greatly increases the
quality of content offerings. The best gift creators are not necessarily the best
curators, and vice versa. Therefore, we must separate the creation and curation in
the form of a maker/checker system.
The Curator has 3 things to review:
o Content:
§ Visually judge representation and description.
§ Weed out inappropriate or low quality content.
§ Flag out any potential legal violations or IP violations.
o Category:
§ Proper gift categorization for better sorting capabilities
o Price:
§ Determining appropriate pricing levels. The initial price must be well
represented based on its visual quality, value in real world context and
price relativity. For example, a virtual Diamond-studded pen can be more
expensive than a virtual car even though the virtual car is more expensive
than a normal virtual pen.
Curation is not an easy job and the curator might not be well-versed to judge all gifts.
Hence, a curator can choose to skip a gift if he/she is unsure about it and only curates
the ones that he/she has domain knowledge in.

25

1. The content creator can choose the type of gift for their fans to see to create a
customized and constant fresh engagement experience.
2. To close the loop, fans can select and purchase gifts with GIFTO Tokens to send to the
content creator while also providing feedback on new concepts for gift ideas to be
added to the pool of gifts.

4.3 Community Participation: Incentives
We want GIFTO Protocol - The Universal Gifting Protocol to eventually be the ultimate “gift” to
the global community where everyone can create, send, and receive gifts regardless of the
platform in which they reside. Our live video streaming and gaming experience has proven that
it will not only create a significant monetization avenue for the hard working content creators
but also make it mutually rewarding for all parties involved. Our vision is to use the element of
enjoyment and personal connections to further enhance the social dynamics of all virtual
relationships.
We know that for any decentralized ecosystem to work, a proper incentive and disincentive
mechanism must be set in place to continuously reward and encourage positive behavior, while
eliminating unacceptable behaviors. The rules governing this framework should be simple,
logical and transparent enough for anyone to easily read and understand. When such a
framework is properly executed within the ecosystem, it can create a positive feedback loop
that is truly decentralized, in a trustless and autonomous manner. Our suggested framework is
presented below.
Positive Incentives
When the fan purchases a gift with GIFTO Tokens and sends it to the content creator, the
following proposed revenue share in GIFTO tokens ensures everyone involved is compensated:

26

*Note that all token revenue shares occur only after transaction fees incurred by the gift
purchase have been deducted.
Notes:
● Content creator will earn up to 80% as he/she is considered the main contributor to the
ecosystem.
● Gift creator earns 5%:
o If an established IP is used, then the IP rights holder will be entitled to a portion of
this token revenue share. Actual % is up to agreement between gift creator and IP
owner, and there will be a custom data field in the smart contract for this gift.
● Gift Curator earns 2% for work done in reviewing the gift created.
● GIFTO Protocol earns 10% for operational support and maintenance of the ecosystem.
● The remaining 3% would be accumulated into a rewards pool to be paid out periodically to
all viewers/fans as bonus or lucky draw prizes to reinforce the element of fun and
gamification.
The proposed token revenue share will be written into each gift’s smart contract so that all
shares are done in a fair, instant and transparent manner. We will implement constant
iterations to optimize the incentives for all parties involved as the ecosystem evolves from
Alpha to Beta testing versions.
Negative Incentives
There are a number of ways that the ecosystem workflow can be compromised. We foresee
that the following weaknesses may still exist:
● Gift Creators can create poor quality, offensive Gifts which the Curator fails to spot.
● A virtual Gift might violate an existing IP
● A Gift Creator purposely set very high prices for all of his/her gifts
To effectively curb undesired behavior, we will implement certain mechanisms as utilized in the
Uplive platform. As a starting point, detailed policies will be iterated and completed during Beta
testing version:
● Inherent checks and balances in the ecosystem:
○ Content creator receives the majority of the economic value from each gift,
therefore they are the most incentivized to select best quality gifts to increase
the chance that their fans would purchase.
○ Content creators are also the most publicly visible participants hence any
violation of IP rights or common decency is associated with and reflects badly on
them.
27

○ Fans are paying with GIFTO Tokens, which will have economic value, and
therefore will only buy gifts that are high quality and those that they fancy, at
the price that they think are fair. Inefficient or unrealistic pricing of Gifts will
result in fewer purchases, as it is in the real world.
● Gift Ratings:
○ Gifts are rated by fans and content creators:
■ When content creator view Gifts for selection
■ When fans see them in the Gift Store
○ Ratings are based on a widespread 5-star rating (1-worst and 5-best).
○ The ratings of the Gift are recorded for both Gift Creator and Curator
○ If ratings fall below 4 stars, the Gift Creator’s and Curator’s revenue share will be
reduced to 50% of their allocated % earnings.
○ If ratings fall below 3.5 stars, their revenue share would be adjusted to 0%.
Uplive has created a vibrant economy of content creators with fans that are happy to pay for
virtual gifts. We will exercise the same time-tested policies that have been proven to work for
the new GIFTO Protocol ecosystem.

4.4 The Gift Portal
The Gift Portal will enable content creators and users to better manage the entire gifting
experience, from both giving and receiving perspectives.
For content creators:
•
•
•
•
•

To view their received Gifts
Allows content creator to view Gift statistics and continuously customize which
gifts are available for his/her viewers, in order to maximize monetization
View various leaderboards (image 4.4.1 below)
Access analytics to help content creators understand which content drives better
monetization
Use management and communication tool between content creators and their
top fans

For users:
•
•
•

To view which content creators they have sent Gifts to
To view their currently purchased gifts that have not been sent

29

The fan can see who else has sent gifts to this
content creator

To further enhance the social gifting experience, we will introduce the element of competition.
GIFTO Protocol will exhibit a variety of leaderboards for each content creator to encourage
competition amongst his or her fans. The more generous the fan, the higher up the leaderboard
he or she will place.
From the leaderboards, both users and content creators will be able to see who are the top
fans for this creator, what are the most popular gifts, and which content is the most popular.

30

With leaderboards and rankings, content creators can see who their top contributors are. This
opens up more avenues for revenue and content generation. For example, customized content
can be produced at the top contributor’s request; content can also be made exclusively for such
contributors. This system allows producers to build closer relationships with contributors and
dramatically enhances the social relationships between content creators and fans, as they
currently do on Uplive.

4.5 Smart Virtual Gifts
Smart Virtual Gifts are digital assets deployed using smart contracts within the blockchain. They
are used to publish and store data about virtual gifts on the blockchain. Using smart contracts
ensures that virtual gifts are kept transparent and immutable. The Smart Virtual Gift’s record
includes the following data:

Gift name
Visual asset
Gift creator
Provenance of the Gift (Origination/Transaction Path)
Content creator who is merchandizing this gift
Gift value in GIFTO tokens
Token revenue share contracts
○ ie, 5% for Gift Creator, 10% for IP if used, 70% for Content Creator
● Special properties based on categories below
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Many categories of Gifts have already been deployed in Uplive and will be ported over to GIFTO
Protocol. Over time, new types of gifts can be created by the community based on creativity
31

and demand of fans. Pricing of virtual gifts in GIFTO Tokens will be publicly visible in the
representation of the gift. The various models and formats of virtual Gifts to be implemented
using smart contracts are seen below.

4.6 GIFTO Token
GIFTO Tokens will be the main transactional currency in GIFTO Protocol and will be used in the
following ways:
1. Virtual gifts: Community members can use GIFTO Tokens to buy and redeem virtual
gifts;
2. Incentivizing the community: Participants can earn GIFTO Tokens by performing a
service in the ecosystem. e.g. creating a virtual gift or curating virtual gifts
GIFTO Tokens will be compliant with ERC20 standards and will possess the following properties:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Foundation: Ethereum blockchain
Name: GIFTO; Symbol: GIFTO
Supply: One Billion (1,000,000,000) GIFTO Tokens in total
Balance: Available publically on Ethereum
Account: Uses Ethereum addresses
Mining: None
Owner: A multi-signature wallet
Restriction: Owner (Issuer of GIFTO Tokens) cannot purchase, but Owner can allow the
purchase and control of the token initial price peg. The Owner can withdraw ethers
from the contract.

4.7 GIFTO Wallet
To make it easy for users who are new to cryptocurrency, we have also developed the GIFTO
Wallet, a U.S. Patent pending technology transactional wallet. The GIFTO Wallet will handle all
GIFTO-related transaction activities such as creating the user’s wallet on the Ethereum
blockchain, and performing the transferring, buying, redemption functions both internally on
our network and externally on the blockchain. With the GIFTO Wallet, any user can easily
manage, transfer or purchase GIFTO Tokens via Uplive or any other content platforms.

32

In the GIFTO Wallet API/SDK, all communications are securely encrypted via 256-bit encryption,
and the user of the GIFTO Wallet in the application is the only one who can authorize the
transaction. This is done without requiring us to store any user’s wallet credentials in our
system. Hence the user’s wallet’s private key will be only be accessible by the user.
We recognise that the complexity of vague transaction fees, encryption necessitating private
and private key management and alphanumeric addresses may create significant barriers to
mass adoption. To address these issues, GIFTO Wallet will make it very simple for all users to
transact using a simple password or biometrics like fingerprint. Transaction fees will be kept
minimal and fully transparent.
All of Uplive’s 20 million users will have access to the first version of GIFTO Wallet by end of
2017, which will provide the initial user base for GIFTO Protocol.

4.8 Hybrid Off-Chain/On-Chain Architecture
Although the Ethereum blockchain technology is powerful due to its support for readilydeployable smart contracts, one of its often-cited drawbacks is that it is slow and expensive to
confirm a transaction. Recent proposals by many blockchain experts on how to make
transactions much faster did not clearly demonstrate how this issue will be solved in the near
future. We are aware that the time taken to confirm a transaction on the blockchain is
increasingly crucial as we move towards mass adoption, and are constantly surveying
alternative solutions.
Plasma, Lightning, EOS, Cardano, and Zilliqa are some of the numerous transaction platforms
being studied as alternatives. We are in the process of thoroughly evaluating these options to
see if any of them will be suitable for GIFTO Protocol. We will conduct real-world trials once we
have attained a critical mass of real users on GIFTO Protocol.
33

As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we are also in the process of
developing a hybrid architecture (off-chain/on-chain solution) to support fast transaction
execution required by the large volumes expected from virtual gift transactions, while
preserving a sufficient degree of decentralization. The first version of this architecture is
expected to launch in Q1 2018 to support the Beta test of GIFTO Protocol.

4.9 Token Economy
A healthy token economy is key for tokens to shift in the price curve, in a way that directly
proportional to the number of users who are using the token. Healthy token economy has
following characteristics:
● Growing demand: more and more users want to use the token to create value
● Fixed supply: total number of tokens are fixed
● Balance of gradual consumption of tokens and supplying of tokens into the economy
In the centralized Uplive experience, we are running a $100M a year virtual economy, based on
our in-app token, Diamond.
The Diamond user experience is visually explained on the next few pages.

34

Diamonds are the in-app currency that is
They are purchased by fiat via traditional
used to purchase virtual gifts for broadcasters payment channels such as Google Pay and
Apple Pay

Notice that there is 587 Diamonds in my wallet above. This is a natural phenomenon which
occurs in all virtual economies, especially in games. Users use fiat to purchase an in-game/inapp currency, and it takes a period of time for the users to spend the currency to buy game
items, in this case, virtual gifts.
In Uplive, on average it takes up to 5 days for users to fully spend the Diamonds that they
purchased. And because they are buying virtual gifts in real time for the broadcasters, they
almost always buy more Diamonds as soon as the previous balance dips below what is required
to buy a particular gift.

35

1. User buys a gift for broadcaster

2. Gift animation plays, broadcaster is happy;
the user is motivated to buy another gift

36

3. The next gift costs more than the balance
of Diamonds of the user

4. The user is prompted to purchase more
Diamonds

Note 67 Diamonds are still left in the balance before user buys. On average, in Uplive, per day
per paying user, there are 50 Diamonds left in balance.
Therefore, we believe that a similar pattern will emerge in the GIFTO Protocol, whereby there
will always be GIFTO tokens left over in a user’s wallet after buying virtual gifts. This means that
the number of GIFTO tokens held and not sold will increase proportionally to the number of
users who use GIFTOs to buy virtual gifts. This creates a natural restriction to token supply,
which will create natural shifts in the token price curve over time. No additional artificial
mechanism is needed.
37

5. Roadmap and Adoption
Unlike most projects that have only a great idea, GIFTO comes with Uplive’s large userbase and
broadcasters. After all, the whole idea of universal gifting was in response to strong demand by
current Uplive content creators. Our experience with building products for more than 100
million users across multiple countries, languages, and cultures have trained us to be very
mindful of how to drive adoption of new technologies. We will bring these learnings to GIFTO’s
adoption.
We will address 3 aspects of adoption in this section

•

Quantifying the total reach of Uplive’s userbase for GIFTO
Plan for migrating Uplive itself from Diamonds to GIFTOs
Phased execution and timeline

5.1 Uplive Brings 70 Million Global User Reach To GIFTO
Collectively, Uplive already reaches 70 million users that will be incentivized to jump start the
global virtual gifting ecosystem.
•
•

•

Uplive’s 60,000 broadcasters have millions of fans OUTSIDE of Uplive on YouTube,
Instagram, and Facebook
about 10,000 broadcasters have average of 10,000 fans across these platforms, with a
combined 100 million, assuming a large 50% overlap in users, conservatively the reach is
50 million users outside Uplive.
Uplive’s 20mln users are also users on these global platforms, following other content
creators

38

As an example of Uplive broadcaster’s influence outside Facebook, Olivia below has 145,985
fans on Facebook. Since being on Uplive for about 10 months, broadcasting 40 hours average a
month, she has received 14.7mln coins on Uplive, which is equivalent to $221K USD, translating
to $550 USD /hour.

39

In essence, Uplive already represents a large slice of the global content creation and virtual
gifting market.

5.2 Migrating Uplive From Diamonds To GIFTOs
In addition, Uplive is already running a $100Mln USD internal token economy, based on Uplive’s
own in-app token called Diamonds. Currently, virtual gifts are purchased with Diamonds.
Diamond usage in Uplive will gradually be migrated to using GIFTO, as adoption of GIFTO
increases. As there are additional benefits GIFTO tokens have over Diamonds, users will have a
strong incentive to move from Diamonds to GIFTOs. Our goal is to eventually replace most of
Diamonds with GIFTOs, allowing Uplive users to also enjoy the advantages of crypto tokens
over traditional fiat:
•
•
•

•

Uniform form of payment for users across countries, regions, and currencies
Minimize transaction fees of up to 30% on some global payment channels
Protection from frequent payment frauds, especially credit card and payment fraud. For
example: scammers frequently use stolen credit card info to purchase Diamonds, which
are only discoverable post transaction.
Protection from arbitrage losses due to exchange rates fluctuations across different
currencies

The above are real problems faced by Uplive all the time. As an example, some users often
steal other people’s credit card data and use to buy Diamonds, and Uplive only finds out after
someone makes a claim. Furthermore, in 2017 Feb, the Egyptian pound suddenly dropped
more than 10% against the dollar in 1 day, but the corresponding rate was not updated in a
major global mobile payment platform. Uplive team discovered that a user was tunneling to
Egypt via VPN and buying up a very large amount of Diamonds which he then resold. Crypto
tokens can be utilized to solve this problem.
Therefore, as more and more users adopt GIFTO, more transactions within Uplive can be
migrated to GIFTO and off fiat based Diamonds. To facilitate this, we developed the GIFTO
Wallet as a part of the core GIFTO Protocol implementation.
The GIFTO Wallet is already in development and will be rolled out to the Uplive userbase by end
of 2017. After Wallet gets rolled out to all users, across Android, iOS and Web, we will begin air
dropping initial set of GIFTO tokens to seed Uplive users. By end of 2017, there will be 20mln
users holding GIFTO tokens, making it the largest user base EVER to hold a new crypto token.

40

As current blockchain technology cannot handle the fast response time required of a large
commercial system like Uplive, and that a new blockchain Smart Contract Gift system will need
to be built, we will be onboarding users gradually.
By end of 2018, Uplive will generate conservatively 30mln USD a month, and should have more
than 100mln virtual gifts sent every month. We estimate that by then, we will be able to
migrate about 30% of Uplive’s transactions to GIFTO Protocol. 70% of Uplive’s transactions
should be expected by end of 2019.

5.3 Phased Adoption
GIFTO Protocol ecosystem will be rolled out in several phases as follows:

6. GIFTO Limited
The long-term goal of GIFTO Limited is to establish GIFTO Tokens as the pre-eminent
cryptocurrency for a decentralized network of global content creators. All existing GIFTOrelated technology will be integrated to GIFTO Limited, and it will be the holding entity of all
undistributed GIFTO Tokens. The ongoing role of GIFTO Limited will be to further develop the
technologies underpinning the GIFTO Tokens, as well as to perform continuous research and
42

development to improve all other aspects of the GIFTO ecosystem. It will further seek to forge
strategic partnerships with prominent or up-and-coming entities, apps and platforms to
promote, distribute, incentivise, and integrate GIFTO Tokens and GIFTO Protocol to the entire
content creation industry at large. GIFTO Limited will also continuously implement further
policies and measures to ensure the smooth, uninterrupted functioning of any related
technologies to achieve its goal of an open, reliable and decentralized ecosystem.
