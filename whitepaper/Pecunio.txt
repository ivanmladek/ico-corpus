EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
PECUNIO - BLOCKCHAIN INVESTMENTS SAFE AND EASY
Pecunio is a decentralized investment platform that focuses on blue-chip blockchain assets with unique value
proposition and high performance potential.
Our products and services cover the whole lifecycle of blockchain innovation: From angel & venture capital
investments (AC & VC) and initial coin offerings (ICO), to cryptocurrencies and asset-backed tokens.

A DECENTRALIZED INVESTMENT PLATFORM AND EXCHANGE
By tokenizing all our funds and assets, we simplify safe investments into selected blockchain assets. All
major cryptocurrencies will be interchangeable on our platform. What’s revolutionary about the platform
is that it solves the problem of crypto spending and allows management of crypto assets in a safe and
easy way.

ASSET-BACKED GOLD TOKEN
Gold has always been the world’s best hedge against all sort of market turmoil. Our first product in
this product range will therefore be the Pecunio Gold Coin (PGC), which refers to exactly one gram of
segregated, unallocated 999.9 fine gold from LBMA-approved refineries. There is no comparable asset out
on the market at given time.

TOKENIZED FUNDS
Our tokenized funds invest into the most valuable cryptocurrencies, ICOs and AC & VCs. Investing into ICOs
and tokenized AC & VC leverages the performance of our funds compared to regular crypto investments by
far. Our fund management avails of profound experience from the traditional- , as well as from the hedge
fund industry.

A CRYPTOCURRENCY CARD
Our crypto debit card allows coin and token spending in fiat currencies around the world. The prepaid debit
card spares local exchange fees and makes digital currency spending a whole lot easier. Pecunio enables
cryptocurrency spending with instant liquidity.

AN ICO INCUBATOR, A BLOCKCHAIN START UP ANGELIST
Our expertise in traditional and hedgefund management qualifies us to accompany blockchain businesses
successfully spreading their wings. We launch ICO campaigns with a dedicated fund, management support,
legal advice and more. At the same time PECUNIO shares earned profits with its company token holders
via a buyback program.

VISION
The idea of blockchain has opened a whole new chapter of value transfer. Which currencies will stay in
place and proof themselves successful, at which price and on base of which business model or technology
is yet unclear. What we do know for certain is that cryptocurrencies and crypto assets are definitely a part
of the future.
They have revolutionized payments, transactions and many other markets and will soon become
established as the new standard.
Pecunio’s mission is to open the cryptocurrency market to everyone with a variety of interesting products
and services. As a trustworthy company, we encourage blockchain adoption and offer a safe and easy way
to take part in the future of financial markets.
We personally believe in the philosophical mission of Satoshi Nakamoto and created a safe and transparent
investment solution with easy access for everyone.

WE PERSONALLY BELIEVE IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL MISSION OF
SATOSHI NAKAMOTO AND CREATED A SAFE AND TRANSPARENT
INVESTMENT SOLUTION WITH EASY ACCESS FOR EVERYONE.

Your Share of the Future.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY
Since the introduction of blockchain technology, there has been a high demand for crypto assets
on the markets with likeliness of further increase. Fintech is a completely new sector in finance
without any institutions yet and financial service providers have not been able to meet rising
demands for Bitcoin and/or blockchain investment solutions. Finance & Investments are still
heavily underrepresented as a category, due to a lack of innovation and decentralization. It is just
as of recent, that CBOE and CME group launched Bitcoin futures markets.
The dawn of a new investment era began starting with the incredibly successful Ethereum ICO in
July 2014. Imagine having invested an amount of two thousand dollars in ETH at that time. Right
now in 2017, in less than three years, those two thousand dollars would have achieved an amount
worth more than 1 million US $ by now. The same applies for blockchain solution “Stratis”:
Only 12 month after its ICO, tokenholders have multiplied their initial investment by factor 600.
In 2017 the cryptocurrency market capitalisation went from
$ 16BN to $ 770BN US. The trend here is clear and cannot
be disregarded.

Nevertheless, there are a load of obstacles to be challenged before adapting cryptocurrency usage
on a broad scale. It is hard for non-tech-savvy users to easily enter the crypto markets. There are
no institutional guidelines or trustworthy partners to rely on. And of course as the cryptocurrency
market is a very young and new sector in finance, it comes with rather high volatility.

HOW PECUNIO WORKS
SIGN UP
Sign up is as easy as creating a Facebook Account.
The user signs up to create an account on PECUNIO’s platform by providing an email address, a
user name and a password. Upon confirmation via email, a personal wallet is created and he is
automatically directed to the user dashboard where he finds an overview of his personal account and
holdings.
After successfully transferring cryptocurrencies into his account, it is now the user’s choice whether
to spend it via the crypto card, exchange it or invest it into PECUNIO’s products.
Every platform user has the opportunity to purchase into different types of products: The assetbacked token (PGC), various fund tokens (PCC, PICO, PAV), as well as the PECUNIO utility token
(PCO). All platform related products and services can only be accessed with the PCO.

WHY BLOCKCHAIN WHY FUND MANAGEMENT
WHY BLOCKCHAIN
“We have elected to put our money
and faith in a mathematical framework
that is free of politics and human error.“
Tyler Winklevoss, Co-creator of Facebook, top investor in Bitcoin.
The Blockchain is a foundational technology like the Internet itself—a big system enabling
applications to be built on it and value to be stored and transferred safely via a transparent public
ledger. The idea of a decentralized, global payment network with low cost and settlement time has
profound implications across the world-wide financial system.
Abstracting away from solely the financial sector, the transparency and integrity of data on the
Blockchain may transform broad industries and industry standards in areas like record keeping,
logistics, law, identity management, securities settlement, application development and many
more. Furthermore corporate formation & governance, asset representation, contract & agreement
structuring, and the traditional thought processes associated with; each are rapidly being challenged,
questioned, re-thought, re-approached, and re-structured because of the spark ignited by the concept
of the blockchain. We now find ourselves at the forefront of a huge wave of innovation. Approximately
80% of banks are developing their own blockchain technology today. This is one of the main reasons
the world’s biggest firms are now investing into this promising technology and/or adopting it as well.
The real value of the blockchain is that it renders intermediaries completely obsolete. Middlemen
acting as third party establishing “trust” between unknown parties are no longer inevitable. The
blockchain basically replaces these middlemen.
A series of industries will become seriously disrupted, first and foremost:

13

11

Financial Services (Banks, Clearing houses, Money Transfer)
Banks are essentially secure storehouses and transfer hubs for money. Blockchain’s secure,
decentralized, and tamper-proof ledger addresses this function—at a fraction of the cost. A
company called “Thought Machine” has already created a “blockchain bank.” Clearing houses
and stockbrokers are also in the firing line for the same reason. Companies like Western Union
and MoneyGram have always dominated money transfer services. But blockchain start-ups
are trying to create a competitive scenario by offering faster, cheaper and versatile forms of
money transfer.

Real Estate
When most people think of buying and selling property, they think of copious amounts of
paperwork, long, administrative processes, and high agent fees. Using blockchain, anyone can
manage, track, and transfer land titles and property deeds—no need for intermediaries. A
company called Ubiquity is providing this service already.
Music Streaming
Music streaming is great—well, maybe not for the musicians. It’s estimated
that artists lose up to 86% of the proceeds of their music because of illegal
downloading. The blockchain makes it possible for artists to earn royalties on their
music without going through a record label.
Grammy Award Winner Imogen Heap has created a blockchain-based
streaming platform called MYCELIA that is, besides others, facilitating this issue.

12

WHY FUND MANAGEMENT
Despite Bitcoin’s impressive annualized returns since its inception in 2009, the reality is that
blockchain technology is still in its infancy and no one knows whether it will become globally accepted.
This uncertainty surrounding blockchain and Bitcoin’s future is reflected in the price volatility of
cryptocurrencies. When it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies and ICOs, there are a few risks
investors need to be aware of and mitigate:
Regulatory Risk
Probably the biggest risk to the future success of Bitcoin, as both a currency and as an investment
class, is regulatory risk. If China, for example, decides to ban its citizens from holding Bitcoin, the
price of the digital currency would crash. China is by far the largest market for Bitcoin trading, with
over 90 percent of trading occurring in the People’s Republic. Hence, any negative regulatory changes
would have a direct impact on the world’s Bitcoin investments.
The same goes for leading Bitcoin start-up hubs like the U.S. and the U.K. Should any large economy
ban Bitcoin, the price will collapse and struggle to recover.
ICO Scams
Many ICOs/token launches lack legitimacy for one of the following reasons:
1. Some ICOs are outright scams. Their founders simply cash in on the absurd amount of
“dumb money” that people throw into token launches. (The “investors” can often be people
who missed the boat on Bitcoin and/or Ether, who truly don’t understand the differences in
between the various cryptocurrencies, particularly when it comes to value.)
2. Other ICOs are illegitimate because they are essentially a solution without a problem —
not everything needs a decentralized application with its own currency. Because of these
risks, a significant set of due diligence questionnaire has to be implied before buying into a
potential ICO.
It is asked too much, for an average individual with a day job to occupy oneself with all the details
of a rapidly changing market. In order to react to these dynamic systems it needs experts and due
diligence; both are pillars of our performance policy, which is the reason why we preferred active
management of our funds in order to adapt to fluctuated markets. Additionally portfolio diversification
mitigates market volatility, fraud and operational risks while as being a hedge fund renders us
profitable even during falling markets.

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

ASSET BACKED TOKENS
Gold has always been the perfect hedge against volatility. Blockchain technology with its high speed
transfer of value, security and convenience of operation enables this next step in the future of finance:
It allows us to reintroduce gold in digital form as a global currency on the blockchain. Each Pecunio
Gold Coin represents exactly 1 gram of segregated, unallocated 999.9 fine gold from LBMA-approved
refineries. We will be the first FinTech company to exchange physical gold for tokens worldwide.
Pecunio and its partners will store physical gold with the intent, that its gold reserves constantly
meet or exceed the amount of PGC in circulation. We do not deliver a promise; we deliver gold via a
cryptocurrency.

IT IS THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AND SAFEST WAY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET.
The Pecunio Gold Coin is:
• 999.9 fine gold in tokenized form (PGC)
• The world’s best hedge against volatility as a token
• A payment option for goods and services
(gold backed cryptocurrency)
• The easiest way to handle and export physical gold
(world wide branches for direct pick up)
• The safest and most transparent way of transacting gold

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
FREE EXCHANGE

We accept and exchange all major cryptocurrencies, whereas we do not charge any fees on behalf of
exchanging currencies on our platform. The Exchange will be directly connected to the user wallets
and therefore only charges fees (incl. regular network fee) when cryptocurrencies are removed from
the platform. Full functionality of the exchange will be implemented after the ICO.

CRYPTOCURRENCY CARD
Pecunio’s cryptocurrency card is a prepaid multi-asset debit card, enabling coin and token spending
in all fiat currencies around the world without exchange fees. The user will be able to manage assets
via the platform, charging the card with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Dash, Pecunio and many
other cryptocurrencies.
The debit cards come with free choice of name on card and will be valid for 36 months. No matter
where in the world you live, you can be a Pecunio cryptocurrency card holder and easily manage your
assets via our user-friendly dashboard.

TOKENIZED FUNDS
Our fund management avails of profound experience from the traditional- , as well as from the hedge
fund industry. Yielding a good return is our aim as we work on making sizeable commissions and
crypto earnings going forward. By choosing a tokenized investment vehicle, we bring liquidity to the
angel- and venture capital market, which is otherwise a highly illiquid environment. Token holders
can sell and exchange at any given time, making that alone the most significant innovation in AC &
VC markets over recent decades.
Investors will benefit from managerial expertise, broad diversification, careful pre-selection and
reallocation of included coins and tokens and ongoing risk management.

FUND DETAILS
1. PECUNIO Cryptocurrency Fund (PCC)
PECUNIO Cryptocurrency Fund is a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrency
coins and tokens. PCC is restricted to blockchain assets, which are
already exchange traded (eg. 1st Bitcoin, 2nd generation altcoins
like Ether, Ripple, Litecoin and 3rd generation asset tokens like EOS,
Tether and Gnosis). The fund is managed and (re-)allocated based on
managerial discretion, however framed by a determined set of rules.
PCC represents our first product, and was successfully launched
on the well-known ICONOMI platform on 4th of October 2017. The
diversified and risk-adjusted portfolio has a proven track record with
an exceeding performance and can be found not only on our platform:
https://www.iconomi.net/dashboard/#/daa/PCC

A simple comparison:
Ø BTC price (Bitfinex) October 4th 2017: $ 4309.60 US,
January 10th 2018: $ 14435.00 US = 334.99% increase
Ø ETH price (Bitfinex) October 4th 2017: $ 291.40 US,
January 10th 2018: $ 1284.00 US = 428.28%increase
Ø PCC on October 4th 2017: $ 100 US,
January 10th 2018: $ 433.15 US = 433.15% increase
PECUNIO’s Cryptocurrency fund clearly has the makings
to outperform current market developments.

2. PECUNIO Initial Coin Offering Fund (PICO)
PECUNIO ICO Fund targets blockchain companies in their pre-ICO
and ICO phase. PICO Fund is restricted to blockchain assets, which
have a minimum viable product, and are in the preparation for an ICO
event. Our management team will apply extensive due diligence, to
filter weak market propositions, mediocre teams and potential scams
from the long list. From the short list on, we work closely together
with our target investments, helping them to conduct an optimal lCO
launch. Investors in PICO will benefit from our industry links and our
investigative strengths to uncover potential fraud schemes.

18

3. PECUNIO Angel & Venture Fund (PAV)
In addition to the broader market offerings, PECUNIO will launch a
fund, dedicated to angel & venture investments in the blockchain
space. This dedicated fund aims at exceptionally high performance –
targeting a multiplication of capital. PECUNIO’s expert team, supported
by selected external industry advisors, will actively manage PAV. Our
experts will continually scout for early investment opportunities in the
blockchain start-up scene.
Through this handpicked fund offering, everyone can be an angel &
venture capital investor, without any entry or capital requirements. In
order to avoid capital dilution and oversubscription, the fund offering
will be exclusive by invitation only. PECUNIO ICO investors will be
invited to join the PECUNIO Angel & Venture Fund.

Risk Management
Investing into ICOs and tokenized AC & VC leverages the performance of our funds compared to
regular cryptocurrency investments by far. Typically, higher return means higher risk (of loss).
We approach to lower the overall risk by carefully diversifying our fund’s assets, maintaining high
performance attributes. Selected due diligence parameters and a planned set of steps according to
our risk analysis are the frameworks for our success in risk management. Nevertheless, it has to be
stated, that a total loss of capital is not inevitable.
(For those interested in a deeper understanding of asset risk management, we recommend reading

and Paul Embrechts, published by Princeton University Press in 2015; revised 2nd edition, 1st edition

developments.

PLATFORM / EXCHANGE / WALLET / MOBILE APP
The platform with its user-friendly dashboard enables quick access to a variety of features. On one
hand, there is a wallet displaying the account balance, a cryptocurrency exchange and the opportunity
to invest into PECUNIO‘s tokenized funds and products. On the other hand there is a referral system,
allowing the user to profit from his own ambition and satisfaction using peer-to-peer networking.
Our easy-to-use platform will be available via web-interface and via wallets on both Android and
iOS according to our roadmap timeline. Our Mobile Apps will use cutting edge native frameworks to
provide a fast and natural user experience.

20

TOKEN SALE PROCEDURE
To fund the project and the platform, we conduct a token sale. (ICO/ITO) The ticker symbol for our
company token will be PCO. Token sale proceeds as follows.

HARD FACTS
Our crowdsale will be performed in two stages:
•
•

Pre-ICO: February 1st – 21st 2018
ICO: March 19th - April 19th 2018

Bonus stages:
• February 1st – 21st 2018: 25% BONUS
• March 19th - April 19th 2018: 0% BONUS
Available in ICO: 30,000,000 PCO
Full supply: 100,000,000 PCO
Hard Cap: $ 45,000,000 US
Accepted currencies: BTC, ETH, LTC
Exchange Rate: 1 PCO = $ 1.5 US
Token Utility Function: PCOs are primarily a means of payment, „a digital coupon“, for all the
services PECUNIO provides, especially ICO Services and Platform related fees. No other means of
payment will be accepted. PCO allows buying of funds and native tokens on platform and acts as
value transfer.
No Expectation of Profits: Due to the utility nature of the PCO tokens , it does not provide
dividends, profit shares or voting rights to its holders. No guarantees or assurances are provided,
the PCO token shall not be considered an investment.
Architecture: PCO Tokens are Ethereum ERC-20 tokens
Acceptence of Tokens: PCO Tokens are accepted on the PECUNIO platform solely for the time
being. Since the tokens will be released after the Token Generation Event, secondary market
trading is possible. Token buyers have to be aware that due the utility nature of the token a rise in
value is possible however unlikely. Thus PCO tokens shall not be regarded as an investment.
NO MORE PCO WILL BE CREATED AFTER THIS TGE EVENT.

• 10.000.000 of PCO created during the creation event will be allocated to the company
and utilized as a future employee and management token pool, to strengthen our ability to
attract & retail top talent and contractual bonusses; these tokens will be locked for 12
months and are subject to a leak-out clause
• 5.000.000 of PCO created during the creation event will be created for and granted to
advisors and bounty supporters; these tokens will be locked for 3 months and are subject
to a leak-out clause
Capital Reserve
•

15.000.000 of PCO will be credited to the reserve, but not issued. These PCO´s will
be available as an additional source of funding, but may never be issued, depending on
circumstances in the future.

TOKEN VALUE

PECUNIO’s PCO token is a utility token. It acts as a means of payment, a „digital coupon“, for all
the services PECUNIO provides, especially ICO Services and Platform related fees. PCO allows the
purchase of fund tokens and native tokens on platform. The tokens shall not be confused with
company shares, which they are not. They are digital goods, bearing no intrinsic value by themselves,
but the value of the assets, services and/or rights which can be purchased by these tokens.

22

TECHNOLOGY
The asset tokens will be represented as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Coding and
customizing work will be done in Solidity, a high level programming language similar to JavaScript,
targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is the runtime environment for smart
contracts in Ethereum.
Pecunio is an ERC-20 TOKEN
•
•
•
•
•

Security and predictability (as opposed to having to run an independent blockchain network);
Use of robust and well- supported clients (Ethereum based tokens can be managed with
official Ethereum clients):
High liquidity (interchangeable with other Ethereum based tokens or Ether);
Easier listing on exchanges with infrastructure already in place;
Ethereum smart contracts enable a transparent and secure way of value transfer.

Exchange
The exchange works via a matching engine through asset proxies. The interface is therefore linked
to external exchanges and addresses via the asset proxy smart contract, which complies with
ERC-20 standards. This makes the exchange manipulation-safe and enables true transparency.
The software will be written in a hardware-friendly programming language to maintain speed for
fast transactions. As for now, for safety reasons, we decided to keep development in a closed
environment - with consideration of future decentralization.
Wallets
PECUNIO’s multi-wallets will accept multiple currencies and will be written in JavaScript, among
other Bitcore framework. Furthermore, there will be dedicated apps for iOS and Android which
assure the same functionality as the web interface. Mobile Apps will use cutting edge native
frameworks to provide a fast and natural user experience.

23

ROADMAP
Here are some of our recent progressions towards full functionality of our

THE BUSINESS CASE
OUR PRIME REVENUE STREAMS
In order to maintain a stable and growing product and service platform to provide purchasing power
for the PCO tokens, PECUNIO needs revenues. PECUNIO’s revenues come from different sources:
MAIN INCOME SOURCE:
We project the management fee to be 4%, the performance fee to be set at between 15% and
30%. This fee is perfectly on par with alternative investment manager’s industry standards.
•
•
•

Fee: 4% of all assets under active management
Estimated assets under management (2018): 500 Million US$
Estimated revenue from asset management (2018): 20 Million US$

Gold-token-associated transaction and storage fee:
We are currently observing the markets in order to assure a competitive pricing for transaction of
tokens and demurrage of physical gold. This will be a major income source due to the possible use of
the token as a B2B payment token.

SECONDARY INCOME SOURCE:
Card fee:
• Fee: 4% of all assets under active management
Transaction fee:
• Fee 1% of all transactions: approx. $ 600.000 US p.a.

ADDITIONAL REVENUES
PECUNIO intends to add additional recurring revenue streams within the next 12-18 months,
including transaction and consultancy fees.
Revenues from ICO fees
ICO fees are calculated as a 25% cut of the ICO transaction volume, taken on average. We have
also taken into account currency and token market growth.

29

COMMUNICATION AND PARTNERSHIPS
Partnerships
Additionally, we will partner with innovative FinTech companies around the globe to provide our
customers with the best digital investment.
We intend to be a leading digital investment platform and generate revenues with selected “best in
class” partners in other financial categories (VC, hedge funds, savings, credit & loans, insurance)
with an emphasis on blockchain empowered partners.
Strategic partnerships with investment funds, private banks and insurance companies will follow.
On top of that, we are proud to be chosen as one of the 12 DAA managers of Iconomi.
Live Events
We plan on hosting different live events in various venues with regard to our core markets. These
events include:
•

Investor Days: Attracting potential investors at distinguished events with our products
and services will add new opportunities and new relationships to PECUNIO.

•

Road shows: With the purpose of strengthening brand awareness and brand value we will
chose different locations with the goal of increasing PECUNIO’s reach in public.

•

Live speeches: It is hard to compare what could be more convincing than, a good speech
backed by a great product. Public events are a great way to communicate to a broad
audience.

•

Blockchain events: We will not miss out our chance to be represented at blockchain
meet-ups all over the world in order to educate on our solutions in the world of blockchain.

•

Financial events: We are in finance. In order to attract customers and clients from
the old economy and open the gates to new possibilities it is of importance to connect,
collaborate and co-operate.

Global Marketing:
Multi Channel marketing campaigns to be organized, designed and implemented by a team of senior
professionals include

SCENARIOS
PECUNIO‘s innovative business model is profound and elaborate. It is impossible to evaluate
prospects and future financial results with absolute precision, which is why we offer three possible
scenarios to help understand different levers and possible out-comes for our project:

AuM growth rate assumptions
We will grow the overall Assets under Management (AuM) progressively over the next 5 years, with
a growth rate starting from 70% (year 2019), decelerating to 40% (year 2022). We expect the
AuMs to be between 135 Mio US $ and 320 Mio US $, for our three scenarios. This would put us at
par with a typical mid-sized hedge fund. Growing to about 1 Bn US $ at the end of the 5 year period,
we would match the size criterion for a large-size hedge fund.

Market growth rates
Since the beginning of 2017, the Token market has grown at a value-weighted average of about 300 %
annualized. The market will continue to grow, however at a more moderate pace.
We have therefore taken a range of growth rates from 50% to 80% per year as our yardstick. For each of
our three scenarios, it is expected that the Blockchain economy grows by around 3% (Conservative), 5%
(Realistic) and 7% (Optimistic) – per month for the next 5 years.
This equates to around a 40% and 80% annual growth in total assets, fueling PCO fee inflows.
The ICO fees will be set at 25%, on average.

Below are the more detailed projections of revenue dynamics under the three different scenarios
over a 5-year period.

Conservative Scenario
In the conservative scenario, we modestly grow our asset base and revenue streams. We will
operate in a highly competitive market space. However, we strengthen our position as the world’s
first fully decentralized investment platform by adding new fund features valued by the investment
community. In this scenario, we expect AuM to be around 135 Mio US $, by the end of 2018.

In the realistic scenario, we grow our asset base and revenue streams more dynamically.
We will operate in a competitive, but expanding market space. We strengthen our position as the world’s
first fully decentralized investment platform by adding new fund feature, growing the client base and
capitalizing on market gains. In this scenario, we expect AuM to be around 215 Mio US $, by the end of
2018.

OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO
In the optimistic scenario, we grow our asset base and revenue streams still more dynamically. We
will operate in a competitive, though more or less unrestricted growth market. The growth rates will
resemble the dot.com market of the late 1990ies. We strengthen our position as the world’s first and
leading fully decentralized investment platform by progressively growing the client base and capitalizing
on significant market gains. In this scenario, we expect AuM to be around 320 Mio US $, by the end of
2018.
