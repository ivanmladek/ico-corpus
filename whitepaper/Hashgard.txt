Industry Status
In recent years, with digital assets such as Bitcoin gradually entering the
mainstream view, its influence has been increasing day by day. It has become an
asset category that institutions and individuals cannot ignore. The total market
value has reached a maximum of 800 billion US dollars. With the gradual
enrichment of digital assets, there are more and more value-creating activities
related to it. The management of digital assets is one of them.
Against this background, the digital assets fund (token fund) has sprung up
around the globe. According to incomplete statistics, the current number of digital
asset funds has reached hundreds worldwide, and the asset management scale
is nearly 5 billion US dollars. We believe that with the institutionalize and
professionalize of investors in the digital asset market, the construction of
infrastructure of this industry will become the focus of market.

Challenges
Reduced threshold

In the era of digital assets, as the access threshold for digital funds is reduced, fund
managers do not have to undergo qualification verification, and only need one wallet
address to accept and manage funds from all over the world, leading to a mixed bag of
chaos in the digital asset management industry

Lack of Regulation

Digital asset fund is an emerging industry. There is no corresponding industry
regulation. The internal operations of funds are not transparent to investors. The lack of
information disclosure and external audit can not effectively protect the legitimate rights
and interests of investors.

Backward Tools

Conflict of Interests

The management tools of digital asset funds are relatively primitive and backward. Most
management teams use basic Office softwares such as Word and Excel and wallet
applications for records. The accounting is inconvenient and the efficiency is very low.
Participating parties in the field of digital asset management include regulatory
institutions, fund managers, investors and fund custodians, etc. The interests of all
parties are not the same. At present, there is no mechanism for coordinating the
appeals of all parties.

Digital Finance

Regulatory Confusion
Lags and diﬀerences
in regulations.

The formulation of laws and regulations generally lags behind the economic and
social development. Both digital assets and digital asset funds are emerging
industries. The legislative bodies of most countries have not yet issued
corresponding regulations, and even if regulations are introduced, they fail to reach
a consensus.

Regulatory Diﬃculty

Digital assets have the property of “self-financing”. In theory, the issuance and
trading of assets can bypass the traditional financial system, and supervision is
difficult.

High Regulatory Costs

Traditionally, most of the fund's supervision has adopted territorial jurisdiction, but
blockchain technology has such features as cross-temporal, cross-subject, and
international. Fund managers can easily avoid oversight by migrating their
registration sites to third countries.The cost of cross-national jurisdiction is too high.

Lack of Popular
Recognition

The purpose of supervision is to protect the legitimate interests of investors, but
driven by interests, most people lack the sense of participation and recognition of
supervision. Therefore, it is necessary for fund managers to be “self-disciplined” in
addition to the “self-regulation” of the industry.

Origin of Philosophy
"Autonomous organization" refers to a group of interdependent trustees who organize themselves and
conduct self-governance so that they can achieve lasting common benefits in the event that everyone
faces free riders, evades responsibility, or other opportunism. The problem that must be solved is how
to combine the variables, namely (1) increase the initial possibility of autonomous organization; (2)
enhance people's capacity for continuous self-organization; (3) enhance capability to solve the
problem of public ponds by self-organization without some kind of external assistance.
— Elinor Ostrom, Winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, in “Governing the Commons"
Compared to "self-governing organizations," the DAO is a further organizational structure consisting of
a group of people who share the same ideas and have common goals, and operates and selfgoverned through "blockchain" and "smart contracts." In the DAO, individuals are equal, the
implementation of the rules and the changes in the rules themselves are accomplished through "smart
contracts."

Origin of Philosophy
“Crypto-assets, while risky, also brings innovation and can help us
better monitor them. In other words, we can use fire to fight fire.”
— Christine lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund.
For assets such as digital assets that have a “self-financing” nature,
An effective way of supervision is to use the blockchain technology
that carries it to supervise. This is the meaning of “treating fire with
fire”.

The DAO：the exploration of
decentralized asset management
The DAO

Centralized Fund Manager
In the traditional asset management
business, fund managers make profit through
the management of funds from investors.
Advantages: Funds are managed by
experienced professional fund managers with
high operation efficiency.
Disadvantages: The operation of assets is not
transparent, and it is easy to breed corruption
and damage the interests of investors.

VS

In April 2016, the smart contract crowdfunding
application on Ethereum – the DAO – explored
decentralized asset management.
The DAO has designed mechanisms for guardians,
whitelisting, proposals, voting, DAO forks, and fund
transfer to implement decentralized decisionmaking for crowdfunding and asset protection for
investors.

Digital Finance

Hashgard

Team and Partners

The DAO：design flaws, eventually aborted
Defect A:

The DAO adopts voting as a decision-making mechanism and lacks a
professional fund manager. The decision-making is inefficient and not
professional enough.

Defect B:

The smart contract of the DAO hosts the user’s funds, and structurally, the use
and hosting of the funds are not separated, which makes it vulnerable to attacks.

Defect C:

The algorithm design of the DAO smart contract is defective, making it in favor of
users who are inclined to up vote and suppress the opposition.

The DAO：design flaws, eventually aborted
In July 2016, the DAO was attacked by hackers. $60 million worth of ETH was
stolen. The Ethereum community had to recoup its losses through a hard fork.
This event directly led to an ideology split on Ethereum and some members did
not accept changing transaction history through the hard fork, which eventually
produced a parallel version - ETC.
In July 2017, SEC of the US issued the investigation report of the DAO incident. It
is believed that the DAO token is "securities" in nature and should comply with the
federal securities laws.
We realize that many problems in the digital asset management field cannot be
solved by just building a crowdfunding smart contract on Ethereum. We urgently
need more realistic solutions!

HASHGARD：from and beyond the DAO
Hashgard fully absorbed the "asset autonomy" thought in the DAO and improved it.
We believe that in the digital asset management industry in the future, the
centralized and decentralized organizational forms exist at the same time.
The “decentralized asset autonomy” explored by the DAO is one of its forms, but it is
not the only one. Hashgard will combine the concepts of centralization and semicentralization to establish a better digital asset management ecosystem from the
perspectives of regulation and self-discipline.

HASHGARD Core Concept
•

Advanced DAO autonomy: digital assets based on blockchain technology have characteristics such as crosstemporal, cross-subject, and anonymity. Traditional supervision is difficult and costly. At this stage, the
introduction of blockchain's core self-governance can really help the industry promote self-discipline and
standardization.

•

Distributed inclusive finance: Hashgard can empower the design and issuance of distributed digital financial
products and enable global investors to participate based on their risk preferences, so we can truly achieve
distributed inclusive finance

•

Code-level contract regulation: Hashgard consists of a series of smart contract portfolios tailored for asset
management. Fund managers, custodians, third-party organizations, etc., upon appointment by investors, are
subject to corresponding restrictions based on smart contracts.

•

Operational Level Data On-Chain & Privacy Protection: Operational-level data in Hashgard cannot be
tampered and will be cryptographically protected. Fund managers and other fund-raising parties, on one hand,
will have their key business data encrypted and stored through private keys, which will only be open to
authorized person; on the other hand, they can disclose investment decisions, risk management, account
management, financial management, and other operational-level data to their investors to prove the truth and
credibility of performance.

HASHGARD Technical Architecture
•

As the underlying infrastructure of the digital
financial industry, Hashgard has a complete
distributed ledger technology system,
including distributed network technologies,
consensus mechanisms, smart contracts,
application layer interfaces(API) and etc...

•

Hashgard fully considered the need for the
protection and transaction of many different
types of assets in the future when designing
the system, and technically supports the
cross-chain interaction of various public
chains.

•

Hashgard engages with eco-partners such as
decentralized data storage, decentralized
asset custody, decentralized asset issuance,
and decentralized asset lending. Hashgard
connects with eco-partners on lower-layer
interfaces to support developers to build
various application services under different
scenarios.

HASHGARD Economic System
•

Purpose of deposit: within the Hashgard system, in such scenarios as issuance of fund equity
asset, creating a DAO and a DAC etc., user are required to freeze tokens generated by the system
as deposit. When users violate the agreement, the corresponding deposit will be deducted by the
smart contract for punishment.

•

Purpose of burning GAS: the Hashgard token will be used as GAS for trading fuel, partially
distributed to consensus nodes, and partially allocated to contract creators to motivate the
community.

•

Ecological building purpose: The Hashgard Foundation will distribute token reward to DAPP
developers based on criteria such as fund management practices, smart contract creation and
usage, to encourage more users to participate in the digital finance ecosystem.

•

Token appreciation logic: the total amount of tokens generated by Hashgard system is fixed.
Therefore, the total economic value of the community will be greater with more users, at the same
time, more tokens are frozen, resulting in a continuous reduction in the amount of liquidity, while the
demand is increasing, resulting in an increase in expected value of tokens.
