8. You agree that you purchase, receive and hold the Neurotokens at your own risk and that the Neurotokens are
provided on an ‘as is’ basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. It is your responsibility to
determine if you are legally allowed to purchase the Neurotokens in your jurisdiction and whether you can then
resell the Neurotokens to another purchaser in any given jurisdiction. You bear the sole responsibility for
determining or assessing the tax implications of your participation in the crowdsale, purchasing, or receiving and
holding the Neurotokens in all respects and in any relevant jurisdiction.
9. No regulatory authority has examined or approved of any of the information provided in this White Paper. No
such action has been or will be taken under the laws, regulatory requirements or rules of any jurisdiction.

10. The regulatory status of tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many
jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with
respect to such technology and its applications, including the Neuromation Platform and Neurotokens. It is
likewise difficult to predict how or whether
legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger
technology and its applications, including the Neuromation Platform and Neurotokens. Regulatory actions could
negatively impact the Neuromation Platform and Neurotokens in various ways, including, for purposes of
illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale and delivery of Neurotokens constitutes
unlawful activity or that Neurotokens are a regulated instrument that requires registration, or the licensing of
some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale and delivery thereof. The Neuromation Platform may
cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it
illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s)
to operate in such jurisdiction.
11. Given that Neurotoken is based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of
the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on Neurotoken. Moreover, advances in cryptography,
or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to Neurotokens and
the Neuromation Platform, including the utility of Neurotokens, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic
consensus mechanism that
underpins the Ethereum protocol.
12. As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, Neurotoken is susceptible
to attacks by miners in the course of validating Neurotoken transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including,
but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any
successful attacks present a risk
to the Neuromation Platform, Neurotokens, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of
transactions involving Neurotokens.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is seeing another spring and becoming a ubiquitous
part of society. Researchers and engineers have made important steps towards
solving practical problems in machine learning, particularly in such applications
as vision, speech, machine translation, and decision making.
Due to technological advancements coupled with progress in research and
innovation, AI is quickly becoming a part of every company’s operations. This
progress brings its own challenges, such as supply of sufficient talent,
resources, and data. The most pressing problem is the availability of
well-labeled data to support the supervised learning process. Even when
unstructured data is abundant, converting it to a labeled dataset is an extremely
laborious and costly process. There is a need to address the challenges of
practical AI adoption wholesale -- on a platform level. Until this is done, most
businesses will be struggling to adopt AI. Due to the disparity in resources and
focus among companies, we will continue to see a widening gap between early
adopters and legacy operators, putting the latter at an extreme strategic
disadvantage.
Neuromation offers a unique solution that unites market resources, the
scientific community, and commercial and private entities into an integrated
marketplace -- the Neuromation Platform. To address the most critical issue,
Neuromation focuses on synthetic datasets that have been proven to yield
compelling results. Using synthetic datasets in machine learning will further
decrease the cost of--and will ease--widespread AI adoption.

www.neuromation.io

The AI ecosystem is founded upon three pillars:
●
●

●

Datasets – large datasets of structured (unstructured) data used for deep
learning algorithms to learn a specific task.
Computing power – a standalone server or a farm of interconnected GPUs
designed to provide the necessary framework for training AI models with
existing datasets to achieve the objective.
Machine Learning models – a set of algorithms designed to process datasets
in the Neuromation Platform environment.

Each of these domains poses a unique set of challenges for both the supply and
demand side of the AI ecosystem. Neuromation offers a new and effective
approach of connecting supply and demand for each of these domains in a
marketplace, bringing together competencies of researchers, engineers, and
designers and connecting them with commercial sector companies.

We are building a critical component of the budding AI eco-system and plan to
capitalize on the first-mover advantage: The Neuromation Platform provides an
exchange and an ecosystem where participants can either contribute or purchase
the components of an AI model.

The Neuromation Platform will use distributed computing along with blockchain
proof of work tokens to revolutionize AI model development. It will combine all the
components necessary to build deep learning solutions with synthetic data in one
place. Platform service providers, commercial or private, will provide specific
resources for the execution and development of synthetic data sets, distributed
computing services, and machine learning models, addressing the “three pillars”
of AI in the previous slide. Each executed service (data set generation, model
computation) or sold data piece (dataset, data generator) is accommodated by a
reward, numerated in our currency, Neurotoken. The Neuromation Platform will be
running an auction model that allows customers to negotiate prices directly with
service providers.
Imagine a place where you can go and easily address all requests to acquire AI
capability. A vendor will create the data generator for you, then a group of
Neuromation Nodes will use the generator to quickly create a massive virtual data
set. You can then select a set of Deep Learning architectures to train on that data.
Then another group of Neuromation Nodes will do the training in record time!

All value exchange operations on the Neuromation Platform will use Neurotokens.

The price for each service will be determined by the aggregate setting of the
Neuromation nodes (price per unit of computation). Each node will have a minimum
token price-floor setting. The minimal price floor can also be adjusted dynamically
via an algorithm that will maximize the total tokens earned for the node. The
Neuromation platform will determine the resources required for each requested task
and select the most efficient node pool (minimizing price for the customer).
Between nodes “sniffing” out the market and customers hunting for the most
efficient price, the Platform will find equilibrium in supply and demand.

In order to transact on the Neuromation platform, a client will need to buy
Neurotokens. To simplify the purchase mechanics, Neuromation will provide a client
portal that will make Neurotoken purchase a one-click process.

Deep learning employs artificial neural networks of extremely large size; training
such networks often requires vast datasets with highly accurate labeling.
Collecting large datasets of images, text, or sound is easy, but describing and
annotating data to make it usable has traditionally been challenging and costly.
Crowdsourcing was applied to the problem of dataset collection and labeling a few
years ago, employing large numbers of humans to provide much needed
annotations and improve label accuracy. It proved slow and expensive, and
introduced human bias. We propose a solution where accuracy is guaranteed by
construction: synthesizing large datasets along with perfectly accurate labels. The
benefits of synthetic data are manifold. It is fast to synthesize and render,
perfectly accurate, tailored for the task at hand, and can be modified to improve
the model and training itself.
Industry is already using synthetic data to some degree, but its utility is limited.
There is currently no general tool set available that can help use synthetic data at
scale. The Neuromation Platform will change that.

www.neuromation.io

Ten years ago, machine learning went through a revolution. While neural networks
are one of the oldest paradigms in artificial intelligence, researchers and
practitioners have been unable to train large-scale deep neural networks reliably and
efficiently until 2009. Due to the new insights from Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio,
and Yann LeCun, neural architectures quickly became the state-of-the-art in image
processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing, leading to
breakthrough results in machine learning - redefining artificial neural networks as
deep learning. Today, deep learning is the lingua franca in machine learning,
spanning domains from biometrics and self-driving cars to playing Go and
synthesizing speech.
The basic building block of a neural network is the perceptron, a simple
mathematical model of a neuron first proposed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. A
perceptron computes a weighted sum of its inputs (dendrites in biological neurons),
whose weights represent model parameters to be learned, followed by a nonlinear
activation function. The neural network itself is a large composition of perceptrons,
whose parameters can be jointly optimized using gradient descent computed by
backpropagation, a technique first proposed in the 1960s and brought to full
generality in the 1970s.

www.neuromation.io

The compositional structure of neural networks allows for parallelization in both the
training and inference of such models. Parallel processing of the networks’ layers
advanced GPU-based computational paradigms, leading to breakthroughs in
high-performance computing. Currently virtually all industrial applications of neural
networks are trained and run on GPUs, and the next jump in efficiency will involve
specialized hardware such as Google’s TPU and other embedded hardware
platforms.
Even the simplest neural architectures, e.g., a two-layer feedforward network, are
known to be universal approximators -- they have the theoretical ability to
approximate any given mathematical function. In turn, complex neural networks
must have sufficient expressive power (capacity).
When trying to efficiently train deep neural networks with large capacity, one quickly
arrives at a problem: “Where to find a lot of well labeled data?” and “How noisy are
the labels?”
This problem is solved by the Neuromation Platform.

www.neuromation.io

One of the most important problems of modern deep learning is where to get data.
Common neural architectures are usually intended for supervised learning, training
to solve a specific classification or a regression problem on a labeled dataset. There
are techniques for unsupervised learning within the deep learning framework (e.g.,
with stacks of restricted Boltzmann machines, Generative Adversarial Networks)
and approaches to convert unsupervised feature extraction into a supervised
problem (via autoencoders). However, fine-tuning with supervised datasets is still
required. A lot of effort in modern deep learning research goes into transfer learning
(reusing trained models for other tasks on similar data), domain adaptation (reusing
trained models for similar tasks on datasets with different properties) and one-shot
learning (using a handful of training samples to learn a new class once the network
has trained on other classes), but these efforts are still far from mainstream.
As for the data, while it is often easy to get a virtually unlimited dataset of unlabeled
samples (e.g., random photos off the Internet or human speech records), it is very
laborious and expensive to label such data manually. For the last few years,
crowdsourcing has been virtually the only way to create and label datasets,
employing large numbers of people to correct mistakes and improve accuracy. It
proved slow and expensive and introduced human bias.
An average retail set has 150,000+ items. A deep NN needs thousands of
labeled photo examples for each item. Doing this by hand would take years.
Moreover, some data (e.g., per pixel depth values in images) is virtually impossible
to label by humans (we are not good at absolute depth perception) and
sophisticated methods and tools are required to obtain the ground truth (accurate
labels).

www.neuromation.io

We propose a solution where perfect label quality is guaranteed by construction:
synthesizing large datasets along with perfectly accurate labels artificially. The
benefits of synthetic data are manifold:
●
●

●

once the environment is ready, it is fast and cheap to create as much data as
needed;
the data is perfectly accurate and tailor-made for the task at hand, with
labeling that might be impossible to obtain by hand (for example, illumination
map of the environment or depth values);
it can be modified to improve the model and training, in a constant feedback
loop between the model and the synthetic environment.

In our solution, synthetic data is used for training, and a small validation set is
comprised of real, manually labeled data. In essence, this makes using synthetic
data for a transfer learning problem: we need to reuse models trained on one kind of
dataset (synthetic) and apply them on another kind of dataset (actual images). Our
approach, however, has several important advantages that greatly simplify transfer
learning in this case. First, the synthetic training dataset is not given as part of the
problem but rather generated by us - we can and do try to make it match real data.
Data is the new oil. Getting new hand-labeled datasets is like finding new oil
deposits. Synthetic data is like cheap and ubiquitous synthetic oil.
Second, even more importantly, the above-mentioned feedback loop between the
model and the dataset makes it much simpler to perform transfer learning: we are
able to tune not only the model but also the training set, a luxury seldom available
to machine learning practitioners.

www.neuromation.io

In a current application of this approach, we use state of the art object detection
and image segmentation models to recognize objects on the shelves of a grocery
store / supermarket. The objects include food items such as bottles of soft drinks
(Pepsi/Mirinda), cartons of juice, packs of potato chips, etc. This specific
application is particularly interesting for training models on synthetic data. The
objects themselves are relatively easy to render: a Pepsi bottle makes for a much
simpler 3D model than a human face.
Sufficient hand-labeled data is very hard to obtain due to the following reasons:
●

large-scale food companies such as Pepsico may have thousands of different
items and these catalogues change frequently;

●

the objective is to be able to recognize these objects on photos at
supermarket shelves with hundreds of items on each; hand-labeling even one
such photo is a laborious process, while millions of them are needed;

●

high-quality learning also requires a massive null set -- labeled objects that are
similar to ones being learned but not identical to them; typically 10x the
training set.

www.neuromation.io

We have trained several different models for object recognition (SSD, YoLo, Fast(er)
R-CNN), object segmentation (SegNet, FCN for segmentation), and are currently
working on an implementation of Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation. All of
these models contain a convolutional network that does the bulk of feature
extraction work from the image and differ in the extra layers on top of these
features that capture the actual semantics and produce class labels, bounding box
candidates, segmentation, and other outputs.
We have already obtained excellent object recognition results on both synthetic test
sets (which would be expected) and test sets with real photographs (which is
encouraging and serves as proof of concept).
In further work, we plan to improve synthetic data-generation pipelines with
machine learning algorithms, leading to a true active learning framework: synthetic
data is used to improve a model that is verified on real data, while at the same time
the learned model improves the synthetic generation pipeline to further benefit
learning.

www.neuromation.io

The deficiency in computing power required to scale synthetic dataset generation is
the key impediment for widespread adoption. The Neuromation Platform has an
economically viable proposition to the crypto-currency miners that would attract their
computing resources and help resolve the problem.
Background:
Crypto-miners are facing pressure from the ever-decreasing efficiency of their proof
of work computations required to mine Ether or other coins. Growing competition,
consolidation of the miner pools and increasing demand for the computing power
and resources will soon prevent many smaller miners from keeping their efforts
economically feasible.
Neuromation economic incentive for miners:
We want miners to have options. In addition to their existing mining software they
can load up Neuromation Computation Node. When a Neuromation task is available
each node can bid to participate. If the Node wins the bid it will switch computing
power from mining Ether or other coin to a task on the Neuromation blockchain
platform. The Node will generate synthetic data or train a Deep Learning model. As
reward the miner will receive our Neurotokens. Once the task is complete the
Neuromation Node will exit and the miner will proceed to mining crypto. Initially our
Neurotokens will be extending Ether, but later on we plan to migrate to our own
blockchain, once the Neuromation Platform economy matures.
Our preliminary estimates indicate that miners will earn up 3 to 5 times more mining
Neurotokens versus mining crypto currency. Miners will not be engaged in
Neuromation tasks 100% of the time so it will be an efficiency boost to the existing
set up. You can see the difference in effective yield below for similarly configured
rigs, one running crypto currency mining algorithm and one running Deep Learning /
Data Rendering tasks.

There are many publicly available models: VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet for
computer vision, Wavenet for audio, and so on.
They come in a variety of frameworks and libraries: TensorFlow, Caffe, Torch,
pyTorch, Theano, Keras etc.; converters exist between the frameworks.
The Neuromation Platform will support all major deep learning and automated
differentiation frameworks and libraries and provide support for major
off-the-shelf pretrained model formats.
Training results will be made available for the user to download.

●

Moreover, models can be compressed to speed up response times or allow
using them on mobile devices. Common model compression tools include:
○ after a (large) model has finished training, many of its layers often prove
to be superfluous and can be removed, compressing the network by a
factor of 2-3; this especially applies to very deep computer vision
networks based on residual connections; this technique is known as
model distillation;
○ some networks, called mobile nets, are designed from the ground up to
be small (e.g., SqueezeNet in computer vision).

●

Requests for custom models and architectures. If existing models and tools are
not sufficient for the given applications, customers can request a custom
model design for a specific problem. This request will be posted to the
Neuromation Exchange and will be filled by either Neuromation experts or other
certified suppliers.

www.neuromation.io

Our strategy is not to develop our platform in isolation, but to work with partners in
select industries in order to try to bring our vision organically to life. We are
developing “Neuromation Labs” that would develop synthetic data and train deep
learning models on live applications. Each “lab” will be a study on a specific
problem in partnership with a category leader. As our platform is fleshed out, we
will be moving parts of generation and training there, allowing us to organically test
parts of our vision in real-life scenarios.

The Labs will seed the Neuromation Platform market with initial data generators
and data sets. We will also encourage our Labs partners to provide further services
through the platform, thus building the initial market. We have already launched two
Labs and have more in progress. Working off real-world examples allows us to
generalize similar approaches across industries and incorporate those approaches
into our platform making it more powerful with each Lab.

Neuromation has partnered with some of the industry’s leading brands to solve the
problem of finding consumer goods on store shelves. Using synthetic data of every
product, we are able to create large perfectly labeled datasets for hundreds of
thousands of SKUs in the retail industry. Deep learning vision algorithms trained on
these massive data sets are able to efficiently analyze and label shelf availability,
percentage of the shelf, layout accuracy, and other metrics.
(live)

Our Retail technology Lab is the first to go live in the field with select partners in the
markets of Europe, Middle East, North America, and South America. Ideally every
shelf will feed a constant stream of analytic data to our retail partners. Using our
synthetic data approach, we are able to retrain analytic models quickly and
accurately, making AI for retail agile and useful for a multitude of applications.
Synthetic Data Example - procedurally generated 3d store shelves:

Exponential growth is projected to continue for the store inventory and
logistics robotics market.

(live)

What is especially fascinating is that in only about a month of working on the
inventory recognition problem we have achieved 95+% accuracy, a result others have
spent years of effort and millions of dollars on. Significantly, the model performs well
on real-life data without seeing anything but synthetic datasets during training.
This breakthrough proves the viability and efficiency of our approach.
With Neuromation Platform, the gateway to easy AI training at scale will be finally
opened.
(Breakthrough) Model taught on synthetic data recognizes real data.

The potential demand for image recognition alone in the retail industry is enormous.
In fact, by 2020 85% of customer interactions in retail will be managed by
artificial intelligence, according to Gartner.
It amounts to more than 40 billion images per year, according to ECR research of 72
of the biggest retailers and suppliers. Going further, we plan to create datasets that
mimic human interaction with the shelf. We will be able to track customer flow and
intent, creating a full simulator of the retail store, with a multitude of possible
applications.
www.neuromation.io

A typical difficulty with industrial environments is the highly dynamic nature of
performed tasks. Models have to be agile enough to work with dynamic real-time
data with high-precision output. This processing is done on the fly (sometimes
literally - some tasks are done by flying drones). Real time datasets cannot be built
fast enough in a dynamic environment to timely process and output such datasets.
The answer to this problem is the Neuromation Platform which can procedurally
create virtual environments where the models would be trained. Once the models
are trained in these virtual sandboxes they can be quickly calibrated on real data.
Agile hypothesis testing becomes possible.

Neuromation plans to open an Enterprise Automation Lab where the synthetic data
approach will help implement solutions in manufacturing, supply-chain, financial
services and agricultural industries, to name just a few.

www.neuromation.io

There are plenty of interesting targets for the Neuromation approach in Pharma /
Medicine / Biotech. In general, any problem where construction is easier than
recognition (output is easy to calculate from input, but the reverse is hard, like a
hash function in computer science) will yield well to our synthetic data approach.
We estimate that a lot of hypothesis-building in drug discovery and biological
system dynamics can be handled with deep learning models. To kick off this lab, we
have partnered up with a leading provider of infant monitoring solutions.

Through Neuromation Labs we partner with industry leaders to spearhead AI
solutions with them. Neuromation makes money by selling API (SaaS) or data to the
industry partner.
Examples:
○

Retail Lab

In our retail lab we have partnered with OSA HP (http://osahp.com/en/)
and ECR (http://ecr-all.org/?lang=en) to supply 170,000 item synthetic retail
data set for Eastern Europe. The contract involves building Deep Learning
models that can recognize the objects on the shelves and be an integral part
of OSA analytics. The contract potential is over 4.25M Euro over 18 months
time frame. Here is an example of the model deployment on a mobile device:

○

Medical Devices Lab

In our medical devices lab we have partnered with MonBaby
(https://monbaby.com/), a leading infant tracking technology provider, to
create a smart camera to augment their existing offering. The camera will be
tracking motion of the child and giving their caretakers valuable analytics.
Neuromation will be receiving a revenue share from each sold device.
Revenue potential is 2M+ euros over the next few years.
○

Other Labs

Several other labs are slated to open in early 2018. These industry
partnerships should give Neuromation additional revenue opportunities.
Our overall expectation is that we would be making around 30% of our total
revenues through Neuromation Labs partnerships.
