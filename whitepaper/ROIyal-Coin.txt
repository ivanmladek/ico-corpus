INTRODUCTION

Blockchain technology has experienced an enormous growth of
popularity through the recent years and still the potential it bears is
far away from being truly unlocked. Currently, the crypto market is in
the phase of active evolution, which means a great variety of projects
appear and try to adapt and contest each other for the attention of the
community. This also means that a great deal of these projects will
not survive long, because of the lack of flexibility and impulse.
The most common issues that severe the lifecycle of a
cryptocurrency are the unbalanced economy and the lack of a use
case. The use of masternodes (MNs) for the security of the blockchain
as well as the implementation of instant and anonymous transactions
became a small revolution inside the crypto world itself. In a small
fraction of time MNs became valuable investment assets, because the
operating masternodes are given certain coin rewards from the newly
found blocks. The key parameter for a person who is purchasing a
masternode is its payback time or ROI (Return on Investment). One of
the crucial problems for the investors is the uncertainty risk caused
by the fact that numerous crypto coin teams either lack an economical
background or deliberately plan to collect funds by luring the
investors with sweet promises, and then escape. In either case, many
projects start with the estimated payback times of their nodes being
very short – which looks exuberant for investment – but the coin
emission, which is commonly outrageous in scale, results in the
creation of a host of new MNs every day and the ROI values decline
drastically, as does the profit of the investors. Combined with the
negative effects of overproduction of coins on the exchange rates, one
might quickly find himself experiencing bitter financial losses instead
of profits or even a payoff.

AIMS OF THE PROJECT

We created our ROIyal Coin (ROCO) with the goal of providing a
crypto investor with a prolonged passive income from a Masternode.
By design, the block reward system has two distinct phases. During
Phase 1 the amount of coins per block gradually grows, in order to
compensate for the number of masternodes in the network. The initial
MN collateral of 1000 ROCO also changes, to 2000 ROCO at block
70001 and 3000 to block 150001, in order to leverage the effects of
coin emission on the market. Phase 1 will allow a significant number
of community members to become early investors, and then to
maximize their profits. The subsequent Phase 2 involves a gradual
decrease of the block rewards, which will serve as an anti-inflation
tool and the value of ROCO coins in the hands of MN holders and
stake holders will increase due to a slight deficiency of coins on the
market.
The use case of ROIyal coin is directly linked to the concept of
ROI of masternodes and the revenue early investors to a crypto
project should get for their support. We intend to create a monitoring
platform …”wait, yet another MN service?!” – one might rightfully ask
– but this one is different. The common problem a crypto investor
with a capability and desire to fund the freshest emerging projects
experiences is the need to filter off vast amounts of informational
noise, or even the lack of required information at the time it’s needed
most. We are working on a platform that would list the coins about to
launch and provide early or pre-launch information about the initial
ROI, along with other useful data. This way a potential investor will
have all the data to help him make a decision, whether to invest in a
high-risk, but an ultrahigh-ROI coin, or a project with very expensive
MNs but an estimated stable revenue in the long run.
Further development of the ROIyal Platform will include trading
services, such as direct exchange – you will be able to buy some
promising coin for BTC, RVN, or any other crypto, including another
emerging coins. All of this will be available to the early investor or
trader long before the time a project is listed on an exchange or any
ranking or monitoring service. One should realize that such early
purchases are actually very risky, but the profits they might bring can
outperform any expectations.

Our plans include the implementation of a reputation-based
aspect to our platform – the developers of the emerging projects will
be able to provide any additional information to bolster the trust from
the community. Such data will not be demanded however –we respect
the anonymity and privacy of any user of the internet and hence will
not force a KYD procedure for the coin teams, or a KYC one for our
community members.
At first, listing on the ROCO Platform will be free for the novel
coins. This period will last 2-4 weeks, depending on the market
conditions at the platform release time. Afterwards, a certain fee will
be introduced, which would be paid by buying out ROCO coins from
the exchange. The coins must be sent to a specific address where they
will be locked by the team and thus removed from circulation. This
decrease of the total supply should increase the value of the coin and
strengthen its exchange rate.
Coin Reviews
In addition, right before the launch of our project, team ROCO has
made a promising collaboration and we will be launching our own
coin review channel! Starting from a simple “screenshot-andcomment” format, we will gradually develop into a full scale video
resource dedicated to the analysis of emerging coins to help you
secure your investments!

PREMINE DISTRIBUTION

The total amount of ROCO coins in the premine is only 0.5%
from the total supply – 105000 coins. Out of that quantity, we
dedicate 30000 coins to the presale of 30 ROCO masternodes.
Another 30k coins will cover various marketing expenses and several
promotion campaigns will have the budget of 5k ROCO. A part of
coins (25k) will make up the ROCO Development Fund. Finally, 15k
coins will be used as a reserve to cover other expenses.

Promotion

The use of the premined coins by the team will be driven by
necessity, this is demonstrated by the small amount of coins reserved
for promotion. We will minimize the activities resulting in giving away
coins, as due to our observations, this only leads to a decrease of the
market price because of mass selling of the coins by those who don’t
value them.

SUMMARY

 ROIyal coin (ROCO) is a MN/POS cryptocurrency with the
economical parameters tuned for prolonged passive income of
the investors.
 ROCO has a low premine volume. The premine part accessible
by the team will be used carefully, to avoid exchange rate
fluctuations.
 The ROCO team is building a platform for early and pre-launch
listing of emerging cryptocoins, aimed at helping early
investors secure their funds.
 The extension of the ROCO Platform will include a reputational
aspect and trading mechanisms.
 Team ROCO will establish and maintain a coin review channel.
