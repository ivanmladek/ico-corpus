Problem: You do not own your own identity
As the Internet proliferates throughout the world, it becomes an intrinsic
element of human daily life in almost every domain. The Internet is an
inherently

digital,

international,

exponential

and

technology

network

unbounded by traditional borders. The shift from paper to digital computing
and Internet 1.0i and 2.0ii were some of the most fundamental changes of
recent modern history. Today, almost everything is being disrupted by
digitalization, computing, and the Internet. The development of blockchain is
considered by many to enable an Internet 3.0.iii
However, despite advancement and disruption in other domains, the identity
systems we rely upon today are currently paper-based, nationally-driven,
government identity systems and do not leverage the power of Internet 3.0.
Millions of people currently rely on — or are excluded from— identity systems
due to a lack of any modern technology infrastructure.iv
Most identity systems are centrally planned and managed, do not integrate or
link to other systems, and do not place the identity owner in a place of
entitlement and power. These systems lead to inefficiencies, data leaks, threats,
loss of privacy and identity theftv which have left billions without financial
accounts of any kind.vi
Many centralized identity systems have very serious security issues.vii The recent
Equifax data breach where the personal data of up to 143 million individuals
may have been compromised highlights the vulnerability of centralized
databases and calls into question the continued practice of collecting large
centralized sets of highly sensitive data.viii In some instances, the citizens of
entire countries (such as Swedenix) have suffered potentially devastating
personal data breaches. These breaches often do not occur as a result of
hacking or other malicious efforts but, instead, because appropriate safeguards
did not exist to prevent unauthorized access to the data.x
Current identity systems have largely failed to deliver any of the most basic
requirements for a successful identity system: security, privacy, ownership,
access, protection, interoperability, or linked data portability to identity owners.

“Current identity systems are limiting Fintech innovation as
well as secure and efficient service delivery in Financial
Services and society more broadly. Digital identity is widely
recognised as the next step in identity systems.” – WEFxi
The failings of traditional centralized identity systems are clear. To ensure that
individuals retain ownership of their identity, the development of a sustainable
digital identity model for our evolving global society is now essential.

Background
Parties in an Identity Transaction
There are typically three parties in an identity transaction; an identity owner
(IO) (such as an individual or company), an identity claim issuer (CI) or 3rd
party (such as a notary public or justice of the peace), and a relying party (RP)
(such as a bank, brokerage or other financial institution). The IO has one or
more identity claims (IC) (e.g. “My name is John H. Smith” or “I was born on
1 January 1975”). These claims are then attested to or verified by a third party
and the IO is then able to share these verified claims with a relying party, to
gain access to the relying party’s products and services, such as opening a bank
account.

By way of example, an individual (IO) wants to prove to a coin exchange (RP)
that they are a US person (claim) and that they have a US passport (a proof)
and that the electronic copy they are sending is a certified true copy of an
original. This is an electronic identity claim which receives an attestation from

4

a notary and becomes a verified claim. Verified claims are the future of digital
identity.
All of these parties struggle with the current paper driven and centralized
identity systems, and would benefit from a digitized, decentralized identity
system.

Limitations of a centrally managed identity system
Security and other risks
Most identity systems have large centralized databases containing millions (or
billions) of identity records. Because of their sheer size, these centralized
databases are high-value targets for hackers. The identity data they contain is
relatively easy to steal and use.xii Because the reward for a successful breach
increases exponentially with the number of identities held in that database, as a
database grows larger, it becomes increasingly more vulnerable to attack.
Furthermore, a single large database (as opposed to multiple, segmented,
decentralized databases) often means a single point of failure.
Centralized identity systems are usually managed by a single party and that party
then uses third-party processors to access the databases and process the data often without sufficient safeguards and oversight – making the databases even
more vulnerable to data breaches. Even if the operator is trustworthy, a
centralized identity system is vulnerable through third-parties with authorized
access. Individual identity documents are valuable commodities that are easily
sold on the black market. Purchasers of stolen identity data can use this
information to commit fraud and other crimes using the names of the innocent
identity owners. Beyond the obvious damage identity theft wreaks on the
identity owner, such breaches create significant liabilities for the operator of the
central database.
Restricted access
To try and prevent unauthorized access to these centralized databases, access to
the data is restricted by the operator. However, this often prevents identity
owners from accessing their own data.xiii If operators do not allow the data to
be accessed, that data cannot be linked to the benefit of the identity owner.
5

Linked data is a key component of digital identityxiv, as linking data means that
the identity owner can create linked relationships between data to their benefit.
Linking data is not a technically challenging task. In fact, these technologies are
widely available today.
Key technologies that support linked data are URIs (a way to identify entities);
HTTP (a simple but universal mechanism for retrieving resources); and RDF (a
generic graph-based data model with which to structure and link data).xv These
technologies have been around for years and yet individual identity owners
cannot benefit from linked data.
In addition to the technical limitations and security risks introduced through
using a centralized database, there are a number of business concerns of a
single large database operator of identity data.

Monopolies
If there were a single, for-profit organization with a database containing the
identity data of every person on the planet, it would operate as a monopoly and
be able to charge high prices for access to that data. Furthermore, if the
operator gained traction, the “network effect” would effectively lock users into
the network. This, in turn, would create significant barriers to entry for new
market participants. In the absence of competitive pressure, monopolistic
pricing and reduced innovation would likely result.xvi

Data protection compliance
A large, globally centralized database for identity could also breach data privacy
and data protection laws.
National and supranational data protection laws are designed to ensure data
controllers put in place policies and procedures to keep personal data as secure
as possible under threat of heavy monetary penalties and possible
imprisonment if they fail to do so. However, these laws are different for each
jurisdiction, and compliance standards vary enormously. Recent years have also
seen an increasing trend towards jurisdictions adopting data exports controls.
For instance, “the EU views the underlying US privacy laws as not meeting EU
6

adequacy requirementsxvii”. In response, only certain companies will be eligible
to transfer data from the EU to the US if they can comply with the “privacy
shield” framework. This is a barrier to entry for new startups who cannot meet
these burdensome and potentially expensive compliance requirements. To
compound the problem, the “privacy shield” framework is already under threat,
less than 18 months after it replaced the “safe harbor” mechanism which was
deemed inadequate by the European Court of Justice.
Central to most data protection laws is the concept of user consent. This is
normally given by individuals at the time they provide their personal data
through a tick-box or similar mechanism. However, as individuals are not at
the epicenter of existing identity management process, they cannot easily grant
(or revoke) consent or track the consent they give over time despite this being
their inalienable right under those laws. Increasingly, data protection requires
dynamic consent mechanisms to overcome these issues, but these are difficult
to achieve with largely paper-based consent models.
Recent years have also seen a huge rise in international data-sharing regimes
between regulatory authorities in a number of different jurisdictions with the
introduction of FATCA, the Common Reporting Standards and other
international data sharing agreements. Many of these sharing agreements are
also exempted from data subject consent requirements under national data
privacy laws, so individual identity owner consent is not required before their
data is shared. One of the sectors where identity data routinely crosses borders
is financial services and the data being shared between regulatory bodies
routinely includes identity data obtained via the KYC process.
KYC regulatory requirements
KYC laws are national and international in scope, representing a huge and
diverse group of relying parties including (without limitation) the following:
coin exchanges, fintech startups, money transmitters, real estate companies and
agents, precious metals dealers or storage facilities, fiduciaries, corporate
services providers, lenders, banks, securities firms, lawyers, accountants, nonprofit foundations, professional service providers, notaries, governments,
insurers, re-insurers, financial institutions, and generally any legal entity or
natural person dealing in money or finance.

7

KYC is not an option—itis mandatory, with civil or criminal sanctions imposed
by both local and international bodies for failure to comply with KYC laws.
Unfortunately, for many individuals and companies—from small startups to
large corporations, as well as relying parties—KYC compliance is an expensive
and painful reality.
For relying parties - KYC is expensive and time-consuming. The average
annual, recurring cost of KYC compliance is USD 60 million for the average
bank, but may be up to USD 500 million for others.xviii This cost is necessarily
high because relying parties cannot quickly and easily access up to date identity
data, validate the data or screen it to satisfy their regulatory requirements.
Therefore, relying parties must send new requests to the identity owner and
must treat every identity owner as a ‘blank canvas’ and force them through the
a fully robust KYC process.
The time and effort expended by one relying party to perform KYC validation
checks cannot be reused or recycled and is not leveraged in future requests. If
the identity owner decides to change service providers, these same checks need
to be completed by the new relying party. The identity data is not “ported” to
the new service provider and so ends up being held by multiple providers,
many of whom hold redundant, yet still highly sensitive identity data, for
individuals who are no longer their clients or customers.

The high cost

involved in this procedure creates a barrier to exit when changing service
providers, leading to an uncompetitive environment, to the detriment of
identity owners, fintech startups, and innovation, generally and increases the
risk of identity theft for the individuals.
Furthermore, those who lack identity documents issued by a national
government are excluded from commerce completely because of their inability
to comply with KYC regulations. Although certainly well-intentioned, KYC
regulations can easily exclude legitimate market participantsxix and slow down
international commerce. This problem could be easily solved if there was a way
for existing KYC data to be linked, re-used, and easily ported across borders in
a compliant manner.

Solution: “SelfKey” Self-Sovereign Digital
Identity Ecosystem
Our idea is simple: that users should be at the center of their identity
management process, a concept known as Self-Sovereign IDentity (SSID). We
can escape from the legacy systems of paper-based documents and move into a
digital identity with privacy, security, transparency and individual rights with
SelfKey, a SSID implementation built using blockchain technology, with the
corresponding keys held in a digital identity wallet.
SelfKey is an identity system built on an open platform consisting of several
key components including: SelfKey Foundation, a non-profit foundation
whose charter and governance enshrines the principles of self-sovereign
identity, a technology stack with a free and open source identity wallet for
the identity owner, a marketplace with real products and services available
at launch, a JSON-LD (machine readable) protocol, connection to 3rd party
identity micro services which comply with KYC laws and regulations, and
a native token called “KEY” which enables the SelfKey ecosystem to
exchange value and information in an efficient, fully-digital, self-sovereign
manner.
The products available at launch* include:

•

Bitcoin and Digital Asset Exchange Signup

•

Citizenship by Investment programs

•

Citizenship through Investment in Real Estate Applications

•

Company incorporation (including companies limited by shares,
foundations, LLC’s and Trusts)

•

Bank account introduction and application

•

Residence Permit Applications for more than 50 countries

•

E-Wallets or Stored value facilities

•

Gold and Precious Metals purchase and storage

•

International insurance applications

•

Money Remittance & Transfer services

•

Token Sales

Whilst providing tangible utility for the KEY token for identity owners, relying
parties and verifiers, through real world products and services, SelfKey
overcomes the limitations of centralized identity systems, helps achieve
compliance with the most comprehensive national data protection laws and
KYC regulations, and returns ownership and control of identity data back to
the individual – the identity owner.
SelfKey makes identity transactions more secure, private and efficient while
complying with the myriad of laws and regulations that exist today. However,
SelfKey is also building a bridge to a better world - one with digitally signed
verified identity claims, data minimization, proof of individuality, proper
governance, and a user-centric identity system. In this new world, the user can
truly control, manage, and own their digital identity. SelfKey is designed to be
censorship-proof, fair, inclusive, agile, and lean through a well-designed open
source technology stack, and transparent legal & governance infrastructure
through the SelfKey Foundation. SelfKey can match the current and future
needs of evolving modern societies and the global Internet, ensuring human
rights and fundamental freedoms of identity are met.

*Void where prohibited. These services are not offered by SelfKey foundation
directly, but by partners who accept information/KYC sent by identity owners
by using SelfKey.

Is blockchain the answer?
A blockchain is a distributed ledger whereby data is simultaneously replicated to
all participants. Should our identity data be stored on and replicated across a
blockchain that is managed by a number of participating entities (for instance
big banks or governments)?
No. Blockchain (alone) is not the answer.
Replicating all identity data to all parties could potentially breach data
protection laws for various reasons described above in the previous section,
specifically the requirement to keep personal data “onshore” or within a
specified jurisdiction. Furthermore, regulations and best practice requires that
companies only store personal data that is relevant to their business—and even
then, only with the customer’s consent.
Cybersecurity risk is increased if identity data is replicated to all blockchain
nodes. Central data stores are difficult to secure (as discussed above).
Accordingly, simply using a blockchain to replicate this identity data to multiple
parties will force each node on the chain to properly secure this data. As each
organisation has their own cybersecurity practices (and gaps), this would make
it easier for an attacker to steal the data. Even if the personal data is encrypted
this still does not solve the problem of legal compliance, as encrypted data can
still run afoul of personal data regulations.xx Anyone sufficiently motivated to
seek to re-identify individuals from transaction records held on a decentralized
ledger would likely have the wherewithal to re-identify individuals from other
available databases. The fact of anonymity on the blockchain is not the whole
story. In the "Big Data" era, powerful analytics technology can be applied to
match databases that appear to be clear of personally-identifiable information
to those which are not, and this will be a critical compliance test for blockchain
solutions that record personal data.
What is the answer?
The concept of Self Sovereign Digital Identity is similar to the way we store and
manage our non-digital identities today. Currently, most of us keep identity
documents such as passports and birth certificates or utility bills at our homes –
safely, securely, under our own control. We only share them with other entities
11

when necessary. Most of us don’t store these important paper documents (or
unnecessary personal information) with a third party—nor would we want to.
Self-sovereign identity in SelfKey is the digital equivalent of what most of us
already do with our physical identity documents.

How SelfKey works for the individual user
A new user would simply download the SelfKey Wallet application on a
personal device. Identity data is stored locally, on the device. A user is able to
back up this information onto another device or a personal backup solution.
When the user downloads the SelfKey wallet, it is empty. The first thing that a
user needs to store in this container is a public/private key pair (also known as
a SelfKey). This SelfKey will become the user’s digital “pen” that can be used
to apply an identity owner’s unique digital signature to documents. Because the
private key is known only to the identity owner, whenever this digital signature
is applied, it serves to authenticate and validate the owner’s identity to
requesting parties confidentially and securely (without having to appear in
person).
SelfKey has enormous benefits beyond a traditional username and password.
Each SelfKey is unique to its owner.

Where a username/password

combination is stored in a third party’s database, a SelfKey user would never
share their private key - this would always remain a secret to the user.
At this stage, no one–not even the SelfKey foundation–would know that this
was the user’s container, or that the SelfKey number even existed. No other
entity issued it, and it was created solely by the user. This is exactly what it
means to be self-sovereign. The user can now use SelfKey, along with identity
proofs, to receive attestations from relevant verifiers such as notaries,
government institutions, etc. After the user has attested identity claims stored in
their digital wallet, they are eligible to purchase products and services in the
SelfKey marketplace (covered in detail below).
In order for SelfKey users to take advantage of the products and services
available in the SelfKey marketplace, they will first need to create identity
claims. These identity claims are the user’s attributes (e.g. nationality, date of
birth, occupation, etc.) and are stored in text fields (JSON-LD blobs). To save
12

the time it would take to manually type the data into these text fields, photos or
scans of documents can be saved and optical character recognition will
automatically parse the information, making the process much easier. These
identity proofs are needed only to comply with traditional KYC documentary
requirements. In the future, SelfKey’s digitally-signed attestations will eliminate
identity documents as we know them today.
Once the identity claims have been created, the next step in the process is to
receive attestations of these claims. Attestations can be stored in the SelfKey
wallet too. These attestations are machine readable, digitally signed identity
claims, which can also be valid within certain time windows.
The verifiers or relevant authorities such as utility companies, notaries, banks,
passport agencies, hospitals, driving license authorities, immigration, can
potentially sign the user’s claims. These claims can be signed in a way whereby
one could choose to disclose only a minimum of information. In other words,
the identity owner can share what the requesting party needs to know, but
nothing more.

For instance, a user could easily prove they reside in a certain country. Or a
person might be able to prove they are over 18” without revealing more than
13

this information. These identity attributes are boundless and could also include
something such as “professional investor”. The identity owner will be able to
choose which piece of information to pass along to any relying party. The type
of identity claims that can be attested is almost infinite.
Data is stored on a device (under the owner’s control, the same as documents
are currently stored at one’s home or office today) and then when the owner
wants to, they can approve a third party to collect specific data. One can do
this by confirming a notification on said device. This experience feels similar to
authentication via “linking” a Facebook account.
This analogy is only similar in experience-instead of going to Facebook’s
servers to collect personal data, a user will be granting requests from their
personal data store, and will have granular control over what data is shared.
Unlike certain Internet companies, the SelfKey foundation is nonprofit. There
is no monetization by way of advertising or sale of user data.
Minimizing the amount of data which needs to be shared is safer both for the
identity provider and the relying party. The identity owner does not share
information which might be unnecessary or sensitive data – and the recipient
doesn’t need to store it. This helps with both security and compliance with
jurisdictional privacy law requirements.

14

How SelfKey works for a company
As mentioned previously, identity claims and attested proofs are not limited to
persons but can also apply to companies. A company could manage their
startup documents from the identity wallet as well. SelfKey has basic cap table
management, and can provide basic corporate governance which allows the
startup to do things that are currently burdensome such as opening a bank
account. When relying parties onboard a new company, KYC needs to be done
not only on the specific company level but also for all significant shareholders
at each ownership level above the entity until you reach the ultimate beneficial
owners. This kind of level of documentation verification is extremely
burdensome. Furthermore, for many businesses with multiple subsidiaries or
affiliates in multiple countries, this is where the advantages of e-KYC are more
compelling if linked identities can provide multilevel verification and is
something a national, centralized system cannot solve.. With SelfKey,
companies can easily demonstrate things that are traditionally time intensive
and difficult for identity owners to prove and relying parties to validate
(multiple ownership levels, complex structures, capitalization tables which can
change on a daily basis).

15

How SelfKey works for a verifier
There are a number of companies and institutions globally who issue (or could
issue) claims on behalf of identity owners for use by relying parties. Within the
KYC space an obvious example of this would-be utility companies (who
currently issue paper documents); banks (who give letters of attestation) and
company registries (who issue paper documents). SelfKey can be used today to
digitize and monetize these identity claims which relying parties are willing to
pay for. This helps reinforce the crypto-economy in the SelfKey ecosystem. It
may also be possible for verifiers to issue a fully digital certificate on the
SelfKey platform. The owners of this company could instantly verify ownership
by proving they hold the SelfKeys which were used to register the shares.xxi

The SelfKey network
The SelfKey Network is more than just an identity system for secure, encrypted
P2P, structured data and file sharing over the Internet. The SelfKey network is
designed with several innovative attributes to give it the best chance for long
term adoption and success which are explored in the following paragraphs.
Foundation
First and foremost, as previously described in this paper, it is untenable for a
single company to control or govern an identity system. Therefore, a
foundation was formed, not for control over the network, but to preserve
certain core Constitutional Principles (set out below). The foundation protects
and preserves the founding principles of self-sovereign identity.
Non-Profit Status
The SelfKey Foundation makes its top priority the success of the network as a
whole and the native token which runs the network (KEY). The foundation is
non-profit and is set up in Mauritius which benefits from regulatory sandbox
legislation that can be used by blockchain technology companies to develop
and commercialize their applications The SelfKey Foundation does not sell or
provide as advertising the identity data that flows in the system. All value in the
network is designed to flow to and from the use of the native KEY tokens.

16

A critical element of the SelfKey network is the native ERC-20 Token called
KEY, which stands for “Key to Encrypt Yourself”. This token can be used to
access products and services on the network. For instance, KEY is required to
participate, used to incentivize participation, good behavior and use, and enable
a self-reinforcing crypto-economy for identity which could appreciate in value
as more individuals and company join the network, increasing demand for
KEY. Certain actions on the network will require an exchange of KEY and
others will involve placing KEY in a locked contract (to access the network,
and prevent spam via an anti-Sybil mechanism) this research can provide a POI
(proof of individuality mechanism) which can have vast implications to the
Ethereum network.
Governance
SelfKey was founded by a for profit company, KYC-Chain Ltd (KYCC) who
open sourced code and made the monetary contribution to setup the
foundation. KYCC may continue to develop software for the Foundation, but
for the SelfKey network to thrive it is necessary for KEY token holders to
develop the open source platform as well. Members have no entitlement to
receive a dividend or any distribution of profits from the SelfKey Foundation.
There should be no expectation of profits resulting from the acquisition of
KEY tokens although KEY holders may receive financial incentives derived
through their own individual efforts in growing the network.
Legal
Remaining compliant with existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy,
data security, and other important legal considerations is an important mission
for any identity system when the goal is to achieve critical mass and adoption.
To this end, the SelfKey architecture is designed in such a way as to be
decentralized, to be globally accessible, and to be compliant with regulatory
rules, in particular with data privacy laws. This is accomplished through a
flexible, user driven approach which does not force a user to store their
documents in any one particular storage system and which always requires the
consent of an identity owner to trigger identity transactions.
At all times identity owners are in control of their identity, relying parties can
more quickly access the validated identity claims and verifiers can receive
17

payment for their contributions and attestations. This flexible and user driven
framework can help meet various country requirements for transfer of data
overseas.
As the identity system may evolve and change due to legal and technology
constraints-there should be a guiding ethos which is flexible in some regards
(such as storage layer, or what - if anything, is hashed to the blockchain as a
timestamp) but rigid in others, such as the preservation of individual rights and
self-sovereign identity. To that end, the following are the principles of the
constitution of the SelfKey Foundation.

The SelfKey Foundation
These constitutional principles are literally baked into the very governance and
control mechanisms of the SelfKey Foundation. Violating these principles
would be contrary to the constitution which makes these principles technically
and legally binding.
Existence. Users will always have an independent existence. Any selfsovereign identity is derived from a proof of life. In order to further that the
kernel of self that is upheld and supported, SelfKey endeavors to design our
system to exist beyond any one national system, and instead of placing a
priority on any one nation state-instead makes the most important participant
in our system the individual natural living person.
Control. Users always maintain complete control of their identities. The user is
the ultimate authority on their own identity. Users are able to reference their
identity, update it, or even hide it or have it disappear. Users are able to choose
publicity or privacy at their individual preference.
Access. Users have access to their own data. They can easily retrieve all the
claims and other data. In other words, the network will not allow for hidden
data about a user. This does not mean that a user can modify a claim solely at
their own discretion - however, users will be aware of any claims about their
identity.
Transparency. Systems and algorithms owned and operated by SelfKey are
transparent and open source, in both how they function and in how they are
18

managed and updated. The foundation which manages the system is
transparent.
Persistence. Identities are persistent and long-lived. Private keys may be lost,
and might need to be rotated and data might need to be changed, but the
identity should persist and remain.
Portability. All information will be transportable and not held by a single
third-party entity, the identity owner remains ultimately in control of their
identity.
Consent. Identity owners must consent to any transfer or use of their data.
Minimization. Disclosure of claims must be minimized. When data is
disclosed, that disclosure should involve the minimum amount of data
necessary to accomplish the task at hand. The minimum amount of user
information is only exposed to the right entities under the right circumstances.
Protection. When a conflict occurs between the needs of the identity network
and the rights of individual users, the SelfKey network will preserve the
freedoms and rights of the individuals over the needs of the network. Identity
authentication will occur through independent algorithms that are censorshipresistant and force-resilient and run in a decentralized manner.
Interoperability. SelfKey aims to be interoperable. The inherent persistence of
censorship blockchain and autonomy of private keys and self-sovereign identity
ensures wide and continuous availability, in a wide range of industries. Efforts
are made to ensure interoperability with other identity systems.
These principles are part of the Foundations’ constitution and members or the
board elected by members can only pass a resolution or action which is in
accordance to these principles.

SelfKey Technology Stack
Validating Nodes- At the core level of our system are validating Ethereum
nodes. We have considered using the Ethereum “proof of authority” at this
level, but have opted to use the normal consensus mechanism of Ethereum and
19

only change if there is any issue. In testing, we have used the EVM, Eris,
Monax, and Tendermint consensus protocol, and alternative blockchains
remains an option for SelfKey in the future should the Foundation board
determine this as the best course of action. We found a public blockchain was
the fairest, most inclusive, and well adopted blockchain currently existing.
Blockchain Layer – SelfKey key pairs are from the Ethereum Public network.
Storage - As there are challenges in compliance in an international system of
identity, we have made the storage layer entirely up to the discretion of the
identity owner. Documents will sit locally on the device of the user until when
(at their consent and discretion) the identity owner moves the documents or
data elsewhere. Later, storage drivers will be built for user controlled storage.
Key Management / Recovery
It is inevitable in a user managed identity system based on blockchain keys that some users will misplace or lose their keys. In such a case, if there was not
a way to recover the key - then all the attestations would be lost. Fortunately,
we have developed a solution. SelfKey plans to use Uport, a convenient key
recovery mechanism, whereby a user can delegate the responsibility of recovery
to one or more accounts of their choosing. Uport will provide interoperability
and build on standards which the Ethereum community already acknowledges
and accepts.

20

Protocols - In order to make the SelfKey network maximally interoperable, a
number of standards and ongoing work will be dedicated to the protocol layer.
This is how data will move in a structured format between one place and
another (potentially one blockchain to another). Work is being done in this area
with other leading identity systems to ensure interoperability; Sovrin, W3C,
Uport, etc.
ID wallet - The SelfKey identity wallet is available upon launch and is the
starting point for all identity transactions. The wallet can also store KEY.
Through the identity wallet the user can also access different apps in the
application layer. Any company can build in this application layer. Any identity
provider might also make interoperable their set of keys or certificates, for
instance various x509 certificates which qualify under an arbitrary government
electronic transaction ordinance.
ID Microservices – The microservices layer will largely allow for compliance
with international laws and regulations, and will be used mostly by verifiers and
relying parties. Any company might provide these microservices, but to support
the initial application layer and several ICO’s which will leverage the SelfKey
System, KYCC has built and provided some initial microservices such as
sanction list screening (the remediator), company registry lookup, and
document collection and validation (the collector).
Application Layer – Any application can be built on the SelfKey platform as it
has open API’s, open source code, including the wallet which is completely
open source.

Advantages of the SelfKey network over traditional
identity systems
There are numerous benefits available to all parties of an identity ecosystem
including identity owners, relying parties and verifiers, who each have different
agendas. The chart below should demonstrate that a decentralized identity
system can be beneficial for all parties.

21

Centralized Traditional Identity Systems

Decentralized Identity System of SelfKey
Identity Owners

-do not own or control identity
-need to repeatedly go through numerous
onboarding processes to satisfy regulators
-need to keep multiple authentication devices on
hand for a login process
-are unable to port information easily from one
service to another (high switching costs)
-must share identity documents, and cannot
share only a minimum of information
-only exist to relying parties under the
permission and authority of a government
-cannot re-use or recycle the output of an
identity or KYC process
-cannot easily manage company documents or
gather signatures for important decisions

-have full consent and control of their identity
-authenticate at multiple services through a single
key pair stored in a wallet
-can share a minimum of information
-can recover a lost key
-can access a marketplace of fintech products and
identity services
-can easily sign documents and reach consensus
as a company

Verifiers
-do not monetize identity claims (i.e. utility
company).
-are unable to revoke a claim
-cannot quickly grant claims
-identity claims are sometimes fraudulent

-can monetize identity claims through KEY
-can revoke claims
-can quickly grant claims
-claims issued have more confidence

Relying Parties
-must spend a lot time and effort onboarding
clients to satisfy regulatory requirements
-have annoying onboarding experiences where
customers have an unsatisfactory experience
-no way to import customer data
-costs a lot of money to validate KYC
-costly and challenging to be internationally
compliant
-processes are driven by paper based and manual
effort by compliance teams

-can quickly onboard identity owners
-can delight clients
-can request additional client details easily
-can benefit from economies of scale
-can be internationally compliant
-processes are driven by KEY and checked by
RP’s

Overall system features and benefits
-Vast amounts of data sits in a large silo
-reward for hackers is greater, thus bigger target
-proprietary and secretive
-creates monopolies of data
-less likely to be interoperable with others
-no value returned to the user
-owned and controlled by a single party

-distributed network allows for multiple small
storages
-reward for penetration is lower
-User centric and driven
-Open Source
-No single point of failure
-No centralized management or control
22

-single point of failure
-has traditionally led to massive data loss,
instances of fraud, and is holding back the world
from self-sovereign digital identity

-Better suited for an international context
-More transparent

The KEY token
KEY will be critical to running the ecosystem as all products and services are
available through some nominal payment in KEY, which will be used to power
the 'identity ecosystem' through a variety of actions. For instance, KEY can be
used, to do things such as pay for request attestations; receive identity claims
(and give value back to user); pay for marketplace listings; and generally, to
exchange value, incentivize use and adoption and allow access as a token.
As shown in the diagram below, each member of the ecosystem has a valuable
role to play in encouraging system use, utilizing KEY, and providing identity
proofs and attested claims. The below is not an exhaustive list of the uses of
KEY – but it should be clear that there is abundant token utility from the
launch of the network, and unlike many other tokens, KEY has intrinsic value.

Use of KEY Tokens
At the launch of the SelfKey network, the following services will be available:

•

Bitcoin and Digital Asset Exchange Signup

•

Citizenship by Investment programs

•

Citizenship through Investment in Real Estate Applications

•

Company incorporation (including companies limited by shares,
foundations, LLC’s and Trusts)

•

Bank account introduction and application

•

Residence Permit Applications for more than 50 countries

•

E-Wallets or Stored value facilities

•

Gold and Precious Metals purchase and storage

•

International insurance applications

•

Money Remittance & Transfer services

•

Token Sales
23

Within this ecosystem, only three parties exchange value. Identity owners,
relying parties and verifiers.
SelfKey will have a trust framework which will be signed by Relying Parties,
Identity Owners and Verifiers. “Trust frameworks are not a new concept. They
are commonly used both inside and outside of the world of digital identities.
Mostly they are used to govern a variety of multi-party systems where
participants desire the ability to engage in a common type of transaction with
anyone of the other participants, and to do so in a consistent and predictable
manner. In such cases, they are proven to work and scale.” xxii
The SelfKey trust framework will include specific protocol level information
but also information about KEY in order to properly incentivize good
behavior. It is expected that Identity Owners, Verifiers and Relying parties will
sign this trust framework which can help incentivize proper use of the network.
These documents will be released approaching public launch of the network
and with community feedback.

Looking to the future
Our working assumption is that it is very difficult to develop a system which
will be compliant with all data privacy laws in every jurisdiction. Therefore, the
identity owner is in charge of where their data is stored, and all actions are
driven by the identity owner.
24

Importantly, personal data and identity data are kept out of the transaction
ledgers altogether by replacing them with an encrypted reference to the data – a
“hash”. These hashes or ‘fingerprints’ help the identity owner prove that data
did exist at a certain date, but without the identity owner sharing the actual
identity claim - the data on the chain is completely anonymous and obfuscated.
The use of hashes also helps address the fact that blockchain technology is
structured to keep a permanent, immutable record of all transactions that have
taken place, meaning that in theory there can be no "right to be forgotten" in
the context of blockchain. Data protection laws the world over require that
personal data only be kept for so long as there is a purpose to do so. We believe
that encryption controls limiting the accessibility of personal data hashed in the
blockchain is a viable solution for data protection compliance. It is true that
encrypted personal data may still be classed as personal data in some
jurisdictions as long as the holder possesses the encryption key. However, if it
can be demonstrated that the keys will only be made available in circumstances
dictated by the individual, then it is difficult to see the objection from a data
protection perspective.
Data will flow from one place to another through Https, and work is being
done on P2P messaging protocols, and pairwise encryption methodologies for
data transfer. Essentially, the layperson can rest assured that: 1. Data only
moves upon consent. 2. Data Privacy is paramount and data is never shared by
the foundation with anyone 3. Each identity transaction uses encryption 4. Data
does not move through the blockchain, per se - and happens mostly outside
“off-chain” through various encrypted messaging and structured data
protocols.
The blockchain will have hashed the data and is stored it in a way that it can be
proven that the data has not changed. This timestamping mechanism is critical
in certain situations to prove timeliness of documents. Care will be taken so
that data is not correlated or causes a loss of privacy.
SelfKey Wallet
The Wallet (where the user will store and manage their ID attributes and
claims) is available immediately and is open source, available on desktop for
Mac, Linux and Windows. The SelfKey roadmap and immediate deliverables
call for this wallet to be available on mobile.
25

SelfKey Ecosystem
The SelfKey Identity Ecosystem is another major component we will be
working to improve. SelfKey includes 3 primary parties 1) the identity owners,
2) relying parties and 3) verifiers (or original claims issuers). SelfKey will engage
on a tripartite marketing development push to get all of these parties on the
network.
SelfKey Marketplace
The marketplace is a key component to the SelfKey ecosystem as it allows for
identity owners to see which relying parties are using the SelfKey system. In the
marketplace, identity owners can browse various financial offers and place an
order for a particular product. Relying parties / service providers can list offers
in the marketplace either free or for a fee. As the marketplace is two sided,
KEY can be used as the main token or commodity to interchange value.
SelfKey Data minimization
One of the key aspects of the system is data minimization, or in other words Identity Fragments. This will allows the identity owner to provide as little
amount of information as possible to satisfy the relying party or verifier. While
this can be done through advanced technology such as range proofs or zero
knowledge proofs (ZKP’s) it can also be done through specific protocols or
identity fragments. A person could for instance, prove their residency was in
Singapore - without revealing their exact address. This can be accomplished
immediately through proper design and doesn’t require a long development
process of ZKP’s. A portion of the funds received in the fundraiser will go
towards data minimization.
SelfKey Proof of Individuality (Biometric Research)
As our first founding principle is existence, an important element of the
SelfKey project is that a persons’ identity does not start with a government
issued identity document but rather with a human life. In order to do this, a
certain amount of research will be done on Proof of Individuality (POI) so that
anyone, anywhere is able to prove themselves to be alive at a given time, and
gain certain access to the SelfKey network. A separate whitepaper has been
written about this process and will be released when the POI validation and
26

testing begins in earnest. We believe that POI can be better solved with
biometrics than what is currently being proposed in the Ethereum community
– a series of video calls. Furthermore, the foundation will issue grants to try and
do a purely biometric based key recovery mechanism, so that if you lost your
keys, all one would need is not a complex brain password, but yourself.

The SelfKey team

Conclusion
SelfKey proposes a self-sovereign identity system as the best model for our
evolving global society. SelfKey is a distributed key management and recovery
system, a privacy preserving protocol based on verified claims compatible with
W3C in a JSON-LD compatible format, powered by a fully decentralized
blockchain, and developed by a non-profit foundation with distributed
governance. Inscribed in the forecourt of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi,
around 3000 years ago: γνῶθι σεαυτόν, or when translated into English; know
thyself. It is as clear now as it was then, you are the person best suited to
manage your identity. As we enter into a world that is increasingly digital, our
lives will move in unimagined ways onto public Internet infrastructure. Our
digital identity is at risk and not currently owned by identity owners.
Self-Sovereign identity on blockchain keys is only a partial solution, but in this
paper the SelfKey Foundation has proposed a distributed technology, legal and
governance ecosystem for you to truly own your own identity.
