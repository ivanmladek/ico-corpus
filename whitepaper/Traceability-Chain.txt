Outline
Traceability Chain (referred to as TAC for short) is traceability public chain erected through
block chain technology. According to the trans-chain protocol with ETH, it builds traceability
cloud platform by using the blockchain’s unique non-temper distributive book recording feature.
Through the sub-chain of the implementing project and corresponding DAPP application, TAC
solves the enterprise puzzles during raw material procurement, production, storage, circulation,
distribution and terminal consumption such as information traceability, anti-counterfeiting and
verification and accurate marketing, provides swift and high-efficiency development cloud service
cluster for the technological developers and solves the “trustable” puzzles for the brand enterprise
and consumers.
TAC ecology includes major chain, cloud platform, developer, enterprise and consumer.
In aspect of commercial mode, TAC erects basic blockchain platform and provides intelligent
contract interface. The developer may provide blockchain traceability anti-counterfeit technology
solution for the brand client and the brand client pays corresponding fee. The consumer may
obtain different awards from the brand enterprise via free scanning research.
Thanks to the business model design and the basic platform erected based on core idea, the
traceability chain enables more technology developers to join in ecology and facilitate more brand
clients to upload the commodities on the chain, in which way the traceability chain may enter into
the market and capture the market faster.
On Big Data Expo in Guiyang on May 28, 2017, in regards to the anti-counterfeiting
problem of Maotai, Ma Huateng, Tecent CEO, expressed that in the future, the networking
anti-counterfeiting form that was based on cloud end and mixed blockchain technology was
far effective than the traditional anti-counterfeiting trademark. The blockchain technology
is a medium existence. Like a accounting book, it may record all trading data which can be
used to verify whether the information is true.
Firstly, the blockchain is different from the usual centralized information storage organization.
The decentralization feature realizes the openness and equality of the data together maintained by
many nodes of the blockchain.
Secondly, the verified information will be stored forever after being added to the blockchain

and the data cannot be revised with single node. Thus, the blockchain data have higher stability
and cannot be tempered or repudiated.
Thirdly, anybody may check the blockchain data and share and exchange the data in the
whole system on public interface. Therefore, the blockchain keeps the highly openness and
transparency of the system information.
Vitalik Buterin, God V, Founder of Ethereum also said: “Traceability” business is an
awesome blockchain implementation application.
The blockchain provides a wonderful chance for the traceability business. Traceability refers
to the circulating chain used to trace and record intangible goods or digital goods. Through each
circulation registration, it may realize the objective of information collection and record, sourcing
traceability of raw materials, production course, batch inspection, logistics circulation and
anti-counterfeiting and verification and improving supply chain and providing financial services
of supply chain. The internal logic and data storage and verification situations for applying the
blockchain technology on traceability, anti-counterfeiting and supply chain improvement are much
familiar—non-temper data and time stamp.
The traditional traceability system adopted centralized account book mode or adopted
dispersive and separate record and storage by the market participants. It was a kind of information
island mode. In the centralized account table mode, it is the key whoever maintains the account
table as the center. No matter whether the source enterprise stores or the channel distributer stores,
since they are both the interested parties on the circulating chain, when the information on the
account book is against their interests, they may temper the account book or tell a lie that the
account book gets lost due to technology reason.
As a global project, TAC starts up in China and accumulates experience and improves the
platform. As the project develops, TAC will set the technology research and development center
and the market expanding center in Silicon Valley and radiate North America and Europe. In other
regions, we continually insist on the fastest application landing and focus on traceability,
anti-counterfeiting and supply chain application to solve the “trustability” for global goods
circulation, and win bigger value increment for the whole ecology in virtue of the industrial
reform of the blockchain.

I. Traceability Chain Understanding on Blockchain
1.1 Background of Blockchain Project

Internet has experienced two huge changes during its near 50-year development history. The
first change was global computer networking. Since the birth of ARPA network in 1969, the world
mainstream countries were gradually connected to internet to start the global networking journey.
The second change was that the global internet application. Since world-wide-web thesis network
appeared in 1989, the internet application realized global application outburst like “a hundred
flowers in bloom”. Now the third change is in pregnancy.
e-Cash proposed in 1983 is a digital payment system but failed later due to the centralization
reason.
HashCash proposed in 1997 is a digital currency that adopts poof of work (PoW) and has
been widely and hugely applied by digital currency.
B-money proposed in 1998 is the first de-centralized digital currency system. It is a pity that
it did not propose detailed implementation.
In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto firstly proposed blockchain conception. Although the blockchain
has experienced revolution of several generations beforehand, this period is the development stage
of digital currency. Until the birth of bit currency in 2009, which symbolized that the blockchain
technology brought huge hope for the digital economy era, it then really realized decentralized and
public-financial digital currency system, formally opened the development of the blockchain
technology and also started human research and exploration in the aspect of intelligent contract.
Version 1.0 blockchain was featured with digital currency and version 2.0 blockchain was
featured with intelligent contract. Then version 3.0 blockchain was featured with application
landing, which digitalizes the offline situation and synchronizes to blockchain network. Any great
creative technology will form huge change to the world. The steam engine has changed the
production form; the internet has changed the interaction form; what’s the blockchain changed is
value form. The change from blockchain to the world is mainly expressed through changing the
company organization form, commercial cooperation form and social governance form.
1.2 Significance of Blockchain Project

With the support from the blockchain technology, people find that the blockchain meaning is
that it can build a much reliable internet system and fundamentally solve the cheat and
rent-seeking during value exchange and transmission. As the blockchain technology becomes
popular, the digital economy will be much authentic and reliable since it can not only publicize the
information but also protect the privacy; not only make decision together but also protect
individual benefits. This mechanism will enhance the value interaction and lowers the cost.

tacchain.io

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

In the public service layer, the blockchain technology is exploring the application in fields of
public management, social protection, intellectual property management and protection,
anti-counterfeit and traceability of commodity and land ownership management. Relevant
practices prove that such technology may assist to promote the public participation, reduce the
social running cost, enhance the social management quality and efficiency and play important
facilitating effect to the tips for social management and governance level.
In the economic meaning, the new value interaction form created by blockchain is based on
“weak centralization”, which however doesn’t mean that various “centralizations” in the
traditional society may disappear completely. In the future, there will be huge amount of
“multi-center” systems in blockchain. Focusing on union chain, private chain or mixing chain, the
blockchain will further enhance the running efficiency of the “center” and reduce rather a part of
cost.
In the view of technology, we think that the blockchain is a kind of technology system that is
maintained together by many parties, stores the data with blockchain structure, uses cryptology to
guarantee the transmission and access safety and can realize consistent data storage and avoid
temper and refusal. Such technology brings indefinite imagination space to the world. The global
concern about the blockchain overheats continually. The major global economic entities start the
research on blockchain technology and development trend in the state strategy layer.
The birth of the blockchain technology symbolizes that the people start building the real
trustable internet. While, the application innovation of “blockchain plus” then points out the new
development direction of the industrial innovation and public service.
1.3 What’s the Traceability Chain

We hope to, basing on the technology of blockchain, adopting unique non-tamper distributed
ledger characteristics of the blockchain, build the communication node at bottom layer,
traceability cloud platform and distributed storage cloud service; solve the enterprise difficulties in
information traceability, anti-counterfeit, verification and mobile marketing during raw material
procurement, production, storage, circulation and distribution, store and terminal consumption
process of the commodity through the sub-chain of the landing project and corresponding DAPP
application, and provide a fast and efficient cluster of cloud services development for the technical
developers, so as to solve the problem of "trusted" for brand enterprises and consumers, and then
build a new blockchain ecosystem ---Traceability Chain as the future world-selectable commodity
information and internet value transmission protocol, and push forward the practicability and
usability of the whole block chain industry.
As the most promising blockchain ecosystem, TAC thoroughly combines the system
framework advantages of Ethereum, Ripple and Fabric. TAC will also constantly and gradually
form the blockchain economy through the construction of the foundation platform, the design and
development of the software and hardware products, the development of various products and the
development and iteration of the commercial landing project, gradually form TAC economy
tacchain.io

system, improve the industry efficiency, and promote the effective and collaborative development
of the society.
1.4 Advantages of Traceability Chain Project

Through tracing and recording the circulation chain of the tangible goods or intangible
information and registering each circulation, TAC realizes full-course traceability from
information collection and record, the sourcing, sourcing traceability of the raw materials,
production course, processing round, storage information, verification batch, logistics circulation,
the third party’s quality inspection, immigration control of customs, anti-counterfeiting
authentication, and improve the service accuracy and safety of the supply chain data according to
the traceability information and further provide blockchain financial service for the participants in
the industrial chain. The internal logic and data storage and verification situations for applying the
blockchain technology on traceability, anti-counterfeiting and supply chain management are much
familiar—non-temper data and time stamp.
The traditional traceability system adopted centralized account book mode or adopted
dispersive and separate record and storage by the market participants. It was a kind of information
island mode. In the centralized account table mode, it is the key whoever maintains the account
table as the center. No matter whether the source enterprise stores or the channel distributer stores,
since they are both the interested parties on the circulating chain, when the information on the
account book is against their interests, they may temper the account book or tell a lie that the
account book gets lost due to technology reason.
Such example is usual in real life. The camera is always off at key moment. Therefore, the
centralized account book maintained by the interested party is not reliable. Under information
island mode, the market participants themselves maintain an account book which is commonly
known as standing book and named to input into invoicing system after electronic input. No
matter whether the real standing book or the electronic invoicing system, the owner may temper or
edit later freely. The real-time checking ability in registration and settlement situation and the
non-temper and time stamp ability in data storage and verification situation of the blockchain
provide powerful tool for the traceability, anti-counterfeiting and supplychain financial and
management situation.

II. Background of Traceability and Anti-counterfeiting Market
According to the statistics, the loss from the false and counterfeited products to the markets
worldwide has reached USD300 billion. The annual deal amount of the false and counterfeited
products has occupied 10% of the total trade worldwide. In China, due to the powerful imitation
and production ability, the false and counterfeited product scale made in China has exceeded
CNY300-400 billion, especially in the fields where counterfeiting and infringement are much
common, namely currency, medicine, food, cosmetics, clothes, agricultural material products, auto
and farm machinery parts, audio and video products, software and computer chips. It has been the
“severe area” of the false and counterfeited goods.

2.1 Three Great Demands in the Future

(1) Public safety field. The informatization and electronization trend becomes much obvious
and provides much effective technical means and platform for the criminal prevention and strike
in public safety field. For instance, since January 3, 2011, 17000 taxis in Shenyang have been
installed with anti-counterfeiting sign. The anti-counterfeiting sign will become effective formally
and the “unlicensed taxi” will have nowhere to hide.
(2) Food safety field. The “Twelfth Five-year” Development Plan in Food Industry puts
quality safety at first and proposes to enhance the food quality sampling qualification rate from
94.6% in 2010 up to higher than 97% in 2017, which may hugely reduce the rate of food safety
accidents, obviously enhance people’s food satisfaction, ensure that the consumers are not worried
about food and further safeguard people’s fundamental interests. As people’s concern and high
attention to food safety increases, how to guarantee the food safety and prevent the infringement
of the false goods has becomes the technical and management puzzle in food safety field. The
government and consumers long for a simple but easily-operational technology to protect the food
safety. How to let the food put on the dining table safely becomes the hot point and difficulty of
the new technology, new equipment and new application.
(3) Drug safety field. According to the requirements of relevant policies and documents such
as Notice on Implementing Electronic Supervision on All Kinds of Basic Drugs, till April 1, 2011,
all basic drugs shall be implemented with dynamic management via electronic supervision code
during the circulation. It almost covers all medicine enterprises and manufacturers that produce
drugs. The involved scope is wide. The electronic supervision code is the unique symbol to
distinguish the drugs and is the “ID Card” of each box of drugs. The application of the electronic

tacchain.io

9

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

supervision code aims at helping state relevant organs to carry out much accurate and timely
supervision in the drug production and circulation rounds, providing convenience for the
producers to carrying out effective management and control to the drug sales and meanwhile
providing supervision platform for the people so as to realize medication to certain extent.
According to the development schedule of the electronic drug supervision work, the basic drugs
that are not connected in the network and are not marked with electronic drug supervision code
shall not be allowed to join in the drug bidding and procurement. According to the reckoning, 307
kinds of basic drugs will get involved in more than 3000 medicine plants which will need about
30-50 billion tags annually.
2.2 Traceability and Anti-counterfeiting Application Condition in China

Ali-Health & Tmall Medicine Together Started “Nutritious China” Brand Strategy
In October 2016, Ali-Health and Tmall Medicine together started “Nutritious China” brand
strategy and declared to build “Nutritious China Traceability System” to realize the “one code for
one nutritious product” traceability. In virtue of “Relieved on Code” platform of Ali-Health, we
can realize the traceability to relevant nutritious products, meaning that the nutritious products
have “ID Cards”. The consumer may find the nutritious products with authorized sign “Nutritious
China” of Tmall quickly as long as logs on the home page of Tmall and searches “Nutritious
China”, namely medlar, Chinese caterpillar fungus, bird’s nest, colla corii asini, dendrobe,
Ginseng, pseudo-ginseng, honey, and pilose antler, which have basically covered the popular
nutritious products in the market.

Yunnan Baiyao: “Truth Traceability” Was Brand Commitment
On November 1, 2014, Yunnan Baiyao erected a platform for assisting enterprise brands and
launched brand-new electronic tag anti-counterfeiting and traceability solution to solve present
bad situation that the good and the bad mixed in the market and the consumers cannot tell the truth
from the false.
Junlebao Dairy Built Anti-counterfeiting and Traceability System
In December 2016, Junlebao trademark is Chinese famous trademark. After entering into the
mobile internet era, Junlebao Dairy responded state policy call, followed the enterprise
tacchain.io

10

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

development trend, protected the consumers’ benefits, and started implementing enterprise
internet+ plan and built dairy anti-counterfeiting and traceability system.
FIR MUS Powder Milk Launched Cell Phone APP to Check Whether the Product Is True or
False
FIR Mus created and launched product traceability APP on cell phone in 2014 and realized
that 15 kinds of information such as fresh milk, finished product, place of origin, inspection place,
logistics head warehouse and the initial distributor can be traced and checked. In the aspect of the
information completeness and transparency, it not only complies the state requirements but also
the first in the industry. After creating the leading traceability system in dairy product industry,
FIR MUS still carries out innovation and upgrading unceasingly and continually improves the
product safety traceability through informatization and digitalization to seek self break-through.
Anti-counterfeiting and Traceability System of Maotai

RFID Anti-counterfeiting of Wuliangye
Wuliangye started using RFID anti-counterfeiting technology since 2014. On the basis of
bottle code and box code, Wuliangye added the unique RFID code and combined the three codes.
It is the first enterprise inside to apply RFID technology in wine anti-counterfeiting and
traceability. In 2017, Wuliangye improved the anti-counterfeiting overall and the consumers may
check whether the wine is true or false via cell phone directly.

2.3 Overseas Traceability and Anti-counterfeiting Application Condition

Since 1990s, many countries and regions have applied the traceability system in agricultural
tacchain.io

11

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

product quality safety management.
(1) Agricultural product traceability system of the European Union. The EU’s application of
the agricultural product traceability system is the earliest, especially the traceability system of live
cattle and beef products. EU includes the agricultural product traceability system into legal
framework. According to the beef tag law, the countries of EU shall build verification and
registration system for live cattle during production round and provide clear enough product sign
information to the consumers during sale round.
In January 2000, the EU published Food Safety White Paper, which proposed a fundamental
reform, namely to, based on controlling the whole course “from farmland to dining table”, define
the liabilities of all relevant producers and business runners.
In January 2002, the EU issued No.178/2002 decree ruling that each agricultural product
enterprise shall provide guarantee measures and data for the raw materials, ingredients and
relevant materials used during the production, processing and sales in order to ensure the safety
and traceability.
(2) Agricultural product traceability system of the US. In the US with extremely developed
market economy, the agricultural product traceability system is mainly built by the enterprise out
of own accord and the government plays a driving and promoting role. American industrial
association and enterprises built voluntary traceability system. More than 70 associations and
organizations and more than 100 professional livestock raising and veterinarian people composed
USAIP to jointly join in making and establishing livestock sign and traceability plan, aiming at
being able to determine all enterprises involved in direct contact within 48h under the condition
that foreign epidemic diseases were found.
In May 2003, FDA published Food Safety Tracing Regulation, which requested all
enterprises involved in food transportation, distribution and importation shall build and keep the
all course records relevant to food circulation.
(3) Agricultural product traceability system of other countries
The British Government built internet-based Cattle Traceability System. The system records
the cattle’s transfer condition from birth to death. The farm owner may record and register new
cattle and check the conditions of other cattle he owned through the online network of the system.
Canada started implementing compulsory live cattle and beef product labeling system since
July 1, 2002 and demanded that all beef products shall be labeled with bar codes up to the
standards.
National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is Australian livestock label and traceability
system. The live cattle shall be identified according to the ear label or rumen label identified by
NLIS. When the cattle moves to a new place the RF identification reader of the plant or slaughter
house may be read and recorded in NLIS database as migration information.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Brazil decided to carry out compulsory growth record to the
beef cattle since March 15, 2004 and realize a growing condition supervision from birth to the
table.

2.4 The Significance of Product Quality Traceability for Enterprises

The product quality traceability system is not to supervise enterprises, but to help enterprises
to build brand images and improve social effect and economic benefit. The whole process of
traceability management not only strengthens quality management of enterprises and reduces the
cost of error correction, but also facilitates enterprises to collect commodity information,
understand consumption trend and improve quick response capability. In the fields of circulation
and manufacturing, especially in the fields of food safety, drug production and manufacturing of
some chemical products, the establishment of product quality traceability system has become an
important means of management for enterprises to survive on. In retail and manufacturing
enterprises, such as automotive and electronic products, when quality problems arise, by
establishing the traceability system, the enterprises may quickly find out relevant batches and key
quality problems in them and recall relevant batches of products. On the one hand, the enterprises
can quickly deal with the problems of consumers; on the other hand, the enterprises can reduce
losses arising from recalls.
2.5 The Significance of Product Quality Traceability to Consumers

Product traceability allows consumers to comprehensively understand the lifecycle
information of products and make consumption more transparent. Meanwhile, the establishment
of product traceability system can propose appropriate countermeasures to reduce losses of
consumers when accidents due to poor quality happen, so that consumers’ benefits can be
protected. For example, recall system of the automotive industry is based on product traceability
system.
2.6 Famous Companies Lay Out Blockchain Traceability
2.6.1 Ant Financial

The blockchain technology developed by Ant Financial Technology Lab will be implemented
and applied to food safety and certified product traceability. According to the introduction of Ant
Financial, milk powder products of 26 brands from Australia and New Zealand, such as Abbott,
Aptamil, Wyeth and Bellamy, have their own “ID cards”, namely, Traceability QR code. Users can
know all information, including place of origin, date of production, logistics and inspections by
opening Alipay App and scanning QR codes after buying milk powder products in Tmall Global
and receiving them.
Product anti-counterfeiting query with blockchain is different from previous commodity
information query typed in by merchants because blockchain has permanent traceability and is
difficult to be tampered, so as to ensure the correctness of information and records and prevent
false information. Previously, Ant Financial applied blockchain to public welfare and
mutual-assistance insurance. The former is similar to supply chain traceability in principle. The
latter mainly uses transaction transparency and nonrepudiation to ensure trust. Product
anti-counterfeiting is the third scene of the implementation and application of Ant Financial
tacchain.io

Blockchain Technology.
2.6.2 JD

With the guidance and witness guidance of the Ministry of Agriculture, General
Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of
China, the Ministry of industry and information technology, China Quality Certification Center,
China Chain-Store & Franchise Association and China Animal Agriculture Association, Jingdong
will set up “Jingdong Quality Traceability and Anti-Counterfeiting Alliance” jointly with brands in
the fields of fresh food and consumption goods, such as Kerchin, Shuanghui, Jingqishen,
Wuliangye, Huggies, Wyeth and Nestle. Jingdong thinks data untamperability and existence proof
of time stamp that blockchain has can well support the traceability and anti-counterfeiting of
commodities. Take fresh food as an example, in the future, after shopping at Jingdong, users only
need to open APP, find the order and click “One-Click Traceability” or directly scan the
Traceability code on the product for information traceability. Take beef as an example, through the
only traceability code of the beef purchased, you can see which farm does the beef purchased
come from, breed and age of the cattle, the fodder, quarantine certificate number of the place of
origin, enterprise information of the processing plant, slaughter date, information of pre-delivery
inspection report, time to warehouse, temperature and spot check report for storage. Even delivery
information for final delivery can be traced and shown one by one. Therefore, illegal transactions
and frauds may have nowhere to hide and the users can eat safe food.
Zhang Chen, CTO of Jingdong Group, said as a leader in self-run B2C E-Commerce,
Jingdong Mall has an inescapable responsibility to adhere to building high-quality shopping
ecosystem and technology will become an important support for Jingdong’s high-quality
shopping.
2.6.3 IBM Assists Wal-Mart

Wal-Mart ensures the safety of pork supply chain. China is a country of high pork
consumption. Its pork consumption accounts for more than half of pork consumption in the world.
As the largest retailer, the first step of Wal-Mart’s global blockchain program is to ensure the
security of pork supply chain of Chinese market.
This project uses IBM’s blockchain technology based on Hyperledger, subordinate
open-source software of Linux Foundation, to timely record product information, including farm
source details, batch number, factory and processing data, date of expiry, storage temperature and
transport details, and information of each process in safe blockchain database.
Through implementation of the project, Wal-Mart can check place of origin of the pork it
sells and the process of each intermediate transaction from time to time, to ensure all the
commodities are verified.

2.6.4 Three Different Points from TAC to Three Blockchain Businesses

Ant Financial and Jingdong serve their own platforms and are only open to merchants within
their platforms at present. IBM’s system is systematic and integrated customized service directly
provided for large- sized customers. However, cloud platform of Traceability is open and win-win
ecology of developers. It provides distributed communication nodes and perfect blockchain open
platform at the bottom, provides the environment and interface for developers to quickly conduct
development of blockchain applications and serves global brand customers and millions of small
and medium-sized worldwide enterprise customers through Developers’ Community which
becomes stronger and stronger. In addition, TAC develops consumers through researching and
developing DAPP “Thousand Star City”, grants rewards through behavior mining, and stimulate
the consumer’s activation and participation through computing power. The accumulation of the
consumers may improve the brand enterprise’s interactive marketing and e-commerce sales and
further attract more brand enterprise in. It is one difference point between the traceability chain
from other several blockchain traceability businesses.

III. Fields Covered in Traceability and Anti-counterfeiting Business
and Development Plan
3.1 Traceability and Anti-counterfeiting Business Field

Traceability and anti-counterfeiting business is widely applied in various social fields. Please
see following figure for detailed situations:

Figure 1 Application Situation

3.1.1. Food Safety

Food is the first necessity of the people. The food safety has rose to a major national strategy
during the 13th Five-Year Plan period. With the implementation of the most strict Food Safety
Law of the People's Republic of China, various measures have been taken across the country in
relation to food safety. Among which, the construction of food traceability system is an essential
item in food safety work. As a result, the market prospect of food safety traceability platform is
considerable, and the industry will usher in great opportunities. The establishment of the food
safety traceability platform ensures that the whole process of the food from the field to the dining
table can be traceable, and the circulation of the fake and inferior products is restrained to a large
extent, and meanwhile, the digital dynamic tracking and monitoring system is also established
during the whole process of foods production for the consumers.
Today, the establishment of the traceability chain project is an innovation by the founder
team for themselves. The whole process traceability system, the dynamic tracking and monitoring
system and the block chain technology are combined to utilize the distributed storage of the data
on the chain, and the characteristic of non-duplication and alternation, the platform can construct a
tacchain.io

16

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

commodity full life cycle tracking and tracing system for enterprises from the raw materials to the
terminal consumers. The detailed information of each procedure during commodity production is
recorded in real time to ensure the controllable source; the flow direction of the commodity is
comprehensively tracked, the commodity circulation details are realized, and the defective
products are recalled directionally, thus achieving the traceable disposition of the products. When
prevent and eliminate food safety hazard thoroughly, the fake and inferior products are eradicated
from the source, the data basis is provided for later consumers, thus strengthening the reputation
of the enterprise and the consumer's purchase confidence.
The traceability chain team has reached the cooperative intention with the wild blueberry
enterprise in Greater Khingan Mountains and Jiaozuo Wenxian Yam, which has solved the
problems of traceability and anti-counterfeit of blueberry and yam through the landing of the
traceability chain platform. Additionally, with the attention of the market on block chain, it docks
the merchants with the mobile marketing and mobile E-commerce developers, In 2018, the block
chain blueberry and the block chain yam market full media propaganda and marketing will be
promoted, thus making the technology truly serve the market.
3.1.2. Medicine and Health Products

The medicine industry is more specific than other industries, first of all, the audience is
different from the common consumption group, mostly old and weak patients; secondly, the
product is more professional, and common consumer does not have the discrimination ability. In
contrast, fake and inferior medicine and health-care products have flowed into the market, which
caused great harm to consumers, and the identification of counterfeit and inferior products is more
difficult. Cao Guying, the national famous drug inspection and discrimination expert, said in an
interview that "a considerable amount of fake drugs are made by professionals, and they are
deceptive. A large proportion of them has no effect, which can't cure the diseases and won't cause
death of people. There are also some drugs that illegally add hormones, chemical (western
medicine) ingredients to immediately reflect the 'effect', such as health care products that claim
'therapeutic effect and reducing blood sugar'". Which means, the patient and the families are
difficult to identify through their ability once the drug has launched into the circulation market,
regardless of whether the advertisement, trademark or a curative effect are to be viewed.
The whole process tracing of the traceability chain ensures that the quality of the medical and
health-care products is ensured, and the dynamic tracking and monitoring system can solve the
problem of incorrect storage and impersonating replacement during the transportation and
circulation processes, and the control on the circulation details of medicines makes it easier to
achieve the emergency treatment and directional recall. At the same time, it also provides the
references for the governmental administrations to strengthen the means of law enforcement and
strengthen the market supervision, thus creating an orderly medical and health care products
market which is free from worry for merchants and reliable to doctors and patients.

The traceability chain team has reached cooperative intention with a domestic well-known
medical enterprise to generate a sub-chain for the enterprise through the traceability chain to
provide the full life cycle tracing and anti-counterfeiting and consumer interactive services for
hundreds of medicines of the enterprise. In addition, the TAC team also negotiated with one
national medicine group and started making relevant feasible research reports on using blockchain
technology to upgrade and reform the all-life circle traceability and supplychain of Chinese
traditional medicine.
3.1.3. Maternal and Child Products

From milk powder to vitamin balance, from cradle to chewing gum, the parents are always
tread as if on thin ice. From a family as the minimum to an industry and society as the maximum,
all parents hope to be able to bring the best food and supplies to the baby. However, fake and
inferior products always cling to the demand and "profit". The quality problem of domestic milk
powder in previous years made the consumers experience a carry-over of fear, and the good and
bad overseas purchasing mixed together, and it was more difficult for the parents to choose. When
shopping receipts have become the assistant tool of fake goods to enjoy the trust, what more can
people believe?
The traceability chain and the traceability anti-counterfeit platform introduces traceability
from raw materials to every procedure of production and circulation, and the distributed storage
technology ensures that all the data cannot be changed and covered, the producer can monitor the
production and circulation procedures through the platform at any time, the consumers may
realize the source of raw materials, flowing direction of products through the platform. With the
mobile APP, the consumers may even realize where the cows that produce baby's milk powder eat
the grass, and where the cotton for producing the clothing of mother is adopted, combining the
control of the whole production and circulation process. Traceability chain makes the parents free
of worry, makes baby healthy and returns the market to the merchants.
The traceability chain has signed a memorandum of cooperation with an innovative brand
enterprise of maternal and child products, and will provide traceability and anti-counterfeiting
solutions for the company's products after the traceability chain has been officially launched.
3.1.4. Cigarette and Wine

Cigarette and wine are not the necessaries of life, but it is an irreplaceable hard demand. It
has been for a long time for the demands on cigarette and wine, with the development of society,
the increasing of people's living pressure and the fermentation of the unique wine culture in China,
the demand of the market on tobacco products has never been attenuated. And the brand products
of the cigarette and wine have marked prices, which can obtain the universal value certification in
the sales circulation range, and can even be circularly used as the circulating medium. Therefore,
on the one hand, on the one hand, the anti-counterfeiting of the cigarette and wine has been paid
great attention by the producer and seller, and in the aspect of anti-counterfeiting technology, it
tacchain.io

18

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

is absolutely walking in front of other daily commodities; on the other hand, the production and
sale of the fake cigarette and wine industry has always been "keeping pace with the times",
"following the tide", and presenting the situation that "no prairie fire can destroy the grass, it
shoots up again with the spring breeze blows".
There are more than a dozen anti-counterfeiting marks for some brands of cigarette and wine,
however, on the one hand, consumers have different purchases for purchasing and have limited
identification ability; on the other hand, the means of making and selling fake products are
different, and the effective, long-term and systematic anti-counterfeiting identification system has
not been established at all times. In this case, synchronization monitoring system can trace the
source and realize the two-way tracing to show its capabilities. From the raw material supply to
the production and circulation, where the raw materials are supplied for which batch of products,
where the finished products are sold, and which batch of product shall not be sold in which area,
from the tobacco growers to the manufacturer, from the manufacturer to the distributor, from the
distributor to the retailer, from the retailer to the consumer, all the procedures in the production
and circulation are traceable bidirectionally. The distributed ledger ensures that the data is
authentic and reliable, and it is absolutely impossible to tamper with the fake and inferior
products.
The traceability chain team is making relevant layout in the field of cigarette and wine, and
has docked with several medium-sized cigarette enterprises and liquor plants, and is striving to
reach cooperative intention in the second quarter of 2018, thus pushing the traceability chain to
land in the field of cigarette and wine.
3.1.5. Luxury and Cosmetic

With the development of social economy, people's consumption level is also upgrading
accordingly. More and more people have the increasing demands on consuming famous brand
luxury goods and cosmetics. It's human nature to love beauty, and various luxuries with the
combination of beauty, grace, nature and practicality are attractive for many people. However,
luxury goods are named as "luxury", besides the high quality, the price is of course expensive. For
a variety of reasons, the price of domestic luxury fully demonstrates the so-called "identity
recognition" function, and has successfully made many buyers stop at the counter. Take the Estee
Lauder "Small Brown Bottle" Eye Cream as the example, its CIF price is RMB175, the import
duty rate is 10%, the consumption tax rate is 30%, plus the cost during import process, the import
dutiable price is RMB274.5, which is nearly RMB100 higher than the CIF price. In the domestic
circulation process, 5% of business tax, 17% of VAT and urban maintenance and construction tax
will be paid, plus the advertising fee, the final retail price of its direct operating store and Sephora
exclusive counter is about RMB540. And this price has successfully promoted the demand-hungry
consumers to transfer to overseas online shopping.
For most domestic consumers, the overseas shopping website and the shopping store of
Taobao and JD for products of overseas products have been a complex mood of love and hate. Not
tacchain.io

19

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

extinguished demands and inaccessible pit --- consumers need high-grade goods of relatively
reasonable cost performance, the online dealers and overseas shopping are providing such supply
and service, which would have been a win-win, but the operators were driven by interests and
consumers lacked discrimination. The lack of transparency in the process of commodity purchase
and circulation leads to this "operational space", which is what traceability chain is devoted to and
capable of filling.
3.1.6. Publishing and IP Derivatives

With the rise of knowledge economy, intellectual property has become the core element of
market competitiveness. Driven by interest, the cultural industry has become a serious area of
copyright piracy. The publishing industry in early years, the Internet creation and the IP
derivatives industry in recent years have suffered heavy losses under the infringement of copyright.
Before, it occurred in the vendition meeting that the reader fans asked for signature with the copy
of pirated work, which made the author in an awkward position; while it has become a
phenomenon that the works resources such as online novels, games, music, videos and pictures
which have been disseminated and downloaded freely, in this situation, people can't realize that
this is abnormal and improper. However, this disorder not only hits the author's creative
enthusiasm, increases the operating cost of the operation agent, causes huge losses for relevant
creators and institutions, but also impedes the formation of the ordered market in relevant fields. If
the users and audiences are accustomed to free use, it's hard to accept payment, and the so-called
free is often the most expensive. The good work requires the author to devote a lot of time and
energy to his creation. Without benign interaction and reasonable return, what it damages is the
author's creative passion and creative ability, which can lead to the final absence of good works.
When it is difficult to find a work worthy of watching after searching the whole network, we are
paying the price for poor copyright protection when choosing a hot movie but suffering from the
bizarre plot, the strange transition, artificial dialogue and a rough production.
The traceability chain project has made brave attempt for the protection of intellectual
property, which is not only the grasp of the utilization trend of the block chain technology, but
also the positive response to the market demand of the society and market demands on the
protection of intellectual property. The technical application of traceability chain in copyright
protection can not only promote the consumers to realize the whole creation and publishing
process of the commodity but also provide real evidence for the creation party and the publishing
party to maintain legal rights, and reduce the evidence cost in the process of maintaining rights to
the maximum extent. Monitoring from the source to the end, from the process to the details,
copyright infringement won't find the place to hide.
3.1.7. Art Collection

Art collection combines ornamental value and investment value. With the enhancement of
people’s artistic levels, rapid spread of auction prices of artworks and media’s promotion of
tacchain.io

20

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

treasure evaluation programs and activities, more and more people are eager to enter the artwork
market. The biggest difference between artwork market and other markets lies in the default
requirement of the field for people’s connoisseurship and aesthetic standards, which not only
naturally enhances the admittance requirements of art collection market, but also regards losses
arising from authentication faults as “tuition fees for entry”. Such industrial status and more and
more new members undoubtedly make speculative counterfeiters see an opportunity that can be
made use of.
The choice of artworks may vary from collector to collector due to their different aesthetic
orientations. However, no one will choose forged and fake artworks. Art collection is not only a
commercial activity, but also a kind of heritage and protection of culture. We cannot leave any
operation space for counterfeiters because of the so-called “industry characteristics” or any other
reasons. Eliminating the false and retaining the true is the issue that Traceability tries to achieve.
From creation to completion to auction to collection and circulation, records are kept for every
step of change to an artwork. Each circulation can be verified by untamperable data.
3.2 Development Plan

At the beginning, Yuansu Platform was founded to prevent and completely eradicate
potential food safety hazards, ensure the whole-process traceability of food from field to table and
completely eliminate gorged and fake food. Next, we will make overall arrangements in fields of
food, drug, baby and maternal products, alcohol and tobacco, luxury goods, cosmetics, publication,
IP copyright and art collection, provide whole-process data for merchants and consumers and
provide basis for government departments strengthen their means of law enforcement and
intensify their efforts in market supervision. Electronic commerce, automobile parts, building
materials and governmental affairs processing and auxiliary query will be the journey for the next
step. On the road of extract something of worth from a miscellany and eliminating the false and
retaining the true, Traceability will trace to the sources all the way and restore a genuine and
authentic market environment..

IV. Technical Architecture
The technical architecture of the traceability chain consists of three parts: bottom chain,
platform layer, and application layer of the traceability. Please see following figure for further
details:

tacchain.io

21

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

Figure 2 Technical Framework
TAC: Traceability Chain Token, digital license of the bottom layer of the entire system, is not
only the fuel for information exchange of the basic links, but also a voucher for value transfer of
the entire ecosystem.
DPOA: Blockchain certificate of various rights and interests of assets, such as the right to use
assets and ownership of assets.

Shared host cloud plan uses a file data storage solution based on IPFS Protocol
IPFS is based on content storage, rather than file names. It uses content addressing instead of
traditional addressing based on IPs and domain names. Users needn’t to care about the locations
of servers or consider the names and paths for file storage. IPFS is based on the only encrypted
HASH value calculated according to its content. The same content will have an only HASH value.
HASH value directly reflects the content of the file. When IPFS is requested for a file HASH, it
may use DHT to find the node where the file is located, retrieve the file and verify the file data.
IPFS is the infrastructure of general purpose, the underlying storage is based on P2P storage
technology, and there is no storage limitation. It can perfectly match with blockchain, the system
can use IPFS to process quantity data, store content on IPFS network, then store corresponding
HASH into blockchain and print timestamp. In this way, storing data by IPFS and completing data
pricing, right confirming and right transferring through blockchain can give full play to data value.

Subchain management
One of the main functions of the traceability main chain is the subchain management,
traceability subchain can be created by authorized account at any time after the main chain runs.
The creator can custom-make the detail functions of subchain and specific information of
tacchain.io

22

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

subchain token according to application requirements. These custom-made information forms data
structure of subchain, and releases information of creating this subchain in the main chain by the
means of invoking smart contract of main chain. This kind of release needs to deduct a certain
TAC (including creation charge and service charge), thereby it can be recorded in the block of
current period by accounting node.
At this point, the information of the subchain is recorded in the main chain, and then the
subchain will be regarded as an independent blockchain, which records the corresponding
transaction records and related data of all kinds of business logic in the subchain (pictures, audio
and video data will be stored in the cloud host of IPFS).
Because the TAC transaction is only recorded in the main chain, the operation of main chain
is independent of the subchain. The nodes running on the main chain only need to save the main
chain data, and only do the consensus and verification of the TAC transaction block. TAC, a
flexible subchain creation mechanism, determines that the subchain is tailorable, the state of the
subchain has no influence on the completeness and security of the main chain functions; besides
recording the description information of the subchain, the related data of other subchains will not
have an effect on the main chain.

4.1.2 Smart contract:

At present, the contract layer of the traceability chain has been fully developed, and a cloud
platform for the decentration of traceability chain has been built. To make it easier for developers,
we complete the verification of traceability anti-counterfeiting code, the inquiry of logistics code
based on the contract, all of which are smart contracts. The location of traceability chain is in the
public commercial application platform, so the traceability chain will take different ways to public
chain (main chain) ecological integration and promote the formation with other smart contract
platforms. The traceability chain will recruit and stimulate the third-party team (Technology
Development Company), build more actual and practical landing application projects based on the
traceability chain, the front-end audiences will be ordinary consumers, and then it will accumulate
and precipitate large numbers of fans for the brand enterprises traceability chain and subchain.
4.1.3. Various subchains

Functional characteristics of subchain
When the subchain is created, it can realize the customization of general function through
invoking the bottom interface of the traceability chain, which can make the subchain support all
the functional characteristics of main chain, also can restrict or not provide certain functional
characteristics according to application scenarios of the subchain, thus the functional
characteristics consistent with application scenarios demand of specific subchain can be quickly
custom-made.
Functional characteristics supporting customization include subchain token transactions,
transactions of subchain token and main chain token, cross-subchain token transactions, subchain
business transaction logic, pseudonym (Aliases), voting system, account control, instant message,
data storage, etc.

Subchain token transactions
Through customization, subchain can support the subchain protogenetic token transactions,
transactions of subchain token and main chain token, and cross-subchain token transactions. When
the cross-currency transactions are conducted, the token holder puts forward transaction request,
the transaction request information contains the types of transaction (buying and selling), domestic
currency type, target currency type, transaction price, and the number of transaction, traceability
chain agreement will make a match and complete matching buying and selling by means of
decentration, and the generating transaction record will be recorded in two crossing chains,
compared with the traditional trading center, it has the advantages of publicity, fairness, reliability
and traceability.
4.2 Consensus Mechanism DPOS

The node consensus at the bottom of the traceability chain uses the DPOS algorithm, and all
blockchains are essentially deterministic state machine driven by transactions. Consensus
tacchain.io

24

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

mechanism is a process to agree on determining the order of transactions and filtering invalid
transactions. Many different consensus algorithms can produce the transaction sequencing with
same effect, but DPOS has run reliably on many blockchains for many years, which is proved to
be a strong, safe and effective consensus mechanism.
Like all consensus algorithms, the maximum damage possibly caused by block producer is
review. The validity of all blocks must follow the deterministic open source state machine logic.
DPOS algorithm summary
The DPOS algorithm can be divided into two parts: how to select a group of block producers
and scheduling block production. The selection process should ensure that the interest holder has
the ultimate control of the situation, because when the network is running abnormally, the loss of
the interest holder is the greatest. Since the selection process itself has little influence on how to
reach consensus actually, this article will focus on introducing how to reach a consensus after the
block producer is selected.
In order to better explain this algorithm, it is assumed that there are 3 block producers, A, B
and C. Because reaching a consensus requires 2/3+1 majority to make a ruling of all situation, in
this simplified model, the producer C is assumed to be the role of breaking the deadlock. In reality,
there are 21 or more block producers. Similar workload proves that the general rule is the longest
chain wins. At any time, when an honest node sees a longer valid chain, it will switch from the
current bifurcation to this longer valid chain.
The certificate of entrusted rights and interests (DPOS) is strong in any case where we can
think of natural network fracture, even when most producers are cheating.
Unlike some other consensus algorithms, DPOS also can continue to function when most
producers are unqualified. In this way, the community can vote to replace the unqualified
producers until the 100% participation rate is restored. In my cognitive domain, no other renew
algorithm can remain strong under such high intensity and variable failure conditions.
In the final analysis, the reason why DPOS has such powerful security comes from the
algorithms of its selected block producers and verification node quality. The approval of voting
process can ensure that one person cannot choose alone and assign any producer even he has 50%
valid voting right. The design of DPOS is aimed at optimizing the mechanism that the honest
nodes of the strong network connections 100% to participate in the consensus. This allows DPOS
to confirm the transaction within the average 1.5 seconds and with 99.9% determinacy, and
simultaneously degrade in an elegant and detectable way, recovering from degradation to normal
is just a piece of cake.
4.3 Application Layer

In the early stage, the traceability chain provides a general application protocol at the bottom,
to develop different landing projects, and fastest make the blockchain benefit the masses.

tacchain.io

25

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

For most people, the goal of using and developing blockchain is not to recreate a set of
blockchains by themselves, only wishes to develop their own applications based on the existing
blockchain bottom or technical framework.
TAC is a blockchain application program that provides the next generation of platform,
allowing the development and distribution of blockchain application program based on the
traceability chain. TAC provides an easy-to-use interface and a full-featured ecosystem. Through
TAC, developers can build, publish, distribute and achieve aims by the application program in the
supply system allowed to use custom-made blockchain, smart contract, cloud storage and
computational node.
TAC provides standardized program module and makes development template aiming at
different business scenarios.

4.4 Framework Advantage
Available to Coexist with Traditional Central Data System
Can realize the second-time business development without revising existing centralization system
and realize the coexistence, natural switch or overall migration of the new businesses and original
businesses. Under the actual background that the blockchain lands, how to realize much friendly
upgrading and switch is the key.
Visual Intelligent Contract Generation Template
TAC provides open intelligent contract template, open industrial contract template and intelligent
contract generator for operators, which greatly lowers the intelligent contract making threshold
and flexibility ratio and may enable more developers to join in the tractability chain ecology.

V. The Ecology of Traceability Chain

The ecology contains: network node, cloud platform, technology developer, manufacturing
enterprise, consumer
tacchain.io

27

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

5.1 Network Node (Shared Hosting)
⚫ Network node supporting the public chain of traceability chain obtains service exchange or
token award through cloud services of shared hosting;
⚫ Each enterprise customer’s server host resources or leased cloud host resources are shared to
realize distributed distribution;
⚫ Enterprise customer’s related big data content will be distributed on thousands of shared
hosts, and its own host will also be responsible for the contents of other enterprise
customers. These data contents are encrypted to ensure data security.

⚫ If the host resources consumed by enterprise customer’s project are less than the host
resources provided by its own, it can get token award.
⚫ If the host resources consumed by enterprise customer’s project are greater than the host
resources provided by its own, it needs to consume token award.

5.3 DAPP Developers
DAPP developers are enterprises or individuals who have been engaged in traceability
anti-counterfeiting business in the past or are interested in expanding the traceability
anti-counterfeiting business and technology of the blockchain. Through the traceability chain, the
developers can easily conduct the blockchain formation of the traceability anti-counterfeiting
application, and use the latest technology to serve brand enterprise, thus seizing the early
advantage of the market.
The collection of the application development enterprises and individuals of the traceability
anti-counterfeiting business, the establishment of traceability chain schools and developer clubs
and training and road show for the global tour.

5.4 Brand Enterprises
The enterprises in the traceability chain ecology have the following characteristics
1. They have a rigid demand for the traceability and anti-counterfeiting of commodities
2. They dare to explore new technologies and new marketing models
3. The consumers of the enterprises have extensive demand for the quality and authenticity of the
enterprise’s commodities.

tacchain.io

29

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

Expansion of enterprise customers
1. Developers carry out expansion
2. Traceability chain sets up the connection platform
3. The traceability chain is to establish cooperative relations with various related government
departments, institutions, organizations and associations, deliver speeches for relevant enterprises
and guide enterprises to use traceability platform of the blockchain.

Earnings of enterprises
1. The full digitization and traceability of the production, circulation and sales of the products of
enterprises can be realized
2. Consumers can easily check the traceability and anti-counterfeiting of the enterprises’
commodities, which can improve the brand credibility of enterprises
3. The host of the enterprise can join the shared host cloud and the rich support force can earn the
token, which can reduce the network cost of the enterprise
4. Enterprises can conduct marketing interaction and commodity exchange on the APP of the
traceability chain, so as to increase fans, promote brand and increase sales
5. Enterprises from various industries that take the lead in using the blockchain will gain more
attention from the market and media publicity to realize the corner overtaking

5.5 Consumers
In the ecology of traceability chain, the consumer (user) is an important component. The
commodity buyer of the production enterprise can use the service of the platform through
traceability anti-counterfeit authentication; obtain TAC through anti-counterfeit authentication and
marketing interaction or by using APP to scan and use TAC to exchange the commodities
provided by the merchants.

tacchain.io

30

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

Through the improvement of consumers’ use of APP, the traceability chain can carry out
more ecological service functions on the APP.

VI. Summary of Traceability Chain/TAC
In order to meet the needs of good ecological operation and commercial application, the
Traceability Chain Coin is issued as the token of the system; TAC Token is called TAC for short.

6.1 Introduction to TAC
TAC is the token of traceability chain with a total amount of 1 billion, which will never be
additionally issued; in the traceability chain ecology, it is indispensable and is the carrier of value
delivery, which circulates between platforms, developers, enterprises, service institutions and
consumers to make the whole ecology healthier and have more development motivation.
TAC is constituted via ERC20 protocol of ETH and is 1 billion in total;

6.2 Acquiring Way of TAC
Users: the users may obtain token awards by buying commodities. They can participate in
marketing activities, scan and obtain the token awards after the anti-counterfeit authentication, or
they can obtain the tokens through the community activities organized by the platform.
Enterprises: the promotion items are exchanged for tokens, and the rich support force of the
shared host cloud is exchanged for tokens.
Developers: they obtain tokens by providing the enterprises with intelligent contract and
application development or by participating in the developer activities organized by the platform.

6.3 Use of TAC
1. It is needed to pay or burn TAC when developing on the traceability chain, certifying
application and using the service of the chain (such as the miner fees transferred on the chain);
TAC is the only Token used for the application operation on the chain.
2. With the increasing number of customers and consumers who have cooperated with the
traceability chain and the increasing trading volume in the chain, the traceability chain can receive
more commission. The team will regularly take part of the commission TAC or part of the
earnings to repurchase TAC and destroy it according to the price of the secondary market at that
time.
3. TAC can be used as a vote when a witness is elected.

X. Risk Assessment and Legal Affairs
10.1 Risk Assessment

tacchain.io

45

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

As a kind of new investment mode, digital asset investment has different risks. Therefore,
the investors shall carry out further operations before cautiously evaluating the investment
risks and self capacity for bearing and defending the risks.
⚫

Policy Risk
Since that the state regulation on blockchain project and digital asset exchange form is

not clear, the participants may suffer loss due to certain policy reason.
⚫

Supervision Risk
At present, the digital asset transaction has certain uncertainty. Since there lacks

effective regulation in digital asset transaction field, the digital asset tokens may rise and drop
sharply. If the individual participant lacks experience, after entering into the market, he may
not bear the asset shock and psychological pressure from the constant uncertainty. It cannot
be denied that in the foreseeable future, there will be regulation rules issued to rule and
specify the blockchain and electronic token field. If the regulation subject carries out specific
management in the field, the tokens bought in exchange period may be influenced, including
but not limited to the fluctuation or limitation in the aspect of price and easy sale.
⚫

Market Risk
In the digital currency transaction market, if the overall value of the digital asset market

is over-estimated, the investment risk may enlarge and the participant’s expectation on the
exchange project may be excessively higher. The excessively high expectation cannot come
true.
⚫

Competition Risk
As the information technology and mobile internet develop, the digital asset with “bit

currency” as representative emerges gradually. Various decentralized applications will appear
successively and the industrial competition will become fiercer and fiercer. However, as other
application platforms appear and expand constantly, the community will face continual running
pressure and certain market competition risk.

⚫

Tokens Sale Market Risk
Since the token sale market environment is close to the overall trend of the digital asset

market, if the market is depressed overall, or influenced by other uncontrolled factors, then it may
lead to that even if the token has good prospect, the price is still underestimated for long time.

⚫

Hacker or Theft Risk

tacchain.io

46

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

Hacker or other organizations or states may try to break the traceability chain platform in any
ways, including but not limited to a series of attacks such as refusing service attack, Sybil attack,
smurfing and malicious software attack.

⚫

Risk from Losing Private Key
The logging-in voucher of TAC owner shall keep cautiously. If lost, the TAC may be lost.

The best and safest logging-in voucher storage form is that the holder keeps the private key in one
or several places and it’s better not save in public computer. After the held TAC is withdrawn into
own digital wallet, the unique form included in the operating address is the holder’s private key
(namely secret key or wallet password). The user shall be responsible for protecting the relevant
private key self for signing and proving the circulation of the asset ownership. The user
understands and accepts that if his private key document or password are lost or stolen separately,
the obtained TAC relevant to the user’s account (address) cannot be recovered and will be lost
forever.

⚫

The Holder’s Voucher-related Risk
If any third party obtains the holder’s logging-in voucher or private key, the party may

directly control the holder’s TAC. In order to minimize the risk, the holder shall protect the
electronic equipment against the unverified access request from visiting the content in the
equipment so that personal private key and digital asset are stolen.

⚫

Risk that the Application or Product Fail to Reach the Self Expectation or the
Holder’s Expectation
The traceability chain platform is present at iterative development stage. Any TAC self or

holder may have excessively higher expectation on the aim or imagination of the function or form
of the traceability chain platform or TAC (including the participant’s behavior). Any wrong
analysis or the a design change may lead to such situation.

⚫

Uninsured Loss Risk
Dislike bank account or the account of other financial organization, there is usually not

insurance protection by storing in the account on the traceability chain platform or relevant
blockchain network. For the losses under any situation, no public individual organization will
underwrite for your losses.

⚫

Systematic Risk
Although some of the neglected critical defects in software on the traceability chain platform

or the risks caused due to large-scale fault of global network infrastructure will be weakened
greatly as the time goes on, for instance, repair the bug and break the computer bottleneck, other

tacchain.io

47

Absorbed In Creating Global Biggest Traceability Public Chain

risks cannot be foreseen. For instance, the political factor or natural disasters that may lead to
partial or global internet interruption.

⚫

Bug Risk or Risk from Accelerated Development of Password Cryptology
The speedy development of cryptology or the scientific and technical development such as

the development of quantum computer may bring the breakdown risk to traceability platform,
which may lead to the loss of TAC.

⚫

Other Risk
The cryptology-based digital token is a kind of brand-new and untested technology. Except

the risks mentioned in the white paper, there are still some risks that the founding team does not
mention or has not foreseen. In addition, other risks may appear suddenly or appear in the
combination way of multiple risks.
