Ripio​ ​Credit​ ​Network
a​ ​global​ ​credit​ ​network​ ​based​ ​on​ ​cosigned​ ​smart​ ​contracts
by​ ​Ripio​ ​International​ ​Limited

Abstract
Ripio Credit Network (“​RCN​”) is a protocol based on smart contracts and blockchain
technology, which brings enhanced transparency and reliability in credit and lending.
The protocol enables connections between lenders and borrowers located anywhere in
the world, regardless of currency. By reducing the traditional banking brokerage costs
and management fees, RCN aims to allow better conditions for both sides, creating a
better credit alternative than anything available today. By including an intermediary
agent (the “​Cosigner​”), the RCN seeks to neutralize the lender’s credit risk and, in case
of a default, provide an alternative mechanism for managing the debt collection in the
borrower’s​ ​country​ ​of​ ​residence.

1.​ ​Context
1.a.​ ​The​ ​traditional​ ​banking​ ​system
The financial system has been one of the main actors of the global economy for
hundreds of years. Credit, one of its essential functions, consists of managing the
savings of a population by channeling these savings from agents with surplus funds
(lenders)​ ​to​ ​others​ ​with​ ​insufficient​ ​funds​ ​(borrowers).​ ​[See​ ​Figure​ ​1.]
In a hypothetical scenario in which no bank existed as an intermediary agent, for a
credit transaction to take place both borrowers and lenders would need to: (1) become
aware of each other’s existence, (2) agree on how to value the risk involved in the credit
transaction, (3) agree on time-limits, amounts, and related terms, and finally, (4) manage
the​ ​logistics​ ​necessary​ ​to​ ​actually​ ​transfer​ ​the​ ​money​ ​during​ ​the​ ​lifetime​ ​of​ ​the​ ​loan.
Today, bank intermediation reduces these transaction and information costs, but with
certain limitations. Generally, banks focus their operations in determined geographic
locations, which makes it difficult for people in different areas to connect for purposes
of credit transactions. Additionally, a large amount of the world’s population is
unbanked or underbanked, and the rest are plainly excluded from the financial system.
[See Figure 2.] Banks give loans and credit according to their risk capacities, and as a
result, some credit projects are too expensive to undertake relative to the would-be
borrower’s creditworthiness, and some are simply un-creditable under local banks’ risk
capacities. As a further limitation to bank intermediation of credit, the standard
credit-granting process involves inherent bureaucracy in the collection and dispersion
of information, which adds costs and ultimately excludes even larger segments of the
population.​ ​[See​ ​Figure​ ​3.]

1.b.​ ​Internet​ ​and​ ​the​ ​Rise​ ​of​ ​P2P​ ​Loans
During the last 15 years, the Internet has produced a radical shift in terms of
information and communication, setting off an accelerated democratization process on
both​ ​for​ ​the​ ​people​ ​who​ ​have​ ​access​ ​to​ ​it.
The new social technologies of the Internet have also helped to expand the boundaries
of the traditional banking system by offering novel credit alternatives, such as
peer-to-peer (“​P2P​”) loans. These technologies helped the credit system to move
forward on some key points: (1) interest in modernizing the whole credit-granting
process revved up; (2) the segment of the population covered by the internet-based
credit system increased; (3) the localization issue was mitigated, to some extent; (4) the
intermediation costs were reduced, and thus the P2P interest rates were less than most
traditional bank lending rates; and (5) the shift brought better conditions for both
lenders​ ​and​ ​borrowers​ ​in​ ​terms​ ​of​ ​evaluating​ ​a​ ​project’s​ ​creditworthiness.
The Internet-driven shift was significant, but there are some structural problems still to
solve. First, the credit risk is generally still assumed by the lender, and not by the P2P
platform. Second, the credit risk evaluation process, though improved, remains
asymmetric. Third, the lender has only a few management tools to manage their assets.
Finally, if the company behind the P2P platform defaults or declares bankruptcy, the
lender​ ​has​ ​limited​ ​recourse​ ​with​ ​respect​ ​to​ ​the​ ​borrower.​[2]
In this context, the lender is confronted with a binary scenario: its counterpart (the
borrower) either meets its obligations or does not. In other words, the risk may be too
big and not diversifiable enough for a given lender to participate in the P2P lending
platform.

2.​ ​Ripio
Ripio​ ​(formerly​ ​BitPagos)​ ​has​ ​been​ ​described​ ​as​ ​one​ ​of​ ​the​ ​most​ ​promising
Bitcoin-Blockchain​ ​startups​ ​in​ ​Latin​ ​America​.
Ripio means “​gravel​” in Spanish. Just like gravel serves as a foundation for new
roadways, Ripio aims to build new roads throughout the digital economy. New roads
create new possibilities, and they are the key to widening access towards ​financial
inclusion​​ ​for​ ​everyone.
Ripio’s main objective is to ​democratize the digital economy in Latin America​,
offering digital payment alternatives within everyone's reach in a region where 65%
remain​ ​unbanked.​[3]
Due to its efforts toward the democratization of finance, Ripio was recently selected as
one of 2017 breakthrough brands by ​Interbrand.​[4] Here’s what the global consultancy
stated​ ​on​ ​their​ ​annual​ ​report:
Harnessing breakthrough blockchain technology, Ripio is bringing financial
freedom to regions of Latin American that lack banking. It sells bitcoins in
local currencies to facilitate online transactions and easy peer-to-peer
payments, and even extends credit—no cards, accounts, or fees involved.
Ripio (which means “gravel” in Spanish) is paving the road to full financial
inclusion​ ​in​ ​a​ ​growing​ ​digital​ ​economy.

2.a.​ ​The​ ​Road​ ​of​ ​Ripio
In 2013, ​BitPagos ​started as Latin America’s first Bitcoin payment platform, offering
bitcoin-based financial services for merchants​. A year later, the company launched
Ripio​, a digital wallet that enables consumers to send, receive, store, and buy or sell
Bitcoin in local currency and to make online payments on thousands of websites. In
January​ ​2017,​ ​BitPagos​ ​rebranded​ ​as​ ​Ripio.
Ripio​ ​has​ ​over​ ​100k​ ​users​ ​in​ ​Latin​ ​America.

2.b.​ ​Ripio​ ​Credit
In 2016, Ripio launched a groundbreaking credit service (called ​Ripio Credit​), reaching
the​ ​finals​ ​at​ ​TechCrunch​ ​Disrupt​,[5]​
​ ​ ​and​ ​revealing​ ​the​ ​innovative​ ​service​ ​to​ ​the​ ​world.
Ripio Credit currently extends credit to Ripio users, allowing them to finance their
online payments in installments, using bitcoin as the transaction vehicle. This
alternative credit facility is available to individuals without a credit card or a bank
account, and it represents a service that no other Bitcoin wallet company had offered
before.
Out​ ​of​ ​an​ ​Argentina-based​ ​entity,​ ​the​ ​company​ ​loans​ ​its​ ​own​ ​funds​ ​to​ ​borrowers​ ​in
Argentina​ ​in​ ​order​ ​to​ ​provide​ ​the​ ​Ripio​ ​Credit​ ​service.​ ​The​ ​company​ ​works​ ​with​ ​local

3.​ ​Ripio​ ​Credit​ ​Network
A​ ​P2P​ ​credit​ ​network​ ​based​ ​on​ ​cosigned​ ​smart​ ​contracts
3.a.​ ​The​ ​P2P​ ​Network
Leveraging the existing Ripio Credit application, the Ripio Credit Network (“​RCN​”)
leads the road towards credit democratization, offering a solution to traditional banking
system​ ​alternatives​ ​to​ ​credit​ ​access.
RCN is a protocol based on smart contracts that standardizes credit lending through
blockchain technology. The protocol facilitates connections among several agents, each
of whom play a role to ultimately offer the lender better tools to manage its capital,
reduce the intermediation costs between a lender and borrower, provide increased
credit​ ​access​ ​to​ ​borrowers,​ ​and,​ ​as​ ​a​ ​result,​ ​make​ ​more​ ​projects​ ​viable.
The Ripio Credit Network can connect borrowers, lenders, and other network agents all
over the world, allowing each one of them to manage the credit in their local currencies,
as long as they have Internet access. First, the RCN connects an agent with information
on the borrower’s identity to an agent who analyzes the borrower’s credit risk
impartially. Next, the RCN enables the sharing of this information with a cosigner, who
is an agent that provides a guarantee on the loan; the cosigner not only reduces default
risk for the lender, but it could also diversify its own credit risk by guaranteeing a
number of loans – hence reducing (and in some cases neutralizing) that risk. In
addition, in the case of a default, the cosigner may manage the unpaid debts in a
traditional​ ​way​ ​(e.g.,​ ​through​ ​a​ ​debt​ ​collection​ ​process).

[Diagram:​ ​the​ ​Ripio​ ​Credit​ ​Network​]
At​ ​the​ ​time​ ​of​ ​the​ ​network​ ​launch,​ ​RCN​ ​will​ ​consist​ ​of​ ​the​ ​following​ ​agents:
-

The​ ​Borrower​ ​who​ ​makes​ ​a​ ​credit​ ​request​ ​from​ ​its​ ​wallet​ ​provider.
The​ ​Lender​​ ​who​ ​invests​ ​by​ ​lending​ ​funds​ ​via​ ​a​ ​Credit​ ​Exchange.
Ripio​ ​International​ ​Limited

-

-

-

The ​Wallet Provider who generates a smart contract to: (i) specify the terms of
the loan, (ii) receive funds from the Lenders via Credit Exchanges, and (iii)
distribute these funds to Borrowers and other agents, as applicable and as
specified​ ​by​ ​the​ ​terms​ ​of​ ​the​ ​smart​ ​contract.
The​ ​Scoring​ ​Agent​​ ​provides​ ​a​ ​credit​ ​score​ ​for​ ​each​ ​Borrower.
The ​Oracle sets the price feed of the RCN Token according to the Wallet
Provider’s local currency, which is used to determine the exchange rate between
local currency and RCN Tokens at the time the loan is executed and when
subsequent​ ​repayments​ ​are​ ​made.
The​ ​ID​ ​Verifier​​ ​verifies​ ​the​ ​Borrower's​ ​identity.
The ​Cosigner who acts as a guarantor for Borrowers, and who may act as an
intermediary agent between the Borrower and the local legal system in the event
a​ ​Borrower​ ​defaults.
The ​Credit Exchange allows the Lender’s offer to extend credit to match with a
Borrower’s request for credit via a smart contract generated by the Wallet
Provider.

3.b.​ ​RCN​ ​Tokens
Although Borrowers and Lenders will likely prefer to denominate credit transactions in
a local currency, RCN Tokens will be required to facilitate transactions among the other
agents in the RCN, as further described below. RCN Tokens will be required to access
the RCN network given that agents' fees and obligations – plus the corresponding
distribution expenses within the network – are driven by the use of these tokens. RCN
Tokens also act as an incentive to each one of its participant agents to continue to
participate​ ​in​ ​the​ ​network.

3.c.​ ​The​ ​Smart​ ​Contract
The “​smart contract​,” generated by the Wallet Provider and executed when matched by
the Credit Exchange, contains the relevant credit terms, Borrower obligations, events of
default, and signatures or verifications from each of the other agents, as applicable. RCN
Tokens will facilitate interaction with the smart contract among agents within the RCN.
Each credit flow starts with the ​Borrower who makes a credit request. The Borrower
performs the request from its Wallet Provider, which has already integrated to the RCN
protocol,​ ​and​ ​then​ ​the​ ​Borrower​ ​waits​ ​for​ ​an​ ​approval.
The ​Wallet ​Provider (​i.e.​, any entity that wants to offer credit services to its users via the
RCN) adds information about the Borrower and its credit request, generates a smart
contract, and then broadcasts it to the network. Borrowers will only connect with the
RCN through a Wallet Provider. As a condition to using any software or services
provided by Ripio to the RCN, each Wallet Provider must warrant its compliance with
all applicable regulatory frameworks for the jurisdiction(s) in which the Wallet Provider
offers​ ​its​ ​services,​ ​including​ ​any​ ​applicable​ ​lending​ ​laws.
The ​Oracle ​provides the service of informing the exchange rate between any given
currency used by a Wallet Provider, Credit Exchange, Borrower, or Lender, and RCN
Tokens, at any time it is consulted. The Oracle will most frequently be consulted at the
time a loan is originated, and during the credit life time in order to determine its
installments.
Ripio​ ​International​ ​Limited

An ​ID Verifier identifies each Borrower and verifies that he / she is who he / she claims
to be; this will prevent most fraud or scam attempts and provide the Borrower’s
identification​ ​information​ ​in​ ​case​ ​of​ ​a​ ​default.
A ​Scoring Agent then analyzes available information to statistically evaluate the
probabilities of a default linked to a certain ID. This same Scoring Agent could
eventually gather the transactional information from the RCN blockchain (which is
open to anyone on day one) to build a credit ledger and track a Borrower’s instances of
default​ ​or​ ​non-default​ ​over​ ​time.
The ​Cosigner uses information provided by the ID Verifier and the Scoring Agent to
establish the terms under which it will operate on a loan. The default terms, under
which the cosigner takes responsibility for the Borrower’s debt, will be clearly specified
in the same smart contract. The Cosigner terms will be added to the smart contract,
along with the terms provided by the ID Verifier and Scoring Agent, and the smart
contract will be then generated and broadcasted by the Wallet Provider. In the event of
a default, the Cosigner acts on behalf of the Borrower by taking responsibility for the
debt amount as specified in the smart contract. The smart contract also determines if
the Cosigner is obliged to make a unique payment to the Lender or if it will continue to
bear​ ​the​ ​expense​ ​of​ ​the​ ​periodic​ ​installments​ ​under​ ​the​ ​original​ ​conditions.

[Diagram:​ ​the​ ​Cosigned​ ​smart​ ​contract​]
The cosigned smart contract is then listed by a ​Credit Exchange​, including the
information gathered up to this point. That is: amount, currency, Borrower ID,
Borrower credit score, co-signature insurance options, and any other agent or Borrower
input permitted. As a condition to using any software or services provided by Ripio to
the RCN, each Credit Exchange must warrant its compliance with all applicable
regulatory frameworks for the jurisdiction(s) in which the Credit Exchange offers its
services,​ ​including​ ​any​ ​applicable​ ​lending​ ​laws.
Ripio​ ​International​ ​Limited
https://ripiocredit.network
Page​ ​9

Through the Credit Exchange, a Lender that holds RCN Tokens can create a trading
order. When these orders match the conditions on the cosigned smart contract, the loan
will take place and the smart contract will execute accordingly. The RCN Tokens
involved will be transferred to the corresponding Wallet Provider, who will, in turn,
grant​ ​credit​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Borrower,​ ​upon​ ​turning​ ​the​ ​RCN​ ​Tokens​ ​into​ ​local​ ​currency.

3.d.​ ​Credit​ ​Lifetime
Once the cosigned smart contract is generated, the Borrower is bound to the Lender
under a payment obligation. The Borrower has committed to return the funds
borrowed, plus interest, in periodic installments or in a single installment. The Wallet
Provider is also obliged to inform the due dates and installment amounts to the
Borrower.
The total amount of RCN used in each payment will depend on the exchange rate(s) set
by the Oracle, which will oversee the market conditions and inform the smart contract
of exchange rates at each particular moment of payment. The repayment of funds will
flow as follows: (i) the Borrower will pay in local currency terms the amount due to the
Wallet Provider; (ii) Wallet Provider will trade the Borrower’s payment amount for
RCN Tokens at the rate set by the Oracle; (iii) the Wallet Provider will then send the
RCN Tokens to the Lender; and finally, (iv) the Lender can decide whether to hold the
RCN​ ​Tokens​ ​or​ ​trade​ ​them​ ​for​ ​another​ ​currency.

3.e.​ ​RCN​ ​Launch
At the time of the RCN launch, an Oracle will be live and capable of providing its
services to anyone who accesses the network. Additionally, the Argentinian entity that
currently provides Ripio Credit services will begin using the smart contract
functionality described above to provide simple, single-installment loans. Initially, this
entity will act as several agents in the RCN: the Wallet Provider, the ID Verifier, the
Scoring Agent, the Cosigner, and the Credit Exchange, using RCN Tokens to interact
with the Oracle on the RCN network. The entity will continue to comply with all
applicable​ ​lending​ ​laws​ ​in​ ​Argentina,​ ​where​ ​Ripio​ ​Credit​ ​services​ ​are​ ​available.
Once the RCN shows early signs of a favorable outcome (by increased usage), we expect
new agents will be drawn to the network. Eventually, RCN participants could evolve
their businesses to build new products on the RCN protocol or take on additional agent
roles within the network. These new products would bring new users and participants to
the network, and new ways for RCN Tokens to be used. Ultimately, as the RCN grows,
P2P lending can take place via an increasingly more efficient, borderless network of
agents offering services ancillary to lending that can programmatically execute via RCN
smart​ ​contracts.

3.e.i.​ ​RCN​ ​Token​ ​Sale
The RCN Tokens will be the backbone of the Ripio Credit Network. Around the launch
of the RCN, and in order to undertake future and further development of the network
protocol, the company will conduct a Token Generation Event (“​TGE​”) and crowd sale
of RCN Tokens, where 51% of the RCN Tokens will be made available for sale. The

Token​ ​supply​ ​of​ ​1​ ​billion​ ​as​ ​follows:

-

The​ ​51%​ ​of​ ​RCN​ ​Tokens​ ​made​ ​available​ ​for​ ​sale​ ​in​ ​connection​ ​with​ ​the​ ​TGE​ ​will
be​ ​allocated​ ​as​ ​follows:
- Up​ ​to​ ​42.5%​ ​/​ ​425,000,000​ ​RCN​ ​Tokens​ ​may​ ​be​ ​sold​ ​to​ ​purchasers​ ​before
the​ ​TGE.​ ​Any​ ​remaining​ ​unsold​ ​Tokens​ ​will​ ​be​ ​reallocated​ ​and​ ​made
available​ ​to​ ​the​ ​public​ ​via​ ​crowd​ ​sale​ ​at​ ​the​ ​time​ ​of​ ​the​ ​TGE.
- A​ ​minimum​ ​of​ ​8.5%​ ​/​ ​85,000,000​ ​RCN​ ​Tokens​ ​will​ ​be​ ​made​ ​available​ ​to
the​ ​general​ ​public​ ​via​ ​crowd​ ​sale,​ ​beginning​ ​at​ ​the​ ​TGE​ ​on​ ​October​ ​17th,
2017​ ​and​ ​lasting​ ​until​ ​the​ ​earlier​ ​of​ ​either​ ​the​ ​date​ ​510,000,000​ ​RCN
tokens​ ​have​ ​been​ ​sold,​ ​or​ ​November​ ​5th,​ ​2017.
15%​ ​/​ ​150,000,000​ ​RCN​ ​Tokens​ ​will​ ​be​ ​kept​ ​as​ ​a​ ​pool​ ​to​ ​incentivize​ ​the
participation​ ​of​ ​agents​ ​and​ ​for​ ​otherwise​ ​bootstrapping​ ​the​ ​network.
34%​ ​/​ ​340,000,000​ ​RCN​ ​Tokens​ ​will​ ​be​ ​held​ ​as​ ​a​ ​provision​ ​for​ ​partnerships,
marketing,​ ​and​ ​future​ ​RCN​ ​expenses.

4.​ ​Anticipated​ ​RCN​ ​Network​ ​Development
Following​ ​the​ ​RCN​ ​network​ ​launch​ ​and​ ​token​ ​sale,​ ​the​ ​company​ ​will​ ​continue​ ​to​ ​use
RCN​ ​smart​ ​contracts​ ​to​ ​facilitate​ ​lending​ ​transactions​ ​in​ ​Argentina.​ ​In​ ​the​ ​future,​ ​the
company​ ​anticipates​ ​the​ ​network​ ​will​ ​grow,​ ​and​ ​an​ ​increasing​ ​number​ ​of​ ​agents​ ​will
begin​ ​providing​ ​various​ ​RCN​ ​agent​ ​services​ ​in​ ​jurisdictions​ ​throughout​ ​the​ ​world.

4.a.​ ​ ​Importance​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Cosigner
As the RCN network develops, the Ripio International team views the existence and
inclusion of the Cosigner agent as a significant and meaningful benefit to the network’s
utility. The “​Cosigner” will act as a guarantor for Borrowers, and may act as an
intermediary agent between the Borrower and the local legal system in the event a
Borrower​ ​defaults.
The ​Cosigner uses information from the Identity Verifier and Scoring Agent and credit
ledger to determine the terms by which the Cosigner is willing to cosign on a loan. A
Cosigner may group the smart-contract-based loans (generated by the Wallet Providers)
in homogeneous risk portfolios in order to diversify them. This way, the Cosigner will
be able to estimate and predict an expected loss for a portfolio of similar credit rates
and use this information to assign its fee to cosign the smart-contract-based loan and/or
add credit information to the smart contract under various conditions. The default
terms, under which the cosigner takes responsibility for the Borrower’s, will be clearly
specified in the same smart contract. These terms from the Cosigner will be added to
the smart contract, along with the terms provided by the ID Verifier and Scoring Agent,
and the smart contract will be generated and broadcast by the Wallet Provider. In the
case of a default, the Cosigner acts on behalf of the Borrower by taking responsibility
for the debt amount, according to the insurance conditions noted on the smart contract.
The smart contract also determines if the Cosigner is obliged to make a unique
payment to the Lender or if it will continue to bear the expense of the periodic
installments​ ​under​ ​the​ ​original​ ​conditions.
The Cosigner is intended to be one of the key agents of the Ripio Credit Network. It is
intended to act as a reinsurer that distributes and reduces the Lender’s risk and, perhaps
most importantly, to also help improve the contract conditions on the Borrower side by
retaining​ ​access​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Borrower’s​ ​local​ ​legal​ ​system.

4.a.i.​ ​Regular​ ​P2P​ ​Loans:​ ​an​ ​Unbalanced​ ​Loss
In the case of a regular P2P loan, the lender doesn’t know whether the borrower will
have enough payment capacity in the future to pay off the loan or not. If the lender gets
a certain number of borrowers sharing the same characteristics, he will learn that
eventually some of them pay off the debt and some of them don’t. In other words, in a
regular P2P loan, the lender faces a random phenomenon, statistically speaking; by
taking​ ​the​ ​exact​ ​same​ ​action​ ​in​ ​apparently​ ​similar​ ​conditions,​ ​he​ ​gets​ ​different​ ​results.
In the following table, we have 10 borrowers that – according to a trusted credit score
assumption – each bear a 10% chance of default. The lenders are listed in rows, the
crosses represent the default events, and the columns represent different scenarios and
/​ ​or​ ​successive​ ​loans​ ​of​ ​the​ ​same​ ​lender.
Ripio​ ​International​ ​Limited
https://ripiocredit.network
Page​ ​12

[Table​ ​1:​ ​ ​loans​ ​scenarios​ ​]
As Table #1 shows, every column has 9 successful payments and 1 case of default, which
means that the 10% default assumption is correct in each of the 10 scenarios. However,
the entire loss is borne by just one lender, who loses potentially all of the funds
invested.
In the last column (
), some lenders haven’t lost funds in any of the 10 scenarios
(lenders 2, 5, and 10) and some lost their funds in more than one opportunity (lenders 7
and​ ​9).
This example simply reveals the main problem of most P2P loans: ​the single lender
cannot diversify the credit risk​. By following the trajectory of a single lender on many
scenarios (i.e. a single row on infinite columns), we would notice that the default rate
would stay at 10%, but there would still be no guarantee for the lender that the loss
would​ ​be​ ​as​ ​expected.
On an individual level, there’s very little utility in talking about the difference between a
borrower’s expected chance of default and the lender’s expected position. What the
credit system needs is an agent with enough credit volume to use the statistics to
diversify​ ​exposure​ ​and​ ​thereby​ ​neutralize​ ​the​ ​default​ ​risk.
In order to neutralize default risks by credit diversification, the lender’s risk on each
loan​ ​should​ ​be:
-

Finite​:​ ​the​ ​parameters​ ​of​ ​the​ ​event​ ​of​ ​default​ ​must​ ​be​ ​clearly​ ​defined.
Accidental by nature​: the lender should not have control of the event of default
in​ ​order​ ​to​ ​avoid​ ​manipulation​ ​and​ ​anti-selection.
Measureable​: the economic value of the loss should be determinable. There
must be enough data available in order to evaluate the risk with a high degree of
confidence.

Ripio​ ​International​ ​Limited
https://ripiocredit.network
Page​ ​13

-

Independent​: exposure units should be spatially and temporally separate from
each other (i.e. if one lender has a claim, this should not affect another lender’s
claim).

4.a.ii.​ ​RCN:​ ​Enter​ ​the​ ​Cosigner
RCN seeks to solve the risk neutralization problem by adding the figure of the Cosigner.
In order to explain the role of this agent, let’s review scenario #2 on the previous
graphic​ ​and​ ​add​ ​the​ ​cosigner:

[Table​ ​2:​ ​risk​ ​neutralization​ ​by​ ​the​ ​Cosigner​]
As Table #2 reveals, a default occurs regardless of the Cosigner’s intervention, but the
risk has been neutralized. The Lenders have traded higher but uncertain profit for
lower but more certain profit. The risk and the surplus are transferred to the Cosigner,
who​ ​collects​ ​a​ ​predefined​ ​premium​ ​to​ ​guarantee​ ​the​ ​loan.
Let’s review a second example, where the Cosigner undertakes a smaller part of the
obligation.​ ​In​ ​this​ ​case,​ ​the​ ​Cosigner​ ​stands​ ​for​ ​the​ ​60%:

Ripio​ ​International​ ​Limited
https://ripiocredit.network
Page​ ​14

[Table​ ​3​:​ ​risk​ ​neutralization​ ​by​ ​the​ ​Cosigner​ ​(with​ ​lower​ ​premium)​]
As we can see on Table #3, the Lender will lose a larger amount of his investment in the
case of a default, but his profit will be higher if there’s no default event. In other words,
the risk transferred to the Cosigner is smaller, but the cost (pure premium) is lower on
the​ ​Lender​ ​side.
In fact, there can (and will) be more complex scenarios. The Cosigner will evaluate his
participation on the loss and ponder that participation when iterating and estimating his
pure​ ​premium​ ​when​ ​he​ ​undertakes​ ​his​ ​next​ ​responsibility.

[Formula​ ​1:​ ​pure​ ​premium​ ​(p.p.)​ ​estimation​ ​by​ ​the​ ​Cosigner​]
The previous examples are simplified to explain the role of the Cosigner agent in basic
terms. In practice, the loan amount (“​amount exposed”​) will be quite different, and, in the
case of a default, the Borrower may have already paid a few installments, so the debt for
which the Cosigner is responsible would be just a proportion of the initial amount
(​referred​ ​to​ ​as​ ​“EAD,”​ ​or​ ​exposure​ ​at​ ​default​).
In the RCN, we intend for the Cosigner to be able to manage the debt as a local agent in
the Borrower’s country of residence, which enables robust opportunities for collection
that​ ​may​ ​consist​ ​of:
1.
2.

Contacting the Borrower ​via email, sms, phone, social media, or any other
means,​ ​to​ ​inform​ ​the​ ​Borrower​ ​of​ ​the​ ​default​ ​amount​ ​now​ ​due.
Offering a repayment reschedule plan​. The Cosigner might incentivize the
Borrower to make repayments (​i.e.​, by agreeing to not report the Borrower’s
Ripio​ ​International​ ​Limited
https://ripiocredit.network
Page​ ​15

3.

4.

default to a credit bureau) if a new payment schedule is accepted and the
repayments​ ​are​ ​made​ ​on​ ​time.
Reporting the debt to the local credit bureau (such as Equifax/Veraz in
Argentina and Peru, CIFIN in Colombia, etc). This report enables local collection
agencies​ ​to​ ​intervene.
Taking legal action​. If the Borrower ignores alternate means of contact, the
Cosigner could send a demand letter, noting an intention to proceed with legal
action. If this demand letter meets no response, legal action or a collection
process​ ​can​ ​be​ ​initiated.

Collection strategies, as described above, usually result in recovery curves such as the
following:

[Chart​ ​1:​ ​loss​ ​given​ ​default​ ​vs.​ ​recovery​ ​rate​]
The inclusion of a Cosigner can substantially reduce the loss in the whole network – not
just the loss attributed to the Cosigner himself (​referred to as loss given default, or “LGD” [6]
​ ​)
–​ ​but​ ​also​ ​the​ ​loss​ ​sustained​ ​by​ ​the​ ​Lender.
Consequently, the Cosigner should then be able to estimate a pure premium, just like
the​ ​traditional​ ​banking​ ​system​ ​does​ ​to​ ​predict​ ​a​ ​loss​ ​(“​ EL,”​ ​or​ ​expected​ ​loss​):

[Formula​ ​2:​​ ​expected​ ​loss​]
Furthermore, the Cosigner likely has more capacity than the Lender to undertake any
estimation deviation. The Cosigner can use his know-how to estimate the score that will
be included in the smart contract and assesses an estimated loss beforehand (that may
or may not be exactly the same in the future). This is why the Cosigner adds a statistic
safety margin (​risk charge​) in order to cover unfavorable / unexpected scenarios; the
more​ ​homogenous​ ​the​ ​risk,​ ​the​ ​lower​ ​the​ ​margin.

Finally, the Cosigner should be able to add an amount over the pure premium to cover
his expenses and a desired profit. As such, we can rethink the Cosigner premium this
way:

[Formula​ ​3:​ ​Cosigner​ ​full​ ​premium​ ​components​]
This formula explains how the Cosigner collects his premium and reveals the
components that factor into the premium. The same formula also works to reveal how
the Cosigner might (i) deal with future default events in unexpected or worse scenarios,
(ii) undertake the expenses of his work, and (iii) leave a profit margin to participate in
the​ ​Ripio​ ​Credit​ ​Network.

4.b.​ ​The​ ​Vision​ ​of​ ​an​ ​RCN​ ​Use​ ​Case

[Diagram​ ​3:​ ​RCN​ ​use​ ​case​]
Pedro, a student from Rio de Janeiro, wants to buy a car so he can more
easily go from his workplace in Leblon to the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro in Maracaña, where he studies. Pedro requests a loan from his
Wallet Provider for BRL 9,799 (USD $2,978). The Wallet Provider
generates, fills, and signs a smart contract with an amount request in RCN
equivalent to BRL 9,799 and broadcasts it to the network, including terms
such as the interest rate and the number of installment payments Pedro will
make. The smart contract is then completed with data from the ID Verifier,
Scoring​ ​Agent,​ ​and​ ​Cosigner.
Wang, a Juneyao Airlines employee from Shanghai, has CNY 20,000 (USD
$2,996) in savings, and he is not planning to spend these funds for awhile.
He decides to invest that money in a P2P loan, so he makes an order with a
few​ ​requirements​ ​(interest​ ​rate,​ ​due​ ​date,​ ​etc.)​ ​via​ ​a​ ​Credit​ ​Exchange.
The smart contract is then settled in RCN, however, the value of settlement
is represented in US dollars (“USD”) in accordance with the data supplied by
the Oracle. The equivalent to USD $0.85 in RCN goes to the ID Verifier,
USD $1.10 in RCN goes to the Scoring Agent, USD $111.69 in RCN goes to
the Cosigner, and USD $2,978 in RCN are transferred to Pedro’s Wallet
Provider. Then, the Wallet Provider trades those RCN for the amount in
BRL​ ​that​ ​Pedro​ ​requested​ ​as​ ​a​ ​loan​ ​to​ ​buy​ ​his​ ​car.
Pedro is now committed to return a debt of USD $2,979.95 in 24 monthly
installments of USD $136.14. Thus, Pedro agrees to return an amount that
includes the commissions of the ID-Verifier and the Score Provider and
Wang pays the Cosigner fee. The internal rate of return for Wang is slightly
lower​ ​than​ ​9%​ ​and​ ​the​ ​interest​ ​rate​ ​paid​ ​by​ ​Pedro​ ​is​ ​slightly​ ​higher​ ​than​ ​9%.​

Summing​ ​Up
ID Verifiers get RCN Tokens in exchange for verifying the Borrower’s
identity. ​Scoring Agents receive RCN Tokens in exchange for providing
data related to, and rating, the Borrower’s creditworthiness. ​Cosigners
collect a premium in RCN Tokens in exchange for cosigning the smart
contract along with the Borrowers. When a Lender agrees to the smart
contract listed on the Credit Exchange, RCN Tokens that have, per the
Oracle, a corresponding funds value in a specified currency in the amount of
the loan, are sent from the Credit Exchange to the Wallet Provider through
the smart contract. Finally, the Wallet Provider trades RCN Tokens for the
Borrower’s local currency and provides the Borrower with the funds
accordingly.

4.c.​ ​ ​Ripio​ ​Credit​ ​Network​ ​Development​ ​Roadmap
Milestone:​ ​Testnet
ETA​:​ ​August​ ​2017

Description​:
RCN Tokens and initial network agents are deployed via a testnet environment to
perform simple loans without installments and corresponding tests prior to the TGE
and network launch. An Oracle (which returns fixed prices and exchange rates) is
deployed to perform simple loans based on smart contracts: i.e. loans without
installments (zero coupon bond). A credit exchange interface is built into the RCN
test-net so as to allow testing of interactions among lenders, wallet provider, and
network.
Time-estimate​:​ ​1​ ​month

Milestone:​ ​TGE​ ​&​ ​Network​ ​Release
ETA​:​ ​October​ ​2017

Goals​:
-​ ​Oracle​ ​MainNet​ ​deployment.
-​ ​RCN​ ​Token​ ​crowd​ ​sale​ ​begins.
-​ ​RCN​ ​development​ ​team​ ​growth.
-​ ​Linking​ ​of​ ​the​ ​current​ ​Ripio​ ​Credit​ ​product​ ​to​ ​the​ ​network.
Description​:
The Oracle now functions within the RCN network and is also linked to the existing
Ripio Credit product. Acting as the network’s first user, as a Wallet Provider on the
Borrower side, the Ripio Wallet builds simple smart contract-driven loans and
broadcasts them to the network tested on the previous stage. RCN holders (contributors
who bought RCN tokens during the crowdsale) are now able to interact with Credit
Exchanges connected to the network and use their RCN tokens as capital for these loans
requests.

Further development of the RCN protocol is documented and specifications are
mapped out (agents, contracts, interfaces, technologies, etc). This stage includes the
addition​ ​of​ ​new​ ​members​ ​that​ ​will​ ​build​ ​up​ ​the​ ​development​ ​team.
Resources​:
Technical architects, software engineers, blockchain experts, web designers, content
managers,​ ​and​ ​UX​ ​designers.
Expected​ ​Deliverables​:
-​ ​RCN​ ​protocol​ ​documentation​ ​(diagrams,​ ​written​ ​records,​ ​etc).
-​ ​Initial​ ​network​ ​agents​ ​deployment​ ​(results​ ​report).
Time-estimate​:​ ​2​ ​months

Milestone:​ ​Full​ ​scale​ ​completion
ETA​:​ ​December​ ​2017

Goals​:
-​ ​Implement​ ​of​ ​advanced​ ​smart​ ​contracts,​ ​RCN​ ​agent​ ​interfaces,​ ​and​ ​SDKs.
Description​:
This phase will see the implementation of advanced smart contracts and SDKs. These
additions allow third-parties to join the network as RCN agents. The RCN smart
contracts now have the capacity to generate advanced credit requests, manage due
dates, and allow payments in installments, among other actions. The ID Verifier
interface is now defined and implemented, as well as the Cosigner and Scoring Agent
interfaces and their roles within the network. In addition, the Credit Exchange is
implemented in order to support smart contract trading and represent peer-to-peer
loans.
Resources​:
Blockchain experts, developers, project managers, DevOps, web designers, and UX
designers.
Expected​ ​Deliverables​:
- Documentation of advanced smart contract functionality, along with SDKs for RCN
agent​ ​roles.
-​ ​The​ ​smart​ ​contracts'​ ​solidity​ ​source​ ​code​ ​will​ ​be​ ​published​ ​on​ ​Github​ ​and/or​ ​other
repositories,​ ​including​ ​the​ ​release​ ​of​ ​SDKs​ ​and​ ​related​ ​agent​ ​integration​ ​tools.
Time-estimate​:​ ​4​ ​months

Milestone:​ ​Network​ ​development
ETA​:​ ​March​ ​2018

Goals​:
-​ ​Build​ ​the​ ​RCN​ ​business​ ​development​ ​team.
- Drive business development efforts to bring new network players as participant
agents.

6.​ ​Conclusion
The importance of the credit system as one of society’s most accomplished
collaborative efforts is unquestionable. Most great ideas would have never seen the light
without​ ​sharing​ ​funds​ ​from​ ​different​ ​people.
In this line, the longstanding contribution of traditional banks in the worldwide
economy must be acknowledged. However, due to traditional banks’ credit
selectiveness, renowned bureaucracy, and high-brokerage costs, the question now
presented​ ​is​ ​whether​ ​this​ ​system​ ​can​ ​be​ ​improved.
In recent years, new credit and lending alternatives have emerged based on the Internet
and P2P technologies. These alternative solutions improve most traditional banking
services by covering a larger segment of the population and offering new project
viabilities. Still, they present a structural problem in that it remains difficult for a lender
to​ ​have​ ​a​ ​diversified​ ​portfolio​ ​in​ ​order​ ​to​ ​mitigate​ ​default​ ​risks.
RCN aims to strengthen the solution provided by most P2P platforms and magnify its
potential. Based on the Ethereum blockchain’s ERC20 protocol, Ripio will launch a
credit network operating on cosigned smart contracts​, and connecting borrowers,
lenders, and cosigning agents. The cosigning agent undertakes insuring a sufficient
volume of credit transactions to predict its own return on investment, to manage the
debt,​ ​and​ ​to​ ​collect​ ​the​ ​funds​ ​in​ ​case​ ​of​ ​borrower​ ​default.
Ripio Credit Network sets the stage for a decentralized, trustworthy, predictable, and
more efficient P2P global credit network that can make it possible for many ideas and
projects​ ​all​ ​over​ ​the​ ​world​ ​come​ ​to​ ​fruition.
