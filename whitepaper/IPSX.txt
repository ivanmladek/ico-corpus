IPSX
IPSX – a decentralized exchange for sharing IPs and a framework for building applications, on
top of the existing IPs shared by the community members and data centers.
A smart contract based, blockchain protocols and utility token incentivized mechanism of
sharing IPs among actors from all over the world and a framework to build applications that
require IPs built in a reliable and open source environment.

DISCLAIMER
This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer or solicitation
to sell shares or securities in IPSX or any related or associated company with IPSX. Any offer or
solicitation will be made only by means of a confidential offering memorandum and in full
accordance with the terms and conditions of all applicable securities and other laws existing at
the moment.
"The highest good, then which there is no higher, is God, and consequently it is immutably
good, hence truly eternal and truly immortal."
— Saint Augustine, from the book “De natura boni”, circa 405 C.E.
Adapting this sentence to the current social, economic, political and psychological realities of
mankind and relating it to the actual technological field we would obtain:
“The highest good, then which there is no higher, is blockchain, and consequently it is an
unchangeable good, hence truly eternal and truly immortal.”

VISION AND CORE FEATURES
- IPSX is the first truly decentralized IP Sharing Marketplace, which will create a global
marketplace for IPs. Combined with flexible tools (SDKs and APIs), to aid entrepreneurs and
developers in a fully secured and transparent environment to develop new applications on top of
the already existing IPs on the IPSX sharing platform. It will become a framework and a
marketplace for new applications that require IPs at their backbone (VPN providers, Data
Mining software, web crawling bots, micro tasks, etc.).
- Data is said to be the new resource of our times. At the backbone of Data Mining, large volumes of
IPs are required for the actors involved in the mining process to be able to perform tasks. By
substantially lowering the price of IPs and solving the IPs accessibility and availability problems,
IPSX is aiming to become a key building ecosystem for all the fields that require larger or smaller

volumes of IPs and allowing complex applications from Data Mining and other fields to become
more accessible to everyone.
- IPSX connects actors in a peer-to-peer network, enabling both data center owners and
individual users, that will be called "providers" to rent IPs to other users, that will be called
"requesters". The IPs can be used to complete different tasks requiring one or more IPs from
different locations. Today, IP addresses are valuable assets with a low liquidity level due to the
fact that there is not a simple solution to share/rent IPs based on a specific list of filters and IP
resources are supplied by centralized providers which are constrained by closed networks,
proprietary payment systems, and many other restrictions.
- IPSX core built-in feature set is a dedicated Ethereum-based transaction system, which
enables direct payments between requesters and providers, solving all the above mentioned
problems, increasing the liquidity of the IPs and allowing any actor that has an IP on his internet
connected device, to take part into a multi-billion yearly business, that otherwise would be
closed to home internet users.
- IPSX function, as the backbone of a distributed market place for IPs, can be considered an
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), and also a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). However, IPSX will
reveal its true potential by adding dedicated software integrations to the ecosystem that will be
built on top of the existing IPs and that can use the IPs on the IPSX platform. Any interested
party is free to create and deploy software to the IPSX marketplace by using the SDKs and
APIs that will be provided by the IPSX ecosystem.

BACKGROUND – HOW IT ALL STARTED
In 2011, Sergiu Draganus along with some other friends created GeoRanker
(www.georanker.com), a Data Mining Platform focused on Local SEO Reporting instruments,
that connects to servers from more than 50.000 different locations and retrieves live ranking
data from Google, Yahoo, Bing, Yandex, YouTube in real time.
One of the major activities that followed from GeoRanker initial business model was custom Data
Mining for different clients from all over the world and, later on, the business model included also IP
sharing and renting, based on requests that came from our different type of business partners.

Some of the major problems encountered during the Data Mining processes, IP rental and IP
sharing processes, among others, were low liquidity level, good quality and high prices for IPs
(in order to obtain a good price/IP huge volumes of IPs need to be rented or purchased from
different IP providers).
Based on the increasing demand of IPs from the GeoRanker platform clients, the impossibility to
satisfy all the requests, combined with the blockchain technology and capabilities, the IPSX concept
was born in July 2017 and developed initially in multiple brainstorming sessions by the GeoRanker
team members. At that time, the team was already composed by multiple blockchain early adopters,
evangelists and enthusiasts, so it all came natural in creating the IPSX concept.

INTRODUCTION
There are about 3.5 Bln Internet users and 8.4 Bln IoT devices connected to internet according
to Gartner.
What all of them have in common above other things, are:
- high speed CPUs
- memory Chips
- internet Protocol Addresses called IPs.
There is a huge need of remote IP usage which results in a market of over 60 Bln USD with a
16% yearly growth rate.
Remote IP usage is popular among end user consumers to:
- improve privacy and security
- access geo-blocked services / media
- bypass national and corporate restrictions.
Remote IP usage is popular among business providers for building:
- VPN applications
- Data Mining;
- security layers
- other micro tasks.

www.ip.sx

The success of such a project is already proven by the TOR project among end users, which
currently has over 2.5 M daily users.
Main problems of TOR and other similar projects are:
-liabilities - you might have a problem when sharing your IP
-no revenue/ no economy behind the IP sharing/ IP renting processes, which generates the next
problem
-bandwidth and Speed Quality
-not usable for business and service providers.

SOLUTION: IP SHARING EXCHANGE (IPSX)
Blockchain based system fully automated, with full clearing of utility tokens associating the price
and distribution, based on offer and demand for IPs.
First level:
You will be able to share your device’s IP address or as a Data Center to share a full range of
unused IPs in order to win real-time IPSX tokens in a safe way. (All connections will be logged
in the blockchain).
As a client you would be able to access, in real time, IPs from all around the world and use
them for short period of times, as of 5 seconds up to a whole month.
Second level:
We will create a framework and a marketplace and allow any business and service providers to
build custom made applications that require large volume of IPs based on our SDK and APIs.
As a VPN provider, you would be able to integrate your system with our SDK to let your clients
choose from millions of IPs from all around the world.

IPSX AS AN ECOSYSTEM
The IPSX business model and use cases will fully benefit from all the advantages of the
relatively new technological advances. The market for IP Sharing can now be organized to an
entirely new system and principles, and moving from centralized and hard solutions to
rent/share IPs to a fully decentralized and fully automated system of renting/sharing IPs.
At the moment, the IP sharing market is only accessible to a few large players that understand it
and its needs, and that also have the technical solutions to rent/share IPs. With the
advancement of the blockchain technology, everyone can take part into a multibillion yearly
business and provide their support to a decentralized economy and generate revenue in a safe
and easy environment.

ACTUAL PROBLEMS
IP addresses are valuable assets with a low liquidity level due to the fact that there is not a
simple solution to share / rent IPs based on a specific list of filters.
Below we will present some projects and solutions that approached this direction so far:
TOR free software project, famous for introducing the idea of Onion Routing to a wider
audience. In this system, users download a global list of relays and exit nodes, randomly select
from that list, and form onion routes from their selection. Some of the problems it faces:
- high lags because there are no rewards for sharing IPs
- no internal economy
- liabilities (you don’t know what actions the users are doing using your IP address).

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) use encryption to securely transport a VPN subscriber's
traffic across a larger insecure network. Once the VPN has received the traffic, it is decrypted
and retransmitted across a different large insecure network. The retransmission can assist
users in circumventing access restrictions imposed by websites, and, to a lesser extent, reduce
the tracking of their website browsing habits. Encryption prevents the user's ISP from seeing
their traffic. Some of the problems faced by the VPN providers are:
-limited number of IPs from GeoLocations where the demand is high, thus leading to the
impossibility for some users to access different services (too many users use the same IP and
the IP is banned or restricted)
-the end users are required to pay a full month price even if they need the service for only a
couple of minutes or hours.
The process of IP Sharing is difficult from the perspective of matching a specific need with the
offering.
Clients for IP sharing have different needs, such as:
- rental Time frame
- number of IPs
- geolocation
www.ip.sx

- usage scope
- usage protocols http/smtp/VPN etc.
- costs of usage/duration
- contractual Costs / micropayments.
Providers also face different problems:
-B2C - making money by sharing phone/tablet/ISP IP – no technical solution
-finding clients for specific IP / IP classes - marketing issues
-B2B - Difficult to build IP portfolios with different IP classes renting for short periods of time
-contractual costs / micropayments
-liabilities.

SOLUTION
The use of BlockChain Technology advantages:
-integrate cross platform clients
-create a marketplace where the request will meet the offer for IP services
-sharing / renting IPs using custom filters time frame / price / GeoLocation / protocol manage micropayments using ETH protocols and smart contracts
-record all “transactions” (IP shares owner/ client) in the blockchain.

OUR VISION: IPSX AND WEB 3.0
At the moment, as Internet users, we are being restricted in different ways, we are not allowed
to use services and applications due to censorship employed by various groups of interests
from all over the world.
All this comes to us in many forms.
Nation states monitor the Internet traffic, so they can construct different profiles of their citizens.
In such a context, dissent becomes dangerous, and honest political discord in some places is
impossible.
In a very similar way, Internet Service Providers and content providers have become
unstoppable and restless in their objective to monitor, track and profile every user across the
Internet. The daily Internet activity, communications and behavior of every user are gathered
and sold to advertisers and basically anyone willing to buy them. Such transactions occur with
little to no conscious consent from users and with a complete disregard and lack of respect for
any notion of personal privacy.
Access to content is being restricted by its content providers to certain areas due to Intellectual
Property limitations or purely because of low valuation of users from some particular locations.
We don’t condemn in anyway the current system and its position. However, in the actual context
and the new economy model that rises, we believe that this system is old and unfair to many
actors inside of it, and the time to change is NOW.
www.ip.sx

We believe that the future of economy and Internet will be a fully distributed network, enabling
users and actors from all sectors to securely and directly exchange content, without sharing it
with corporations or other middlemen and 3rd party service providers.
In this direction, IPSX allows all the actors to participate in the internal economy of the
ecosystem and provides a way of supporting the decentralized vision, shared economy and
generating revenues. Of course, we will support and encourage the development of other
technologies, many of which have gained significant traction in recent years.
Better data-sharing technologies are necessary, and in order to allow data sharing in an open
and censorship free environment, the IPs are required, as the backbone of Internet protocols.
Taking into account the ongoing development of IPFS, Swarm and other solutions, the time for
fully decentralization seems to be within reach.
Eventually, the blockchain networks will become more scalable, more efficient, and will include
a fully functional network of micropayment channels. The IoT devices will become easier to
integrate and communicate with, and a larger volume of IPs will be available, thus allowing free
internet. This concept of free internet we not only mean it in terms of upfront payment, but also
free of all the restrictions, censorships, privacy thieves and sensitive, personal information data
buyers.
IPSX will provide the easiest way for users from all over the world to help the Internet in
becoming a fully decentralized and free of the actual less fair interests of different actors, by
sharing IPs in an easy and totally transparent way among worldwide users and providing the
fuel of truly decentralization for the Internet.

TECHNICAL APPROACH
In this section the technical approach will be presented. However, the more detailed technical
specifications will be released on design documentation that is currently under construction by
the technical team.

Actors
An actor of the IPSX system is represented by a trio which consists of:
- a human/bot administrator of the device that uses the IPSX system for offering or
requesting IPs. The lender of the IP is called “provider” and the user of the IP is called
“requester”;
- a Java Application/API that acts as an interface with the IPSX system. The JAVA
application will be built for all platforms and mobile devices and will run as a client on the
end user’s (actor) device;
- a third-party VPN Application which is used to instantiate VPN connections.
According to his role in instance, a user is of one of the two types:
- “Provider” User = a user who provides an IP or list of IPs by placing offer orders and by
instantiating a VPN server once a deal is done.
- “Requester” User = a user who benefits from an IP or list of IPs by placing request orders
and by instantiating a VPN client once a deal is done.
The identification data of a user consists of its unique IPSX wallet address. In other words, a
user is represented in the system by his IPSX wallet address.
The IPSX utility token will be a standard ERC20 token issued on ethereum blockchain, so any
ethereum account can be used as an identification data (ID).
Structure description: system layers:
IPSX system operates on three technological layers:
- On the Ethereum Layer, the Centralizer Smart Contracts will manage the wallets, the
profiles, the token balances. Also, we are analyzing the micro Raiden protocol for
micropayments at this layer.
- On the Application Layer, the IPSX Java App will implement the user interface and the
communication/synchronization with the Centralizer Smart Contract and the VPN
Application and it will also arrange the matching process and the deals.
Moreover, this IPSX Java App will ensure the management of the Service Layer by constant
communication on the IPSX pair channel between the partners of the deal.
- On the Service Layer, the VPN App is a third-party application used to instantiate VPN
connections between the actors.

www.ip.sx

Logical components of the Centralizer Smart Contract:
WALLET (ID) manages the IPSX token balance of the users and has a list of records with the
following structure:
– Id = the IPSX wallet address of the user
– Balance = the number of IPSX user-owned utility tokens that are available to his use for
placing request orders or just for simple transfers
– Reserved = the number of IPSX user-owned tokens that are reserved for ongoing deals
and future payments and that are not available to him at a defined moment for any other
operations.
JAVA application components:
PROFILES - manages the user profiles and has a list of records with the following structure:
– Id = the IPSX wallet address of the user
– Info = is a complex data structure that stores information about the user, including his
rating and general preferences/ settings/ criteria/ history.
ORDER BOOK - manages the offer/request orders received from users via the IPSX Java App.
It has two main components, namely the Offer Orders List (OOL) and the Request Orders List
(ROL). The offer orders received from the providers will be recorded in the OOL and the request
orders received from the requesters will be recorded in the ROL. Both OOL and ROL have the
following structure as lists of records:
– Id = the IPSX wallet address of the user who placed the order
– Order = the details of the order.
DEAL BOOK - manages the deals between users. More precisely, it manages the deals
between a provider who placed an offer order and a requester who placed a request offer in the
context of a previously identified matching between these orders. It has a list of records with the
following structure:
– ProviderId = the IPSX wallet address of the user who placed the offer order and will play
the role of a provider on the Service Level (in other words, the IPSX wallet address of the
“Provider” User)
– RequesterId = the IPSX wallet address of the user who placed the request order and will
play the role of a requester on the Service Level (in other words, the IPSX wallet address
of the “Requester” User)
– Deal = the details of the deal i.e. the combined data from the offer order and request order
– Status = the status of the deal. This status will be changed during the life cycle of the deal
according to the status/events received from the IPSX Java Apps of the actors involved
in that deal, based on an agreement protocol described in the next sections.
MATCHING - a function that identifies matches between offer orders and request orders and
instantiates a new deal that will be further placed in the DEAL BOOK, while asking the ORDER
BOOK to eliminate those orders from its offer/request list.
AGREEMENT PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTATION

www.ip.sx

11

This is a function that generates a deal status based on the provider status and requester status
received (or automatically assigned in special cases) from the actors of a deal.
The process description is presented in the design documentation which is currently under
construction and will be released on a future date.

IPSX UTILITY TOKEN (IPSX)
IPSX is a utility token based on the Ethereum technology, issued on ERC20 protocol and it will
be used as a unit of exchange between the actors of the IPSX ecosystem.
Also, IPSX will be used for commission payments to the platform for all the details that are
sealed inside the IPSX ecosystem.
The general conditions for using IPSX will be set in the terms and conditions that are currently
in process of creation and review by the legal and technical departments of the IPSX team.
The supply of IPSX utility tokens will be limited to the pool of tokens created during project
funding period and no other tokens will be issued on an advanced stage of the IPSX project life
cycle.
IPSX utility token creation
The IPSX is a token on Ethereum platform. Its design follows widely adopted token
implementation standards. This makes it easy to manage using existing solutions including
Ethereum Wallet.
Maximum number of tokens created during the crowdfunding period (updated on 29 th Jan 2018):
- Total: 1 800 000 000 (100%);
- Funding participants: 900 000 000 (50%);
- Incentives for early adopters and strategic partners 495 000 000 (27.5%);
- Bounty campaign 45 000 000 (2.5%);
- Team and strategic partners 360 000 000 (20%).

www.ip.sx

12

Sending 1 ether to the IPSX smart contract will create a predefined number of IPSX tokens
based on the ETH hard cap that will be set before token generation event.
No token creation, minting or mining after the funding period will be possible.
Tokens will be transferable once the funding is successfully completed (this needs to be agreed
on a future state).
Any tokens that will not be distributed during the funding period will be later on distributed to the
contributors proportionally to the amount contributed during the funding period.

FUNDING PERIOD
The funding period is the entire timeline used by the IPSX management team to secure funds
for the development of the IPSX ecosystem.
The funding period will be composed from multiple stages as follows:
1.Initial investment – this phase has already taken place and we, the founders of the IPSX
project, were the investors of this phase. We will describe on the roadmap how we used the
funds from this funding stage.
2.Private investment – this phase will start on November and will be open only to private and
accredited investors and also to strategic business partners.
There will be a minimum investment for this phase that will be revealed on a later stage and this
phase will be conducted on private and individual sessions.
3.Private pre-sale – this phase will be opened to early community members that will be willing
and able to pass a full KYC/AML process. Also, we are analyzing different partnerships with
presale platforms.

www.ip.sx

13

4.Public crowdsale – this is a very delicate phase and we will analyze it very seriously before
releasing any information about it.
As most of you know, the legal aspect is very important and sensitive on this subject and we do
not want to treat this in an easy and irresponsible way.
We will release an official position of the company on a blog post in the upcoming period.

USE OF FUNDS
Funds raised during the funding period will be used solely for the development and benefit of
the IPSX Ecosystem.
A more detailed distribution of the funds will be released in the upcoming days, along with the
new version (0.2) of the whitepaper draft, after a first round of reviews.
