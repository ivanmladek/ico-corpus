I. Abstract
In recent years, cosmetics and skincare (“beauty”) as an industry has blossomed and become a ubiquitous presence
throughout social media, communities, and commerce platforms. The global cosmetics market has been registering steady
annual growth of 3%, and in developing countries, (including China) the growth rate has been at 5% annually1; however,
within the market, hundreds of cosmetics companies have entered a zero-sum game with nearly identical product lines,
brand, and sales channels. Simply speaking, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find players that provide differentiated
and personalized services or products catering to individuals with tastes and qualities that are outside of the “average”
user. The focus on the “average” is ironic because beauty products tend to be one of the most polarizing products in terms
of user experience between different individuals, yet due to traditional marketing strategies, the overall industry has been
forced away from personalization to generalization and mass marketing, effectively functioning in a declining state of
innovation. In an attempt to solve this dilemma, cosmetic companies are perpetually seeking ‘innovative’ ideas that will
bring creative disruption to the traditional value chain, but in the absence of a marketplace or channels that provide
reliable consumer data and actionable data insights, such measures face an uphill battle.
At the other end of the market, consumers have to cope with different difficulties. As mentioned above, “cosmetics” is one
of the hottest buzzwords and industries regardless of gender, age, and nationality, and among such heated discussions,
customers face three major difficulties. First, it is difficult to distinguish real information from fake or manipulated
information as companies sponsor and fund most of the current cosmetics content and so-called “studies”. Secondly, only
a select few ‘power influencers’ are currently benefiting from pro-rata ownership or enjoying appropriate rewards for
their meticulous contribution to various platforms. Thirdly, cyber security has become a dire and pressing issue as the
amount of personal information shared throughout social media grows exponentially.
Cosmochain is a complementary Company-to-Consumer platform that connects cosmetics product users and content
creators to cosmetics product suppliers, including cosmetics companies, OEM/ODM manufacturers, R&D centers, and
distributors. Through this platform, the Cosmochain Team aims to solve the aforementioned unmet needs of both
companies and customers. All data collected from platform participants are kept confidential in this customer-centered
ecosystem. Those who contribute their scarce time and attention toward producing and curating contents for others are
compensated with tokens and receive pro-rata ownership of the contents they create. On the other hand, cosmetics
product suppliers are able to actualize a wide variety of “on-demand” services on the platform by utilizing API that
Cosmochain provides.
Two different tokens and one internal virtual index make up the Cosmochain ecosystem: 1) The first token is an externally
traded token called Cosmo Coin, 2) The second token as well as an index of contribution to the platform is Cosmo Power,
which can be used to make payment within the platform and given out as rewards for activities, and 3) The one virtual
index is called Cosmo Level. Cosmo Level, a reputation index, is designed to prevent abuse of power within the platform
and can only be accumulated by actual activities and contribution. Having been assigned distinct roles within the
Cosmochain platform, these three entities construct a healthy ecosystem.
●

The success of the Cosmochain platform lies in the active participation of users – where customers create
reliable data after trying out various cosmetics products and sharing the experience with one another on the
platform. As a result, Cosmochain has designed its own transparent and fair reward system based on Steemit’s
incentive model.

●

The Cosmochain platform connects this user-created data to interested company participants and distributes the
payment made by the company to customers as reward for use of the information. Through this reward system,
Cosmochain aims to address two structural issues of social media-based platforms: 1) risk of inflation following
the necessity of a long-term and great quantity of token issuance to grow the community, and 2) risk of
decreasing attractiveness of contribution rewards after the inflation rate has been stabilized.

●

In addition, the Cosmochain platform aims to realize an upgraded tokenization model that brings the power
back to its users by redistributing the following: (i) the right to display ads in a user’s viewing space, (ii) the

1 Euromonitor International report, predicted market growth between 2017 and 2021: Global 2.8%, China 5.4%

03

right to access a personally curated Marketplace, and (iii) the right to share personal data to partake in a study
or survey. Simply speaking, the Cosmochain platform will go beyond simply allowing users to share onedimensional personal information.
As such, Cosmochain serves the purpose of revolutionizing the cosmetics industry’s ecosystem by redistributing
ownership and management authority of personal cosmetics data and contents to those in need, and through operations
of transparent rewarding system for the redistribution of data.

II. Cosmetics Industry Trends
II-1. Key changes in the cosmetics industry
Over the last decade, the global cosmetics market grew steadily across product categories and regions to become a $500
billion market2 (in terms of retail value). In the future, the developed markets are expected to grow at a rate of 2-3%, and
developing markets (such as China, Southeast Asia, South America), are expected to grow at 5% or higher. At the same
time, some key trends have been spotted within the value chain of cosmetics. They lead to the conclusion that utilization
of “customer data and insight” is going to become a big factor in winning in this business.
1)

2)

3)

Planning & ideation: No more recycling of existing “success” formulas
Today’s cosmetics market can be characterized as a war of “differentiation”. In the past, whoever had the
strongest retail and sales channel always came out victorious; however, today’s winners are those that can grab
customers’ attention. Anyone who has purchased cosmetics for the past few years can immediately tell that one
can make thousands of combinations of cosmetics products in a single store, or one can find a single product that
can do all the features of toner, lotion, and cream. This is a huge change from the past because customers are
now trying to find products that they can customize for their specific skin conditions. As a result, today’s
cosmetics industry needs to do more than just manufacture high quality products; it has to have a precise
understanding of customer needs and putting them into product development.
Production: Personalization and micro-segmentation is the key
Customers’ preference towards “personalization” has already been proven in other industries. As a result, many
leading cosmetics companies are investing a significant amount of time and effort into manufacturing
personalized cosmetics products. Kiehl and Lancome are collecting skin data in stores and mix the ingredients
for customers on the spot. AmorePacific is using genetic analysis customers3 who visit stores in person.
However, this is not an effective way of personalization as this does not collect enough data within the short
period time, and many customers do not feel comfortable having their skin diagnosed in stores. As a result,
personalization in cosmetics is much slower, when compared to other industries.
Channel: Marketing/Sales switching to online channel & “marketing effectiveness” decreasing
Until the early 2000s, when the offline channel was the main sales channel, marketing efforts were primarily
focused on mass penetration and ATL (above the line - TV, Paper etc.) channel. Since late 2000s, where online
channel became the predominant sales channel, viral marketing has become a key while brand power has
become less important. For the first time, small to mid-sized cosmetics brands were able to participate in
marketing to a wider group of consumers. The ensuing online marketing battles caused each brand to spend
more and more of their revenue cost on marketing. When social media giants entered advertising from around
2010, the cosmetics companies’ most powerful marketing channel became the large social media channels (such
as Facebook). However, customers are now over-exposed to unwanted products, and as a result the cosmetics
companies’ ROAC (return on advertising costs) has been rapidly decreasing. Hence, improving ROAC through
effective targeting and content development has become a key driver in winning customers.

II-2. Market value and size of associated industries

As stated above, the cosmetics industry is a stably growing, highly attractive industry, and the growth is expected to
continue in the future as such growth is evenly distributed both geologically and categorically, rather than concentrated in
a certain region or product category.
-Global cosmetics market size history & forecast-

-Breakdown & growth of cosmetics market by region-

Desire for collection and sharing of beauty data, which the Cosmochain platform will provide, is prevalent amongst
various areas in the cosmetics market, and precise data mining and the ability to interpret or utilize data will become key
success factors for cosmetics companies to win in today’s highly sophisticated market. Global cosmetics companies are
spending billions of dollars to hire business consulting firms or big data analysis companies to collect and process beauty
related data, while small and medium-sized companies are working with survey companies to collect necessary data.

There are numerous examples that prove the effectiveness of data mining: ‘Beauty by Design’ and ‘Curology’ in the US
market, and ‘Huiseoul Inc.’ in the Chinese market. The aforementioned companies not only connected customers with
beauty consultants but collected dermatologic data from customers by receiving skin images, going through personal

05

consultation sessions, and conducting surveys in order to provide customized cosmetics and skincare solutions. As a
result, they achieved rapid business growth and accumulated millions of customers in terms of Monthly Active Users
(MAU). As another example, ‘Function of beauty,’ a big data based customized shampoo manufacturer founded in 2015,
has proven the value of innovation in manufacturing by reaching a value of $150 million in two years. In the perspectives
of companies, business operations based on such data mining have minimized the manufacture of unnecessary products,
reduced marketing expense, offered customized solutions, and provided excellent services based on customer data;
companies are now able to eliminate inefficiencies that were once considered almost inevitable.
Also, it is important to take a closer look at how customers collect information and utilize sales channels. Social media
services, online shopping malls, and online blogs are the main information sources of female customers in their 20s to 40s,
and their annual growth rate is at 3%. On the other hand, the growth rate of the sales channels is somewhat evenly
distributed; drugstores are the leading sales channels followed by brand shops, social commerce, and the open market.
This means that the data collecting points are going bimodal in that how customers collect information and where
customers actually purchase cosmetics are different. Efforts to mine collective data are made by big data experts or
keyword extraction algorithm builders, but this kind of collection of scattered data is inevitable given the lack of a unified
platform to provide data in a user-friendly manner to the final decision makers (i.e. the customers). Although companies
are trying to solve this problem by merging the commerce platform and social media platform, customers are not yet fully
satisfied with such platforms that blur the primary and secondary functions.
Lastly, relaxation of government regulation will promote the expansion of “customized” cosmetics. It is a well-known fact
that providing personalized products are a global trend, from fashion or lifestyle industries to industries that were once
considered impossible to personalize such as electronics or furniture. On the other hand, the cosmetics industry has been
progressing slowly due to Food and Drugs Administration’s strict regulations. The Korean government, starting from the
year of 2016, finally relaxed government regulation and extended support for cosmetics; such change initiated the move of
the Korean cosmetics industry, the hub of cosmetics manufacturing, towards personalization. As Korea already possesses
global leading manufacturers with state-of-the-art technology, and as the government relaxes regulations, Korea-based
Cosmochain will create a synergy effect within the Cosmochain platform in that it will connect technology and global
trends. In this way, the value of data will also increase.
As such, the primary reason for collecting beauty data within the Cosmochain platform is not limited to a particular area
of the cosmetics industry but to bring creative innovations to the entire value chain.

III. Cosmochain’s Service Architecture

06

Cosmochain’s architecture is made up of three layers – the database, platform, and application layers. All information
created and shared within the platform are managed securely by the blockchain, all individual customers and participants
can exercise ownership and management right of their own content, and all platform users can receive compensation
when data and content are shared with company participants. Also, participating companies are able to provide a wide
variety of “on-demand” services on the platform by utilizing API that Cosmochain provides.

-Cosmochain’s service architecture-

III-1. Platform layer
The platform layer is a core layer in the Cosmochain service architecture, where customer-provided data is stored on the
blockchain and delivered to companies as business solutions. The platform layer has two components: ‘Cosmochain
Community’ for customers and ‘Cosmochain Solutions’ for companies. ‘Cosmochain Community’ is a place where
customers can talk about cosmetics and beauty and create various contents. Through this activity, customers can receive
rewards in a transparent manner for any beauty insights they provide. The data provided can be effectively linked to
participating companies as ‘Company Solutions’, which can be used by such companies.

III-1-1. ‘Cosmochain Community’
This is the most essential part of Cosmochain’s service where all insights for the participating companies are generated.
Unlike other social media where commercial, unsolicited and mass-oriented content can be overwhelming, Cosmochain

07

aims to create a community where objective and useful information is shared and communicated. In order to realize this
goal, a precisely designed reward system must exist in exchange for valuable contents creation and curation activities.
Therefore, Cosmochain has decided to utilize blockchain and apply Steemit’s model, which is known to have successfully
achieved decentralization and has proven its effectiveness in social media platform to design its own reward system for
‘Cosmochain Community’. Customers can participate in ‘Cosmochain Community’ through content creation (writing
posts, uploading videos) and curation activities (voting up or down to other users’ posts) – both of which can result in
‘rewards’ according to the reward scheme.

III-1-2. ‘Cosmochain Solutions’
In addition to ‘Cosmochain Community’, the Cosmochain platform provides various solutions in which companies can
participate and use the data of participating customers. Below are the core values of the Cosmochain platform.
1) The Cosmochain platform will provide five different solutions to company participants. Each company
participant will pay fees for using data provided by Cosmochain’s customer participants.
2) If a company utilizes information provided or created by customers, the company rewards the customers (the
information providers) through the blockchain in a completely transparent manner. For business models that
self-creates extra values using such information, both the platform and data providers shall share rewards in
order to continue the improvement of the platform.

-Cosmochain’s solution map-

Solution 1. Collect and manage customer data and allow option to share data
The essence of the Cosmochain platform is the collection and management of data using blockchain technology, and the
key data here is each customer’s basic demographic information, and also cosmetics-specific data such as skin type. Such
personal data are used only within the Cosmochain platform and are selectively filled out by customers and also

08

customers can also set a level of how much data will be shared with others. For companies, they can compensate the
customers who agree to share their data with rewards.
Access to such customer data is revolutionary – it can change the rules of the game and transform the beauty business
model. As discussed in “II. Cosmetics Industry Trends”, core competency in product excellence is key as customers become
more educated and selective in choosing the products. However, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to secure the
essential input data using current sources such as each company’s limited customer pool. If companies are able to obtain
customers’ dermatological data, such data will become an essential input of product ideation and production. This will
pave the way for mass-customization of cosmetics products, which all cosmetics companies regard as the ideal goal.
From a data security perspective, implementing blockchain will help eliminate any concern over of personal data leak and
other related security concerns.
Solution 2. Micro-pooling of relevant customers
Companies’ acquisition of customer data within the platform provides an increased level of convenience, as companies
can use the data as a reliable source of customer opinions and ideas for tests and surveys. Currently, when cosmetics
companies want to hear from the public, they can only (i) use existing customer pool, (ii) randomly select people with
specific characteristics through agencies, or (iii) spend a long period of time to find relevant subjects. Due to the
importance of receiving feedback from the right people, companies often spend more time and effort finding the target
than carrying out actual testing and analyzing the opinions. In the past, this inefficiency was simply regarded as
inevitable.
Currently, the so-called “agencies” act as a bridge between cosmetics companies and customers, connecting the customers
with the target characteristics to the companies in need. In fact, these agencies cause even greater inefficiencies – increased
time, higher cost, and lack of accuracy in discovering the right sample customers. In the Cosmochain platform, companies
do not need to spend time and effort to find the right testing subjects, and there is no agency necessary as customers with
the right characteristics voluntarily respond to companies’ surveys and test requests in return for a small amount of
rewards – a mutually beneficial relationship.
Solution 3. Provide personalized ads based on customer activity analysis
Today’s online and mobile ads, both random and personalized, have a great deal of inefficiency. First, the right to display
ads belongs to the platform (website, app etc.) owner; therefore, if there are ads within a platform, all visitors are exposed
to watching unwanted ads. Second, the effectiveness of ads is questionable as today’s online and mobile ads simply show
ads related to what the visitors already clicked in the past. As a result, users are willing to pay for services like YouTube
Red or other ad-blocking apps in order to avoid watching unwanted or annoying ads.
In the Cosmochain platform, customers have the option to watch or block ads within the platform and at the same time,
rewards are given to customers who agree to watch ads. Also, the Cosmochain platform provides data and customer
insights from customers’ behavior within the Cosmochain platform, which can be used as input for personalized ads – this
allows companies to show ads that have the highest chance of being converted into actual purchase. This ¾nefits both
customers and companies by providing the customers convenience discretion to watch or block ads, and by eliminating
participating companies’ unnecessary advertising costs.
Solution 4. Operating personalized commerce within the platform
Cosmochain will operate personalized commerce to allow customers to be exposed to their most desired products and
allow companies to display and sell products with the highest click-to-purchase conversion rate. The key advantage of
Cosmochain’s commerce feature is that the personalization is based on real information from Cosmochain’s customers.
Even Google and Amazon’s most advanced personalization engine can only be based on highly accurate assumptions
using customer analysis to guess at the customers’ information – this is still not the same as using real information which
is difficult to acquire in the first place. However, Cosmochain will implement both real data and customer analysis,
allowing it to achieve higher accuracy than any other existing algorithm. Another advantage is that the more customers
agree to share their personal data and the more customers participate in the Cosmochain platform, the faster the accuracy
and effectiveness of personalized commerce will improve.
Solution 5. Providing big data-analyzed customer insight

09

Lastly, the Cosmochain platform provides multidimensional customer insight by analyzing all information and actions of
its customers. Simply speaking, it is possible to convert every community activity, such as blog posts, creating content,
shopping etc., into usable data. For example, it is possible to analyze a customer’s vote up or vote down activity to analyze
what the customer likes, or extract keywords from a popular blog post. This creates synergy with the already provided
customer data, and in the end, this will result in customer insights which have never before been available.

III-1-3. How the Cosmochain platform is operated
The Cosmochain platform provides a user-friendly UI in order for users to easily participate in company-sponsored
projects.

Five key features of the Cosmochain platform from a user’s perspective are as follows:
1. Social media as a community
●
User can freely upload or view content like social media, and other users can vote, write comments or repost in
their personal page. Each uploading of content is regarded as a contribution to the Cosmochain platform, and
responses from other users will be evaluated automatically by a specific algorithm, which will decide how much
Cosmo Power (usable tokens within the platform) or Cosmo Level (reputation index) will be rewarded.
Customers who consumed content can receive rewards for their curation efforts.
2. Participating in company-sponsored projects
●
In addition to the basic information provided by platform participants, companies can initiate sponsored
projects when in need of extra data, surveys or tests. In the “Project” tab, users can see the current list of
sponsored projects, Cosmo Power to be rewarded, qualifications to participate and other relevant information.
Individuals should use their Cosmo Power as deposit to participate. Companies can select which individuals to
execute the project with, and companies can predict reliability level of participants based on the amount of
Cosmo Power or Cosmo Level held by candidates. After successful execution of a project, agreed amount of
Cosmo Power shall be rewarded to participating individuals. Amount of Cosmo Power can be adjusted through
mutual evaluation of the project, and amount of Cosmo Level rewarded will be automatically calculated.

3. Commerce features for shopping (Marketplace)
●
The Cosmochain platform offers Marketplace, where participating companies can sell their products. When a
transaction is made, payment is made by Cosmo Power, and companies can either convert it into Cosmo Coin
(Token) and then into cash (fiat money) or use Cosmo Power freely within the Cosmochain platform. Customers
can use cash and Cosmo Power combined to buy and companies receive cash and Cosmo Power combined. As a
result, Cosmo Power paid by customers are internally vested as Cosmo Coin, and companies receive Cosmo

010

Coins, or cash (through an exchange solution within the platform) immediately products (more details in IV.
Cosmochain’s Token Model).
4. Data submission
●
Participating customers provide personal dermatological and cosmetics-related data, and whenever companies
access the uploaded data, customers receive preassigned amount of Cosmo Power. This means companies can
access the data of customers who agreed to share their personal data, and in return companies pay customers
the agreed amount of Cosmo Power.
●
The “data submission” tab of the Cosmochain platform contains 1) Demographic information: personal data
such as name, gender, birthday, region etc., 2) Dermatological and cosmetics-related information: actual photos
of skin and types of products recently used, 3) New product registration – details of products not yet registered
on Cosmochain’s database, 4) Purchase data: list of products purchased within and outside of the Cosmochain
platform. Customers receive Cosmo Power for submission of data, and they can set the level of what data to
make accessible. Companies can perform big data analysis to draw customer insights.
5. Personal account management including Cosmo Coin / Cosmo Power conversion, and provision of platform
information
●
Since it is essential for the Cosmochain platform to encourage users to create valuable data and create cosmeticsrelated contents to receive rewards for their contribution, separate ‘My Cosmo Power’ and “My Cosmo Level”
sections have been created. The right-hand side tab features ‘personal account management’, ‘provide platform
information’ ‘FAQ’ and other tools that assist in the smooth operation of the platform. In this section, customers
can convert/exchange tokens used in the Cosmochain platform, purchase Cosmo Coin, read FAQs, and refer to
any other useful information. Developers can access Cosmochain’s API information, which will allow them to
develop a decentralized application and contribute to the platform as a part of the ecosystem.

III-2. Database layer
In today’s so-called Industry 4.0 era of information and communications technologies (ICT), high costs are involved in
receiving and processing meaningful data, and there are always questions regarding reliability. Cosmochain designed a
full database layer using blockchain as its core technology in order to take full advantage of data integrity, nonrepudiation, no network fees, and other inherent benefits.

011

III-2-1. Selection of base blockchain
The Cosmochain Team is spending a considerable amount of time and efforts to research various blockchain protocols for
smooth operations of the Cosmochain platform. There are two requirements for selecting the blockchain protocol for the
Cosmochain platform: 1) Transaction fee must be minimal - due to the nature of the Cosmochain platform, most activities
within the platform require high storage space and frequency of utilization, and if each transaction requires fees, the
platform will not be sustainable, and 2) network processing power must be able to handle all transactions simultaneously
– the nature of community requires transaction power of at least 1,000 TPS. The Cosmochain Team will continue to
evaluate technical requirements and feedbacks from users before development and completion of the Cosmochain
platform.

III-2-2. Data classification for the access-restricted
All information within the platform can be divided into public and private, depending on the contributor’s intention, and
Cosmochain has decided to follow the naming rule of access modifier.
In the middle is the information used for transaction on the platform, and this data can vary from simple demographic
info to actual pictures and videos of skin condition, areas of interest etc. Cosmochain classified this as “protected-on” and
depending upon the user’s choice, it is possible to switch to ‘protected-off’ and this data is fully encrypted. Key values are
saved within blockchain and encrypted values are stored outside of blockchain. Deciding on the scope of information
selection (switching on/off of information) is a key item for consideration. Internally, the Cosmochain Team will build
global data fabric and execute ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) on the large set of data on the web, analyze the
rapidly changing key factors of the cosmetics business, and finally establish the platform as a destination to decide
whether to provide information to the next platform user.

012

III-2-3. Storage policy
According to Google, visitors will leave the website if the page does not load within 3 seconds; thus, keeping the
blockchain body light and securing high service speed. Except for publicly-stored text type data, all data will be encrypted
with only hash stored as private key within blockchain, and value data will be securely stored in Amazon S3. Cosmochain
also considered IPFS (Interplanetary File System); but concluded other problems may rise as all “protected-on” can be
decrypted. Cosmochain will provide various security/certification such as HIPAA/HITECH, Fed Ramp, and will use
Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the main external database as AWS offers tools for big data analytics. Public data is
stored in data space within blockchain and in decoded area within storage and will be made public to everyone. Private
data can only be accessed by the specific user as the data is stored in the encrypted area within storage. Upon users’
request, data can be exchanged between encrypted and decoded spaces.

III-2-4. API and other infrastructure overview

013

Cosmochain Team will provide an API that not only runs results of internally cleansed data, but also provides search
engine features that allow the customers to perform queries scoped to various levels of privacy. In addition, this API will
also be able to run various on-demand services on the platform and will consider provision of SDK in the future. The end
goal of the development will be to surface all of these functionalities as an easy-to-use API for developers to consume.
Cosmochain must have Multi-contract/Multi-state interface as the platform will be based on web and mobile. Following
specified ‘Smart Contract’, the flow will follow below infrastructure components. Essentially, NoSQL-based Light DB
(such as MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra) will be built in order to accommodate data variation, conducting cache within EC2
Server, and the main data will be encrypted and stored in S3 server. Therefore, below infrastructure design will allow
powerful big data analysis (such as AWS Big Data Solutions).

III-3. Application layer
Cosmochain’s application layer allows company participants to develop various solutions and applications within the
Cosmochain platform, and this will help generate new ideas from all participating parties. Although not implemented yet,
following use cases based on Cosmochain are possible:
Use case #1) Personalized product development
●
Gather ideas from customers with similar skin types and cosmetics needs, and produce personalized products
by customizing the product solution
Use case #2) Big data-based shopping navigator
●
Perform big data analysis on customer data and guide the customers through the recommended products based
on their skin type/nationality/country/age

014

IV. Cosmochain’s Token Model
Three different asset classes make up the Cosmochain ecosystem: two tokens managed by the blockchain (Cosmo Coin /
Cosmo Power), and a third in-platform index (Cosmo Level) for expressing the contribution level within the platform.

●

Cosmo Coin: Cosmo Coin is the primary medium of economic activity and exchange within the Cosmochain
platform. To companies, Cosmo Coin is used as a means of payment for utilizing various solutions within the
Cosmochain platform. To individual users, Cosmo Coin is used as a means to purchase Cosmo Power necessary
for in-platform activities, and acts as a medium of exchange to convert Cosmo Power acquired from activities
into other currencies.

●

Cosmo Power: ‘Cosmo Power’ can be obtained by conversion from Cosmo Coins or through community
contributions (e.g. posting reviews, voting up and down posts), and it represents level of contribution to the
platform. Therefore, Cosmo Power can be used as an index of influence within the community (which
determines how much reward will be given) and when acquired or purchased Cosmo Power can be used to
purchase products within the Cosmochain platform’s Marketplace. Depending on the level of contribution,
Cosmo Power holders are provided with “Activity Credits”. Users who wish to tokenize Cosmo Power have the
option to convert Cosmo Power to Cosmo Coin through a 30-day vesting period.

●

Cosmo Level: Cosmo Level is an indicator and measure of a user’s contribution to the Cosmochain community.
Cosmo Level is determined by the total amount of Cosmo Power accrued in a moving time window. Cosmo
Level cannot be purchased by Cosmo Coin or converted from Cosmo Power – it can only be accumulated
through activities within the platform. Depreciation is applied to Cosmo Level through exponentially weighted
moving average (EWMA), which encourages active platform activities.
-Cosmochain’s token mechanism-

IV-1. Cosmo Power

015

Cosmo Power is the level of influence a user can yield within the Cosmochain platform. For those who are familiar with
the Steemit platform, Cosmo Power is conceptually analogous to Steem Power (SP) in this respect.
[Acquisition of Cosmo Power]
There are two ways to acquire Cosmo Power as platform participants.
1) Through active participation inside the Cosmochain platform: A platform participant can acquire Cosmo
Power by sharing his/her personal cosmetics usage history and derma-related information, creating or sharing
digital content on the platform, and exercising voting rights on content and interactions on the platform. Below
are specific activities from which customers can earn Cosmo Power:
l

l

l

1.1) Providing personal information and agreeing to utilization of personal information: In this scenario,
a participant simply provides his/her personal and dermatological information by filling out a template
guided by the platform. The data provided by participants will be securely stored in an encrypted and
decentralized format, keeping the sensitive and personal information safely. However, the number of
Cosmo Power awarded will depend on the level of detail and validity of the information provided.
Participants can set the level of access to their personal information by subject, and exercise complete
ownership and management rights of their data. Companies willing to utilize this information can
access the information only at the level of access set by the participants. If companies wish to access
information beyond the set level of access, they can request for additional access or ask for more
information, to which participants who received the request may choose to accept or decline the request.
1.2) Creating contents: Participants can acquire Cosmo Power by creating contents (posts or videos) or
through curation activities (i.e. voting) on the contents within the platform. Detailed reward scheme will
be defined by Steemit’s reward system as a reference. Contents created by users are evaluated through
voting from other participants in the platform and are rewarded according to the received votes.
1.3) Voting: Participants evaluate contents by voting them up and down. This is an important form of
contribution for ensuring the quality of the platform; therefore, participants who vote up or down
contents will be rewarded with Cosmo Power accordingly.

2) Converting Cosmo Coin to Cosmo Power: The platform also provides the option to convert 1 Cosmo Coin to
1 Cosmo Power. The conversion is effective immediately.
[Use of Cosmo Power]
1) Cosmo Power equates voting influence in the community: Participants get votes in proportion to their
Cosmo Power holdings. Voting power derived from Cosmo Power holdings can be used to curate high-quality
contents through voting and this contribution is rewarded with Cosmo Power.
2) Cosmetics purchase in the Marketplace: Participants can purchase cosmetics in the Marketplace using Cosmo
Power.
3) Conversion to Cosmo Coin: Cosmo Power can be converted to Cosmo Coin upon request from both
participants and companies. After a 30-day vesting period of request, Cosmo Power will be converted to Cosmo
Coin. The prime motivation for having this vesting period in place is to encourage long-term holding of Cosmo
Power, which is essential to sustainable growth of the Cosmochain platform. The vesting period also serves as an
effective deterrence against short-term arbitrage opportunities and a buffer to react to any unforeseen
circumstances.
4) Acquisition of Cosmo Coin through long-term holding of Cosmo Power: Cosmo Power represents influence
within the community and holding Cosmo Power for a long period is regarded as contribution to platform
through community activities. Cosmo Power holders will receive a certain amount of Activity Credits based on
their Cosmo Level, which is given according to the level of contribution to the platform.
IV-2. Cosmo Coin

016

Cosmo Coin is a token that participants can trade with each other and can be transferred outside of the platform. Cosmo
Coin provides a medium of monetary reward for users’ contribution to the platform.
Cosmo Coin is also used for other functionalities built on the platform. Companies pay for sponsored projects and ads in
Cosmo Coin. Also, Cosmo Coin can be used by companies to receive as payment from the Marketplace transactions.
IV-3. Inflation
The inflation rate of Cosmo Coin will initially be set at 10% for the first year of initial token sales and decrease by 30% (of
the previous inflation rate in percent) every year. Inflation rates for Y5, will be approximately 2.5%, and from Y11 (2028)
onwards, the rate will be fixed at 0.5%. A portion of newly issued coins will be provided to Cosmo Power holders as
Activity Credits based on their Cosmo Level.
As such, Cosmochain plans to stabilize inflation faster than other comparable social media platforms on blockchain,
including Steemit. This plan is based on the condition that circulation of tokens that exceeds customers’ demands occurs
through solutions provided within the platform, which means the platform does not need to issue an infinite number of
new tokens to reward customers for their contribution through activities. Liquidity of tokens is established through
following mechanisms: i) a Marketplace through which customers can directly purchase companies’ products with Cosmo
Power, and ii) operation of Coin Pool, which stores tokens for in-platform transactions.
IV-4. Coin Pool
The Cosmochain platform’s Coin Pool exists to enhance token liquidity between users and companies within the platform.
The Coin Pool is replenished as follows:
1) Inflation: 20% of newly issued Cosmo Coin will be stored in the Coin Pool.
2) Revenue from businesses: Upon customers’ approval, the Cosmochain platform will provide mechanisms for
companies to display advertisements within the platform. Also, companies will be able to carry out companysponsored projects, such as customer surveys, product tests or focus group interviews. Cosmo Coins used as
payments for these services will be stored in the Coin Pool.
The Coin Pool will be consumed as follows:
1) Payouts to participants: Platform users who view ads on the platform and participate in company-sponsored
projects will be paid by converting Cosmo Coins from the Coin Pool to Cosmo Power.
2) Providing discounts in the Marketplace: Platform users will receive benefits in the Marketplace based on the
amount of Cosmo Power held (or Cosmo Level), and the discount benefits will be funded from the Coin Pool.
3) Operating costs: Operating costs for maintaining a healthy platform and its ecosystem will be funded from the
Coin Pool.

IV-5. Reputation model based on Cosmo Level
Cosmo Level is designed to guarantee a more objective platform activity reputation than Cosmo Power, which can be
purchased. Cosmo Level assigned to an individual customer or company is proportional to the amount of Cosmo Power
acquired as contribution rewards from platform participation.
[Exponentially Weighted Moving Average of Cosmo Level]
Contribution to community is calculated as [Amount of Cosmo Power held * 0.25 + Time-depreciated Cosmo Level * 0.75],
and depreciated contribution of Cosmo Level is calculated as below. Period of observation is 6 months. α=0.25. The value
of α may change after testing processes to find the value that returns lowest MSE (Mean Squared Error). 𝐶𝐿# refers to the
Cosmo Level at a given time t, and 𝑆# refers to the converted value of Cosmo Level by EMWA.
𝑆# = 𝛼𝐶𝐿# + (1 − 𝛼)𝑆#,[Cosmo Level loyalty system5]
Cosmo Level categorizes both individual customers and companies into three levels based on loyalty, and following benefits
will be given. Number of customers/companies in each class level will be divided by the ratio of 10:20:70, and loyalty level
will be assigned every week at 00:00, Monday KST.

IV-6. Marketplace
A key feature of Cosmochain is the Marketplace. The Cosmochain Marketplace provides the opportunity for companies to
acquire Cosmo Coins without directly purchasing Cosmo Coins. As the platform grows, more companies will be willing
to participate as sales through Cosmochain’s Marketplace will provide benefits such as lower costs, targeted sales etc.
IV-7. In-depth contemplation of the token model
1) Why does Cosmochain’s ecosystem need two types of tokens (Cosmo Coin / Cosmo Power) as well as one extra virtual index
(Cosmo Level) to measure reputation level?
Success of the Cosmochain platform stems from long-term commitment of participants to the community. Cosmo
Power promotes long-term commitment through the vesting schedule, and this model has been proven through
Steemit. Short-term users will hold Cosmo Coin, while long-term users will hold Cosmo Power, taking extra advantage
of extra voting power or greater discounts within the Marketplace.
The Cosmochain platform can self-sustain by creating a semi “closed loop value chain” that connects valuable
community-created data to companies who can use the data for product improvement and by redistributing its value
back to the customers as rewards. If users were rewarded with a currency that could be liquidated immediately, they
would not be able to participate from a long-term perspective. By introducing Cosmo Power to the ecosystem,
Cosmochain induces participants to be long-term users by providing reasons to hold Cosmo Power and by setting a 30day vesting period for liquidation. However, Cosmo Power can also be purchased by capital, and platform
recommends long-term holding of Cosmo Power by providing (Activity Credits); therefore, amount of Cosmo Power
by itself may not be an accurate evaluation tool to measure contribution. Therefore, the Cosmochain platform has
implemented Cosmo Level to the operations of the platform, which is a pure reputation index that can be accumulated
only by actually contributing to the platform through activities.
2) How is reward rate of Cosmo Power designed?
Amount of Cosmo Power to be rewarded, which is provided to the customers for their contributing activities, is
designed with the following as key inputs:
1)

2)

Community contribution: Rewards for posts are distributed from the coin inflation in proportion to the votes
they receive. 80% of the reward is distributed to the author of the post, and the remaining 20% of the reward is
distributed among the curators (i.e. participants who voted on the post) in proportion to the votes they have
given.6
Revenue from companies: Activities such as data submission, project participation and ad views are subject to
extra rewards provided by the platform. Weights (proportion) of allocation of Cosmo Power follows expected
customer demands by categories. As a result, amount of Cosmo Power rewarded for each activity may fluctuate
due to short term activity demands; however, the platform will be designed to prevent inversion of relative
values of each activity.

-ICO schedule and bonus scheme-

l

Above ICO schedule & bonus scheme are subject to change with prior notice depending on company policy.

Issuance of Cosmo Coin is to support the development of the Cosmochain platform, and the economic ecosystem
surrounding the platform, and one can participate in the ICO using Ethereum (ETH). The total number of Cosmo Coins
issued to ICO participants will equal to 50%7 of initial token distribution. 20% of total initial token distribution will be
distributed towards partners of the platform for acceleration of activities, 10% will be used as Reserve for the purpose of
developing and support economic ecosystem of the Cosmochain platform, another 10% will be allocated to Cosmochain
Team, and the remaining 10% will be distributed to Advisory and early stage investors.
Tokens that participants purchase through the ICO are the same as tokens consumable in the Cosmochain platform once
the platform development is completed. As early participants to the Cosmochain’s ecosystem, the participating companies
will have the opportunity to utilize Cosmochain’s solutions (that are more economical than existing marketing tools) first,

7 This number may be increased up to 60% due to bonus, but total token supply will not be changed.

and the participating users are expected to be able to exercise greater influence through a more convenient acquisition of
Cosmo Power.
V-2. Instructions for ICO
The Cosmo Coin ICO will be done through an Ethereum smart contract. ICO participants will be able to purchase Cosmo
Coins by transferring Ethereum directly to the Ethereum Wallet Address that Cosmochain provides. Cosmo Coins will be
automatically allocated to the contributors’ Ethereum Wallet, if the transfer is properly completed. Cosmochain Team will
further provide detailed instructions for participating in the Cosmo Coin ICO through its official website.
V-3. Post-ICO funds implementation plan
Funds collected through the ICO process will be used as follows:
Use
Details
Platform R&D
The Cosmochain platform plans to bring many technological innovations throughout
the entire value chain of cosmetics industry. The Cosmochain Team plans to further
develop: 1) a “standardized solution” by utilizing customers’ image data, 2) a big
data analysis algorithm based on machine learning of merging structured and
unstructured information, and 3) acceleration of user interface and user experience
that meet the requirements of the rapidly changing characteristics of beauty industry
customers.
Server operation and
The most important keys to successfully operating the decentralized systems are the:
maintenance
1) node operating system, and 2) security of external architecture that is linked to the
blockchain. In terms of node operating system, the system needs to either fulfill the
necessary conditions of the computing power system (40+ Core, 100+MB Bandwidth)
in response to PoW or purchase large amounts of coins to meet the condition of
PoS/DPoS. Besides the blockchain’s ledger, areas linked to other system are
vulnerable to processing/flowing/storing data. In this case, the modification of the
architecture is necessary depending on the development of the hardware and security
technology in order to provide the best performance and services.
Building partnerships
Building partnerships with industry leading cosmetics companies is necessary for the
Cosmochain platform’s long-term and stable growth. Thus, the Cosmochain Team is
actively seeking for partnerships around the world. Such partnerships include ‘image
deep-learning software companies,’ ‘multi-channel networks,’ ‘global cosmetics
distributors,’ and ‘cosmetics community management companies.’
Marketing & operating
Since the beauty community is extremely competitive, the Cosmochain Team will
expense
invite active content creators or users from existing platforms such as ‘Instagram,’
‘YouTube,’ and ‘Blogs.’ This will result in a considerable amount of initial advertising
and marketing costs.

V-5. Risks that ICO participants should consider
All ICO participants should be fully aware of the risks listed below in related to the construction of the Cosmochain
platform before purchasing Cosmo Coins.
1) Risk related to the beauty industry
The beauty industry is a highly competitive market due to its high trend sensitivity and low barriers of entry. Also,
the cosmetics market is highly volatile in that it is strictly controlled by regulations of the Food and Drug
Administration. Thus, there are risks of new regulations banning beauty platform businesses, data marketplace,
or sharing of personal information. This may result in unexpected outcomes such as low participation levels of
both companies and customers or limitations in platform operations.
2) Risk related to blockchain technology and the blockchain industry
Government regulation is not clearly stated at the time of this whitepaper’s release, and new regulations may
partially limit or ban the construction of the Cosmochain platform and ecosystem.
3) Risk related to ICO participation
Participating in the Cosmochain ICO may be banned depending on ICO participants’ nationalities and according
to their respective countries’ regulations.

Vision for platform growth: Cosmochain Team would like to propose the following roadmap in order to quickly organize
and stabilize Cosmochain’s economic ecosystem. Please note that the roadmap below is in regard to the operation of the
Cosmochain platform prior to stabilization, and the Cosmochain Team’s endeavor is for the platform to achieve full
autonomy and decentralization once stabilization is complete.
1. Growth of the business model

023

First, the Cosmochain Team will recruit individuals that can actively participate in the Cosmochain platform and secure
their data. This activates the “data submission” feature of the platform, and this is the area which Cosmochain shall
address through marketing efforts in different target countries. For the early supply of data in the initial phase of business,
the Cosmochain Team will partner with cosmetics companies that already have cosmetics databases in the target
countries, in order to merge them into the Cosmochain’s database. At the same time, Cosmochain will release the social
network service, the biggest feature of the platform, within six months of the ICO in order to recruit more platform
participants and continue to offer competitive services and drive business growth by further enhancing the accumulated
data.
Particularly for the case of Huiseoul Inc., a Chinese K-Beauty mobile commerce company which finalized a partnership
agreement with the Cosmochain Team, Cosmochain and Huiseoul Inc., will cooperate to complete migration of Huiseoul
Inc.’s entire customer pool and customer data by Q3 of 2018. Huiseoul Inc. is already offering a data-based product
recommendation solution; therefore, transfer and integration of the data on the ‘blockchain’ will likely be seamless.
Through this partnership, the Cosmochain platform plans to offer service to customers in China and Korea by Q4 of 2018
with the Soft Launch of the platform.
With enough advanced data and a pool of participants, the Cosmochain Team will cooperate with companies that want to
take part in this constructive revolution of the cosmetics industry using the Cosmochain’s database and prove that this
new concept of the economic ecosystem is indeed effective. This service includes sharing database with participating
companies, company-sponsored projects, micro-segmented marketing and establishing personalized sales channel –
basically, all business models that Team expect to bring to the world. The innovative services that the Cosmochain
platform will provide are designed to address unmet needs of today’s cosmetics companies, and it has already been
proven elsewhere that these could be solved using blockchain technology. It is at this point that the Cosmochain Team
expects the cosmetics companies to be willing to enter private sales on the platform.
When company-sponsored projects enter the soft stage on the Cosmochain’s economic ecosystem, companies around the
world will be willing to join the platform, which will result in a further development of the Cosmochain’s API Layer.
Using API provided by the Cosmochain Team, many companies are expected to develop and offer differentiated services
releasing DApp (Decentralized Application), and in the course of this service development, the Cosmochain platform can
generate even greater business opportunities and value creation.

2. Regional and global expansion
In order to grow the platform and build an economic ecosystem, Cosmochain will gradually expand its business to
countries based on their respective strategic importance.
The first global market that Cosmochain will target is China – a top priority country both in terms of cosmetics market
size and growth rate. In fact, the Cosmochain Team has already signed MOUs with a number of cosmetics-related
companies in China and received content on the supply of their customers’ data. Currently, the Cosmochain Team is
testing the process of migrating data to the Cosmochain platform. In addition to the Chinese market, Cosmochain will
target the Korean market at the same time, one of the most dynamically changing and trend-leading cosmetics markets in
the world. Although the Korean market is very mature with the second highest cosmetics-industry-to-GDP rate, the
country’s cosmetics market is still growing quickly at an annual growth rate of 6%. In addition, with the highest internet
connectivity and smartphone penetration rates, Korea is a strategically high priority market for the platform. Cosmochain
aims to secure sufficient high-quality data from China and Korea by the end of 2018. By the first half of 2019, Cosmochain
plans to execute company-sponsored projects within the Cosmochain platform.
Starting in the second half of 2019, Cosmochain will expand even further to Japan and other ASEAN countries, the
Americas, Europe and Oceania. The $23.8 billion Japanese market and the so-called “post-China” ASEAN region with
more than 630 million people will be the next target for Cosmochain both for scale and growth. Especially, the ASEAN
cosmetics market is projected grow at more than 10% until 2020, and online commerce is growing even faster at 22%
annually. The American (US) market is the largest cosmetics market which accounts for approximately 20% of global
revenues are made. Using the American market as a starting point, Cosmochain will look towards Brazil (4th largest
market) and other markets in the Americas. Into the 2020s, Cosmochain plans to expand to Europe and Oceana.
