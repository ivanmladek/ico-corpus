ABSTRACT

INFORMATION is exchanged for money daily
throughout the world, but the current tools to do
so are cumbersome, costly, and inefficient.

K

NOWLEDGE SEEKERS AND KNOWLEDGE PROVIDERS DON’T
have adequate incentives to share personal contact information
with each other, because neither can be guaranteed that the other will
follow through with the exchange. To solve this, a third party organizer
is often brought in, but these services take a large cut of the profit,
resulting in a knowledge seeker being charged more, or a knowledge
provider walking away with less. To get around this, many knowledge
providers will ask for payment in advance, but this demands trust from
the knowledge seeker’s end. There is currently no efficient application
on the market to solve this problem.
Blockchain technology has opened up the possibility for borderless
peer to peer transactions. This means that the exchange of information
for money can be made on a global scale without a costly intermediary.
Experty, our cutting edge application, is designed to connect
knowledge providers and knowledge seekers anywhere in the world
using blockchain technology. Payments are automated through our
operations contract (OC), allowing voice and video calls to be monetized
without a lengthy setup or upfront payment. Knowledge providers can
advertise their services through a direct call link or QR code, which can
be placed on any social media platform. A knowledge provider simply
sets their rate per minute, and when the call is complete, the OC settles
the charges based on the predetermined rate. Knowledge seekers will
only be charged for the length of the call.
We believe Experty will save countless man hours due to its ability to
increase efficiency and accessibility to the exchange of knowledge
worldwide. Our solution will help level the playing field, especially for
those without access to the traditional banking systems.

VALUE
PROPOSITION

W

E HAVE DEVELOPED A BLOCKCHAIN-BASED CALLING
platform that allows two or more parties to connect via
video or audio call. Within the application, a knowledge provider
can set their rate per minute, which is paid by the knowledge
seeker when they call. This exchange is settled seamlessly through
the Blockchain using an Ethereum smart contract coupled with
off-chain software. Experty adds value to the consulting industry
through simplifying the exchange of knowledge for currency.

Knowledge Provider. Can share his or her direct call link
without fear of receiving fraud and/or marketing calls. They
can also display their availability schedule.
Knowledge Seeker. Saves time and money by contacting
wanted person directly, and paying only for actual call time.
Third Party Services. Gain another path to monetize their
existing client base.

Value Proposition

1.1

INTRODUCTION

As a consulting team, we have found a technological
need for a payment service able to process ad
hoc conversations and consultations. Currently, in
order to provide or receive online consultations,
there are three settlement possibilities. Each of
them has their own associated problems:
1.

2.

3.

Charge and Cost Confusion. A user
can pay a provider up front for a
consultation, but the exact amount
required is not known because the
provider may be charging by the
minute or by the hour. In addition, the
user and provider may not know the
total duration of the conversation at
the time that payment is discussed.
Trust. A provider can also use a postconsultation billing system, which
requires the provider to trust that the
knowledge seeker will pay for the
service after finishing the call.
Payment Friction. A provider can also
rely on external services or third party
intermediaries. In these cases, money
transfers are highly regulated events
that create a large barrier to entry,
even for globally-recognized brands.

of day. Instead of building a single consultation
marketplace, we have created a protocol allowing
users to share their paid call links or QR codes
wherever they want, including but not limited
to: websites, blogs, and social network profiles or
portals.

1.2

MOTIVATION BEHIND THE
EXPERTY PLATFORM

Thanks to the invention of Blockchain technology,
it is now viable to make micro-transactions
worldwide. Anyone, regardless of location, can
send a small amount of value to anyone else in
the world. We live in a knowledge-based economy.
We should be able to exchange knowledge in the
same way.
Combining micro knowledge exchanges and
blockchain micro payments makes this feasible
on a worldwide scale. Currently, there are no
available tools to easily handle this process.
Experty offers the best tools to solve this problem
for both “knowledge providers” and “knowledge
seekers”.

We see an opportunity to connect our dedicated
software with blockchain technology. Our goal
is to make Experty fully decentralized, thus
preventing DDoS attacks from taking the platform
down entirely. Experty will have the ability to
operate globally, without interruption, at any time

PROJECT
DESCRIPTION

T

HE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT IS TO OFFER AN
avenue to connect two or more people so that they may
conduct a paid knowledge exchange via online voice or video call.
In this document we identify the participants as knowledge seeker
and knowledge provider. However, Experty’s possible use cases
are wider than just knowledge exchange. It can include calls with
celebrities for charity actions or one-on-one private video chats.
The Experty platform consists of applications available for mobile,
web, and desktop. Users are also able to send free text messages
between each other in order to discuss the terms further if
needed. Text messaging can also be disabled by the provider if
they so choose. Voice or video calls are always paid, charging by
the providers predetermined rate.

2.1

TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

The current platform is being built using React
and React-Native. This allows us to shorten the
go-to-market process and implement additional
features from the roadmap, while still keeping the
native application experience and performance.
All Ethereum smart contract interactions will be
triggered by the recipient of the call, since it is
in his or her interest to register for payment. The
caller must first provide enough funds allowing
for at least 30 seconds of the call in order to
initiate the conversation.
During initialization of the call, the recipient
sends the exact conditions of the exchange to
the caller, including the recipient’s minute rate,
call identification, and the Ethereum addresses
of both parties. The on-chain transactions occur
through our Ethereum smart contract, known as
the operations contract (OC).
After verifying that these conditions match as
intended by the caller’s application, the caller signs
the action with his or her private key and sends
back signed proof to the recipient. The recipient
then uses the signed proof of initialization to
trigger the start_call function on OC. In doing so,
this makes the funds unusable elsewhere, thus
preventing: double spends, withdraw of funds
during the call, or trying to trigger another call.
The process happens automatically in the
background of the application after the call is
answered. This occurs in a matter of milliseconds
during an initiating ‘handshake,’ so it’s not
noticeable for participants.
During the first few seconds of the call, the
recipient’s application checks if the call
was registered on the Blockchain and if the
participants, provider and user, are matching. The
application does not allow for triggering another

call when one is in progress, however, if abuse
does occur, the information is sent to our team
and the abuser’s funds get blocked until the
situation is resolved.
As long as the call is in progress, the recipient’s
application gets signed and confirms the call
length from the caller at every second through
an off-chain unidirectional payment channel.
Such confirmation contains the information
about both participants, call identification, call
length, and timestamps. This information is used
by the recipient to trigger the end_call function
after finishing the call. Immediately after, funds
are transferred from the caller’s address to the
recipient’s address. This also unlocks the caller’s
ability to withdraw his or her remaining funds or
trigger additional calls.
Only one signed confirmation on the OC is
needed at the end of every call action. Interaction
between the OC and the off-chain unidirectional
payment channel means that charges occur only
during an active connection. This prevents charges
from occurring due to a disconnected internet
connection as well as preventing potential scam
usage where the caller blocks signed confirmation
at the end of the call.
Withdrawal of funds from the OC will always be
delayed, 10 blocks by default. This removes the
possibility to withdraw these funds before the offchain processes are completed. The number of
confirmations to delay payment stored within the
contract vary, and can be modified in the future
to follow platform changes.
More description of the contract, with all functions,
is provided in the Contract Architecture chapter
of this document.

CORE FEATURES

The Experty platform is based on an Ethereum network contract which acts as the back-end for the
service. The website and applications store the information about the usage history of all users.
◊◊

WebRTC Protocol. Audio and video communication within the application uses the WebRTC
protocol. This protocol is used in apps like Whatsapp or Google Hangouts to ensure peer
to peer data encryption and provides robustness proven by millions of users using the
technology already.

◊◊

Fully Decentralized Call Links. Our goal is to allow experts to share their paid call link
whenever and wherever they want. This avoids relying on Experty to create a marketplace for
them. Knowledge providers can use networks where they are already known and considered
trusted experts, such as message boards, social media, blogs, etc.

◊◊

Instant Payments. The payments will occur on the Ethereum blockchain after the call based
on a pay-per-minute rate. The OC will provide the security of a payment settlement system.
A caller without sufficient funds to complete at least 30 seconds of a call will not be able to
trigger a call. If a caller’s funds are running low, they will be notified in advance and will be
disconnected when funds fall below the per minute rate.

◊◊

Cross Platform Calling Application. The first version of Experty will have dedicated calling
applications for most platforms, including iOS, Android, and Windows. We also plan to
integrate Experty with third party video calling applications so that potential users will be
able to use the application of their choice.

◊◊

Availability Schedule. Knowledge providers are able to set their availability time, so they can
easily prevent all calls outside a given timeframe.

◊◊

Ethereum Wallet. The provided applications will have a built-in Ethereum wallet for
managing funds.

USER FLOW

1.

A knowledge provide sets his/her rate in
US dollars (for example, $5 per minute)

6.

The knowledge provide receives EXY
tokens based on the conversion rate

2.

An advice seeker is aware of the main
pricing in USD before he/she decides to
make a call

7.

A value for knowledge exchange occurs

8.

ADDITIONAL STEP: If the knowledge
provider doesn’t want to keep EXY
tokens, then he/she will be able to convert
them to any other cryptocurrency on
his/her own.

3.

The Experty app calculates the amount
of EXY tokens required per minute
based on the USD/EXY conversion rate
on the secondary market

4.

The advice seeker tops off his/her
account by using one of the available
methods (USD, BTC etc.)

5.

The advice seeker starts the call

EXPERTY.IO

Project Description
Future versions of Experty will include more
advanced payment types, such as a variable
rate for longer calls, or different suggested
rates for different types of knowledge providers.
The available modifiable options a knowledge
provider has will be updated based on continual
user feedback.

Internet. These services are also crucial
for those in rural and/or underserved
areas, especially those who suffer from
chronic illnesses requiring frequent
doctor visits.
3.

Programmers. Most of the people from
our team are programmers themselves.
We are frequently called upon as
consultants. When working in a large
company, there are usually multiple
colleagues available for feedback. This
is not the case when doing freelance
work. There are discussion boards
and web chats to pose questions, but
no financial incentive to provide an
answer, leaving many waiting for a
reply.

4.

Business Advisors. Short consultations
with successful business professionals
can become a critical pivot point for
many companies on all levels.

5.

Professors. Massive open online
courses (MOOCs) are becoming
increasingly popular. Professors or
distributors may have limited time
and availability to answer questions
that arise. Experty will help triage and
prioritize their time.

6.

Language Learning. Listening to
foreign languages when learning is as
important as attempting to speak the
language yourself. With Experty, you
can call anyone in the world and have
a live conservation in any language
when native speakers are available.

7.

Webcam Chats. Paid one-on-one
video-chats with camera models
are popular services that currently
require an intermediary for payment

We believe this unlocks new opportunities for
knowledge monetization because there are
currently no incentives to share a direct phone
number with strangers. Influencers, who would
otherwise have many potential customers or
callers, have no other way to quickly incentivize
their time.

2.4

POSSIBLE USE CASES

The most likely use cases for Experty will occur for
professionals who are well known or casual users
with a niche following. Professional users may
include lawyers, medical providers, programmers,
professors, business advisors, etc.; and casual users
may include bloggers or YouTubers, celebrities
and influencers, webcam models, and charitable
causes.
1.

2.

Lawyers. Frequently, one needs quick
ad-hoc knowledge from a lawyer.
The most common method today is
through an in-person consultation
to avoid the payment settlement
problem, even when it may be easier to
complete this over the phone.
Medical Consultants. Similar to
lawyers, there are instances when
phone conversations are perfectly
suitable for provider and patient. With
concierge medicine and telemedicine
on the rise, doctors and patients are
now regularly participating in everyday
checkups or consultations through the

Celebrities & Influencers. Similar to
bloggers and YouTubers, celebrities
and influencers often have time
constraints preventing them from
contacting their audience directly.
Experty allows for monetization of this
direct contact with their audience.

settlement. The user must also provide
credit card information to a third
party company. The models’ network
also takes a percentage of the profits.
Experty would allow discreet, secure,
and direct payment from user to
provider.

9.

Bloggers & YouTubers. Both groups
have large audiences wanting to
contact them directly. Due to time
restrictions, direct contact usually
occurs through comment replies or live
streams. Integrating with our platform
will allow these individuals to provide
additional monetization of their
audience group by charging for private
calls.

10. Charity Donations. Celebrities or wellknown individuals frequently give their
time for charity. Experty would allow
for increased transparency of funds
through the Blockchain and a decrease
in costs or fees taken by intermediaries.

COMPANY EXAMPLE

1.

Jack (a user) needs immediate support from a company he purchased a product from

2.

He navigates to the product support section of the company’s website

3.

He finds a regular support and a premium support option

4.

He chooses to use the premium support

5.

This directs him to the company’s Experty premium support profile

6.

He doesn’t have any Experty tokens to use the application

7.

He pays for Experty tokens using his credit card (such as Visa)

8.

Experty tokens are delivered to his light wallet

9.

Jack calls the premium support line, sending Experty tokens to the company’s support line
every minute as dictated by the predefined rate.

WHY BLOCKCHAIN?

Blockchains, by nature, have several properties that make them attractive for our platform. These
properties are essential to the success of this project. Thanks to Blockchain technology, we are able to
achieve the following:
◊◊

Payment Settlement. Thanks to smart contracts, we are able to alleviate a large problem:
when and how the payment should be settled. With Experty, the payment is made during
the calls. Participants can disconnect whenever they want and the payment is made only
for the recorded time. The contract decides whether or not the caller has enough funds, and
makes sure that the funds are transferred to the recipient when the call is completed.

◊◊

Legal Simplification. Holding customers’ money falls into the legal purview of several
regulations and regulatory agencies. Using cryptocurrency simplifies this drastically since the
funds are transferred directly between the parties involved. Any funds sent or received in the
Experty platform can be withdrawn by users at any time through the Ethereum wallet.

◊◊

Instant Payments. Ethereum payments are realized within seconds. Knowledge providers
don’t need to worry about these payments being locked in processing for weeks on end, or
payments being denied through chargebacks.

◊◊

Third Party Service Transparency. Our marketing strategy highly relies on external services

EXPERTY.IO

which already have thousands of users in their database or network. Blockchain transparency
allows for tracking calls triggered from their websites without worrying about a substantial
usage and clearing cost or denial of payment by a service provider.

SMART CONTRACT
ARCHITECTURE

B

Y DESIGN, OUR OC AND OFF-CHAIN PROCESSES ARE
perfectly able to cover any type of unit of money per time
exchange. Although Experty is purely about information exchange,
we see many more potential use cases of the contract itself.
The OC architecture provides a way to utilize signed off-chain
transactions done through Experty. Due to the possible inefficiency
of registering calls directly on the Blockchain, the recipient uses
a signed confirmation of the call to lock the caller’s funds on the
contract until the call finishes.
During the call, the recipient receives additional confirmation from
the caller each second. After finishing the call, he or she uses the
most recent confirmation in order to transfer the funds to their
balance and unlock the remaining caller’s funds.

POTENTIAL ETHEREUM
BOTTLENECK

The Ethereum network (EN), in its current state,
is not able to process many frequent transactions
and most likely would be bottlenecked using the
current architecture at scale. The solution to this
problem is implementing a type of Lightning
Network (LN) or Raiden-like Network instead of
directly messaging the EN. In this case, the LN
can be used as a middle layer between recipient
and the OC.
Communication schema would change from:
1.

[ Caller ] < --- > [ Recipient ] < --- > [ EN ]

Into:
2.

[ Caller ] < --- > [ Recipient ] < --- > [ OFF-CHAIN / LN / Raiden-like ] < --- > [ EN ]

The Ethereum team is currently working on
moving from proof of work to proof of stake,
which may fix the efficiency issues far sooner
than it would become a problem for our platform.
The LN or Raiden-like Network itself is not a
part of our project in its current state. However,
the architecture by design is built to allow the
possibility of LN-type architecture if needed.

Instead, in our approach, we are creating a totally decentralized
solution. Users will be able to share their calling links on any
existing platform. Knowledge providers can use the link where
they are popular or a known influencer, such as question and
answer discussion boards like Quora, or social media portals such
as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

THIRD PARTY PLATFORM
INTEGRATION

A decentralized solution means the possibility of
integrating into a variety of third party services,
already containing large user bases, which can
allow creators or influencers to make additional
profit using our platform. This strategy is a lean
and efficient go-to-market strategy since we will
not need to reach out to individuals one-by-one
to create the desired network effect. Instead, we
can rely on an existing established user base.
Experty allows anyone to quickly and immediately
monetize their time or content beyond what they
were initially capable of. This is efficient for both
the provider and the receiver.

Examples of premium features include:

TOKEN ECONOMICS

The Experty Token (EXY) is a major constituent of
the Experty platform. EXY is created only during
the Token Generation Event.
EXY is a utility token that will be used for the
following:
◊◊

EXY will be used for all payments from
advice seekers to knowledge providers

◊◊

EXY will be staked by users for access
to premium features

◊◊

EXY will be used by advice seekers as a
deposit for advance scheduling with a
knowledge provider

◊◊

The final number of tokens needed to be staked
for premium membership and exact features
are going to be decided based on actual user
demand and the token price.

EXY will be sold inside the application via different
methods including:
1.

Credit Cards (VISA, MasterCard, etc.)

2.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. Our team will build the
first fully functional version of the app, which will use
Experty tokens to process payments.

continue to improve the app’s user experience based on
feedback.

•

MARKETING. We will use funds to market the Experty
