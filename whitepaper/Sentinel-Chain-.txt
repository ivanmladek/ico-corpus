Abstract

The ‘poor’ are much richer than they think. What they need is a solution to
unlock their economic potential. We bring to them the Sentinel Chain, a
blockchain based solution to the problem of ‘dead capital’. The Sentinel Chain is
a global B2B marketplace for financial services accepting the use livestock as
collateral. The Sentinel Chain addresses two main issues to be solved to allow the
asset tokenization of livestock: First, the creation of a process that transforms
livestock from ‘dead capital’ to a fungible asset with a transparent and clear
defined value. Second, the creation of an open and transparent marketplace that
connects the unbanked to the network of global financial providers. This paper
introduces the concept and benefits of Sentinel Chain as well as a technical
appendix which elaborates on the design and fundamental architectural decisions.

Keywords: Financial inclusion, livestock, collateral, dead capital, blockchain
technology, smallholder farmers, unbanked

Introduction

Livestock is an integral part of the greatest enterprise on earth – small-scale
agriculture. No other enterprise supports the livelihoods of as many people.
There are more than 570 million farms worldwide, most of which are small and
family-operated. These smallholder farmers rely on seasonal agricultural
production for their livelihoods. Approximately 70% of the global food
production comes from small-scale agriculture.
Smallholders are a driving force in feeding the world.
According to the FAO World Census of Agriculture and UNDESA Rural
Population data, smallholders are the largest global segment living on less than
US$2 a day and are central to global financial inclusion efforts – but reaching
them with financial services is challenging.
Due to the seasonal and volatile nature of agriculture, financial service providers
face liquidity management and concentration challenges due to covariant risks –
i.e. farmers in the same area generally borrow at the same time and often engage
in the same activities, and are therefore exposed to the same risks. One of the
primary barriers to private-sector credit to smallholders is the lack of physical
collateral – the economic value of their physical asset such as livestock is not
recognized as ‘capital’ in the financial economy. The problem of ‘dead capital’
leaves the smallholders in an unfortunate position of low financial capability.
Without access to formal financial services, they are subjected to higher costs of
borrowing as providers often require greater incentives to offer them credit.
‘Dead capital’ exists because we have forgotten that converting a physical asset
such as livestock to generate capital – for example, using the cow to borrow
money to manage cash outflows and inflows during times of volatile weather and
markets – requires an extremely complex process.
The ‘poor’ are much richer than they think. What they need is a solution to
unlock their economic potential.
There are two main issues to be solved in order to allow asset tokenization of
livestock: First, the creation of a process that transforms livestock from ‘dead
capital’ to a fungible asset with a transparent and clear defined value. Second, the
creation of an open and transparent marketplace that connects the unbanked to
the liquidity pool of global financial players.
We believe that the mutual creation of livestock insurance and the registration of
livestock provenance on blockchain provide a new opportunity: the real
possibility of accepting livestock as ‘collateral’ for loans. This innovative model
will solve the complex process of converting the physical asset to generate
economic capital.
Our solution will revolutionize financial access by unlocking the true economic
capital of the unbanked.

Market Trends and Potential
“It is a world where the ownership of assets is difficult to trace
and validate. It is governed by no legally recognizable set of
rules; where the assets’ potentially useful economic attributes
have not been described or organized; where they cannot be used
to obtain surplus value through multiple transactions because
their unfixed nature and uncertainty leave too much room for
misunderstanding, faulty recollection and reversal of agreement.
Where most assets, in short, are dead capital.”
HERNANDO DE SOTO, The Mystery of Capital

4.1 The Hidden Economic Capital of the Unbanked
The ‘mystery of capital’ de Soto writes about refers to the seminal meaning
of the word. In medieval Latin, ‘capital appears to have denoted some form
of livestock, which have always been important sources of wealth beyond
the basic meat they provide. Livestock can be counted and measured, but
most importantly, additional wealth (or surplus value) in the form of milk,
hide, wool, meat and fuel can be obtained from livestock. Livestock also
has the useful attribute of the ability to reproduce themselves. According to
de Soto, the term ‘capital’ begins to do two jobs simultaneously, capturing
the physical dimension of assets (i.e. livestock) as well as their potential to
generate surplus value.
At the moment, the unbanked lack access to the mechanisms that could
unlock the economic potential of their livestock so that they could be used
to produce, secure, or guarantee greater value in the formal financial
economy.

“…farmers (in Myanmar) have limited access to competitive
agricultural loans, so most of them have to rely on costly
financing at high interest rates, sometimes of more than 5% per
month. High interest rates are an inhibitor of profitability. As in
any other businesses, people will not invest if the return is
inadequate.”
U Thadoe Hein, Managing Director, Myanmar Awba Group
Oxford Business Group, Interview with U Thadoe Hein
23 November 2016
With more than 570 million smallholder farms in the world, there is a need
to address the number of traditional pain points in the context of
agricultural finance, making it easier for farmers to save, borrow, manage
irregular income and insure against loss.
Although the use of digital financial services to expand smallholder access
to finance is still in its infancy, the sheer number of pilots is cause for
optimism.

4.2 The Rising Global Demand for Food
Demand for food and other agricultural products is projected to increase by
50% between 2012 an 2050. Smallholders in developing countries produce
the bulk of the world’s global food supply – which has been showing an
increasing trend (See Table 1 and 2 below). However, despite their
important contribution, smallholders have suffered benign neglect by
policymakers and the international financial community. As a result,
smallholders in the developing world continue to account for a large
proportion of the poor (See Figure 1 and 2).

Isolated from the benefits of the global market economy, smallholders often
cannot keep up with the rising demand for food and face limited resources,
poor access to markets, affordable technologies, infrastructure and most
importantly, credit. The smallholders are also the most vulnerable to price
shocks in the global food price volatility.
Agriculture is not just a food-producing machine. It is the backbone of the
rural livelihood system, a major source of skilled and remunerative
employment and a powerful engine towards larger economic growth. The
Sentinel Chain has been designed to fuel this engine and empower the
unbanked into economic prosperity.

The Sentinel Chain Ecosystem
“I’m sure all of us here today would agree that financial services
are the lifeblood of an economy.”
H.M. QUEEN MÁXIMA
Inclusive Technology for an Inclusive Future
Speech at the Singapore Fintech Festival, 16 November 2017

The Sentinel Chain is the world’s first global B2B marketplace platform for
financial inclusion services accepting the use of livestock as collateral.
The ultimate objective of the Sentinel Chain is to unlock the economic potential
of the unbanked by bringing together an international community of financial
providers looking to participate in facilitating financial inclusion in an open,
secure and transparent marketplace. It is specifically designed to provide
affordable and secure financial services to those who need it most – the 2 billion
unbanked.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nation’s
report on World Agriculture, growth in the livestock sector has consistently
exceeded that of the crop sector – the total demand for animal products in
developing countries is expected to more than double by 2030. With financial
inclusion being a priority for developing countries, the Sentinel Chain project
seeks to introduce livestock as ‘capital’ in the formal financial economy, the
transformation from ‘dead capital’ to a financial asset class will increase
investment and participation substantially. The basis for such a solution lies in
the creation of a physically tamper-proof and digitally-immutable system capable
of livestock provenance – the origin of a livestock’s existence.
The Sentinel Chain Ecosystem is made up of 5 main components:
•
•
•
•
•

Livestock Identification Tag
CrossPay Mobile Application
CrossPay Blockchain
Sentinel Chain
Sentinel Chain Token

21 of 50

5.1

Livestock Identification Tag

The RFID-enabled livestock identity tag (Livestock ID Tag) is tamper-proof and
theft-proof on both a material design as well as a data level.
(i)
(ii)

(iii)

5.2

From a material design perspective, the tag has been designed to
prevent physical tampering or theft. The tag has been designed for
“single-use” and thus cannot be removed without being destroyed.
From a data perspective, the tag stores the geolocation and time
stamp information on to the CrossPay Blockchain. Immutability and
non-repudiation ensures the authenticity and secure traceability of
certifications, i.e. a digital ‘passport’ that proves its existence and
ownership to an identified entity and origin.
From both a material design and data perspective, in the event that
the tag has been forcibly removed, the information which resides in
the tag will be invalidated, thus rendering the tag useless.

CrossPay Mobile Application

The CrossPay Mobile application (Android) is a mobile financial delivery
mechanism for use with the CrossPay Blockchain. It is also designed to be a
mobile wallet that provides the unbanked with quick access to their balances and
allows for transactions with other users and merchants.

5.3

CrossPay Blockchain

The CrossPay Blockchain is a B2C financial ecosystem specifically designed for
the unbanked. Managed and operated within a local geography, it is accessible
via the CrossPay Mobile application – a simple mobile interface built for
Android. Since blockchains have been fundamentally designed as a decentralized
technology for the grassroots level, it is highly suitable for deployment in
pockets of local ecosystems to meet the financial inclusion needs of the
unbanked.
CrossPay Blockchains consist of 3 components:
(a) Tamper-Proof RFID-enabled Livestock Tag,
(b) CrossPay Mobile application, and
(c) Blockchain technology
These innovative technological solutions will work together to unlock the value
of “dead capital” trapped in livestock, thus addressing the last mile problem of
financial inclusion. CrossPay Blockchain will use a native cryptocurrency token
called “Local CrossPay Token” (or LCT). LCT will be pegged to the value of the
country’s native currency.

22 of 50

5.4

Sentinel Chain

The Sentinel Chain is the world’s first global B2B marketplace platform for
financial inclusion services based on the use of livestock as collaterals. It has
been designed with the specific purpose of creating a low-cost cross-border
financial infrastructure connecting the isolated unbanked with limited access to
formal financial services to a global network of financial providers.
The Sentinel Chain is a consortium blockchain that operates within decentralized
governance and is connected to multiple CrossPay Blockchains. In doing so, the
Sentinel Chain and the CrossPay Blockchains creates a hub-and-spoke
ecosystem specifically designed to provide a low-cost cross-border financial
infrastructure. Such an infrastructure will provide liquidity to the local unbanked
population via an international network of financial providers. (See Figure 3
below)

Figure 3: The diagram above shows a high-level design of the Sentinel Chain.

23 of 50

5.5

Sentinel Chain Token (SENC)

The Sentinel Chain Token (SENC) will be an ERC20-compatible token on the
public Ethereum blockchain that allows global financial service providers and
cryptocurrency holders to participate in the Sentinel Chain marketplace. Activity
on the Sentinel Chain will be performed solely using the Sentinel Token. This
will make the Sentinel Token an integral part of the Sentinel Chain platform and
the driver of its economy.

5.6

Differences between the LCT and the SENC token

The LCT token will be the local CrossPay Blockchain equivalent of the SENC
token. It will be a private token that resides only within each local CrossPay
Blockchain. LCT will be used internally by CrossPay Mobile to facilitate the
local payments on CrossPay Blockchain Services. The value of LCT is pegged to
the country’s native currency. Every country will have its own LCT token. LCT
token will not exist on any public blockchain and cannot be minted on its own.
LCT can only be purchased using SENC.
SENC token will only exist on the public Ethereum blockchain. A fixed number
of SENC tokens will be issued during an Initial Token Sale. SENC will be
required for use with the functions provided by the Sentinel Chain. SENC can be
owned by anyone with an ERC-20 compatible wallet. Like all cryptocurrency
tokens, SENC may be exposed to market volatility. LCT however will be pegged
to the country’s native currency value and will not be exposed to the volatility of
the cryptocurrency markets.

Sentinel Chain Alliance Partners

InfoCorp has formed alliances with various strategic partners to extend the value
of the Sentinel Chain.

Maybank is Malaysia's largest bank by both market capitalisation and total
assets. It is also one of the largest banks in Southeast Asia, with total assets
exceeding US$164 billion and net profit of US$1.63 billion for 2016. As the
leading Malaysian banking group with a strong regional presence in South Asia
and Southeast Asia, Maybank acts as the main provider of settlement and foreign
exchange services to InfoCorp, in facilitating Sentinel Chain’s operations. (See
Appendix D).

VeChain is renowned for creating a powerful public provenance blockchain that
can be used to combat counterfeit luxury goods. As livestock ownership and
owners’ data remains on the Sentinel Chain, livestock, the provenance of the
livestock can reside on a public provenance platform that is integrated to Sentinel
Chain, such as VeChain. This can be useful in the case of cross-border livestock
trade and food supply chain where proof of origin is required.

MediShares is the world’s first global marketplace for mutual aid backed by
ZhongTopia, the largest online mutual insurance in China with a membership
base of 10 million users. MediShares platform can be integrated to Sentinel
Chain as a financial service provider and offer its services to Sentinel Chain’s
unbanked market.

The Sentinel Chain Token Features (SENC)

We intend to issue the Sentinel Chain Token (SENC), which is primarily used as
a medium of exchange for the Local Community Token (LCT) which is then
used to make payments for services or participate in projects. These features will
be explained in greater detail as follows:

6.1 Insurance

6.2 Loans

6.3 Collateral

6.4 Crowdfunding

6.5 Community
Projects

6.6 E-Payments

26 of 50

6.1 Facilitating Livestock Insurance
Problem: (1) Fraud is one of the biggest challenges to livestock insurance. A
false insurance claim can be filed by swapping out the livestock tag from an
insured livestock asset onto an uninsured livestock asset. (2) The second
challenge is the lack of accurate livestock time-series data that can be used to
determine the livestock insurance premium.
Solution: (1) A physically tamper-proof livestock identity tag when combined
with the digitally-immutable property of blockchain as a storage provides the
mechanism to prevent such fraud. (2) As the blockchain is inherently a timeseries transaction ledger, this creates a storage for analysis of accurate livestock
data for insurance premium in future.
Function: SENC can be utilised by livestock insurance companies as a medium
of exchange to purchase LCT, which LCT in turn can be used to pay for
information storage and publication of a livestock insurance policy on the local
CrossPay Blockchain so that such livestock insurance can be associated with the
identity of the relevant livestock owner as tracked by the local Crosspay
Blockchain and the identity of the relevant livestock tracked by a tamper-proof
livestock identification tag (See Figure 4 below).

Figure 4: The diagram above shows the issuance of livestock insurance

27 of 50

6.2 Loans using Livestock as Collateral
Problem: The biggest challenge to getting loans for the unbanked is the lack of
credit history and the high interest rates in obtaining an unsecured loan. The
second challenge is the difficulty in getting a secured loan using livestock as an
asset. Currently, there is no accurate way to provide the proof-of-ownership from
an unbanked to a livestock asset, or the proof that it has not been pledged to
another lender.
High financing cost for unbanked farmers in Myanmar
Farm crop prices in Myanmar are much lower than in Vietnam
and Thailand. The reason is access to finance. According to
Chief Executive of Myanmar Awba Group, “Myanmar farmers
have to take loans from loan sharks at an interest of 5-8 percent a
month, that translates to 100 percent a year.” It is not just farmers
but traders in the chain get finance at similar rates. Myanma
Awba Group is a market leader in agrochemical fertilizers in
Myanmar, connects to 3 million farmers across the country
through its vast network of sales centres and dealers.
Interview with Myanma Awba CEO, U Thadoe Hein
Frontier Myanmar, 4 October 2016

Solution: A livestock insurance policy combined with the use of tamper-proof
livestock identity tag and borrower’s identity information on the blockchain
provides the attestation to the claim of ownership as well as the proof of origin of
the livestock asset. The blockchain contains loan agreements that can be used to
verify if the livestock is already been pledged. The use of Sentinel Chain’s
design provides a way to create credit history which can then be verified on the
blockchain by future lenders.
Function: SENC can be utilised by local financing companies as a medium of
exchange to purchase LCT. The LCT can in turn be used to pay for the
publication of livestock-collateralized loan agreements on the local CrossPay
Blockchain so that such livestock-collateralized loan agreement can be
associated with the identity of the relevant livestock owner tracked by the local
Crosspay Blockchain and the identity of the relevant livestock tracked by a
tamper-proof livestock identification tag. (See Figure 5 below)

Figure 5: The diagram above shows the issuance of loan agreements
28 of 50

6.3

Collateral by Third Party Local Financial Providers

Problem: Local financing companies need access to loans from larger or
offshore financing companies. This can incur high interest rate to offset the high
credit risks associated with unsecured loans.
Solution: Through the creation of livestock collateralised loans, local financing
companies are in a better position to manage risks. In addition, local financing
companies may use SENC as a collateral for additional leverage. This puts local
financing companies in a better position to negotiate for more competitive
interest rates and for offshore financing companies to gain access to new and
emerging markets.
Function: SENC may be used as collateral by third party local financing
companies (as borrowers) to secure against offshore lending from third party
offshore financing companies (as lenders) in order to minimise counter-party risk
exposure for such offshore financing companies providing such lending. SENC
can be held in escrow guaranteed by a contract on the Ethereum blockchain. In
the event that the third party local financing company defaults, such escrowed
SENC can be released to the third party overseas financing company to be
liquidated for funds. (See Figure 6 below)

Figure 6: The diagram above shows the cross-border remittance

29 of 50

6.4 Facilitating Third Party Crowdfunding Projects
Problem: To bring down the cost of financing for the unbanked, the local
financing companies must gain access to cheaper source of funding. However,
due to the risk premium and limited access of funds, finding a more affordable
source of funding for unsecured loans will be challenging.
Solution: The Sentinel Chain will open up a marketplace for Peer-to-peer
lending and crowdfunding platforms to integrate with a network of unbanked
financing companies. This creates an economy of scale for the overseas lending
platform while at the same time providing an alternative and competitive source
of funds to local financing companies. Livestock collaterals and SENC
collaterals are both credit risk mitigation measures that can be verified on
Sentinel Chain – giving the overseas lenders higher transparency and confidence
to provide loans to local financing companies.
Function: Third party crowdfunding projects may utilise crowdfunding
platforms that are integrated to the Sentinel Chain to undertaking fund-raising in
SENC, which can be used to finance the third party local financing companies’
business-activities.
In order for third party local financing companies (as borrowers from third
parties) to on-lend to the unbanked, the third party local financing companies
will need to secure cheaper source of borrowing. The ability to use livestock as
collateral allows the third party local financing companies to manage default
risk, as well as enabling it to further secure borrowings from third party offshore
lending companies or third party offshore crowdfunding platforms using the
proof-of-ownership of the relevant livestock collateral. To facilitate access to
such proof-of-ownership, the third party offshore crowdfunding platforms’
crowdfunding projects can be integrated with the Sentinel Chain to raise SENC,
which can be used to finance the local financing companies’ business-activities.
By connecting the unbanked to the increased availability of access to the funds
offered by the third party offshore financial service providers or third party
crowdfunding platforms, Sentinel Chain will be leveraging on the economies of
scale, driving down the cost of access to digital financial services.

30 of 50

6.5 Facilitating Community Projects
Problem: While financial inclusion remains the objective of the Sentinel Chain,
the unbanked may be disadvantaged in their access to basic infrastructure such as
electricity, road or clean water.
Solution: SENC can be used by local non-for-profit organisations to receive
donations from overseas donors and financing aids by integrating their
fundraising platforms on to the Sentinel Chain.
Function: SENC can be utilised by third party local not-for-profit organisations
as a medium of exchange to purchase LCT that can be used to finance certain
social inclusion activities such as building of schools and infrastructure. In times
of natural disaster or crisis where financial aid may not be readily available, the
Sentinel Chain network may be used for a quick and easy sources of funding by
such third party local not-for-profit organisations.

31 of 50

6.6 E-Payments
Problem: The ability to drive adoption of electronic payments for financial
inclusion depends on the ubiquity and network effect of CrossPay Blockchain
users.
Solution: By unlocking the value of “dead capital” in unbanked livestock and its
usage for livestock insurance and livestock secured loans, the utility value of
CrossPay Blockchain can be increased to accelerate adoption of electronic
payments via CrossPay Mobile application.
Function: SENC can be utilised by stakeholders as a medium of exchange to
purchase LCT that can be used for electronic payments to merchants who accept
LCT.

32 of 50

6.7 Increased Adoption and Utilisation
To revolutionize financial access, the project aims to increase adoption and
utilisation of the Sentinel Chain as an international marketplace for cross-border
financial services by connecting local community blockchains to offshore
financial service providers.
With an increased adoption and utilisation of livestock insurance in conjunction
with Crosspay Blockchain, other economic activities utilising the CrossPay
Blockchain such as livestock-collateralised loans, are likely to increase as well.
This creates a virtuous cycle which increases the network effect of the Sentinel
Chain.
The number of active users is expected to grow rapidly in the early years as the
Sentinel Chain opens new markets, either by expanding its own operation or via
licensing of the software to local entities.

8. Conclusion
"The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the
abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide
enough for those who have too little."
Franklin D. Roosevelt
We have presented the Sentinel Chain model, which will create the world’s first
global marketplace for financial inclusion services accepting the use of livestock
as collateral. This paper explains the hidden economic potential of the
smallholder farmers in which the main problem hindering the recognition of
livestock as a financial asset is the very characteristic of livestock - that each
individual livestock is unique. Consequently, there is a lack of transparency and
liquidity, on the one hand, as livestock change ownership via private cash
transactions. On the other hand, there is a multibillion dollar untapped market.
Once the Sentinel Chain is implemented, this market will start growing rapidly.
The Sentinel Chain was built with the specific purpose of creating a cross-border
financial infrastructure connecting the previously isolated unbanked to a global
network of financial providers. Our solution, as described in this paper takes a
unique approach to unlocking the economic potential of the unbanked by
establishing livestock provenance through the creation of livestock insurance on
blockchain. By turning the “dead capital” into a verified asset, this new system
could be a unanimous source of connected information, secure and incorruptible,
to allow for the integration of the unbanked into the global financial economy.
The Sentinel Chain has not only created a new class of financial inclusion
solution but has also set the stage to extend the platform to use cases beyond
financial inclusion. Livestock provenance data helps as a quality-control measure
for disease control. The same provenance-powered data also enables the
traceability of food origin and the verification of the organic food supply source.
By unlocking the economic capital of the unbanked, the Sentinel Chain unlocks
new opportunities and benefits for the banked – thus empowering the wellbeing
of people, animals and communities. Join us today in our mission to redefine
inclusive finance.

Appendix A – Tamper-Proof Livestock Identity Tag
The RFID-enabled livestock identity tag (Livestock ID Tag) is tamper-proof and
theft-proof on both a material design as well as a data level.
Livestock Identity Tagging System Components
The livestock identity tags consist of a “Male-Female” tag combination:
•

The Female Tag Component – The female tag component is a disc
embedded with an ISO-14443 compliant NFC chip that can interact with an
NFC-enabled smart phone.

•

The Male Tag Component – The male component, also known as the
backing disc, joins the female tag component together through the ear of the
livestock. The tag has been designed for “single-use” and cannot be removed
without being destroyed. The durable material is made of hardened rubber as
compared to the mainstream plastic. In the event that the tag has been
forcibly removed, the information which resides in the tag will be
invalidated, thus rendering the tag useless.

•

Tag Applicator – The applicator comprises of a bluetooth smart sensor
which houses the repository for the data and authenticity of the livestock.

•
•

Plunger – The plunger is the manual activation tool that will trigger the
transmission once both discs are bound together on the livestock’s ear.

Livestock Identity Tagging Process
The 4 stages of tagging the livestock are:
•

Stage 1 – stock/origin stage. Raw tags are received from the factory in
separate component packages.

•

Stage 2 – initialization stage. Data pertaining to the insured livestock are
stored into the chip. For example: Tag ID, the name of the insurance
company, date of issuance, etc.

•

Stage 3 – application stage. Both Male and Female discs are tagged unto the
ear of the insured livestock using the applicator.

•

Stage 4 – confirmation stage. Tags with the stored data are then writeprotected with the geolocation and time stamp information on to the
CrossPay Blockchain for “Read-Only” traceability.

Appendix B – Crosspay Mobile
The CrossPay Mobile application (Android) is a mobile financial delivery
mechanism for use with the CrossPay Blockchain. It is also designed to be a
mobile wallet that provides the unbanked with quick access to their balances and
allows for transactions with other users and merchants.
•

Multi-mode authentication. Its ease of use can be adopted by different
unbanked users. An authentication threshold can be set with a pre-determined
amount. For example: US$10 as a daily pre-determined allowance

•

Proximity mobile payments with QR codes and Near Field Communication
(NFC) instead of using a traditional credit/debit card

•

Escrow payment mechanism which can be used to provide electronic cashon-delivery (COD) payments to replace physical cash payments for the
delivery of goods within a local community.

•

Identity validation. From a data perspective, a livestock identification tag
stores the geolocation and time stamp information on the CrossPay
Blockchain. Immutability and non-repudiation ensures the authenticity and
secure traceability of certifications, i.e. a digital ‘passport’ that proves its
existence and ownership to an identified entity and origin. This forms an
important security aspect of the transaction.

•

Asset Tokenization. By converting the rights to an asset into a digital token
on the CrossPay Blockchain, the unbanked is able to turn their Real world
asset(s) into a securitized asset. For example, an unbanked may collateralize
his livestock by digitalizing the livestock’s ownership and value onto the
blockchain network, which is multi-signed by interested parties.

•

Document Tracking. The application is designed to track and validate the
authenticity of documents stored on the CrossPay Blockchain.

•

Provenance. The application enables the creation of unique IDs tagged to
the physical assets and tracking them via the private key controlled within
the mobile device.

Appendix C – CrossPay Blockchain Design
An agricultural-financial ecosystem can only be created by bringing together various
stakeholders onto a blockchain backend which includes unbanked farmers, livestock
insurance companies and micro-financing institutions (MFIs). Blockchain contains
unique properties that makes it a desirable technology to be used as a tamper-proof
data storage for the tracking of livestock ownership as well as a forgery-proof
distributed accounting system for the delivery of unbanked financial services.
•

•

•

•

Immutability. Immutability refers to the ability to prevent any changes to data
that has already been created and is a core feature of most blockchain
technologies.
Resiliency. The decentralized nature of blockchain removes the single-point-offailure risks associated with centralized systems by providing the redundancy
and security provided by multiple nodes on the blockchain.
Non-Repudiation. Non-repudiation refers to the guarantee that an action
performed on the system can be proven to be performed by, and only by, a
certain individual. This is a key aspect to prevent forgery.
Auditability. Because every transaction on the blockchain is tracked since the
creation of the system, and given that data is immutable and non-repudiating,
therefore information on the blockchain is highly auditable with a high degree of
authenticity.
Low capital outlay. All of the above features can be implemented using
centralized infrastructure. However, these features will require high upfront
investment cost and sophisticated enterprise grade infrastructure and services
which makes the provision of low-cost financial inclusion solutions
unsustainable in the long run.

A local unbanked community, unlike the general public Internet, operates with an
inherent level of trust. Instead of a fully trustless public blockchain model, a semitrusted blockchain model utilizing a private blockchain platform is compatible and
desirable in this scenario for the local community use case. The use of private
blockchain can also avoid the volatility risk associated with the public blockchain or
uncertainty over transaction fees. As transaction privacy is kept to within the private
blockchain, it is also easier for regulatory acceptance.
The CrossPay Blockchain is designed to address lightweight financial applications and
extension of the open source MultiChain1 which is a Bitcoin core fork designed as a
low-latency2, private blockchain platform that supports permission management and
native digital asset.

What is blockchain?
The invention of the Bitcoin protocol has brought about new opportunities for
inventing new ways in solving the financial inclusion problem. Bitcoin was made
famous because of its ability to address the double-spending problem in an
electronic cash payment system. Unlike physical cash, digital information can be
replicated and processed indefinitely, similar to making a copy of an email and
sending to multiple parties. The key limitation of digital payment systems, which
traditionally use a neutral trusted third party to maintain the record of the payers’
and payees’ balance and transactions is in a centralized database. The key
innovation that has risen from the invention of Bitcoin lies in its ability to prevent
the double-spend issue without the need for a centralized trusted third party. This
result in a decentralized peer-to-peer global payment system that has proven its
resiliency to security breaches for close to a decade. Blockchain refers to one of
the underlying technologies used in the implementation of Bitcoin.

Atomic Asset Exchange
Transactions within a CrossPay Blockchain are commonly facilitated by an atomic
asset exchange without the need for a centralized trusted authority. In computer
science terminology, atomic basically refers to a group of operations that either
succeed or fail in its entirety. This is analogous to delivery-vs-payment, a financial
industry term. For instance, Alice can atomically exchange an asset called “ABC”
with Bob in return for an Local CrossPay Token called “LCT”. As described in the
diagrams below, the exchange is constructed as a blockchain transaction by both
parties and submitted to the blockchain for confirmation. The success of this exchange
depends on the match of asset types and quantities provided by both parties.

Payment Protocol
Payment or collections protocol similar to BIP703 can be implemented using the
atomic exchange of payment request and LCT. The payment request is implemented
with payment details containing the merchant’s identity, and contains the PKI
certificate and digital signature along with payment receipt information. This
information is stored as meta-data on the blockchain and associated with the
completed transaction as part of the atomic asset exchange.

Identity Management / Know-Your-Customer (KYC)
The identity information, such as a merchant’s identity, is maintained at two levels - a
public identity information and private identity information, based on the web-of-trust
design.
•

•

Public Identity Information is maintained on Sentinel Chain and is stored as
X.509 digital signature certificates with the owner’s CrossPay Blockchain
address.
Private Identity Information is maintained on CrossPay Blockchains as a
hash to the identity attributes such as date of birth are encrypted and stored
along with the verifier’s signature such as local financing companies. These
attributes are stored off-chain for security purpose.

The identity owner can selectively provide verified identity attribute to third party
upon request, such as for KYC purposes.

Livestock Insurance Process
The livestock record registration process includes 3 functions:
• For the livestock insurance company to record its issuance of the livestock ID tag
on the blockchain.
• For the livestock insurance company to attest to the identity of the unbanked
farmer who registered to use its service.
• For the unbanked farmer to apply the livestock ID tag onto the cow and record the
ownership, timestamp and geolocation information onto the blockchain as a proofof-ownership.

The livestock insurance purchase process serves the following functions:
• For the livestock insurance company to verify the existence and health of the
livestock and issue an insurance policy that is tied to the livestock, linked to the
livestock ID tag.
• For the unbanked farmer to digitally acknowledge the insurance policy and
provide proof of insurance ownership via the blockchain.

44 of 50

Livestock Collateralised Loan
The livestock collateralised loan application process serves the following function:
•
•
•

For the lender to verify the true ownership and insurance protection belonging to
the unbanked livestock.
For the lender to verify the identity of the borrower that is also attested by the
insurance company to prevent loan fraud via forged identity.
For the unbanked to prove its identity, ownership of the livestock asset as well as
ownership of insurance policy from verified livestock insurance company.

E-Payment
The loan agreement can be used by the local lender to offer loans to the unbanked
users or in the alternative, offer LCT as a loan to the unbanked to spend within the
local ecosystem with merchants who accept LCT as a form of payment.

Balance of Incentives
The ecosystem is maintained by balancing the incentives between unbanked,
insurance company and lender.
The farmer needs to:
•
•

Provide farmer’s true identity in order to make a livestock insurance claim.
Use the livestock insurance as a proof-of-ownership to increase the chance of
collateralising the livestock for cheaper loans.

The insurance company needs to:
• Ensure that the livestock is real and is fit to be insured.
• Ensure that the identity of the livestock matches that stated in the insurance
policy in the event of an insurance claim.
The lender needs to:
•
•
•
•

Ensure that the livestock is real and is fit to be insured.
Ensure that the farmer is the true owner of the livestock.
Ensure that the livestock has not been collateralised for other loans.
Lend at a lower interest rate when the livestock has been authenticated and
insured by an insurance company.

As a result, livestock owners has a higher incentive to provide accurate data regarding
their identity as well as the ownership of the livestock. The livestock insurance data
stored on the blockchain is further protected by a community of lenders that has no
incentive to collude with the insurance company to attack the blockchain. There may
be an incentive for the unbanked farmer to collude with the livestock insurance agent
to defraud the lender. This can happen if the rogue agent were to issue a tag for a nonexistence livestock for the unbanked to collateralise it for loan. But since the tag
cannot be removed without destroying the chip containing the livestock address,
therefore a physical inspection by the lender before approving the loan can be used to
verify the claim.

Appendix D – Sentinel Chain Design
The “Sentinel Chain” is implemented as a consortium blockchain that operates with
decentralised governance. Each consortium member is represented by a cluster of nodes on
the Sentinel Chain known as the Sentinel Nodes. This decentralized governance model
requires that 60% of consortium members’ approval are required for the addition of a new
consortium member.
Cross-Chain Interoperability
There are generally three types of techniques in chain interoperability4.
• A centralised, multisignature (“multisig”) notary scheme, whereby a group of
parties agree to carry out an action on Chain B when some event on chain A
takes place. For instance, Interledger5 follows such a model.
• Sidechains6, or relays, are able to validate events on an external chain as part
of local event validation
• Hash-locking utilizes events on different chains which are unlocked by a
single shared value.
However, most of these techniques are often discussed under the context of a public
blockchain ecosystem where a fully untrusted environment is involved and no
restrictions on permissions and memberships. The use of private blockchains
introduces centralization and new complexities. Considerations must be given to the
different permissions granted to the connecting nodes on their respective blockchains
as well as the type of assets that are allowed to participate in cross-chain transactions.
Cross-Chain Atomic Swap
The design of Sentinel Chain Cross-Chain is fundamentally based on the algorithm
proposed by Tier Nolan in 2014 to facilitate peer-to-peer trade exchange7, commonly
known as cross-chain atomic swap. This technique has inspired and was adopted by
various other blockchain protocols such as Lightning Networks, Raiden and others.
For this to work, the hash function to be used between the two interacting chains must
utilize (1) same hashing formula in order for the secret to be shared, (2) multisignature support. To illustrate how this works conceptually, we assume both Alice
and Bob have a wallet on blockchain A and blockchain B and wish to exchange asset
LCT.A and LCT.B. Alice wish to swap LCT.A for LCT.B with Bob.
•

•
•

•

Alice must broadcast a transaction for sending LCT.A to Bob’s wallet
address on blockchain A locked with hash of Bob’s secret that only Bob will
know.
Bob broadcast a transaction sending LCT.B to Alice on blockchain B (the
same hash function) locked with the same hash.
In order to receive LCT.A on blockchain A, Bob must unlock LCT.A by
broadcasting a transaction that contains the secret onto blockchain A;
therefore revealing the secret to Alice.
Alice can therefore unlock the LCT.B being sent to her by using Bob’s
revealed secret on blockchain B.

This approach can be supplemented by additional time-locked transactions that can be
broadcasted for refunded to both parties in the event that the exchange does not take
place within a limited amount of time.
Sentinel Chain Cross-Chain Design
Sentinel Chain adapted this technique for use with permissioned nodes called the
Sentinel Node that contains address on both the interacting blockchains. Since the
actual implementation of the Sentinel Chain Ecosystem involves 3 types of
blockchains at varying levels of trust - CrossPay Blockchains, Sentinel Chain and the
public Ethereum network, the design for cross-chain interoperability features must
strike a balance between practicality and security.

To illustrate how the cross-chain interoperability can be implemented for the Sentinel
Chain Ecosystem, the following example assumes an overseas lender on the public
Ethereum network transferring SENC tokens to a local financing company to be
converted into Local CrossPay Token (LCT) for use in the CrossPay Blockchain.
Step 1: From Ethereum to Sentinel Chain. Offshore lender performs an atomic
cross-chain swap using SENC ERC223 tokens from its Ethereum wallet to Sentinel
Node’s Ethereum wallet. Sentinel Node on Sentinel Chain performs an atomic crosschain swap using SENC.USD to offshore lender’s Sentinel Chain wallet. SENC.USD
represents the USD equivalent value of SENC that resides internally within Sentinel
Chain only. This assumes the USD to SENC currency exchange rate is known and
agreed upon prior to the transfer and that the Sentinel Node has sufficient balance of
SENC.USD to complete the swap.

Step 2: From within Sentinel Chain. Offshore lender performs atomic exchange
using SENC.USD for IOU.USD from local lender on the Sentinel Chain. Local lender
issues IOU.USD and performs atomic exchange with offshore lender on the Sentinel
Chain in return for SENC.USD. This assumes the IOU includes relevant terms related
to interest rates and that the offshore lender has sufficient balance in its SENC.USD
wallet to complete the exchange.

Step 3: From within Sentinel Chain. Local lender performs another atomic
exchange between SENC.USD with SENC.XXX (where XXX represents local
currency) with a Liquidity Provider residing within Sentinel Chain. The role of
Liquidity Provider is currently performed by InfoCorp using a pre-funded liquidity
pool of fiat currencies raised via the SENC token sale and held in multicurrency
account with InfoCorp’s settlement bank.

SENC that resides internally within Sentinel Chain only. This assumes that the
Sentinel Node has sufficient balance of LCT.USD to complete the swap.
