Introduction
About Fantasy Sports
Fantasy sports is a type of online game where participants assemble virtual
teams of professional players of a particular sport. Such teams then compete
based on their actual statistical performances in the actual games being played
by them. Based on this performance of the chosen players of the fantasy team,
the points for the team are compiled and totaled.
The point system for fantasy leagues are calculated by a league commissioner,
or may also be calculated by tracking actual results of the professional sport.
Thus, fantasy sports allow its players to involve themselves much more directly
during the entire duration of the league.
The medium allows individuals to exercise direct control over the operations of
their fantasy sports team. They also provide the individual with the chance to
live vicariously as general managers, franchise owners, or coaches of their own
team or teams by structuring and drafting the team. They also have the liberty
to structure the team in a manner where they can start and organize rosters of
athletes playing for them.
In addition, playing fantasy sports creates a competitive experience among
friends and fellow fantasy sports enthusiasts. The medium also enables sharing
of knowledge and expertise. These games also provide a platform for endusers to interact with their friends and colleagues while engaging in their
favorite leisure activity.

DFantasy
Conventional fantasy sports are centralized and heavily monopolistic. FanDuel
and DraftKings are the two big companies owning over 90% of DFS market.
High commission rates, lengthy verification process, unfair competition and
slow withdrawal of money are other major problems in conventional fantasy
sports.

Over 4 billion people across the globe follow some kind of sports. Fantasy
sports users, however, have increased to 59.3 million in US and Canada in
2017. Our team, being a team of crypto and sports enthusiasts, believes that
there is a huge pool of market uncashed due to the lack of accessibility. Our
team knows that users do not have access to fantasy sports due to the lack or
weak payment infrastructure in these parts of the world as we belong here.
The existing fantasy sports platforms hugely focus on American football and
basketball which are not very popular in other parts of the world. We want to
build a platform which provides wide variety of fantasy sports which is
accessible to every users.
DFantasy is a decentralized, blockchain-based fantasy sports platform. It is
built on top of ethereum technology. We want to use blockchain in the fantasy
sports to make the platform inexpensive, fast and highly accessible. Users all
over the globe can enjoy the wide variety of sports anonymously.

Market
Fantasy sports is ever growing market. About 59.3 million users play fantasy

Problems in existing platform
Online fantasy sports industry is immature and thriving to grow its market.
There are various shortcomings like high rates of commission, lack of variety in
sports, lengthy verification process and so on.

Accessibility
85% of fantasy sports users are from North America and 95% expenses are
made by these users. There are many sports followers apart from these parts
of the world who are not reached by these platforms. The major fantasy sports
platforms hugely focus their marketing campaigns in North America and they
have leagues only for sports popular in those parts. One of the reasons we
believe for this sort of targeting should be the lack of efficient payment system
in many countries in the world.

High Commission Rate
Existing major fantasy sports platforms charge around 10% as commission
which is a very high rate. Smaller the pool size, more the charge is. This really
affects the majority of fantasy players and beneficial for the large players. The
major essence of fantasy sports is disturbed by this structure of commission as
the smaller players are discouraged due to the higher rate of charges in
smaller pools.

Lengthy Verification Process
Verification process in existing fantasy platforms are lengthy and complicated.
Users need various government issued documents to make themselves eligible
to play fantasy sports. The whole process can get tedious, troublesome,
lengthy and complicated.

Slow Transaction Of Funds
The amount which is rightfully yours as you have won it with your skills and
investments can get stuck due to various technical and legal obstructions.
Existing platforms can take from 1 week to several weeks to withdraw your
fund electronically or by check. The companies can even deny your fund as
they have ‘right to refuse your withdrawal and close your account’.Unfair
Competitions

Unfair Competition
Large players in fantasy sports can use scripts and algorithms to create many
possible combinations of line ups which increases the probability of them
winning the league nearly to 100%. Existing platforms allow users to
participate any number of teams of one particular user to join the league which
provides the larger players the opportunity to outplay the smaller players with
their huge investments and infrastructures.

12

Solution
There are various problems and shortcomings in the existing fantasy platforms
to overcome which we want to develop decentralized fantasy platform which is
inexpensive, fast and fun. The features which help overcome the shortcomings
of existing platforms are discussed as follows.

Anonymity
All users need to participate in the contests in our platform are wallet address
and FAN tokens. Public address is the only thing that represents user in the
blockchain. This prevents the lengthy verification process which are must in
the existing fiat-based fantasy platforms.

Accessibility
As discussed above, the only things required to enter a contest in DFantasy
platform are wallet address and FAN tokens. The geographical locations and
the lack of credit card information do not prohibit users from participating in
their favorite fantasy sport leagues.

Faster Transactions
As a user wins a contest, their fund instantly gets transferred to their wallet
address. The transaction time is as long as it takes for the miners to mine the
transaction which is usually couple of minutes.

Low Rakes(Commission)
In our DFantasy platform, leagues are created by users and certain(very
small)percentage of the winning amount is transferred to the league creator for
contributing to the platform by creating leagues. We as a development team

13

will get a very small percentage of the winning amount. Overall, the overall
percentage of commission will not exceed 2-3%.

Fair competition
To make the platform for all players with varying skill sets and varying
budgets, we are discussing on various potential solutions.

1. Efficient Pricing
We are putting our efforts on building an algorithm to efficiently calculate
the salary of players based on their opponents as well. Obviously, the
metrics like their earlier performances will be taken into consideration.
We are also discussing on pricing the players by the ‘wisdom of crowd’
approach.

2. Limiting Entry
Skilled players joining almost every contests in the platform make the
league uninteresting and unfair. For this purpose, we will be limiting the
players to join only certain number of contests per day. We will also only
allow certain number of teams to enter a particular contest for a user to
prevent user from running unnatural tricks to create the line ups.

3. Private Leagues
Private leagues can be created which will not be visible for public. The
unique code to join the league can be shared to friends, colleagues,
relatives or whoever the league creator want to play the league with.

14

Product Detail
In DFanatasy platform, users holding threshold number of 10,000 FAN tokens
are allowed to create leagues. Once the league is completed and the winners
are decided, the league creator will get certain percentage of FAN tokens as
reward for creating the league and helping the platform. User creates the
league, user plays and users earn the tokens. We like to call this process as
the democratization of fantasy sports. League creator can create private and
public leagues.

• Private League
Private leagues are not visible to any user in the platform. The league creator
can invite her friends by sharing a unique code to join the league.

• Public League
Public leagues ,in contrast to private league, can be viewed and joined by
anyone by paying the entry fees.

League Types
Daily, weekly and season long will be the three types of leagues provided in
DFantasy platform providing league creator with options on how long she
wants the league to run.

1. Daily Fantasy Sport

Daily Fantasy Sport(DFS) is played by picking the players participating
in a sport event taking place that day. The winner is decided by
statistically calculating the points of the user according to the performance
of the players she picked before the match.

15

2. Weekly
Users pick players participating in that particular gameweek. Other
protocols are similar to DFS.

3. Season long
Season long fantasy are considered as traditional fantasy sports.
These fantasy sports run throughout the season and winners are
decided in the end of the season.

Fantasy Sports Types
On the basis of how players are picked and how the league runs, draft
fantasy and capped fantasy are two widely popular types of fantasy sports.
Technically, draft and capped are algorithms which are used to conduct the
league. We are going to introduce the third type of algorithm odd fantasy.

1. Draft Fantasy
There are two types of draft: snake and auction draft. Basically snake
draft algorithm allows participants to pick players in turn. Once all the
participants complete picking their players of choice, it is called a round.
In the next round, players turns are reversed to provide every
participants equal chance of picking their favorite players. The rounds
continue and turns are reversed until all the participants have

2. Salary-capped fantasy

Every participants are provided with equal budget and players are
priced with salary. Participants can pick any players and build their
squad but not exceed the budget. Participants may have same players
in their squad but in draft, players do not repeat in different squads in

16

3. Odd fantasy
Odd fantasy is our organic concept. It is in many aspects similar to the
salary capped fantasy except there is no cap fixed. The more
expensive one builds her squad, more the entry fees will be. If the
squad is inexpensive, the entry fees will be lower accordingly. The
total sum of all entry fees will be the winning amount. The participant
with inexpensive squad will have better odds but less chance to win
and the one with expensive squad will have less odds but better
chance to win.

Sports Included
DFantasy is the platform where FAN tokens can be used to play the fantasy
sports. DFantasy is a flexible platform and new sports can be added efficiently
into the platform.

1. Soccer
Various leagues of soccer are played in most of the countries in the
world. Premiere league is the most widely followed league and is
competitive league as well.
In the initial phase of DFantasy platform, we will include Premiere
league as the first league so that many users can be reached. We plan
on including other leagues like La Liga (Spain), Serie A(Italy),
Bundesliga(Germany), Ligue 1(France). We will also add other leagues
like Major Soccer League (USA), Campeonato Brasileiro Série A
(Brazil) and other major leagues played across the world. We will also
try and add major Asian leagues.
Major world events of soccer like FIFA World Cup, FIFA Confederation
Cup, UEFA Euro Cup, Copa America will also be added.

17

2. American Football
American football is the most popular fantasy sports. We will have
National Football League NFL (USA) and Canadian Football League
CFL (Canada) in our platform.

3. Cricket
Cricket has a very genuine and passionate followers across the
CommonWealth nations. The sport is expanding its followers in other
parts of the world like America both North and South. Cricket
Leagues are not very long and usually international cricket are more
popular and followed.
T20 leagues are recently gaining more popularity in countries like
India, Australia, England, Bangladesh and West Indies.
In DFantasy platform, we will include T20 leagues like IPL (Indian
Premiere League, India), Big Bash League (BBL, Australia), NatWest
T20 Blast (England Cricket Board), Caribbean Cricket League (CCL,
West Indies Cricket Board now the Windies) and Bangladesh
Premiere League (BPL, Bangladesh).
World events organized by ICC like ICC World Cup (ODI and T20)
and ICC Champions Trophy will be added to the platform.
Other team sports like basketball, baseball and hockey will be
continuously added as the platform and user grow.

18

FAN token
FAN tokens are the only tokens which are used to participate in the fantasy
sports available in the DFanstasy platform. FAN tokens are paid to enter into
the contests available in DFantasy platform and the winning amount are
rewarded in FAN tokens. At least 10000 FAN tokens are required to be hold by
user to create a league. The league creator is awarded with FAN tokens as
reward for creating the contest. FAN tokens have various usabilities which are

1. Participation
As discussed above, FAN tokens are the only tokens used to participate
in the fantasy sports available in our platform.

2. Create League
The users who hold at least 10,000 tokens at the time have the
opportunity to create the league and earn x% of winning FAN tokens
as reward.

FAN tokens can be acquired by joining the pre- ICO and phases of ICOs.Those
who miss the ICOs can later acquire the FAN tokens from various exchanges
with BTC, ETH and other coins.

Playing DFantasy Platform from User Perspective
Users do not need to create an account to access the DFantasy platform as the
platform guarantees the anonymity of user. The user once gets in the platform
can search various public leagues available for their favorite sport. If the user
does not find the appropriate league for her to join, she can create her own
league(if she has at least 10,000 tokens). To join the league, however, user
must deposit the FAN tokens as entry fees. To deposit those tokens, user
should make the signed transaction i.e user must sign with her private key or
keystore file and password. We do not save or access these information any
further after making the deposit.Once the league is joined, user can participate
19

in various activities as the league proceeds depending on the type of league.
Winners will be declared and the FAN tokens won will be immediately
transferred to the public wallet address of the winning user. The league creator
will be awarded with x% of winning FAN tokens after the league is completed.

20

Technology
At the moment we are looking for off chain stack as (Erlang, go) etc for
backend system (nodes) to extract player points and run algorithm. We are
expecting the system to be

•

High performant
Fault tolerance
Realtime
distributed

We are developing Dfantasy platform as high load system. Fantasy sport is
huge market and at pick hours traffic can be very high. For this we need
system to be highly concurrent, distributed and high performance. Erlang is
well known for handling these issues. On the next phase we will be using
Ethereum blockchain and solidity framework
for handling transaction,
calculating results, and allocating token for league owners through Dapps.
