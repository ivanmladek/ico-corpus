Abstract

UCHAIN WHITEPAPER
The next generation Distributed smart network
blockchain for the sharing economy

Abstract
The market size of the global sharing economy is expected to reach 520 billion
US dollars in 2018, according to Roland Berger’s report [1] on the sharing
economy. Along with the rapid growth, there are more problems exposed in
this disruptive business such as:
•

Excessive transaction costs
Centralized platforms charge high commission fees for service
matchmaking.

•

The problem of trust
There is no effective credit system reflecting both individual credit
and organization credit.

•

Data leakage and abuse
Centralized data storage mechanism can easily lead to data leakage
and misuse.

In our daily practice, we have come to realize and attribute these problems to
the excessive centralization of the business. Combining U-bicycle’s experience
in the practice of sharing transportations along with support from our strategic
partners, we have been working on a solution, realizing the way to solve these
issues will be through the implementation of a truly free peer-to-peer network
with the combination of blockchain technology along with an underlying sense
of the sharing economy.
UChain is a public infrastructure blockchain network specifically designed for
the global sharing economy. Along with other sharing economy enterprises,
we aspire to build a decentralized worldwide sharing economy ecosystem
where every user can exchange value and publish contents freely without
intermediaries Through UChain and its decentralized autonomous ecosystem,
all users and merchants will be empowered.

Current State of the Sharing Economy Ecosystem

1 Current State of the Sharing Economy Ecosystem
1.1

Potential Growth in the Sharing Economy
The sharing economy is also known as a collaborative economy or peer-to-peer economy. One of the pioneers in the
sharing economy, Ms. Robin Chase, has given the formula for the sharing economy: 𝐼𝑑𝑙𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑠 + 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚 +
𝑝𝑢𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑐 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑦. In the era of the sharing economy 1.0, people provide their idle
resources, either a physical property or a service through a third-party platform for other people in exchange for
money.
Current iconic companies in the sharing economy can be divided into 8 major sectors:
Shared Accommodation (Airbnb), Shared Work-space (We-Work), Shared Services (TaskRabbit), Shared Transportation
(Uber, Didi, Grab), Shared Resources (Open Garden), Shared Knowledge (Quora), Shared Medical Services (Medicast),
and Shared Education (Coursera, KHAN).

1.2

Current Problems in the Sharing Economy
All of the iconic sharing economy companies are still in generation 1.0, where users are not truly making
communication peer-to-peer. Users still obtain matchmaking services through a centralized platform. All exchange of
services and values need to be managed and distributed through intermediaries, bringing up some substantial
shortcomings.

1.2.1

Excessive Transaction Costs
Excessive transaction costs have always been the norm in the centralized matchmaking business which is no different in
the sharing economy. For example, Uber's key profit comes from commissions with the rate starting at 20% [2] and
varying (usually higher) at different times and locations. Most companies try to maximize their profit while reaching
their operational KPI (key performance indicator). Hence, sometimes they will limit the supply of their sharing service in
order to maximize profit. Among famous unicorn companies, this practice is even more common, since they have
gained a considerable market share that allows them to challenge and test user’s acceptance of price and service
quality. Banks and other financial institutes would charge users extra transaction fees, with more costs being added to
the user if they’re using fiat via the default payment gateway.

1.2.2

The Problem of Trust
Trust is essential for the sharing economy. In order to make a transaction possible, the consumers and suppliers of the
market have to achieve a mutual trust first. Traditional technology has not been able to solve the problem of trust
between people through technical means. As a result, the platform, acting as an intermediary, vouches for both parties
to facilitate the transaction. Sometimes it collects deposits or collateral from both parties to reduce the financial risk,
which has virtually increased the barriers and cost to the sharing economy.

Current State of the Sharing Economy Ecosystem

Data Leakage and Abuse
The sharing economy and the companies behind it have benefited everyone, bringing a more convenient lifestyle. At
the same time, more users give out their identity information for registration purposes. At present, most companies
and sharing economy platforms store users’ data in centralized databases. If the server is breached or any inappropriate
internal management conduction is performed, a large number of sensitive data would be at the risk of theft and
leakage. In Uber's 2016 user data breach, the data leak was due to inappropriate user data access on third-party cloud
services performed by two people outside the company. Hackers gained access to over 600,000 U.S. driver's name and
license numbers, as well as the personal information of 57 million Uber users worldwide, including e-mail addresses and
mobile phone numbers. In 2017, Equifax, the largest US credit rating company, also leaked 140 million users’ data from
various malicious attacks, which equates to nearly half of the U.S. population’s information.
Data abuse is also a common social phenomenon, with users having to provide their personal information such as
phone numbers and email addresses to the sharing platform of their choice. After obtaining user's information, instead
of complying with the user agreement, some companies use this data for other purposes, with some cases showing it
being sold for money. The recent Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal involves the collection of personally
identifiable information of up to 87 million Facebook users that Cambridge Analytica began collecting in 2014. The data
was used to influence voter opinion on behalf of politicians who hire them. Not only do users not have control over
their own data, they sometimes will also be troubled by all kinds of harassment.

The UChain Solution

2 The UChain Solution
The essence of blockchain is an autonomous peer-to-peer network. It can achieve a tamper-proof, decentralized and
fully autonomous ecology that everyone can participate in, which coincides with the nature of the sharing economy.
The sharing economy is a peer-to-peer business model that would be in a far more advanced state with the application
of blockchain. The idea behind the community autonomy would inspire people around the world to participate in and
benefit from the development of UChain.

2.1
2.1.1

Blockchain solutions
Excessive Transaction Costs
UChain will establish a decentralized Blockchain network. During the peer-to-peer transaction settlement between user
and service providers, intermediaries will be cut off and we estimate to reduce the transaction fee by nearly 20%.
During the transaction, UChain's token will be used as a transaction certificate when the user subscribes to or purchases
a service, such as booking a room. The user may need to freeze a certain amount of tokens as a deposit, which will be
released upon completion of the transaction. The whole transaction process will be handled by smart contracts and
cross-chain hosting technology to ensure the authenticity, legality, and compliance. With users and merchants using
UCN for transacting, we will be able to achieve a real-time settlement and eliminate the risk and cost involved with the
usual way of payment on existing platforms

2.1.2

User Credit Passport
UChain records transaction activities on the Blockchain, which is broadcasted and stored by nodes in the network. This
distributed ledger is tamperproof with and fully traceable, creating a decentralized and unbreakable "chain of trust."
In this "chain of trust", UChain will establish a credit passport mechanism open to all sharing service providers. Keeping
track of all participants’ behavior once the user's credit passport is verified by the service provider, they can use it as
identity authentication and directly transact without having to pay a deposit. UChain will be integrated with a variety of
sharing economy enterprises specialized in travel, travel, accommodation, knowledge, and education industry. In the
nearby future, users can use it on different occasions for various services, bringing them much smoother experience

2.1.3

Security of Users’ Data
UChain records user and service provider’s data on the Blockchain, such as identity information, property information,
transaction records and reviews on different services. Instead of storing and accessing data from a centralized database,
we store and extract data through a distributed storage scheme with a private key, which means that data cannot be
tampered with and is only accessible by the owner. Users and service providers have to sign with their private key if
they want to revise their information, with all changes being fully traceable.
With the distributed storage scheme, data will be encrypted, split, shredded and scattered on different nodes. Retrieval
of any single piece of data stored by a node will not be complete or readable. It ensures that if a single node is
compromised, it does not reveal full information.
When UChain records data on the Blockchain, it is actually storing the address where they can retrieve this data. UChain
is able to modify user’s data access through a smart contract, only under the user’s authorization. When users authorize
the merchants to access their data, the authorization information such as access time and operation log, along with the
user’s public key signature will be recorded on the blockchain, making all actions traceable, eliminating the possibility of
data misappropriation.

2.2
2.2.1

Value recreation: Sharing Economy 2.0
The new Sharing Economy Model
In the sharing economy 1.0, intermediary platforms play an important role by facilitating the transactions between
users, whilst charging commissions for this service. All transaction settlements are dealt with in fiat, however, in the
new sharing economy 2.0 era, users are connected peer-to-peer without intermediaries and commissions, with all
transactions being settled in the local token.

The UChain Solution

In addition, our underlying Blockchain architecture will provide users and enterprises the opportunity to distribute their
own tokens. Through UChain, users can easily share, pay, and settle sharing services. UChain also encourages users and
service providers to contribute their idle resources to the ecosystem for more token rewards and community
interaction.

2.2.2

Dependent digital assets distribution
UChain will look to cut out the intermediaries by developing a peer-to-peer transaction network, giving the benefits
back to users and service providers. Furthermore, the service providers can issue their own digital assets, tokenizing
their own sharing services. Besides acting as the main circulating currency for every transaction taking place in the
UChain ecosystem, UCN can also be employed as the basic unit in exchange for other tokens issued by service providers
who decide to build within the ecosystem.
Any DApps built on top of UChain can issue their own token and develop its sub ecosystem. For example, U-Parking, a
strategic partner, can build their own DApp with our infrastructure Blockchain and various API services provided. In
addition to developing their own DApp, they can also issue their own token in exchange for UCN from their service
users. U-Parking can use all UCN raised from its token sale to pay for API services provided by UChain. Users can use its
native token to pay for sharing parking services provided by U-Parking with an exclusive offer. U-Parking could also
build its sub ecosystem where its users can participate in and own these tokens such as by contributing their idle
parking spots.
As more and more sub-ecosystems issue their own tokens, UChain will also build a DEX (decentralized exchange) to
provide liquidity options for these tokens.

Technical Framework

3 Technical Framework
UChain’s overall product structure can be divided into four layers: core blockchain layer, API / SDK Layer, service layer,
and application layer.
The UChain platform uses a middleware technology that combines innovative blockchain technology with traditional
database technologies to enable the creation of tables similar to traditional databases on the blockchain, enabling rapid
conversion of platform data between local databases and blockchains. Only by using this technology can we ensure that
complex data and historical reviews within shared economy applications can be stored intact, well-structured and
quickly on the blockchain. The UChain platform adopts the same properties that all blockchain data cannot be
tampered with, including service providers' transaction records, historical reviews, and other structured data to ensure
legitimacy.

Technical Framework

Core Blockchain layer
Distributed Shared Ledger [3]
UChain is deploying a decentralized peer-to-peer distributed storage technique by applying a DHT (Distributed Hash
Table) based distributed storage protocol, with data being indexed by file content (Hash) instead of a file path (URL).
Large files will be partitioned into fixed-size data chunks and distributed across multiple nodes. Each file fragment is
indexed by a hash value, which is stored in the distributed hash table of each node. When the user needs to extract the
complete file,
the Kademlia DHT algorithm [4] will retrieve the file fragments from the distributed storage network, and reassemble it
into a complete file. Each server node does not have a complete file or even a full fragment index from one file.
Therefore, if a single server is compromised by hackers, they cannot obtain complete file data.
The customer's sensitive data, track data with core values and unstructured data on the platform, including avatars and
photos, are all stored on a distributed storage network. The data hash index will also be saved on the blockchain.
Comparing the hash later can identify the authenticity of the data.
One of the main problems with this kind of system is the need to balance between redundancy and reliability. This
conflict is resolved through implementing token incentives and backbone nodes. Users can choose reliability for files,
low-reliability files can be stored and accessed for free or minimum cost. Highly reliable files will be provided by stable
and reliable services from backbone nodes.
The block data structure of UChain is as follows:

public class Block //Block
{
public uint Version;
public UInt256 PrevBlock;
public UInt256 MerkleRoot;
public uint Timestamp;
public uint Bits;
public ulong Nonce;

Consensus Mechanism (RPCA) [5]
When choosing a consensus mechanism algorithm, UChain considered several mainstream algorithms, including POW,
POS, DPOS, DBFT, and RPCA (Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm), and finally chose RPCA as UChain's consensus
algorithm utilizing the fact that RPCA is designed primarily for transaction speed, aligning with various scenario needs in
the sharing economy. The information can be broadcasted efficiently to every node in a few seconds with high
performance and high Byzantine fault tolerance. Moreover, the RPCA algorithm has been proven robust and effective
with Ripple.
Transaction speed and high concurrency are two benchmarks to evaluate the system designed for the sharing economy,
and with that we ruled out PoW and PoS, which are slow in block generation, thus, heavily reducing transaction speed.
The main purpose of RPCA is designed for transaction speed, which also meets the scenarios in the sharing economy.
The information can be broadcasted efficiently to every node in a few seconds with high performance and high
Byzantine fault tolerance. Moreover, the RPCA algorithm has been proven robust and effective in Ripple.
The UChain network generates a new block every few seconds by reaching consensus through the RPCA algorithm,
assuming that the consensus process is successful and there is no fork in the network. The newly generated block is
unique across the entire network.
The RPCA algorithm completes the transaction in two stages, the first is to achieve consensus on the transaction set,
the second is to propose the newly generated block and add it to the blockchain.
The consensus achievement of a transaction set is carried out in sub-rounds. The following operations are performed
in each round:
A.
B.

10

Each node collects as many possible consensus-required transactions as possible in the "candidate set" at the
beginning of the consensus.
Each node makes a union of its "candidate set" in the list of trusted nodes and votes for each transaction.

Copyright 2018 UChain
C.
D.

Technical Framework

The UNL service nodes will communicate node to node about the result of the votes. The transactions that
reach a certain approval percentage will reach the next round. Others will be discarded or re-elected in the next
consensus process round.
In the final round, all transactions with more than 80% of approval votes will be placed in a consensus
transaction set. The transaction set here is similar to Bitcoin and is in the structure of a Merkle tree.

After the transaction set is formed, each node starts to pack new blocks. The process of packaging blocks is as
follows:
A.
B.
C.

D.

The creation of a block hash consisting of the following: a new block number + the Merkle tree root hash of the
consensus transaction set + the parent block hash + the current timestamp.
Each node broadcasts its own block hash to its visible nodes. The visible nodes not only refer to the nodes in the
trusted list but also to the nodes that can be discovered through the node discovery process.
After the node collects the hash of the block broadcasted by the nodes in all its trusted lists, it combines the
block hash generated by itself to calculate a ratio for each block hash.
If the ratio of a certain hash exceeds the threshold (usually 80%) it is considered to be the block hash that
achieves consensus. If your own hash agrees, it indicates that the block you packed has been confirmed,
agreed upon and therefore is stored locally while its status is also updated at the same time.
If your hash is different from the consensus hash, then you will be required to go to a node with the
correct hash in a block and request the new block information, store it locally and update to the current
state.
If there is no hash above a set threshold for a block then consensus process is restarted until the condition is
met.

At this point, the consensus process of one block ends and the next round follows.
Consistency in RPCA is ensured by the connectivity of sub-networks to other sub-networks. To ensure that the
blockchain is not forked each sub-network must maintain connectivity with at least 20% of the entire network node.
While achieving 20% connectivity forking the blockchain is impossible;
For Instance, if the consensus block hash obtained in a sub-network is inconsistent with that of the entire network, 80%
of the consensus requirements cannot be reached.

Figure 3-2: RPCA sub-networks must maintain at least 20% connectivity
During each round of voting, the node will collect the response time of each node in its UNL (Unique Node List), and the
nodes with regular slow response times will be eliminated, so UNL can maintain a high communication efficiency. Under
the condition of effective communication, the RPCA (Robust Principal Component Analysis) algorithm can guarantee to
generate a block every 3 seconds. The test TPS is around 1500 which will cover most use cases.

3.1.3

Elliptic Curve Cryptography [6]
UChain uses ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) to sign digital assets to ensure the security of every transaction. The
public key can be calculated from a known private key. ECC is widely regarded as the most powerful asymmetric
algorithm given the key length, which has been fully exercised in the bitcoin network.

Technical Framework

ECC: Secp256k1 [7]
Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic
curves over finite fields. ECC requires smaller keys compared to non-ECC cryptography (based on plain Galois fields) to
provide equivalent security.
Elliptic curves are applicable for key agreements, digital signatures, pseudo-random generators and other tasks.
Indirectly, they can be used for encryption by combining the key agreement with a symmetric encryption scheme.
The elliptic curve refers to a homogeneous equation:

𝑌 2 + 𝑎1𝑥𝑦 + 𝑎3𝑦 = 𝑥 3 + 𝑎2𝑥 2 + 𝑎4𝑥 + 𝑎6
The combination of numbers and shapes, determined by the plain curve, where the coefficient
𝑎 𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, . . . 6) is defined in a domain, is a number field which can be rational, irrational or complex. Which
one is used in the ECC cryptosystem is defined in the finite field 𝑔𝑓(𝑝𝑟).
A special point called the infinity point and all the points on the ellipse form a set together with a defined addition
operation to form an Abel group
Each point on the curve must be non-singular. So-called “non-singular” or “smooth” in mathematics means that there is
a tangent at any point on the curve.

Figure 3-3: secp256k1's elliptic curve

Figure 3-4: secp256k1 random scattered points graph

This is a graph of secp256k1's elliptic curve 𝑦 2 = 𝑥 3 + 7 over the real numbers. Note that because secp256k1 is
actually defined over the field ℤ𝑝 , its graph will in reality look like random scattered points, as seen on Figure 6-3.
Secp256k1 refers to the parameters of the ECDSA curve, and is defined in Standards for Efficient Cryptography (SEC)
Secp256k1 was almost never used before Bitcoin became popular, but it is now gaining in popularity. Most commonlyused curves have a random structure, but secp256k1 was constructed in a special non-random way which allows for
especially efficient computation. As a result, it is often more than 30% faster than other curves if the implementation is
sufficiently optimized. Unlike the popular NIST curves, secp256k1's constants were selected in a predictable way, which
significantly reduces the possibility that the curve's creator inserted any sort of backdoor into the curve.

Technical details
As excerpted from Standards for Efficient Cryptography 2 (SEC 2): [7]
The elliptic curve domain parameters over 𝔽𝑝 associated with a Koblitz curve secp256k1 are specified by the

Properties
Secp256k1 has characteristic 𝑝, it is defined over the prime field ℤ𝑝 . Some other curves in common use have
characteristic 2, and are defined over a binary Galois field

𝑔𝑓(2𝑛 ), however secp256k1 is not one of them.

As the 𝑎 constant is zero, the 𝑎𝑥 term in the curve equation is always zero, hence the curve equation becomes
𝑦 2 = 𝑥 3 + 7.

SDK/API Layer
Smart Contract Systems
UChain's smart contracts include transaction processing and storage mechanisms, as well as a complete state machine
for accepting and processing various smart contracts, transaction storage and state processing are done on the
blockchain. Transactions mainly contain data that needs to be sent and the descriptions of said data are referred to as
events. After the transaction and event information is passed to the smart contract, the resource status in the contract
resource set will be updated, triggering the smart contract to perform state machine judgment. If the trigger condition
of one or more actions in the automatic state machine is satisfied, the contract is automatically executed by the state
machine according to the preset information.
According to the trigger condition contained in the event description information, the smart contract system
automatically sends out preset data resources and events including trigger conditions from the smart contract when the
trigger condition is satisfied. The core of the entire smart contract system is that all the transactions and events handled
by the smart contract are still exported as transactions and events. The smart contract is just a system of transaction
modules and state machines. It does not generate smart contracts, nor does it modify smart contracts, it only exists to a
set of complex digital promises with triggering conditions that can be properly implemented according to the
participants' will.

Smart contract construction and execution
1)
2)
3)

Multiple users participate in formulating a smart contract.
The contract is spread through the P2P network and stored on the blockchain.
Smart contracts embedded within the blockchain are automatically executed.

The following steps describe in detail the process of phase 1 “Multi-User Participation in Formulating a Smart
Contract”:
A.

The user must first register on the blockchain. The blockchain returns a pair of public and private keys to the
user, the public key is used as the account’s address within the blockchain, and the private key is the only way
to manage the account.

B.

Two or more parties, based on need, agree on a contract that includes the rights and obligations of both
parties, these rights and obligations are programmed in machine language. The contract is signed by both
parties with their private key to ensure the validity of the contract.

C.

The signed smart contract will be transmitted to the blockchain network along with its content.

The following steps describe in detail the process of phase 2 "Contracts are transmitted through the UChain network
and stored on the blockchain":

14

A.

The contract transmits across the entire blockchain network through p2p communication. Each node receives
a copy. The verification node in the blockchain first saves the received contract into memory and waits for a
new round of consensus to trigger and process the contract.

B.

When consensus arrives, the verification node will pack all the contracts saved in the most recent period
together into a set, calculate the Hash value of the contract set, and finally assemble the Hash values of the
contract set into a block structure, spreading to the entire network. Other verification nodes will receive the
hash of the contained contract collection and compare it with their own saved contract set. Sending a selfapproved contract set to other verification nodes, through this multiple rounds of transmission and
comparison, all verification nodes eventually agree on the latest set of contracts within a specified time.

C.

The latest contract set will be transmitted to the entire network in the structure of blocks. As shown in the
following figure, each block contains the following information:
- Hash value of the current block
- Hash value of the previous block
- The timestamp when consensus was reached
- Other descriptive information.

Copyright 2018 UChain

Technical Framework

The most important piece of information in the blockchain is a set of contracts that have reached consensus. The node
that receives the contract set will verify each contract and its participants’ signature and the verified contract will be
written on the blockchain.

Figure 3-5: Schematic diagram of smart contracts within blockchain blocks
The following steps describe the process of phase 3, “Built-in Blockchain Smart Contracts Auto-execute”
A.

The smart contract periodically traverses the state machines and checks their current status, transactions, and
trigger conditions contained in each contract one by one. The conditionally satisfied transaction is then
pushed into the queue to be verified and awaits consensus, transactions that do not satisfy the trigger
condition will remain on the blockchain.

B.

The events in the most recent verification process will be transmitted to each verification node. Like common
blockchain events or transactions, the verification node first performs signature verification to ensure the
validity of the events. Verified events will enter the pending consensus set to wait for the majority of
verification nodes to reach consensus. Once reached, the events will be successfully executed and notify the
user.

C.

After the event is successfully executed, the state machine of the smart contract will determine its status.
After all the events included in the contract are sequentially executed, the state machine marks the status of
the contract as completed and removes it from the latest block. It will otherwise be marked as “in progress”
and continue to be saved in the latest block for the next round of processing until it is marked as completed.
The entire event and its status are processed and completed by the smart contract system built into the
blockchain core. It is fully transparent and tamper-proof.

To achieve a more transparent ecosystem our platform will adopt a variety of methods to support the sharing economy
service providers in developing DApps and smart contracts including;
-

Blockchain virtual machines that support C++ and Solidity languages programming.
Convenient SQL commands within our smart contract storage system, due to our blockchain database storage
features.

Technical Framework

Modules
Basic service management module
The basic service is deployed on all blockchain nodes to verify the validity of the service request and record a valid
request after reaching consensus. For a new service request, the basic service adapts and analyzes the interface first
and then performs authentication processing. After the transaction or contract is signed and encrypted, it is added to
the block and broadcasted to achieve consensus between nodes. If consensus is achieved, it will be added to the next
block.

User Management module
Our user management module is responsible for managing the identity information of all blockchain participants,
including maintenance of public and private key generation, key storage management, and maintenance of the
relationship between user's real identity and their blockchain address. With authorization, it also supervises and audits
certain transactions.

Smart contract management module
Our smart contract module is responsible for the registering of contracts and managing the trigger conditions and
execution. After the user programs the contract and broadcasts it within the blockchain, the contract signed by both
parties will be executed if the conditions written within, are met.

Transaction mechanism
A transaction is the activity of changing rights of assets or contracts. UChain has designed several types of transactions
and all of them contain an input list, output list, signature list and transaction type related data.
To create a new user issued asset, the user can define the type, name, total amount and the administrator account for
specific assets. Creating assets requires consumption of a certain number of tokens as additional service charge.
•

•

Contract transaction: specifies all participated transactions and can determine whether they are required to
confirm acceptance according to asset type of each transaction. The counterparty may choose to accept (sign)
or reject (ignore).
Agency transaction: not specifying counterparty, but appointing an agent. This agent is responsible for matching
the counterparty of each transaction. The "superconducting transaction" is achieved through this transaction
type.

The data structure of the superconducting transaction is as follows:

public class Order // order ticket
{
public UInt256 AssetId;
public UInt256 ValueAssetId;
public UInt160 Agent;
public Fixed8 Amount;
public Fixed8 Price;
public UInt160 Client;
public TransactionInput[] Inputs;
public byte[][] Scripts;

Credit Rating System
What is a traditional credit rating model?
In the case of FICO [8], credit scores are dependent on five dimensions: Payment history, number of accounts, length of
credit card usage, type of credits, and number of new accounts.
Enterprise Credit Report Systems are alike, they all contain information such as bank credit reports, tax reports etc. The
data based on credit rating models share one common flaw, reliability of the rating depends on the reliability of its
model. Credit information is not direct but indirect data.
How do we perform credit rating through blockchain; User consensus + Coin Days Destroyed [9]
All we need is raw transaction data because blockchain transactions deal with the direction of time, so the marginal
cost of repeated consumption is no longer zero, it's proportional to coin days destroyed. Coin Days Destroyed is a very
important concept in blockchain. For any given transaction it is calculated by taking the number of coins in a transaction
and multiplying it by the number of days since those coins were spent. If someone has 10 coins they received 100 days
ago and they spend it today, then 1000 coin days have been destroyed.
Using coin days destroyed as the weighting factor for credit evaluation can prevent cheaters to repeatedly transfer
tokens between two accounts to increase credit. This can also prevent intentional negative reviews since higher coin
days destroyed means higher weight of a transaction in the credit evaluation.
When a cheater with two trading accounts tries to give himself a high credit score by transferring coins between
accounts repeatedly within a day, only the first transaction will count, as the total weight of coin days destroyed for all
transactions the cheater performed almost equals to the amount of the first transaction in the final credit evaluation.
This will also be the same for the users that have malicious intent and try to use small value transactions to purposely
create bad ratings. It will have little to no effect on the user’s credit.
The weighted model refers to the credit evaluation score obtained by the user multiplied by the coin days destroyed of
the transaction to get the user's final credit score. The model is as follows:

𝑖−𝑛

𝑅𝑛 = ∑ 𝑅𝑖 ∗ 𝑊𝑖
𝑖−1

𝑊𝑖 = 𝐶𝑖 ∗ 𝐷𝑖
𝑅𝑖 ∈ {−1,0,1}
𝑖, 𝑊𝑖 , 𝐶𝑖 , 𝐷𝑖 ∈ (0, +∞)

𝑅𝑛
𝑅𝑖
𝑊𝑖
𝐶𝑖
𝐷𝑖

= a user's final credit score.
= the credit score a user obtains when the 𝑖𝑡ℎ transaction is done.
= coin days destroyed of 𝑖𝑡ℎ transaction.
= the value of 𝑖 ′𝑠 transaction
= the period of time between 𝑖𝑡ℎ transaction and the last transaction before it.

In addition, UChain also introduces credit data from third-party credit rating agencies as part of the "user credit pass"
ecosystem. It is responsible for providing a reliable AI algorithm to get the user information from UChain’s DApps to
obtain a reliable data analysis result thus achieving a reliable credit output and UCN as a reward.

Technical Framework

Service Layer
Account Management Module
Our account management module is responsible for the identity authentication of the user's account, including the
registration, login, and logout process, along with irrelevant private key processing of the account. When the account is
registered, the identity information such as the username and password used by the original user is mapped to the
UChain blockchain address. After the account is logged in, blockchain-related service requests can be sent. For
situations with a high degree of transaction confidentiality, the user may choose irrelevant processing with the
blockchain address, so that different transactions of the same user are not repeatedly recorded in the block, thereby,
improving user security and transaction confidentiality.

Policy Management Module
Our policy management module includes "policy configuration", "data security", "access control" and “regulation and
audit”, which are responsible for permission control and management of user data, private key system, nodes joining
and exiting, and data access. It also includes audit permission, account delegation permission, node consensus
permission and data access permission. The audit permission is to provide the auditing function for the supervisory
authority with control over data scope and access permission, linking users who are not relevant to transactions on the
shared ledger. The account delegation permission is used to control the access to the user account through delegation.
Consensus permission manages the access permission of newly joining nodes. Access permissions are used to manage
the client's data query from the blockchain.

System Management Module
In order for the sharing service provider to be able to quickly migrate its existing service on UChain, UChain provides a
complete, express, and visualized operation monitoring system. It mainly includes system configuration, monitoring,
alarm, release, and service analysis functions. Operation scenarios such as the initial deployment of the system,
upgrade of running programs, and node expansion during operation can be supported by the releasing module. The
releasing module guarantees the consistency of executable programs such as interfaces, consensus algorithms, and
other important modules.

Smart Contract Management Module
UChain smart contract can be categorized into two types: standard contracts and custom contracts. Standard contracts
include relatively simple logic, such as asset consistency check, automatic deal closure, multi-party mutual confirmation
transfer, and automatic maturity settlement. User customized smart contracts support customized configuration and
added business logic to existing contract templates, which also support complex programmed contracts that run in a
separate environment.
Smart contracts are processed in four procedures;

18

1)

Contract registration:
The contract, along with its contents signed by participating parties will be broadcasted through the UChain
network and stored on our blockchain after consensus is reached.

2)

Contract trigger:
After the contract is registered, the contract execution can be triggered by an external condition being
reached, such as timing, event, transaction, etc.

3)

Contract Execution:
Contract execution refers to the complete process of running the contract code in a separate environment,
including building a mirror environment for the contract, where code is executed, and consensus is reached
after the state changes and consensus exception is handled.

4)

Contract termination:
The contract will be terminated or cleaned up if it has been executed, expired or business logic change is
made. The process of cleaning up requires a multi-node consensus before it can be completed.

Figure 3-6: UChain open platform structure

Open platform for enterprise level providers
Through API or SDK on UChain’s open platform, enterprises in the sharing economy can build DApps or simply migrate
their existing app onto UChain. After completing registration as a third-party operator they will receive value-added
services which include the ability to obtain new customers and tokens.
Our open platform will provide services that include the use of smart contracts, automatic split payments, key data on
chain inquiry, UIP, user credit ratings and a series of marketing functions.
Through UChain’s data analysis system we can achieve the following goals;

19

•

Sharing companies can access the platform, integrate resources across the platform, and cooperate with others
to achieve win-win results, thus developing a more competitive and valuable ecosystem.

•

Companies can update their company database, uploading user data and delivering valuable contents.

•

Integrate company’s online software and offline hardware to grow into a complete ecosystem.

•

Through data analysis, breach penalty, information encryption and enterprise alliance sub-systems, it supports
various business scenarios, expanding UChain ecosystem and increasing users’ engagement.

•

Transparent accounting and data management systems and improving the company’s credibility by publishing
and executing necessary actions such as data analysis, automatic split payment, incentive schemes, key data
inquiry and UCN token transfers.

•

Improved data collection capabilities as well as more accurate data analysis to produce user reports including;
daily application, application environment, personal data models.

Figure 4-1: The UChain ecosystem mechanics

4.1

Roles in the UChain Ecosystem
There are two major roles that drive the ecosystem, users and developers. Users can be categorized in service users,
independent service providers, and enterprise service providers. Independent developers or UChain foundation
developers create and maintain the infrastructure. They interact with each other, establishing their distinct values to
make UChain a better ecosystem.

Users
Users are the foundation of the whole ecosystem. Service users can pay UCN for any interesting service provided on the
DApps based on UChain or simply make transactions on UChain’s P2P transaction platform. Independent service
providers can acquire UCN either by contributing their idle resources or properties through the DApps.

Enterprises
Enterprise service providers can develop specialized DApps with UChain infrastructure to provide services. They will be
paid with a matching amount of UCN by the automatic payment functionality implemented in smart-contracts, after
user’s use of the DApp along with the incentive UCN provided by the ecosystem. Enterprises can also pay UCN for
UChain’s infrastructure services and UChain will purchase UCN back depending on the development of the whole
ecosystem.
All enterprises that join the UChain ecosystem not only acquire additional user resources but also enhance their values
by cooperating and participating in the development of the UChain sharing economy network.

Independent Developers
Developers are the diversified and formidable force in the UChain ecosystem. UChain is an open ecology from day one.
We aspire to develop an open and trustworthy platform with the employment of blockchain technology. Capable
individuals or organizations can participate in the development of UChain infrastructure or DApps.

4.2

The UChain Ecosystem

Modules
UCN reward program
UChain will launch an ecosystem reward program with UCN. The network rewards distinguished contributors,
individuals or organizations, by PoA (Proof of Activity) algorithm. [10]
This program will update the reward token pool by dynamic elasticity and recalculate the incentive at fixed intervals to
distribute corresponding tokens to the wallets.

URC-1 Standard
UChain provides sharing service providers with the ability to issue and manage their own tokens. Sharing service
providers (individuals or organizations) are free to distribute digital assets according to the URC-1 standard. Users can
invest in these digital assets to gain from their development.
URC-1 Standard: The URC-1 standard is an interface standard for token issuance on UChain. It is a markup API that
allows tags to be implemented in smart contracts. The standard provides basic functions for transferring tokens and
allows the token to be approved so that it can be used by the third party. The standard interface allows any token on
UChain to be reused by other applications from wallets to decentralized exchanges. API documents and example code
will also be provided.

Digital asset registration platform
Our digital asset registration platform is the entrance for asset holders to contribute to UChain. Users need to register
their assets before they put them into the sharing services offered. This is also one of the important basic services that
the sharing enterprise needs to create DApps. When building a sharing economy DApp, the enterprise integrates the
asset registration process through the built-in APIs and SDKs provided by the registration platform.

User credit passport system
UChain will create an intelligent passport (UIP) for every user, this passport is used as a password key for users to pass
through different blockchains. It is designed based on user’s unique identification and through decentralized user
authentication (KYC), UChain will connect fragments left by users in different applications to create their credit centers
and store them in a decentralized way. We will then look to use encryption technology to segregate the data for privacy
and safety purposes. No one can access user information and its original credit data.
UChain will implement AI to obtain user data from various platforms then perform analysis based on said data. AI will
analyze user’s behavior data and study it to obtain users digital image. As more data is gathered, this digital image will
grow to match users’ real-life characteristics. User data will be layered by credit, defining user’s credit level and this will
be reflected in applications built on UChain so that both sides of the transaction will be able to access it, solving the
problem of trust.

General P2P transaction platform module
UChain will create a general P2P transaction platform module with integrations of several basic features such as map,
payment gateway, and account management so that enterprises can easily build their own marketplace on top of it. It
has the following characteristics:
•

•

•

21

P2P Data Liberation:
by implementing a DHT (Distributed hash table) [11] for storage and distribution we will provide a free and
reliable upload, storage, transmitting and publishing platform.
Fast transaction:
Our "Superconducting transactions" can facilitate safe and high-speed business grade transactions on a
millisecond level by incorporating push technology.
Enabling product:
Through blockchain technology, we can stimulate personal contributions to expand the ecosystem, by
facilitating production, distribution, and transmission of shared properties.

The UChain Ecosystem

Digital Wallet
UChain will provide digital wallet services for all participants in the UChain ecosystem. They can store UCN and any
other URC-1 tokens in their wallets. UChain will also integrate a decentralized exchange (DEX) in the wallet to realize
the exchange of different tokens in each sub-ecological ecosystem in UChain to meet the demands of all participants,
building UChain as a healthier and more dynamic ecosystem.

U-Bicycle DApp

Service layer
•

Red Envelope Reward
In order to increase the use efficiency of the bicycles, U-Bicycle will implement smart contracts, that when the
use of a bicycle is below a certain threshold, it will be identified as a red envelope bicycle on the DApp. Once the
user rides a red envelope bicycle, a certain number of tokens will be rewarded depending on its previous degree
of use, along with the total distance the user rides.

•

Account management service
Users will register a new account with their phone number or email address, with each user being assigned a
unique digital identity that is linked to their account. The user can link also link their digital wallet to the DApp
for easier access. All the transaction and user behavior will be recorded and associated with their digital identity
on the blockchain.

•

Credit Authentication
After successful registration, the user will be required to finish credit authentication before they can use the
sharing service. U-Bicycle DApp will retrieve the User Credit Passport based on the personal information the
user provides. The User Credit Passport is unique for every user and is universal across all applications built on
UChain. If the user’s credit score passes a set level they can rent the bicycle without paying a token deposit, if
however, the user does not meet the required credit score they will be required to pay a deposit, which will be
returned as soon as they finish using the bicycle, with everything being executed via smart contract.

•

Transaction Service
All transactions taking place on the U-Bicycle DApp will be dealt in UCN. The transaction itself along with its
payment information will be passed to and stored on the UChain blockchain. It will also be used as the data
source for updating User Credit Passport.

•

Wallet Service
U-Bicycle will also use and connect its DApp to the wallet service provided by UChain. After the UChain digital
wallet is successfully associated with user’s account, the user can directly use all the wallet services such as
payment and token transfer inside the DApp.

•

Task System
The U-Bicycle will also have a system that distributes operational tasks with a token reward. It will publish the
location-based tasks according to the real situation, such as moving a certain number of bicycles from location A
to location B, due to the number of bikes being disproportionate. All users in location A will be able to view and
accept the task and once the bicycle is transported to location B, the task is considered complete and users will
be rewarded with tokens, which will be displayed prior to accepting to the task.

•

Open platform
U-bicycle DApp also provides APIs for other enterprises and DApps that would like to exercise the sharing
bicycle services provided by U-Bicycle. They can register for the use of APIs including the map service and
payment gateway.

•

Asset Management Service
U-Bicycle provides users who have bicycle resources with the opportunity to digitize their heavy assets to earn
tokens. Besides the 100,000 bicycles owned by U-Bicycle, users can also contribute their idle bicycles to the
platform after they register them within the UChain Digital Asset Registration Platform, renting them to other
users, and earning tokens with ease.

27

Data storage on the blockchain
User and transaction data from U-Bicycle DApp will be packaged and sent through the consensus mechanism to
be recorded on the blockchain after it has been signed and encrypted. In addition, assets such as bicycles from
the U-Bicycle platform will be registered with the asset registration module and stored on the blockchain along
with its location information, service history and maintenance record that are all tamperproof and traceable.

Token Economics

6 Token Economics
6.1

Official Token (UCN)
UCN is the basic unit on UChain. The value of all other tokens is derived from UCN. Those who wish to join or leave
UChain ecosystem must buy or sell UCN.

Figure 6-1: UCN use cases

6.2

Staked UCN (UCP)
Users can get UCP by locking their UCN. UCP is just UCN with voting power, and as such gives the holder higher
ecological access.
Staking: UChain will incentivize holders who keep UCP for a long time by granting them UCN, the distributing rate will
be dynamic so people who hold and lock UCN for a long time will get extra bonuses.
UCP is not exchangeable nor tradable.
By investing in long-term value, the whole ecology can achieve its ideal vision besides making short-term gains. At the
same time, token holders will enjoy vitality from the development of our ecosystem. Long-term holding by community
members will be the backbone of UChain’s ecology. In the world of cryptocurrency, we see short-term investors
continuously looking for cryptocurrencies with higher potential value. UChain aspires to build an autonomous ecology
full of people with shared values.

Token Economics

Value of UCN
As the official digital currency of UChain, UCN has huge potential in market value, this value is quantifiable. As
mentioned previously, by 2018 the market scale of the global shared economy will reach 520 billion dollars. Within it,
centralized platforms as the matchmaker stand to make about 30% of the profit. As the business grows, more
applications are implemented and more data is collected. Credit evaluation and technology services will become more
valuable in the market. UCN is not only a digital currency but also a base currency for all of the derivatives on UChain.

29

•

Transaction value:
UCN is circulated in all DApps built on top of UChain as payment for all kinds of transactions.

•

Supply chain vouchers:
UCN can be used as vouchers for the purchase of assets from suppliers (sharing bicycles, smart devices, etc.).

•

Data contribution rewards:
Users will be rewarded with UCN if they decide to contribute their data to the development of the ecosystem.

•

Value-added services:
UCN can be used for payment of API services provided by UChain.

•

Community rewards:
UCN will be rewarded to the community contributors such as third-party developers and community operators.

•

User incentives:
UCN can be earned by improving your community activity such as on-boarding more users and creating valuable
content.

•

Fees:
All fees will be denominated in UCN such as transaction fee from Sharing services and DEX.

•

Ad delivery:
UCN can also be paid for advertisements deliver through the UChain advertising system.

Disclaimer and other Legal Statements

11 Disclaimer and other Legal Statements
Disclaimer
1)

For enthusiasts of UChain, please read the whitepaper and related instructions on our official website carefully.
Please be sure that you understand blockchain technology and realize that there's potential risk in buying tokens
on UChain. We would urge you to fully assess your financial situation before investing.

2)

This project may fail due to its legitimacy, market demand, technical or other uncontrollable reasons out of our
control. Please be prepared that any of these circumstances may cause all funds you invested in this project to
become worthless.

3)

There are risks associated with the buyer's credentials. If any third party obtains the purchaser's login credentials
or private key they may be able to directly control the buyer's UCN. To minimize risks, the purchaser must protect
his / her electronic devices against unauthorized access requests or access to the device contents.

4)

Blockchain technology has become a target of supervision in all major countries in the world and UChain or UCN
may be affected if the regulatory authorities act against it. If the state limits the use and sales of digital tokens,
the UCN may be restricted, causing the project to be blocked or even terminate UChain's development.

5)

Please be aware of some non UChain application risk that we may incur. With the development of the UCN
platform, third-party based applications may appear. The official UChain platform may directly compete with
these third-party applications, and may also have a negative impact on its value.

6)

It is possible that UChain applications launch without being used by many individuals or organizations, implying
that the public has no interest in developing these relevant distributed applications, which might have a negative
impact on the value of UCN and UChain applications.

7)

The general carelessness and laziness on the internet might prevent anyone from reading this part while you
could have won 100 UCN being the first non UChain person to discover it. An optional personal hug is included.

8)

Any malicious attempt by hackers, other organizations or countries to disrupt UChain applications or UCN
functions, including server attacks, Sybil attacks, malware attacks, or consistent attacks could result in serious
damages and value loss for the UChain platform and UCN token.

9)

The UChain application includes a series of open source software. Third parties could intentionally or
unintentionally push code with bugs which could be implemented into the UChain platform, therefore, damaging
the core framework itself. This could result in a loss of UCN.

10) The rapid development of cryptography or science and technology such as the development of quantum
computers brings the risk of cracking encryption or UChain’s monetary platform. This could lead to the loss of
UCN.
11) As with other decentralized cryptosystems and cryptocurrency, the blockchain that we plan to develop for UChain
applications is also vulnerable to mining attacks. This includes but not limited to, double spend attacks, high
calculation force ratio attacks, "self-interest" mining attacks and excessive competitive attacks. Any successful
attack is a risk to UChain's platform and UCN value. Although UChain's system security is very hard to crack, the
mining attacks mentioned above are real.
12) Unlike bank accounts or other financial institutional accounts, there will not be UChain account insurance or any
other blockchain insurance. In any case, there will be no open individual organization to cover your loss, however,
companies such as the FDIC or private insurance companies might provide a guarantee for the buyer.
13) There is the possibility of UChain dissolution. This could occur due to various reasons, including the volatility of
NEO, ETH, or UCN's own price, the development of the UChain application, the possibility of a disruption in the
business relationships or the possibility of a claim of intellectual property. UChain is likely to be directly impacted
in the event of a major attack or a direct dissolution.
14) If the UChain platform were to fail this could result in normal services that would normally run daily, to stop. This
could lead to the loss of user’s UCN.
15) Crypto tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks referred to in this white paper, there
are also some risks the UChain team may not have stated. Throughout this journey we may uncover various
potential risks that could affect UChain, please be aware.
