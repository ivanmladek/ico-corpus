Abstract
Social networks provide opportunity for data hacks and security/privacy breaches, including
those by the network provider themselves, as evidenced by recent Facebook examples. A
decentralised, encrypted network would enable users to retain control and protection of their data
(including online behaviour, wallet/financial information, multimedia and profile information),
thereby minimising potential for hacking or privacy breaches.
Sociall is a new generation of networking. It is a secure and private decentralised social network
for all. Sociall encrypts all data and multimedia uploads and stores it securely all over the world,
making it completely decentralised. The platform is private and discourages search engines from
viewing user profiles or displaying them in search results.
Sociall does not claim ownership of any uploaded data or multimedia to the system. All
information belongs to the uploading user.
The platform utilises its own easy to use cryptocurrency called SCL. It is used to pay for all
goods and services rather than traditional money. Think of SCL as the native currency of the
platform instead of using multiple different currencies that usually come with conversion fees.
Sociall will supply all accounts with a decentralised wallet to securely store SCL and other
popular cryptocurrencies. All account wallets will exist within a series of smart contacts on the
Ethereum blockchain, making it completely decentralised and uncontrollable from anyone other
than the wallet’s creator. Adding SCL to an account will be a breeze as the wallet will have the
ability to convert many different forms of currency to SCL.
Sociall plans to move the entire platform to self-governing. This means that users on Sociall will
be able to assist with keeping the platform clean and safe by removing spam and offensive posts.
All users who contribute to this will be compensated in SCL. Eventually, the entire platform will
be run by the users instead of a centralised controlling entity. The users will even have the ability
to make updates and fix issues, thanks to open-source and pull-requests.
Sociall is giving the power back to the people.

Market
More than 2.5 billion people people on Earth use some form of digital social networking. Social
media advertising spend is projected to reach more than $51 billion globally in 2018, with this
number reaching almost $77 billion by 20221. Sociall will target these two major markets: social
and e-commerce. Both markets are multibillion-dollar industries, with billions of users, that are
currently controlled by large corporations.
Sociall hopes to create a decentralized social network paired with an online peer-to-peer
marketplace, ad-platform, and much more.
E-commerce sales is expected to grow almost 12% in the next few years. Global retail
ecommerce sales will reach $1.915 trillion in 2016, accounting for 8.7% of total retail spending
worldwide. 71% of shoppers believe they will get a better deal online than in stores.

Functionality
Wallet
Sociall account wallets will be created through a decentralized smart-contract process where
there is no owning entity.
The setup entity, being Sociall, will not have control over any funds kept in a user’s account
wallet and will never be able to process any transactions on behalf of the user – making it
completely decentralized.

Onboarding
process

Prompt user to
create password to
access wallet

Function returns

address

Sociall saves
wallet address in
DB for reference
only

Sociall has plans to allow the storing and sending of other ERC20 based tokens in the near
future, along with also integrating Shapeshift for instant token-to-token trading inside the wallet.
Features & Decentralisation
The entire wallet will be built using a smart contract coded in Solidity on the Ethereum
blockchain. The smart contract will generate a user’s wallet and it will be stored in the database.
Since the wallet is generated from a smart contract, it will not have a private key, so Sociall will
not have to store private keys. Instead, the user will create a password that grants them access to
their wallet. Whenever a transaction requires signing (for a send), the user simply enters their
password and the smart contract checks if the user has access or not. A user password must first
be hashed and salted before sending to the smart-contract as it will be displayed publicly on the
blockchain. This is a far more decentralised solution than hosting and encrypting private keys
like a majority of exchange and application wallets.
Below is the flow for how a user can initiate a transaction and sign with their password.

5

User initiates
transaction

User enters
password to
sign
transaction

Password is
hashed and
salted

Transaction
is signed,
smartcontract
takes % of
SCL as
TXfee

SCL is sent
to address

Passwords must be treated like a private key. As Sociall will not be storing these passwords, if a
password is lost then access to the wallet will be lost forever.
All transactions will be paid in SCL, not ETH. No user account wallet will need to hold ETH to
make transactions/purchases. Sociall will hold an amount of ETH within the smart-contract to
pay for all transactions and will charge users a small amount of SCL (0.50%-1.10%, depending
on TXfees and Gwei prices) for the transaction.
All transaction prices will be dynamically calculated depending on the current SCL/ETH trading
pair price. For example;
Scenario 1: SCL/ETH trading pair goes up. The SCL transaction fee may be reduced as the
smart contract will be overcharging.
Scenario 2: SCL/ETH trading pair goes down. The SCL transaction fee may be increased as the
smart contract will be undercharging.
Scenario 3: SCL/ETH trading pair stays stable. The SCL transaction fee may stay the same or be
slightly adjusted according to market conditions.
Scenario 4: ETH average Gwei is increased due to a high-load network. The SCL transaction fee
may be increased as the smart contract will be undercharging. The SCL/ETH trading pair has no
effect on this scenario, although can play a part depending on market conditions.
An audit of the smart-contract will be completed by a reputable firm before pushing the code
live. Please refer to the Security section within this document for more information regarding
security and code audits.

6

Top Ups
Users on Sociall will be able to top up their account wallet with SCL by simply depositing
popular supported cryptocurrencies (such as BTC and ETH) and eventually fiat. The project will
utilize CoinPayments and Stripe for these future integrations.
This top-up process will consist of complex business logic in the background. A master wallet
consisting of SCL from the ad platform and marketplace fees will fulfil the order.
The proposed flow for topping up with BTC is below. A very similar flow will be utilized for fiat
deposits, although a different API endpoint will be hit.

User
requests
SCL top
up in BTC

API
checks if
enough
SCL exists
in master
wallet

Enough
exists, API
requests
BTC
deposit
address

Deposit
address is
generated
and sent to
user

User
deposits
BTC

SCL is
added to
user wallet

The final proposed flow is for attempting a top up with BTC (similar error flow for fiat) with not
enough SCL to execute the order existing within the master wallet.

User requests
SCL top up in
BTC

API checks if
enough SCL
exists in master
wallet

Not enough SCL
exists

Error is displayed
to user

SCL will be purchased from the master wallet at an inflated rate. The buy rate will be
approximately 5% higher than the consolidated exchange rate.
Sociall has plans to eventually implement a peer-to-peer buy/sell function for SCL directly from
the users account wallet to eliminate the need for a master wallet.

7

User Account
An account on Sociall can be set up in less than one minute. A user simply signs up with their
full name, email address and requested password. After the activation email is clicked, then the
final stage of onboarding begins.
Below are the steps for the onboarding process.
1. User enters basic details and accepts terms and conditions.
2. User clicks on verification email to confirm ownership of email address.
3. User is taken to the final onboarding screen where they select their interests from a
predefined list.
4. User is taken through a short-guided tour of the applications.
5. Onboarding process complete.
Once the onboarding is completed, the user may then browse the application. The user may then
also update their information from the account settings page. A temporary username is created
for them upon signup that consists of their full name and a random generated ID. A user may
update their username whenever they wish. Usernames are used to mention a user in a
post/comment, along with also being the gateway to their profile via a URL.
The URL structure for a user profile: https://sociall.io/u/[username-here]
URLs will not be publicly visitable. If a user does not have an account or is not logged in, they
will be redirected to the login/signup page before allowing to proceed to the requested user’s
profile for privacy reasons.
A SSO (single-sign-on) capabilities will be offered to third-party applications and websites that
would like to offer their users the ability to signup or login with their already existing Sociall
account.

8

Marketplace
Sociall will allow the creation of “product posts” within the platform that represent goods or
services. Followers can see this post and purchase it directly with the SCL held in their account
wallet.
For example, if you wanted to sell your old laptop you could simply attach an image along with
meta data describing the item and price in SCL. Users will then be able to search multiple ways
within the marketplace for your uploaded post.
Once a user decides to purchase a marketplace item, they simply click on the “Buy” button
attached to the post. A password prompt will be displayed to the user for them to sign the
transaction. The receiving user will see a notification stating that a user has purchased their item.
The two users can continue to discuss finer details within a dedicated live chat.
All product posts can be geo-tagged so that users on Sociall can search for items within their
location that are available for local pickup if they wish.
The marketplace will have a small flat fee of 1% in SCL and will be taken from the seller after
the transaction is complete.
The marketplace will have strict rules against illegal goods and services. All of which will be laid
out in the terms and conditions of the website. All product posts that violate these terms will be
removed from the platform to ensure a safe and compliant environment.
Escrow based services and systems will be integrated in the near future to protect both buyers
and sellers. This will consist of a holding account where SCL will be stored until the buyer
receives the item and confirms. At the beginning, Sociall support staff will act as the mediators
within the transaction. Once the platform gets closer to a full self-governing model, then the
mediator role will be moved to the moderations of the platform for a further decentralised peerto-peer marketplace experience.

Instant Messaging
Instant messages are the most used feature within a social networking platform, so Sociall hopes
to make it more enjoyable for its users.
Messages within Sociall will mainly be user-to-user, with the ability to have dedicated messaging
groups for Groups and Events.
Messages will be able to consist of multimedia (images), emojis and eventually also sending of
SCL.
Messaging on Sociall will utilise WebSockets functionality with the help of the SignalR library.
Please refer to the Technology Stack section of this document for more information regarding the
technology behind this.
Sociall will soon integrate end-to-end message encryption. This ensures that only the sending
and receiving users can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even Sociall. The database
will store encrypted messages as cypher text that is unreadable and impossible to decrypt without
access to the unique key pairs.
Here is basic example of how end-to-end message encryption will work on Sociall. Please refer
to the Roadmap section of this document for an estimated implementation date.

User A
and User
B share a
unique key
pair

User A
messages
User B

Message is
encrypted
via key
pair

Cypher
text is
stored in
database

User B

Messages on Sociall will eventually consist of more advanced functions for interaction. This
includes sending SCL to a one-on-one chat, sharing recorded audio, and much more.

to User B

Mobile Applications
Sociall is currently concentrating on the first release of the web platform. Once that is complete
and all issues resolved, then the team will begin working on semi-hybrid mobile applications for
both iOS and Android.
Both applications will consist of all features within the web version and will still be able to
create transactions and access the account wallet.
iOS and Android apps will then be moved to full native applications to ensure better usability,
stability and reliable faster native SDK calls. After the native migration, advanced integrations
such as a VPN and Tor will be added, to further enhance the privacy aspect of the platform.
The web version of the application will be accessible via mobile devices as it consists of a full
responsive design. This allows Sociall users to still use the platform on the go while the mobile
applications are under development.
Please refer to the roadmap section of this document for further information and release dates.

Community/Blog
The Community section on Sociall is a way for all users on the platform to discover new
accounts to follow and to engage with the community.
Consider the Community section to be more of an open public blog where content rich posts can
be seen by anyone on Sociall and beyond. It is where you can create a post with images, links,
embedded multimedia (and more), and to have other users on Sociall read through it. The
Community section will have a feature-rich WYSIWYG editor to make post creation a breeze.
The Community section is the only part of Sociall that is visible to search engines. Community
posts will be indexed by search engines and it is the only section within the application that can
be visited by users who are not registered or logged in.

12

Privacy
Sociall is a private social network that does not allow search engines to index user profiles. The
platform will soon have strict (yet simple) privacy settings for users to control who and who
cannot see their profile and personal data.
On initial launch, all profiles will be visible to other users on Sociall. In future releases (see
roadmap), users will have the ability the make their profile and posts private to those who are not
following them. Account settings will also feature a way to make all following requests manually
approvable instead of having each request automatically approved.
Here is a list of the simple settings that will exist.
-

Profile Visibility
o Public. Profile and posts visible to all users on Sociall no matter who it is (besides
blocked users).
o Private. Profile and posts only visible to users who follow you.

-

Following Approval
o On. All following requests must be manually approved.
o Off. All following requests are automatically approved.

Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding capabilities will soon be added to Sociall. They do not represent an ICO nor do
they integrate with any foreign or new token. Crowdfunds on Sociall simply represent a personal
cause such as an individual user trying to raise funds for a charity, or a family trying to raise
money for medical bills.
All crowdfunds use SCL and set a funding goal, deadline, images and other related metadata.
Sociall will take a small fee of 1% of all raised SCL.

13

Decentralisation & IPFS
All data and multimedia uploads are stored within the encrypted decentralized storage solution
that is built and maintained by Sociall. This system integrates with a hosted database that utilizes
MongoDB sharding for further decentralisation of storage.
1. Image is sent from the client (website) up to server.
2. Image is renamed, encrypted and sent to the cloud for resizing and decryption keys are
stored inside the decentralised database solution.
3. Micro-service picks up queued image, decrypts it, resizes to 3 different sizes (if possible),
encrypts the content again and stores in a permanent store location. The image is resized
to multiple different dimensions for different display scenarios on the website.
4. The encrypted images are stored in the cloud. Since they are encrypted, the cloud cannot
access the raw data.
5. When the client (website) requests an image, the encrypted data is retrieved from the
cloud, decrypted on Sociall’s servers via the stored decryption keys, and delivered to the
client.
The above is used as a temporary solution as it is not an ideal method for a blockchain based
application. The team is already working on a solution that utilizes IPFS, a peer-to-peer
hypermedia protocol.
IPFS is a true distributed protocol that allows us to further decentralise Sociall’s storage solution.
Sociall plans on moving multimedia uploads and data storage to IPFS by 2019. The below
proposed flow is how this will be implemented successfully. The same flow will be used with
data objects too, although they will be JSON documents instead of multimedia objects (images).

Image is
sent to
server for
uploading

Server

IPFS
returns
unique
reference
hash

Server
utilises
IPFS and
uploads

14

Hash is
saved in
DB for
reference

Ad-Platform
The ad-platform on Sociall will consist of a semi-automatic self-serving process. Any user with a
Sociall account and a SCL balance above 0 can create and submit an ad campaign through the
platform.
All submitted campaigns will manually be revived by Sociall support staff before going live on
the network to ensure quality and compliance. As per all other functions on Sociall, this process
will eventually be moved to a self-governing model where moderators on the platform can
approve the ads.
All add fees will be paid in SCL and will be based on CPI (cost-per-impression). Basic metrics
will be displayed to the ad creator in the “Ad Manager” section, such as number of impressions,
performing interests, date/time of impressions and much more.
Ads on Sociall will sit within the news feed on different sections. Different areas will have
different pricing depending on availability and visibility. New sections may be added in the
future depending on planned features that are not within the roadmap.
Available sections include:
-

Personal news feed

-

Community section

-

Right widget section (site-wide)

-

Marketplace feed

All ads on Sociall will be formatted in a strict display manner. This means that ads will have a
short title, description, link and display image. Display image dimensions will depend on the
section that the ad is optimised for. Ads will be static, and no animations are allowed. This is to
ensure that the platform abides to the styling guidelines with nothing looking out of the ordinary.

15

Self-Governing
Sociall is slowly moving the entire platform to self-governing. This means that users on Sociall
will be able to assist with keeping the platform clean and safe by removing spam and offensive
posts.
This “self-governing” feature will give the power back to the people instead of having all power
sit with the owning entity.
For example, mainstream social networks often remove posts promoting free speech or a strong
opinion regarding a certain topic. On Sociall, it’s the appointed moderators (who are not staff,
they are everyday people and users of Sociall) who decide if the post really requires deletion or
not. It’s giving the power back to the people and offering true decentralisation.
Example of the flow for an inappropriate post:
1. A particular post on Sociall is flagged by multiple users.
2. Post is displayed to moderators on Sociall for their decision.
3. 9/10 moderators deem post to be in violation of the sites terms.
4. Post is removed permanently from the database.
5. The 9 moderators are rewarded in SCL for their services.
Example of the flow for an accepted post on the platform:
1. A particular post on Sociall is flagged by multiple users.
2. Post is displayed to moderators on Sociall for their decision.
3. 9/10 moderators deem post to be within the terms and acceptable.
4. Post is then whitelisted and continues to be displayed.
5. The 9 moderators are rewarded in SCL for their services.
Users on Sociall are granted moderator privileges manually if they have a strong track record and
do not break any rules on the platform. At first, Sociall support staff will reach out to users on the
platform to see if they would like these privileges. Eventually, this role will be handed over to
already existing moderators on Sociall to further enhance the self-governing aspect and
decentralised experience on the platform.
16

Technology Stack
Overview
Sociall has five applications. All applications and services run as a consolidated group to ensure
the speed and functionality. Each application is hosted individually to make sure that the
application can continue to run even if a singular service goes down.
Here is the list of all five applications that Sociall is currently running.
1. Frontend application
2. API server
3. Authentication server
4. Image processing micro-service
5. WebSockets micro-service
More micro-services will be created often to keep intense services away from the main API
server.
Frontend Application
The frontend application is developed with the most recent version of Angular. It is served via a
simple NodeJS server running ExpressJS. It sits within a complex docker image on a Linux
server. It utilises popular packages and frameworks such as NGRX and RXJS. The frontend uses
OpenID standards for authentication and communication with the Authentication server.
API Server
The Sociall API server runs on the most recent version of .NET Core. It delivers all information
from the database to the frontend application in a readable manner. It is a RESTful API service,
meaning that it’s based on representational state transfer technology. It also communicates with
all services within the Sociall ecosystem, such as the image processing micro-service and the
identity server.

17

Authentication Server
The authentication server runs on the open-source IdentityServer. It has been slightly modified to
use the most recent version of .NET Core and to adapt to the MongoDB decentralised solution.
The authentication server is API compatible and must be for use within the frontend project. The
server issues refreshable JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) to the client for it to communicate with the
API server. The API server then checks the JWT against the authentication server to verify its
identity.
Image Processing Micro-Service
A micro-service is used to process all image uploads. This is required to compress and resize the
image to multiple different dimensions for different screensizes and placements within the
application. This is run as a separately hosted micro-service to ensure that it does not affect any
other areas of the application, since image compression equals high CPU usage. This service is
written in the most recent version of .NET Core.
WebSockets Micro-Service
WebSockets is a protocol for full-duplex communication via the HTTP protocol. This grants an
always-open connection between the server and the client. It allows a real-time connection for
Sociall’s instant messaging functionality. Sockets is a more advanced solution than traditional
API polling due to its constant server connection and lower bandwidth usage that leads to realtime client-side updates. Messages are sent to the API server for storing within the database and
at the same time synced to the sockets micro-service so that the client experiences a real-time
conversation. The sockets micro-service is built with .Net Core and utilises the open-source
SignalR library.

18

Open-Source
A majority of Sociall’s projects will be moved to open-source just after mid 2018. This includes
the API server, frontend project, and all micro-services (see Technology Stack section).
The project may eventually open some repositories up to pull-requests, although this is yet to be
confirmed. Outside developers will be able to contribute to the development of Sociall by
creating pull-requests on the public repos. If the Sociall development team reviews the request to
be of benefit to the platform, then it will be approved. These participants will not be awarded in
SCL, but instead be mentioned in the credits section on Sociall.
The identity authentication server may be partially open-sourced in the future, although it has
been advised against by the project’s security firm.
Open-sourcing a majority of Sociall’s systems displays transparency to the community.
All code repositories will be available via Sociall’s GitHub Profile - https://github.com/sociall-io

Bounties
The public will be encouraged to run tests on the project’s available code to find flaws in the
security, design and all other aspects. This opens to door to freelance security experts,
developers, designers and other whitehat IT experts to audit code and report issues to the lead
developers.
Bounties will be offered to findings that the support team deems as an error or bug. All finds will
be assessed manually and individually, and the payout will depend on the severity of the issue.
All finds will be paid in SCL to a user’s account wallet on Sociall. These members may also get
their names mentioned in the credits section on the platform.

19

Security
Of course, the most important aspect of any social networking platform is the security of its data
and authentication process. This is why Sociall is using a reputable open-source project called
IdentityServer to handle all authentication of the application.
Sociall is using a reputable third-party security firm to run audits, penetration testing, and much
more over all servers and applications that will be developed. This ensures that there are no
security vulnerabilities within Sociall’s code or development flows. A public report for this will
be available after the audits are complete.
Sociall has five applications (as per the Technology Stack section). All five will be tested to
ensure that the application is secure with no vulnerabilities. New audits and tests will be
conducted each time a new function is pushed live to the platform.
DCORP is developing and auditing the smart-contract wallet. Hosho will complete the final audit
of the code and smart contract structure before pushing it live to the blockchain. Since all wallets
exist within a smart contract on the blockchain, Sociall does not store any private keys or
passwords in the database. This makes hacking account wallets virtually impossible if the user
enters a sophisticated password. Sociall will enforce strict password criteria when the user sets
up their wallet for the first time.
All code audit reports will be publicly accessible via the project’s GitHub profile.

20

SCL
Details
The platform utilises its own easy-to-use cryptocurrency, called SCL. It is used to pay for all
goods and services rather than traditional money. Think of SCL as the native currency of the
platform instead of using multiple different currencies that usually come with conversion fees.
SCL is an ERC20 based token on the Ethereum blockchain.
Name

16,714,019.66
No new coins will ever be created
Buy goods, services and ad spaces on Sociall

Due to the strict nature of smart contracts and project set up, no more SCL can ever be minted.
The circulating supply may slightly differ from the total supply for many reasons such as lost
tokens, locked accounts, lost private keys, and much more. This number cannot be effectively
determined, hence why the circulating supply has been listed the same as the total supply.
SCL can be stored in any ERC20 compatible wallet.

Source Code
The source code for SCL can be found on Etherscan. It is a compliant ERC20 contract and was
developed by Frank Bonnet.
https://etherscan.io/address/0xd7631787b4dcc87b1254cfd1e5ce48e96823dee8#code

Exchanges
Having SCL listed on multiple exchanges is important for the liquidity and volume of the token.
The Sociall support team is constantly reaching out to large reputable exchanges and upcoming
exchanges to have SCL listed there.
The team hopes that once Sociall is out of beta and in to a public release that exchanges will see
potential in both the token and project.
SCL is currently publicly tradeable on the following exchanges.
FCoin - https://exchange.fcoin.com/ex/gpm/scl-eth
HitBTC - https://hitbtc.com/exchange/SCL-to-BTC
Bancor - https://www.bancor.network/communities/5aead51570a04eaf69e59a88/currency
