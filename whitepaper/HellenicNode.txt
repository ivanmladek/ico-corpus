What is Hellenic Node?

My name is Odysseas Vasileiadis (Odma on social media channels). Since 2014
I have successfully operated my own revenue model which I will now share
with the community via our Hellenic Node project in Turtle Network. Hellenic
Node is also, as the name implies, a node I operate and maintain in order to
support Turtle Network.
In short, my revenue model is based on ad placements and content sharing
which is possible by utilizing Google Adsense as well as Facebook’s audience
network. In short we operate at the moment around 40 Facebook Pages (almost
1,5 Million unique Likes) and we lead all this people to our media websites in
Greece. This model has been proven to work and for this reason I would like to
take it mainstream and share it with our Hellenic Node and Turtle Network
community.
Our target is to offer this model so each member can expect a complete return
on investment within 13 months or less. More details about the model’s
structure will be mentioned shortly.
I have been running this business model from 2014 with outstanding profit so i
think its about time to take it to the next level within “Cryptocurency world”
and with Hellenic Node (HN) .
Hellenic Node will run a real business model with the target to get our
investment back in 12-13 months and from that time it will be a win win
situation over the months and for ever. The only way our model is at fatal risk
is if Facebook itself is shut down.

How we work?
Allow me to describe the process of how this project is able to succeed. A total
of 5 staff members are needed, three people will upload content, another person
will translate accordingly and the fifth person will fill in where it is most
needed at any given time, be it posting content or translating.
From our staff members, the content uploaders will work 7 hours each per day.
Their main duty is to upload content on a daily basis. The content varies as
sometimes it is original and other times it references other authors. All the
articles will also be published on our Facebook pages.
The process is very simple:
We create content in the form of articles » these are published on our Facebook
pages » People click to read them » Traffic is directed to our website(s) »
revenue is generated.
With the revenue generated each month we will purchase $TN, $WGR and
$WAVES from the open market and distribute proportionally to qualified $HN
supporters. The minimum requirement to qualify is holding $HN 100,000 in
your TurtleNetwork wallet.

Our Targets?
We create the first line up of our Facebook Pages.
60 to 90 days are necessary to complete our first Facebook lineup. With as few
as 10 pages our model begins to generate revenue. One of our main goals is to
garner 5,000,000 “Likes” under our model.
Expect ROI target : 13 months or less
Our work begins as soon as the soft cap is fulfilled and allocated funds for Tier
1 released. Soon thereafter….

Distrubuted Rewards to HN holders?

– Every month Hellenic Node will distribute $TN $WGR and $WAVES to all
wallets with a balance of $HN 100,000 or more.

– The distribution of rewards will be proportional to the total amount of $HN
held in the wallet during the previous month (random snapshots will be taken
during month prior to distribution).

– The 1st distribution will take place 90 days after successfully completing our
ICO, thereafter every distribution will be on a monthly basis.

– Once ICO ends and Soft Cap is reached, 20% of remaining tokens will be
AirDropped to supporters while the remaining 80% will be AirDropped on a
specified schedule (to be determined after 20% of tokens are AirDropped).

– In the event that Soft Cap (USD $80,000) is not reached by the end date, all
ICO supporters will be refunded within 15 working days

Google Analytics Data, Google Adsense , Facebook invoices
We understand how important it is to provide data in order to back up our
claims and to show you that our proposal is not only serious and promising, but
more importantly, it is a proven model. In order to prove to you that this model
is sucessful we have prepared a package which contains Alexa ranking of my
previous work in Greece, invoices from Google Adsense as well as Facebook
which show actual revenue earned. As long as we reach our Soft Cap we can
guarantee that our business model will launch and that our investors will be
rewarded accordingly within the timeline projected to fulfill ROI.
Below you can see some screenshots of my current working model which
generates respective returns as shown on the invoices.
This project is not a shot in the dark or based on hopeful analysis or statistics.
As mentioned before, this is a working model which has been proven
successful over the past 4 years. It is not a new concept or an idea waiting to be
tested with all the risk resting on investors’ shoulders.

How to buy Hellenic Node (HN) tokens?

Crowdsale Targets and Token Distribution
We need to sell 48.500.000 tokens at the price of USD $0.0017 minimum to run
the project. If we don’t hit the soft cap all the funds will be refunded
immediately.
Soft Cap: USD $80,000
Hard Cap: USD $100,000
If the Hard Cap is reached, we will be able to create up to 50 Facebook pages
which in turn can garner around 5.2 million “Likes” in total. Each page will be
able to amass around 150,000 “Likes” under my proven and currently working
model.
Our main priority is to be transparent at every turn of the process. Each page
will cost between USD $2,000 ~ USD $2,500. All respective records for expenses
involved in creating each page will be provided to our community.
Allocated for ICO : 60,000,000
TNetwork Community AirDrop : 1,250,000
Growth Hacking : 5,000,000

Current $HN in circulation amounts to 5,382,315. Only 8 wallets hold more than
$HN 100,000.

Since total supply of $HN is 100,000,000 and considering the allocated amount
for ICO is 66,250,000 that means a total of $HN 28,367,685 will be burnt
immediately after ICO tokens are sold or the crowdsale comes to an end and
Soft Cap is met.

Nonetheless, should the Hard Cap not be attained, we will be able to proceed
with a set number of pages according to the amount collected by the end of the
crowdsale.

Our project will be launched on TurtleNetwork and $HN tokens will be
distributed within 15 days after ICO ends.

*The 5,382,315.00 are circulating already that’s why they are missing from the
graph*
