I. What is the mission of CyberMiles?
CyberMiles aims to build a smart contract platform that is similar to Ethereum but heavily
optimized to facilitate e-commerce transactions. Our blockchain enables people to
construct and execute business contracts enforced by computer code. Our goal is to
build an e-commerce ecosystem that is native to the network era:

•

no rent-seeking centralized monopoly;

•

more fair allocation of network rewards; and

•

stronger network effects through economic incentives.

The result will be a new generation of e-commerce network that is more affordable to
buyers (both in merchandise prices and financing options) and more revenue streams for
the sellers (such as monetizing data, supply chain financing, and consumer loans).

II. What is PoS?
When Satoshi Nakamoto invented the Bitcoin, a key insight was an economic system that
is more profitable to join the network than to attack it. In the Bitcoin system, the barrier
to attack the system is called Proof-of-Work, or PoW, consensus. However, over the years,
it has also become apparent that the PoW consensus is too slow and wastes too much
energy.

To solve PoW’s problems, a new consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Stake, or PoS, was
proposed. A PoS system allows a vote for each new block by the network’s token holders.
The proposer of a new block is randomly chosen. Each account’s voting power is
proportional to the tokens held in it. The idea is that token holders, especially large token
holders, are incentivized to vote to ensure the network’s security. With voting, the
blockchain can validate blocks with minimal amount of computation. The proposer of an
accepted new block receives award in the blockchain’s cryptocurrency. This process is
called “minting” new cryptocurrency as opposed to PoW’s “mining”. A PoS system is
typically much more performant than a PoW system.

However, a traditional PoS system also suffers from two significant problems: the first
problem is still performance. All token holders can run a blockchain node to propose and
vote on blocks, but most token holders have no expertise or budget to run computer
hardware and software required for a high-performance node. Therefore, blockchain

network is as slow as its slowest node. The second problem is the “nothing at stake”
problem, where a token holder can cheat by simultaneously voting on two competing
proposed blocks.

III. What is DPoS?
Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is an improvement to the PoS mechanism. It is similar to
a representative democracy with land suffrage in human society. In DPoS, the token
holders vote for a small number of representatives (we call those elected representatives
“validators” throughout this article) to represent all token holders to run network
operations. The validators run super nodes, which are professionally run network servers
to ensure the performance and security of the blockchain network. This solves PoS’s
performance problem.

The votes are casted in the form of staking one’s tokens. The staked tokens are locked by
the network as collaterals and can be slashed when the validators misbehave. The staked
tokens are never transferred to the validators who they voted for. They are simply used
as a proof of voting power and incentive for the token holders to choose responsible and
capable validators to maintain the blockchain. The potential punishment solves the
“nothing at stake” problem.

At CyberMiles, we believe DPoS is the future of high performance and secure blockchain
consensus.

IV. How CyberMiles DPoS works
Delegated Proof of Stake is a crucial economic mechanism in the CyberMiles blockchain
network to reward token holders who help to maintain the security and integrity of the
network protocols. There are two roles in the CyberMiles DPoS protocol: delegators and

validators.

A.

Delegators and validators

CMT holders who choose to be delegators lock up, or stake, their CMTs to participate in
the blockchain network’s governance through a voting mechanism. The staked CMTs are
held by the network and cannot be traded or transferred because they can be slashed
when governance errors occur. In exchange, the delegators receive CMTs minted through
systematic inflation and transaction fees in every new block created by the network.
These CMTs are called block award.

The delegators themselves typically cannot or will not run the computer servers that
actually power the blockchain network. Instead, delegators hire, or elect, other CMT
holders, or validators, for this task by staking their CMTs to specific validator candidates.
Validators are responsible for maintaining crucial network infrastructure, and making rule
changes and governance decisions on behalf of its delegators. Since there are only 19
validators in the CyberMiles system, validators must compete for delegators' votes
(staked CMTs) in order to be hired by providing secure servers running up-to-date

software, sufficient computing power and network bandwidth to power the global
blockchain network.

Delegators pay validators with a portion of their block awards. Each validator’s share of
the block award is called the validator’s compensation. A validator must declare a default
compensation rate at the time of candidacy declaration. The default serves as the
maximum compensation rate all delegators must pay this validator. However, once a
delegator stakes the validator, the validator has the option to voluntarily reduce her
compensation rate for this delegator. This allows the validator to recognize delegators
who make significant contributions to the community.

If a validator misbehaves and tries to harm the network, the network might slash its staked
CMTs causing a loss for its delegators. So, the delegators are incentivized to only stake
for reputable and trustworthy validators, therefore improving the security of the whole
network.

In the CyberMiles protocol, 10% of a validator’s stake must come from this validator’s own
CMT holding. This ensures that each validator has skin in the game because its own CMTs
are also at risk for being slashed. Hence, a validator is always also a delegator for itself.

Besides the 19 validators, the CyberMiles blockchain has 5 backup validators in case a

validator resigns, is hacked, or otherwise drops off after being slashed. The backup
validators are also paid by delegators who elected them. The concepts of validator’s
compensation and self-staking both apply here. The CyberMiles DPoS protocol divides
the total block award pool into two parts: validators and their delegators collectively
receive 90% of the total block awards; and backup validators and their delegators
collectively receive 10%. The delegators will find the equilibrium point in terms of staked
CMT distributions between validators and backup validators. We expect the combined
staking amount for backup validators will be somewhat higher than 10% the total staking
amount, resulting in less income per staked CMT for backup validators and their
delegators. That is because the backup validators take less risk of slashing.

The following table shows the responsibilities, risks and rewards for validators and
delegators to participate in the network governance through the DPoS mechanism.

A1.

Voting power

The block award is distributed to the delegators and then validators based on voting
power. Each stake from a delegator has a certain amount of voting power. Each validator’s
voting power is the sum of all its current stake’s voting power, and the entire system’s
voting power is the sum of all validators’ voting power.

Definitions Set 1:
•

𝑺𝒊𝒋 is the amount CMTs staked to validator i by delegator j. There are n delegators
for validator i including the validator itself.

•

𝑽𝒊𝒋 is the adjusted amount CMTs staked to validator i by delegator j. The current
voting power for delegator j at validator i is expressed as 𝑽𝒊𝒋 . In general, the
voting power grows with the staked amount of CMTs at the current time.

•

𝑺 is the total amount of CMTs staked to all validators. It can also be expressed as
𝒏
∑𝒎
𝒊(𝟏 ∑𝒋(𝟏 𝑺𝒊𝒋 .

The CyberMiles protocol disincentivizes any validator from growing too big. If a single
validator’s stake grows above 12% of total stake of the network, this validator could cause
instability in the network. So, the network protocol adjusts 𝑺𝒊𝒋 downward for this
validator. This threshold incentivizes large CMT holders to diversify and stake in multiple
validators, and it incentives validators to limit their max accepted stake.

Block award shares

The block award share for any delegator and validator depends on the current total
voting power, award pools reserved for regular and backup validators, and the
validator’s compensation rate for each of its delegators. The next set of equations specify
the portion of block awards distributed to delegators and validators.

Definitions Set 2:
•

𝑪𝒊𝒋 is the validator’s compensation rate for delegator j at validator i. As we had
mentioned, the validator can adjust compensation rate for individual delegators in
its stake pool.

•

𝑹𝒓 (𝒊) is the portion of the block award pool reserved for validator i’s type. For
example, it is 0.9 for validators, and 0.1 for backup validators.

In each block, the portion of block award each validator and delegator gets are as follows.

Corollary

The formula to compute voting power leads to an important corollary on the potential
compensations for validators and delegators.

Corollary: The more stakes a validator can attract outside of her self-stake, the more
compensation the validator can receive.

Based on the engineering design of the staking mechanism, the validator can encourage
and incentivize certain delegator behaviors by changing individual delegator’s validator
compensation rate.

Examples of validator and delegator compensation

The detailed computation of validator and delegator compensation is complicated and
depends on many external factors such as the staking behavior of others. In this section,
however, we will look into simplified scenarios to illustrate potential ROIs. Our
assumptions include the following.

•

The system has reached equilibrium.
o There is no new stake growth for all validators.

•

Each validator has the same numbers of delegators.

•

All delegator and validator pairs have the same validator compensation rate.

•

The transaction fees are negligible in transactions.

Definitions Set 3:
•

𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍(𝒕) is the total number of CMTs at time t. 𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍(𝟎) is the current total
number of CMTs.

•

𝑰 is the system inflation rate, per year.

•

𝑪 is the validator compensation rate across the system.

•

𝑺𝑺𝑹 is the self-staking ratio of the validator.

•

𝑹𝒔 (𝒊) is the percentage of staked CMTs that are staked for validator i’s type. It is
needed as the block awards are only distributed to staked CMTs.

The following formula compute the annual incomes for validators and delegators
respectively, for each CMT staked from one’s own account.

The following table shows how to apply the above formula to compute the block award
for delegators, and validator’s compensation, in different scenarios. The validator and
delegator incomes listed in the table are per 100 staked CMTs per year. For simplicity, the
table assumes

Note:
1.

The “stake ratio” column is the percentage of total CMT supply that is staked for DPoS. For
example, initially there were a total supply of 1 billion CMTs, so a 25% means overall 250M
CMTs are staked by their holders to participate in the DPoS mechanism.

2. We are assuming a system wide inflation rate of 8% per year, which is the source of block
award.
3. Validator income = validator compensation + block award from self-staked CMTs
4. Delegator income = block award from staked CMTs – validator compensation
5. The validator does not stake more than 12% of the “total CMTs staked”. The income drops for
if the validator exceeds that threshold. See B4 for why this threshold exists.

Incomes for both validators and delegators go up when fewer people stake their CMTs,
as the 8% inflation is divided up amongst fewer parties. The validator’s per-staked-CMT
income goes up when it stakes less of its own tokens and gets compensation from other
delegators’ stakes. However, as we discussed, each validator must self-stake at least 10%
of its total stake.

Next, let’s compute incomes when validators receive a risk premium over backup
validators. In the following table, we assume that the validator’s compensation (C) is 20%,
and the 30% of total staked CMTs are staked to backup validators (Rs). Recall that backup
validators and their delegators collectively receive 20% of the total block awards (Rr). The

income than each CMT staked to regular validators. Delegators do that because the
backup validators have less risk of slashing.

Ongoing validator election

Once the network is up and running, validators can be voted in and out at real time. At
all times, the top 19 validator candidates that have the most “voting power” (as measured
by staked CMTs) are “hired” as validators by the delegators. Validator candidates ranked
between 19th and 24th are elected as backup validators.

B1.

Declaration of candidacy

A validator candidate declares its candidacy to the network. It will give out 3 pieces of
information in the declaration:

1. Details of its operation and credentials, including jurisdiction, data center location,
security setup, and technical setup. The CyberMiles Foundation will evaluate all
validator candidates, and publicly indicate the candidates that meet the
Foundation’s standards (i.e., information accuracy, technical competency, and
hardware / network setup). However, the token holders are free to stake for any
candidate regardless whether it meets the Foundation standard or not.
2. The maximum amount of CMTs it is willing to accept as stakes. In order to prevent
any single validator from growing too big and therefore risking monopoly, the
network protocol punishes very large validators and their delegators. (see the “B4.
Block award and validator’s compensation” section for details)

The CyberMiles DPoS Protocol v1.5

19

3. The validator’s compensation rate it requires from delegators. For example, a 40%
rate means that 40% of the block awards earned by delegators who staked this
validator, will be paid to this validator as compensation.

20

B2.

Acceptance of candidacy

Upon a new candidate declaration, the network immediately takes 10% of the declared
maximum amount of stake from the candidate's own account, and keep it as stake. If the
candidate does not have 10% of the max, the declaration will fail. The validator can, of
course, stake itself with additional CMTs later.

The CyberMiles Foundation will review the candidate's information. If the foundation can
verify the accuracy of the information, it will denote on-chain that the candidate is
“verified”. CMT holders can stake any validator candidate they like, including the
unverified ones, but verified candidates from the foundation give CMT holders more
confidence to stake.

The CyberMiles DPoS Protocol v1.5
Copyright ©2018 CyberMiles Foundation All Rights Reserved.

21

B3.

Staking and unstaking

The validator candidate campaigns in the community and asks people to stake it (i.e., to
hire it for the job of the validator).
CMT holders (delegators) stake their CMTs to the validator candidate. It is important to
note that staked CMTs cannot be traded, and once staked, a delegator must request
unstaking and then wait a week before he can trade them again. You keep getting
award during the waiting period.

The waiting period of unstaking is to guard against something called “long range double
spend attack”.

Note:
During the initial stage of the network, all delegators must stake their CMTs through a specialty
hardware device known as the CMT Cube. That is to ensure network stability and fund safety during
the crucial period of network startup. The CMT Cube will be free and the blockchain staking protocol
will be open to all after the network became stable. See more details in the last two sections herein.

22

B4.

Block award and validator’s compensation

Once the validator candidate receives enough stake to make the top 19, it becomes a
validator, and all its delegators start to receive block award (about every 10 seconds). The
block award includes two parts.

1. The system has an annual inflation rate of 8%. This inflation is distributed as newly
minted CMTs to delegators.
2. The delegators also receive transaction fees paid by heavy users of the blockchain.

The total block award from the system is first assigned to the delegators proportional to
each delegator’s voting power. The system then automatically distributes the block award
to the validators and delegators based on the validator’s compensation rates. The awards
are added to the stake by default. For delegators and validators to withdraw the CMTs
for trading, they need to request unstaking and wait for a week.

A validator can withdraw its candidacy at any time. Once a validator withdraws, the next
candidate with the most staked CMTs in line will become a validator. When a validator
withdraws, all its staked CMTs will be automatically unlocked after the one-week unstake
waiting period. During the whole staking period, there is no transfer of ownership of the
delegators’ CMTs.

23

B5.

Slashing and punishment

When a validator becomes unavailable or produces results that are different from the rest
of the validators, the system will slash and burn 0.1% of its total stake (i.e., the validator
itself and all its delegators will lose CMTs) every block (every 10s). After 12 consecutive
slashes, the system removes the validator and promotes the next validator candidate as
a validator. That is, delegators can be punished for up to 1.2% of their stake in a
misbehaving validator.

The removed validator will no longer suffer slashing loss, but none of its delegators will
earn any block awards either. Its delegator can request to unstake from it, and then restake their CMTs after the one-week unstake waiting period.

C.

Genesis validators election

When the CyberMiles main net goes online, it needs to start with 19 validators, known as
genesis validators. However, the chicken and egg problem is that there is no way to stake
before the main net goes online.

To solve this problem, prior to the main net launch, the CyberMiles Foundation will work
with the community to elect genesis validators based on each validator candidate’s
projected voting power, as well as its contributions to the community. The election
process will be transparent with a public scoring mechanism. The genesis validators are
the top candidates with the highest score. The scoring criteria include:

•

The initial amount of CMTs the candidate is willing to stake (at least 10% of its
declared max – see below)

•

Validator’s compensation rate it requires from delegators

•

Soft commitment of CMT stake from its community.

•

The reputation of the operation entity
o An official website
o Company information (brief introduction of the team and list of key staff,
photos, and relevant background qualifications)

•

Size and activities of its community (i.e., Twitter, Telegram, Medium, etc. followers
and interactions)

The CyberMiles DPoS Protocol v1.5
Copyright ©2018 CyberMiles Foundation All Rights Reserved.

25

•

Geopolitical diversity of the validators (i.e., candidates from under-represented
countries will have higher weight)

•

Commitment to run the validator nodes according to the technical standards set
by the Foundation (total expenditure and technical plan; scaling plan for hardware)

•

Community development plan (validator candidate roadmap on values,
community project timeline, finances, transparency, or any other topics the
candidate deems important.)

•

Operational nodes on the testnet for community testnet participation

To participate in the genesis validator election, each candidate must

•

Declare its maximum accepted staking CMTs

•

Fund its own account with 10% of the max to be staked at genesis by the network

•

Declare its validator’s compensation rate

•

Disclose detailed information about the organization or individual

Once the CMT Cube devices are distributed to CMT holders, the continuous validator
election starts. CMT holders will use the CMT Cube to vote (stake) for validators they
want to hire.

D. About the CMT Cube
The CMT Cube is a home-based device specifically designed to facilitate validator
election during the initial stage of CyberMiles network operation. It is a hardware device
that acts both a CMT wallet (i.e., stores and manages a CMT account), and an easy-to-use
user interface, or UI, for staking the CMTs in the wallet to elect validators. Its UI also
displays the up-to-date earnings (delegator’s block award) the account receives over
time. The hardware wallet at home is much safer than web-based or phone-based
software wallets, and hence is ideal for holding and staking significant amounts of CMTs.

The CMT Cube hardware consists of an LED touch screen for managing CMTs in the
associated account, a secure chip for storing private key information, and a mobile
computer running a customized version of Android. It uses very little electricity, and only
need to be turned on when the user needs to make changes to the account (e.g., to check
account balance, to deposit or withdraw CMTs, to stake or unstake a validator etc.)

In the long run, any CMT holder will be able to stake his or her CMTs via an open software
API provided by the network. However, during the crucial period of network startup
period, the network is vulnerable to attacks and the CyberMiles Foundation must take an
active role in making sure that the validator elections are free from attacks and frauds.
The requirement for a hardware device creates additional safeguards for the validator
election process. For example, as the device has an upfront cost (it will be reimbursed

over the year and eventually it is free) and has an upper limit for CMTs it can hold
(100,000 CMTs), it is very hard for a large stake holder to split into hundreds of CMT
accounts to secretly manipulate the election. The device also has a lower limit of 1000
CMTs it must hold and stake to prevent DDoS attacks or Sybil attacks that use small
amounts of stakes to abuse the system.

The block award distributed to the delegators will automatically show up on the CMT
Cube UI. Since the CMT Cube is the only way to participate in validator staking, it is
currently the only way for CMT holders to earn delegator awards at the initial stage.

As shown in the “validator and delegator compensation” table, the expected income of
each CMT Cube (delegator’s income) is proportional to the amount of CMTs staked, and
is related to factors such as the network-wide total staked CMTs, validator’s
compensation rate. We generally expect the delegator’s income will be higher than the
system inflation rate (currently at 8% per year).

The CMT Cube device will be sold exclusively on the cybermiles.io web site, and it will
be priced in CMTs.
