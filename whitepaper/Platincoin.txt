Codebase:

Litecoin 0.14.2

Hashing Algorithm:

CryptoNight

Block type:

Proof-of-Work (PoW)

Block frequency:

~90 sec

Block size:

4 Mb

Key prefixes:

3 bytes, P4/P5 (testnet), P8/P9 (mainnet)

Difficulty recalculation:

every 2016 blocks

Pre-mining:

600 mio PLC in first 100 blocks

Minting initialization:

blocks starting 100 to 200

MINING
Types of miner:

node, standalone, stratum (pool miner)

Debian, MacOS, Windows

Reward:

Â½ of total fees in block or 0.005, whatever is greater
(spendable after 100 blocks)

Minting support:

coinbase transactions obligatory refill script address
used for Minting transactions

MINTING
Special type of transaction that allows receiving guaranteed yearly interest (e.g. 10%) for
deposited funds. Interest rate should be provisioned beforehand by Root Authority and can
be withdrawn any time. Root Authority (10 keys) is specified in genesis block

SUPPORTING TOOLS
Middleware (indexing service + REST/JSON interface + BlockExplorer) implemented on
Tarantool, high-performance in-memory DB+Application server

NODE RPC
Based on Litecoin RPC with PLC Extensions for Minting transaction creation
(getplctransaction method)

WALLETS
Node wallet, desktop wallet based on Qt (MacOs, Linux, Windows), mobile wallets (iOS,
Android) use middleware for transaction creation/posting and blockchain indexing only
(private keys and wallets are stored locally
