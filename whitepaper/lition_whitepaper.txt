Lition White Paper

KEY
HIGHLIGHTS
Lition is developing the world’s first scalable public-private blockchain with deletable data features, made for commercial products.
This state-of-the-art protocol enables blockchain-based applications to step out of their current niche into commercial mainstream
deployment.
Blockchain development is co-innovated with SAP, whose chief innovation officer Dr. Jürgen Müller is also an advisor to Lition. SAP,
a company with >400 million users and >10,000 developers, is developing the decentralized ledger and smart contract layer, while
Lition is providing the open consensus layer. Lition will run the public mainnet using Lition tokens issued in an ICO for transaction
execution, staking and sidechain creation.
Lition is well positioned to design a blockchain infrastructure for business use, as it launched the world’s first P2P energy trading
dApp that is commercially live in a mass market with real revenues and real customers in over 25 cities. In addition to this existing
P2P trading dApp, there is a second use case in which Lition, together with a major Bank and a real estate company, has developed
an MVP to syndicate loans, and later tokenize the loans as Security Tokens (STOs). Beyond this, there are many more use cases with
the potential to disrupt not only the Energy and Banking spaces, but many others as well.
Furthermore, SAP can easily implement this blockchain into their existing products and services for their customer base of >400,000,
making them immediately ready for blockchain use cases. It is therefore well positioned to become the standard mainnet for
business applications.

Lition White Paper

LITION’S VISION
Our aim is to bring blockchain technology from its current hype-driven, speculation-fueled state with mostly pilot projects into
mainstream commercial use. Blockchain technology should improve the everyday lives of the people.
“Lition – bringing standard blockchain technology to business” - Lition’s vision
In order to achieve this, our objective is to develop an easy-to-use and easy-to-develop infrastructure that fulfills the requirements
of all businesses, from small companies to large corporations. Our blockchain should be the number one choice for any developer
or company seeking to use blockchain technologies.

THE BLOCKCHAIN
INFRASTRUCTURE

WHY BLOCKCHAINS MISS MAINSTREAM ADOPTION
Even though blockchains are regularly praised as a technology with the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries like the
internet did 20 years ago, we see limited mainstream adoption. Very few distributed applications (dApps) have made it into massmarket use, and large companies continue to shy away from the technology. Instead, we see many proof-of-concept or pilot
projects that showcase the technology but never make it to the next step. Leading tech companies have not begun pushing
blockchain into the market.
The reasons for this are both commercial/legal and technical.

COMMERCIAL / LEGAL REASONS
Large-scale adoption of new technical solutions comes primarily from established companies that already own the majority of
customer interfaces across industry sectors like technology, automotive, healthcare, finance, etc. These are typically large
corporations that use specific frameworks in order to decide whether or not to roll out a new technology to their customers.

Lition White Paper

Current blockchain solutions carry a high risk for corporate decision makers and their organizations, with 4 key reasons outlined in
Figure 1. There has not been a solution that addressed these issues until now.

TECHNICAL REASONS
With the hands-on experience gained as one of the world’s few mass-market blockchain applications in commercial production,
Lition has experienced first hand that there is no blockchain infrastructure available that fulfills the technical requirements needed
for mainstream adoption outside of very specific, niche use cases.
Instead, current blockchain technologies are designed for strengths in specific areas, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Technical reasons for low mainstream adoption of blockchains

These limitations largely explain why mainstream adoption of blockchains has been so slow, and why public attention has instead
been driven by cryptocurrency price developments and speculative use.

LITION’S APPROACH TO BRING BLOCKCHAIN INTO MAINSTREAM USE
In order to bring blockchains into mainstream use, Lition needs to address the commercial and technical issues outlined above. As
many commercial issues cannot necessarily be solved by innovative but inexperienced players, Lition has partnered with SAP. The
software giant SAP is the worldwide leader in business software, with a market capitalization of $150bn, over 400mn users from
their >400,000 customers and the power of >10,000 developers. With Lition’s extensive IT knowledge and experience from
launching the world’s first blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading application in a mass market, we’re working together on
a next-generation blockchain infrastructure. The Lition/SAP blockchain is made specifically to be the standard blockchain
infrastructure accepted by big industry players and used by any developer working on a dApp that serves a mainstream market in
a legally compliant way.

8

Lition White Paper

With the backing of a strong company like SAP, and innovative privacy and deletability features, our new blockchain addresses
many commercial issues outlined in Figure 1, making it a lower-risk choice for corporate executives – in turn enabling mainstream
adoption. A more detailed description on the partnership is outlined in a separate section on page 11.
In addition to the commercial purposes, the new blockchain is specifically designed to address the technical limitations outlined in
Figure 2 in one integrated blockchain infrastructure. To be more specific, Lition addresses six core infrastructural issues outlined in
Figure 3 along the existing live use case, as it shows the whole breadth of all improved features within a single customer journey.
Depending on the use case of the commercial blockchain applications, some or all of these features may be needed.

Figure 3: Improvements of new blockchain infrastructure, illustrated along existing peer-to-peer trading use case

Feature 1 – Light Client That Can Run on IoT Devices
Many use cases require IoT devices, e.g. sensors, appliances or Smart Meters, as used by Lition (see the Smart Metering section on
page 40). Today’s blockchain clients which participate in the network as nodes always require significant storage and processing
capacity. Lition’s current Ethereum client from Parity (parity.io), the most popular client in use, requires over 300 GB of storage.
Even special clients like GETH1 require 80 GB of storage in their fast modes, dropping as low as 40 GB for pruned (trimmed) clients
if only the most recent blocks are stored. Pure light clients that only store block headers can go down to 40 MB, but just like remote
clients that don’t require any storage, light clients do not have access to the data of previous blockchain executions, which is needed
to execute smart contracts and verify the correct execution of network nodes.
A blockchain built for widespread commercial use therefore needs clients that can run on thin hardware, such as Smart Meters or
the control units of the distribution grid’s voltage regulators, while still calling and verifying the smart contracts they deploy. Other
industries face the same barriers with existing blockchains, for example banking with lightweight Point-of-Sales (PoS) devices or the
automotive sector with connected cars, increasing relevance for such features beyond the energy space.

Lition White Paper

A promising solution could be provided by Slock.it, which is piloting a similar light client, but so far it is limited to the Ethereum
network with its corresponding shortfalls.
Feature 2 – Low Transaction Costs
High transaction costs caused by low energy efficiency are a common drawback of typical blockchain implementations, with Bitcoin
as the most prominent example. In the existing energy use case, before migration to Lition’s own platform, smart contract
executions can cost up to USD 0.60, depending on Ethereum’s network congestion. This is caused by the high number of hash
computations that are required by the network’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, which results in extremely high energy
consumption.
Bitcoin currently needs 60 TWh 2 annually for its blockchain to operate, an amount of energy equivalent to the country of Colombia’s
1F1F

annual energy consumption. At Lition, a core value is the sustainable use of natural resources, and therefore it is pivotal that we
operate on the most energy-efficient platform available. In comparison, the Ethereum blockchain consumes 78 kWh/transaction2,
thus making it 12.2 times more energy efficient than the Bitcoin network, which uses 957 kWh/transaction2. These numbers will
further improve once Ethereum developers switch from their current PoW solution into a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm and Vitalik
Buterin’s work on off-chain smart contracts with Plasma 3 is released into production state. To operate sustainably, Lition aims to
reduce energy consumption, and thus cost per transaction, to less than USD 0.01.
Almost all modern infrastructure chains like NEM, Cardano, ZipChain, or Hashgraph have developed solutions to solve this issue
with the many available open-source reference implementations. Therefore, this issue has been solved. However, none of these
chains are additionally able to solve the other drawbacks that concern businesses, like delectability or storage of private data in
separate but publicly verifiable sidechains.

Feature 3 – Fast Block Confirmation
Currently, customers need to wait well over a minute before their transactions are successfully executed on the Ethereum
blockchain. The underlying reason is high block confirmation times of 10-20 seconds along with a block height of several blocks
needed for certainty. As many use cases require transactions to be finalized in about 1-3 seconds, Lition is pursuing a protocol to
massively improve the block times for smart contract executions.
As with the issue of high transaction costs, most modern chains have claimed to find solutions to this problem while staying
permissionless. But as is the case with the transaction cost issue, they have not been able to do so while also addressing other
shortcomings, like private data.
Feature 4 – Private Sidechains for Private Data
Today, typical permissionless blockchains store their data publicly, potentially allowing criminals to misuse this information, e.g.
bank accounts or social security numbers. In the existing use case, this could be Smart Meter data, e.g. availability of electrical
appliances, which could provide an indication of household income: a customer possessing 3 TVs, an energy-efficient dishwasher,
a dryer and an electric floor heater is obviously wealthier than the average household. This is all data that Lition can already detect

10

Lition White Paper

today with its Smart Meter integration (see the use case section later in this white paper for details), but no customer would want
this information to be publicly known.
This aspect applies to many industries, such as (a) banking with personal loans and account transaction data, (b) construction with
historic property data, (c) healthcare with medical patient data, (d) supply chain management with product, contract and origin
data or (e) social media with identity or personal (meta)data.
Typical solutions propose achieving privacy by putting private data on a public chain and encrypting it, as suggested e.g. by
researchers Karla Kvaternik et. al.4. Lition is aware that these solutions have fundamental limitations, as the encrypted data is still
publicly available and is therefore prone to hacking if vulnerabilities in the encryption are found or sufficient processing power is
available. This is unlikely now, but as the data is stored permanently and publicly it will still be there in 5 to 10 years, when quantum
computing is set to emerge and loopholes may be found. This has happened many times so far, e.g. for the widely used WEP
encryption, which due to faulty design does not give reliable protection against hackers.
Instead, Lition knows private data needs to reside on private sidechains available only to trusted nodes. Furthermore, public
sidechains are still needed for public data, such as the current energy prices of power plants that must be publicly available. Both
the private and the public sidechains need to be embedded in a greater public, permissionless network so that new participants
can easily join, ensuring easy and developer-friendly adoption of the chain. A solution is the utilization of probabilistic zeroknowledge-proofs as shown in the technical white paper. This would allow public nodes to verify the private transactions inside
private sidechains, ensuring overall consistency.
Feature 5 – API for Chain ↔ Backend Communication for Easy Developer Access
During the development of the energy trading use case, Lition developers had to spend a great deal of time and resources to
develop an API interface that enables communication between the blockchain and the Lition backend application. Blockchain nodes
need a simple API interface to allow easy integration into non-blockchain applications. This is required by business blockchain
applications in every industry that require integration into off-chain systems.
This issue needs to be addressed in order to allow a quick and easy rollout of the Lition blockchain solution into mass markets and
additional use cases. Typical large industry players have a complex legacy IT landscape, making an easy and seamless integration
even more important. These findings are not new, as corporate-targeted projects like NEM or SAP’s blockchain-as-a-service
solutions have also identified this pain point, which must now be addressed. However, neither NEM nor SAP’s current solution is
able to also solve the other issues that remain in regulated markets.
Feature 6 – Data Can Be Deleted from Blockchain
Currently, transactions on blockchains are permanently and irreversibly stored on the blockchain. While this is a precondition of
any public chain, it is not necessarily in the customer's best interest. In an ongoing business relationship, a customer might accept
that his social security number or bank account is needed, but want to make sure this data is deleted once the business relationship
ends and the data is no longer needed. However, once a customer terminates his contract, there is currently no way to delete this
sensitive data – blockchains are not designed for this. Most solutions today that support deletion of data only store the references
in the blockchain, with the real data stored off-block. When private data needs to be deleted, the on-block reference is kept

11

Lition White Paper

unchanged, but the off-block data is deleted. The problem with this approach is that any smart-contract execution requiring private
data needs access to the off-chain resource, defeating the purpose of a blockchain.
In addition to customer issues, there are also legal requirements from the GDPR (General Data Protection Rules) effective
throughout the EU, and many other national data-privacy guidelines. They enforce deletion of private data once it is no longer
needed. In the EU, violations of this law can lead to fines of up to 4% of a company’s global annual revenue, which can be hundreds
of millions of dollars for large corporations. This has been the focus of several press articles 5.
While this might not be an issue for Proof-of-Concept blockchain applications, it will be once an application launches and is brought
to commercial mainstream adoption. Therefore, any business desiring to share its blockchain application with on-block storage of
private data to the masses needs to use an infrastructure supporting data deletion.

THE PARTNERSHIP WITH SAP
SAP, the world’s business software leader with over 400,000 customers and >10,000 developers, has signed a co-innovation
contract to work with Lition on solving the limitations of today’s blockchain infrastructure, such as privacy, speed and transaction
costs.
A summary of this cooperation is outlined by Dr. Jürgen Müller, SAP’s chief technology officer (CTO) in the following interview:

Watch the interview with SAP’s CTO
explaining the cooperation at:
https://youtu.be/lXpBRHptyKk

SAP and Lition believe that a technical solution to the issues limiting mainstream use will spur adoption of blockchain and
blockchain-influenced applications. This will benefit SAP’s customers and Lition’s public mainnet users alike. SAP and Lition are
therefore cooperating to design a permissioned platform that focuses on data storage and exchange, with a layer for publicly
verifiable claims, similar to concepts described commonly as zero-knowledge proofs. This will allow high throughput and low latency
for the majority of private transactions and public validation capabilities for select records.
Based on this design, SAP would leverage their existing database & middleware expertise to explore a platform that incorporates a
pluggable verification layer. Lition would provide a decentralized consensus and verification mechanism tailor-made to hold these
publicly-verifiable claims, extending the capabilities to an identity-agnostic audience and thereby turning it into a public blockchain.
This allows SAP to validate the concept of backing records against a public blockchain. Meanwhile, Lition can run its ecosystem on
the public segment of the solution, where miners execute transactions and are compensated by tokens similar to today’s Ethereum

blockchain. SAP can further integrate the blockchain into their existing product portfolio and offer it to their over 400,000
customers.

COMPARISON WITH EXISTING CHAINS
Lition has conducted extensive discussions with leading experts in order to overcome the issues outlined in the previous section.
After researching dozens of different chains, Lition found many solutions to almost every individual issue, but no integrated,
coherent solution:

Lition White Paper

To provide a background, the six underlying features can be segmented into the following groups:
•

Light-client (#1), Costs (#2), Speed (#3), Accessibility (#5): As described in the previous section, there are many chains or
workarounds to address these issues. With the currently ongoing Hyperledger-implementation, Lition already addresses
many of them. As many open-source implementations exist with a license allowing code re-use for commercial
applications, these concerns are less critical.

•

Private sidechain for private data (#4). Many purely public (e.g. Ethereum) and purely private (e.g. Hyperledger) chains
exist. When both private and public data need to be stored, three potentially relevant options exist for a commercial
implementation. However, they all exhibit other concerns (see below), and none of them provides a solution for deleting
data (#6):
o

ICON, a chain to connect public and private blockchains, was the prime candidate as a foundation for the
existing Lition use case, but in intense discussions with numerous blockchain specialists including a joint
discussion the founders had with ICON’s Lead Blockchain Architect in Seoul (see Lition’s twitter account for
pictures and more information), we could not apply the finance-oriented nature of the blockchain to the smartcontract-oriented nature needed by the decentralized applications of the use case.

o

Polkadot is technically not a blockchain, but rather a method to connect blockchains. The concept is very close
to Lition’s, as they plan to connect private/consortium chains and public/permissionless networks. However,
due to a faulty implementation by their developer Parity Technologies, USD 150m of Ether is frozen forever6.
This is the majority of their funding, making it unclear if they have sufficient funds to ever make it to production
as planned for Q3 2019. Also, reputational risks make it difficult to recommend a solution with this track record
to the risk-averse companies in regulated markets.

o

Energy Web Foundation is an open-source blockchain designed for the energy sector with support for light
clients and confidential messages. It is driven by large corporations such as E.On, PG&E and Shell, and caters to
the needs of these large conglomerates, therefore prolonging the shortfalls of these inefficient markets and
leading to excess profits and continued market domination by these corporations. EWF relies on a Proof-ofAuthority consensus mechanism (with authority given to the conglomerates), which defeats the open nature of
a blockchain. As it is a fork of the Ethereum mainnet, it also has many Ethereum-related shortcomings, such as
the inability to have both public and private sidechains and to delete data. Also, unlike Lition, it has no use cases
that have been brought to commercial production, let alone mass markets.

Lition White Paper

ARCHITECTURE
Applications need scalable, fast and legal blockchain infrastructures in order to find a context where it makes sense to approach
the business arena. As of the time of writing, such a context does not exist. Current solutions are unable to keep data private and
lack deletability features. The three keywords of our solution are sidechains, permissioned nodes and permissionless nodes.
Lition is developing a solution that will assure data privacy while being permissionless. This is made possible by connecting a
permissioned sidechain to a public mainchain.

THE LAYER 2 STRUCTURE
Lition’s Layer 2 solution consists of permissioned nodes that run a privileged blockchain network, which becomes a sidechain once
the mainnet sync happens. The nodes run the network with the Lition Proof of Stake (LPoS) consensus algorithm, making it an
extremely fast chain. Every n blocks, depending on the industry requirements, the side chain will synchronize to the public mainnet.
Only the hash of the last block is published and saved on the mainnet, assuring the integrity of all previously validated transactions.
At the same time, an API is exposed so that public nodes have the opportunity to verify the integrity of a hash within a sidechain.

As a public network, Lition will use the Ethereum blockchain. However, if technology advances and interoperability between
different blockchains becomes feasible, it is Lition’s goal to develop a “universal” layer 2 solution for all Public blockchains. The role
of a public mainnet is to store sidechains’ hashes as proof of their historical integrity. The integrity of recorded blocks is ensured as
two thirds of sidechain nodes need to confirm integrity to the mainnet.

15

Lition White Paper

DATA SEPARATION AND DELETION CONCEPT
Separate storage of private and public data is core to Lition’s blockchain architecture. In a nutshell, we split between:
•

Sidechain block hashes and management: Stored in the mainnet (currently Ethereum)

DApp data and smart contract executions: Stored in the sidechains (public or private).

The blockchain network’s design covers minimum requirements for a governing agreement among a privileged subset of the nodes’
operators, ensuring that private, sensitive data can be handled and securely deleted on demand - even connected to smart contracts
for deletion. The guiding design criteria are post-quantum security for data integrity, a path towards post-quantum security for data
privacy, data minimization under the constraint of providing fault tolerance, privacy of sensitive data, a provision to delete all
occurrences of sensitive data, and the freedom to join as a (non-privileged) node without any special provisions or legal obligations.
Technically, private data is only stored on privileged nodes that are mining private sidechains. The data never leaves the sidechain,
only the hashes do. This allows public nodes to verify the integrity of the sidechain transactions. The mainchain therefore acts as a
“notary” for the private data stored only in the sidechain.

Figure 5: Lition blockchain data separation and deletion concept

Private sidechains also have the ability to delete data. Privileged nodes have to agree to Terms of Service (ToS) upon joining the
sidechain, which can include a requirement to delete data upon request. This gives the sidechain owner (who is legally obliged to
guarantee data deletion) the ability to, in a legal and contractually confirmed way, guarantee that every data holder will delete the
data when asked to do so.
Technically, a deletion request is a transaction signed by the original data owner with the data hash that should be deleted. Upon
receipt, all nodes will delete the data of the requested transaction, but the transaction hash stays intact. Therefore, the Merkle tree
of the block remains intact, and an unobstructed trail from the most recent block all the way to the sidechain’s genesis block is
possible.

Lition White Paper

While the functional requirements addressed by this blockchain are derived from the shortcomings described earlier in this chapter,
Lition provides the technical description in a separate, technical whitepaper. It caters to the technically interested reader, and also
provides the fundamentals from current research.
The technical white paper is available at www.lition.io in the Downloads section.

STEP-BY-STEP DESCRIPTION OF CORE PROCESSES
In this chapter we provide the reader with detailed step-by-step explanations on how transactions are processed, how nodes can
join the network and how they can stake and validate new blocks.

STEP-BY-STEP DESCRIPTION: TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND MINING
Observing Lition’s blockchain from a high level, we see that six main stages are needed to complete the transaction (=Tx) flow. They
are, in this order: Put Gas on Sidechain, Create Tx, Process Tx, Propagation within sidechain, New block creation (Sidechain) and
Mainnet synchronization. For a better understanding of the following explanations, please refer to the architecture table below.

Figure 6: Transaction Flow in Sidechain

Step 0: Put Gas on Sidechain
In order to guarantee that a certain network user will be able to pay for transactions, he or she needs to allocate tokens to the
specific Sidechain. This process requires a smart contract execution on the mainchain called AllocToken(sidechainID, tokenAmount).
As is evident, the amount of tokens and the ID of the sidechain are required. This ensures that the solution is protected against
double-spend attacks on multiple sidechains.

17

Lition White Paper

Step 1: Create Tx
This step refers to the event in which a given user utilizes Lition’s blockchain and triggers a transaction, which implies a cascade of
events as described below. Transaction deployment is compatible with today’s Ethereum blockchain, so developers have no
migration effort allowing a fast growth of the blockchain.
Smart Contracts: If dApp developers use Truffle, for example, they just need to pinpoint the deployment to a different network in
the Truffle configuration file. Solutions allowing upgradability of contracts such as OpenZeppelin can be used.
Clients: The Lition blockchain client is fully compatible with the Web3.js and RPC interconnection capabilities of Geth or Zeplin.
Users can continue to use plugins such as Metamask, and dApp developers can reuse their existing Ethereum applications.
Step 2: Process Tx
During this process, the transaction is received from the node, which in turn ensures that if enough gas is owned by the user, the
user’s smart contract containing the following information is triggered:
Tx:

The smart contract name. For example in the case of energy, buy-energy()

TxHash:

Transaction data are hashed so that a unique hash is created

Gas:

Gas used for the transaction

User:

User’s wallet

Unlike existing blockchain implementations, a user gets an instant (<3 seconds) response if a transaction was processed successfully,
i.e. if the smart contract code was executed without errors and if the user had sufficient gas. This ensures a convenient experience
for the customer and meets expectations for mass market use cases.
Step 3: Propagation within the Sidechain
Once the transaction is processed, it is propagated throughout the network of nodes in the sidechain previously specified by the
user using a gossip protocol. At this point, the transaction is in a pre-validation stage waiting to be mined by Lition’s Proof of Stake
(LPoS) consensus algorithm.
Step 4: New Block Creation within the Sidechain
During this stage, the transaction triggered by the user, together with a variable number of other transactions, undergoes a process
that validates this bundle of data and transfers it to the blockchain in an irreversible way. This is similar to existing blockchains, but
we introduce finality, ensuring consistency between sidechains and the anchored mainchain hashes. Each new sidechain block
contains the following information:
MerkleRoot:

The root hash of the merkle-tree of the block

BlockTX[]:

The hashes of each transaction, needed for the merkle-tree

Hash_prev:

Hash of the previous block, going back all the way to the genesis

Miners[]:

Pool of miners that were active and contributed to this block. The LPoS
mining reward is then calculated and transferred by calculations within
this mainnet smart contract upon mainnet anchoring. The latter three
sets of information (Tokens_N, %_active, Sec_active) are the core
variables of the algorithm which decides the node that is going to be
the validator at any given block creation time.

This process is done by nodes that are therefore not only carrying all the historical sidechain data, but also function as authorities
that guarantee correct behavior within the network by

18

Lition White Paper

staking their own tokens as “collateral”, meaning that in the case of misbehavior, tokens are going to be lost. Lition’s consensus
mechanism that will assure the integrity of sidechains can be seen as a pure Proof of Stake (Pos). Each and every sidechain has its
own network of nodes. Each node has to subscribe to a particular chain by filling in some parameters in a sidechain-specific smart
contract to the backbone mainnet. The function to call is StakeTokens(), which can be called by any mining node of the
sidechain, and it is a prerequisite for miners to receive their mining reward. The details of the smart contract are described in the
process flow for sidechain creation.
To ensure the ability to delete data within a private sidechain, participating privileged nodes need to agree to Terms of Service
(ToS) that require them to delete data once the properly signed request arrives. However, they only delete the data while keeping
the corresponding hashes. This allows the underlying Merkle tree of the block to stay intact and thereby ensures traceability all the
way to the genesis block.
Step 5: Mainnet Synchronization
During this stage, the transaction (which is now already an integral part of the sidechain and is therefore irreversible in its specific
allocation) will be validated by a public mainnet. The communication frequency with the backbone blockchain is industry specific.
For example, energy transactions need to be synced frequently, while notary contracts need to be synced less often.
The synchronization parameters of each sidechain are decided during the sidechain registration process. The parameters to set are
the number of transactions that must occur before the synchronization happens, the time interval between synchronizations, or
both. This particular process will be explained in more depth in the next chapter of this document.
For the purpose of synchronization, only the hash of the last block is required to be stored on the Public Chain, as that assures the
integrity of the whole interval of blocks. For example, the tiniest change in the data saved in previous blocks of the given interval
will affect and change completely the hash of the last block. That occurs because every new block uses the hash from the previous
block as part of the data to be hashed with the Merkle tree of the specific block. Thus, the load of data to be stored on the public
chain is almost irrelevant, but the results are the same.
Once the time of synchronization arrives, the following smart contract function is called in order to anchor the sidechain data in
the mainnet, thereby making it immutable: Notarize(sidechainID, BlockHash, TxUsers[], Activity[])
BlockHash:

The hash of the most recent sidechain block header

TxUsers[]:

The wallets of users, indicating aggregate gas costs per wallet based
on the transaction usage

Activity[]:

The activity record of mining nodes. Together with the LITION tokens
staked through the StakeTokens() mainnet smart contract, the Notarize()
function knows to whom to distribute the users’ gas.

Figure 7: Sidechain registration and expansion

Step 1: Start and Register a Sidechain
Every developer or company that decides to join the network has to register its sidechain to the mainnet, calling the smart contract
RegisterSidechain(). The following data is required:
Sidechain_ID:

This ID is referred to during staking and synchronization. Can be
set to NULL, in which case the mainnet creates an ID and returns
it as return value.

Permissioned:

Defines the nature of the sidechain (boolean yes/no)

Sync_Cond:

Defines the parameters of mainchain sync interval length

MasterHosts:

Array of IPs and ports of the set of initial sidechain nodes,
both for miners to connect to, and separately a Website URL that
users can use to query for information

Step 2: Start Node

20

Lition White Paper

The owner or initiator needs to run a node on the mainnet as well as on the sidechain. On the sidechain, a master host will provide
new clients with a list of bootnodes to connect to.
Step 3: Invite Nodes to Join
The node that initiated the sidechain can then invite new nodes to join the network. Depending on the configuration of the
sidechain, which can be public for non-sensitive data or private for confidential data, new nodes must accordingly be either public
or privileged.
To mine a sidechain, miners need to become nodes and mine blocks. Should they want to be a publicly announced entry point to
the sidechain, they can advertise themselves to the public using the function RegisterNode() on the mainnet registration contract.
The more sidechain nodes advertise themselves on the publicly visible mainnet, the more nodes a new miner has to initially connect
to. Technically, new hosts are added to the MasterHosts variable initially set during the RegisterSidechain() smart contract call.
Respectively, the following data sets need to be included:
Register Node:
Sidechain_ID:

This is the ID created from the sidechain initiator

Node_ID:

This code makes each node unique & identifiable

Challenge:

(Optional) A challenge that can only be solved by nodes being
granted access to the sidechain. Only needed for private
sidechains

Additionally, nodes mining the sidechain may want to stake tokens in order to receive mining rewards, which they can do using the
StakeTokens() smart contract outlined in the upcoming Step-by-Step description.
Step 4: Node Leaves the Network
At any given point in time, nodes can leave the network. The user might leave this side, and therefore needs to inform the mainnet.
This is only needed when nodes have previously called the function RegisterNode() on the registering smart contract.
To cancel a node and therefore leave the sidechain, the user needs to call the UnRegisterNode() function. Respectively, the
following data sets need to be included:
UnRegisterNode:
Sidechain_ID:

This is the ID created from the sidechain initiator

Node_ID:

This code makes each node unique & identifiable

A call to UnRegisterNode() automatically unstakes any tokens a miner might have staked on this sidechain, as staking rewards
can only be received when mining.

STEP-BY-STEP DESCRIPTION: STAKING
Every blockchain needs a fuel to run. Lition’s Proof of Stake (LPoS) is the consensus algorithm which validates the blocks and decides
which miner receives the reward. A step-by-step explanation is outlined below.

Figure 8: Staking of tokens

Step 1: Register as Node in Sidechain
The first step for a user to join the network is to become a node by connecting the client to a sidechain. Once the node is up and
running, the block verification process starts automatically, and the user becomes a functioning validator in the system. Since there
is little incentive to operate a full node, node operators receive mining rewards in the form of tokens. The token distribution
happens once each time the blocks are synchronized with the mainchain. Nodes therefore not only carry all of the historical
sidechain data, but also function as authorities that guarantee correct behavior within the network by staking their own tokens as
“collateral”, meaning that in the case of dishonest mining, tokens will be lost.
Step 2: Stake Tokens & Mine
Lition’s consensus mechanism will assure the integrity of sidechains and belongs to the family of Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols.
Each and every sidechain has its own network of nodes. Each node must subscribe to one or more particular chains by filling in
parameters in a sidechain-specific smart contract to the backbone mainnet. The function to call is StakeTokens(), where the
following data needs to be delivered:
Sidechain_ID:

Sidechain the tokens should be allocated to

Node_ID:

Identifies the Node mining the sidechain

Miner_Wallet:

Wallet where rewards for staking are being transferred

22

Lition White Paper

Tokens_N:

Amount of tokens to be allocated to specific SC. These tokens are
then unavailable for transfer to the mainnet until retrieved again
using the UnstakeTokens() smart contract.

%_active:

Percentage being active since the last block. Mining rewards are
multiplied by this figure.

Sec_active:

Seconds continuously active. Nodes mining for a long time receive
a mining premium.

The latter three sets of information (Tokens_N, %_active, Sec_active) are the core variables of the algorithm which selects the node
that will be the validator at any given block creation time. Hence, the Miner_Wallet that receives the rewards.
Step 3: Miner Rewards
The miners are rewarded every time the sidechains sync with the mainchain. The smart contract that handles the transfers of
staking tokens from the user wallets to the miner wallets is called Notarize(sidechainID, BlockHash, TxUsers[],
Activity[]), as was described in the first step-by-step process description.
Step 4: Node Leaves the Network
Once a node decides to stop staking, e.g. because the user wants to use the tokens on a different sidechain or the mainnet, the
following smart contract needs to be called: UnstakeTokens() where the following parameters must be provided to the system:
Sidechain_ID:

Identifies the chain where the node will stop staking

Miner_Wallet:

Wallet where rewards for staking were being transferred

Tokens_N:

Amount of tokens to be allocated away from a specific SC. NULL
for all.

Now the tokens are available to join other sidechains.

23

Lition White Paper

LITION’S PROOF OF STAKE CONSENSUS ALGORITHM
Necessity for Tokens
Lition itself does not charge for the infrastructure in terms of licensing, but the actors that are part of the validation system are not
doing the validation task for free. Therefore, the whole system needs a fuel to run, an incentive. This incentive is achieved by
rewarding validators in native tokens. At the same time, from a developer perspective, the system needs to be free from bugs, and
potential downtimes or destruction of the system must be disincentivized. In some cases, that is assured by staked tokens that
validators would lose in the case of misbehavior.
Validators’ Consensus Algorithm Types
There are several logics/processes (algorithms) to reach a consensus on which participant of the network (node) gets to add/confirm
the newest block and at the same time validate the integrity of its contents.
Blockchains using Proof of Stake (PoS) require nodes to hold a certain amount of native tokens in order to be eligible to participate
in the validation system. If the validators misbehave, some or all of their tokens will be lost. In order to determine the validator that
will be rewarded with tokens, an unpredictable random function is utilized, which according to specific variables determines the
probability that a validator node will be chosen.
Blockchains using Proof of Work (PoW) choose their validator as follows: the winner of a high energy-consuming mathematical task
competition is rewarded with native coins. In contrast, Lition’s layer 2 solution uses a self-developed Proof-of-Stake protocol. The
Lition Proof of Stake (LPoS) mechanism functions as a consensus algorithm with three variables to determine which is the next block
to be added to Lition’s private or public sidechains. The first variable is the number of tokens that are owned by the node. The
second variable is the age of the staking wallet and the third is the uninterrupted runtime as an active node since it went online. By
this mechanism, the commitment of validating nodes in the Lition network is rewarded and thus honest behavior is incentivized.
Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) in One Solution
In the case of Lition’s layer 2 solution, the transactions are validated once by the sidechain on which the block is mined (LPoS). Since
sidechains are again pegged to the backbone mainnet (such as Ethereum), the whole security of Ethereum’s proven Proof of Work
(PoW) system ensures sidechain transactions cannot be changed. As the load on the mainnet is minimal, and only non-timesensitive transactions are carried out there, the disadvantages of PoW to Lition are relatively small.
Sidechain Creation
Lition’s solution is designed so that any developer can quickly launch an application on the network and create its own sidechain(s)
to store any public or private data a developer may need. Nodes can then subscribe to the sidechain and therefore mine it. Once a
sidechain is created, the transaction fees will provide an incentive for nodes to keep mining it. Additionally, every sidechain owner
must pay a “rent” in tokens that increases with storage size of the sidechain. This gives an extra incentive to the nodes mining it
and ensures that even low-transaction chains will still continue to operate. Otherwise, these low-transaction sidechains would
eventually starve due to too few incentives.
Communication with the Backbone Mainchain
Lition’s infrastructure can be thought of as a system that is composed of two core engines. One of these is Lition’s EVM-compatible
virtual machine, which executes smart contracts on its sidechains, and the other is the link to the Ethereum mainnet, where block
hashes are periodically notarized for every sidechain.

24

Lition White Paper

Once a sidechain is registered, to stimulate participation, Lition will reward and allocate tokens to each node taking part in that
specific chain’s network. This is part of an initial scheme called the Genesis Phase (see the section on page 27 for more information).
On top of this, the revenue flow from transaction costs is divided among the staking nodes. This way, the blockchain’s usage costs
are transferred from the end user of the application to Lition for the initial period, making the system initially more customerfriendly.
The sidechain blocks are then validated on the Ethereum blockchain through a smart contract that executes either once every
certain number of sidechain transactions or after a predefined period of time, giving each side chain the flexibility to decide
depending on the industry.
As shown in the table below, the process of Mainnet Sync from the sidechains to the Ethereum mainnet produces negligible costs

Lition White Paper

Transaction Costs
This can be best compared to “Gas”, meaning any transaction or smart contract execution requires a specific amount of tokens.
The amount of tokens needed is deterministic, similar to Ethereum’s Ether-Gas function. Due to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus
mechanism, the overall costs of transactions and smart contract executions are set to USD 0.01. Potential fluctuations in the
LITION/USD exchange rate are accounted for through periodic gas modifiers. This allows DApp users to calculate with fixed
transaction costs, which is crucial especially for large corporations.
The transaction costs are distributed upon mining of a block, similar to Ethereum. However, no new tokens are spawned upon
mining, leading to a constant and limited total amount of tokens.

REWARDS FOR USERS HOLDING LITION TOKENS
Lition’s consensus mechanism which will assure the integrity of sidechains can be seen as a pure Proof of Stake (PoS) system. Each
and every sidechain has its own network of nodes. Each node has to subscribe to a particular chain by filling in some parameters in
a sidechain-specific smart contract to the backbone mainnet. The function to call is StakeTokens(). It is thereby assured that an X
amount of Lition tokens are being used to stake exclusively for one sidechain. As mentioned above, to incentivize good behavior in
the network, nodes have to be economically involved. As collateral, 20,000 Lition tokens are required to enter the network. This
amount is adjusted continually according to the USD market value of Lition tokens. The goal is to keep the network accessible over
time, meaning that if the market price of Lition is doubled and sustains for a certain amount of time compared to its ICO price, the
tokens required to run one node are halved and so on. The staking nodes will be rewarded by 2 token streams:
1) Mining Rewards for Processing Transactions
Lition’s layer 2 solution is conceived as a scalable layer. Therefore, two main points must be tackled: costs and speed of
transaction execution.
To lower costs, Lition decided to develop a system in which the transaction costs are constantly low, capped to a max of USD
0.01. The problem with other blockchains such as Ethereum is that the market determines the transaction fees, which means
that if the system gets congested, costs rise significantly.
The staking revenue stream for staking 1000 LITION is presented below. The equivalent of USD 100 in LITION tokens is the
minimum amount needed to be eligible as a staking node. As the transaction costs depend on the LITION/USD exchange rate,
this amount can also change. This is needed to ensure network security should LITION prices drop, but at the same time gives
business users security on their transaction costs.
The first scenario called “Today’s use cases” refers to the Lition Network once our energy and banking use cases have been
migrated onto our system. It is a conservative projection, since it takes into account that 1000 customers utilize our use cases,
as is already the case today.
E.g.: Energy Use Case: every 15 minutes, a buy order is triggered on the blockchain to sync the energy demand with the supply.
Every day (24h=1,440min), for each customer we will have 1,440 min / 15 tx/min = ~100 transactions. Meaning that for 1000
customers * 100 transaction/ day / customer = 100,000 tx/day.
In the Upcoming use cases scenario, we show how many other use cases we plan to launch in the near future and how this
would proportionally affect the transactions per day, following the above logic. The same applies to the growth plan 2020
scenario.

26

Lition White Paper

At the bottom of the table the annual interest rate is shown, which will be as high as 34% once more use cases are launched.
The transactions per day are assumed by observing today’s use cases. Though already appealing, it is a very conservative
estimate. If, for example, the energy use case scales to 100,000 customers, the transactions and therefore the revenues will be
factor 100.

Table 2: Example of staking revenues under different scenarios

During initial adoption, the transactions per day will not be attractive enough for the nodes to stake. Therefore, Lition will go
through an initial period of incentivized adoption called the Genesis Phase. During this phase, tokens are distributed each year
to the holders of Lition tokens that decide to stake. This solution makes it very attractive for Lition token holders to stake even
if the network is not yet adopted in a significant manner.
2) Additional Staking Reward During Genesis Phase
The Genesis Phase will be in place for the first two years following the launch of the Lition layer 2 blockchain. In this phase, the
initial functioning of the network is ensured by Lition, which will distribute tokens for each staker regardless of transactions in
the network. However, the variables that determine the staker that wins a specific block are still in place, meaning that the
rewards are distributed proportionally to three criteria. The first is the amount of token that are owned by the node, the second
is the age of the staking wallet, and the third is the uninterrupted runtime as an active node since it came online. This rewards
commitment of nodes in the Lition network. As the table below shows, it assures a constant LITION token inflow during the
Genesis Phase.
Lition will use a maximum of 31% of all tokens during this Phase. It is a maximum because during the Genesis Phase, the inflow
of external tokens to the staker will diminish proportionally to the number of transactions in the network, meaning that the
minimum annual interest rate will be guaranteed to be 20% the first year and 10 % the second year regardless of the amount
of transactions, but the allocation from Lition will diminish if more transaction fees are paid to the staker from the network
users. E.g. if the network grows organically and stakers gain 15% in the first year, Lition will pay the difference 20% - 15% = 5%
and so on. As soon as the network grows enough to guarantee 20% the first year and 10% the second year, Lition will not
allocate those tokens to stakers.

Table 2: Token allocation during Genesis Phase

The Genesis Phase will come to an end once the system is able to sustain itself. For now, the maximum timeframe is set to two
years, however future events and community demand can have an influence. For low-transaction side chains, it will also be
possible to incentivize nodes to stake with a rent that the developer will pay.

EXPECTED BALANCE OF TOKEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND
To ensure that the Lition blockchain infrastructure stays open and efficient, we have introduced a token-based concept. As
previously described, its prime uses are to pay for transactions, staking for correct network behavior and the creation of private
sidechains that distributed blockchain applications (dApps) can use.
Due to the widespread use of tokens, we anticipate a strong demand for them driven by organic (i.e. non-speculative) business use,
as outlined in Figure 9.

LITION REVENUE SOURCES AS A COMPANY
To push the Lition blockchain as the standard for business use, Lition as a company with its entity Lition Technology AG requires a
sustainable source of income. This income pays for development costs, marketing towards gaining additional use cases, etc. A
sustainable revenue source is crucial, as income gained through an ICO is a one-time effect.
Revenue sources are both digital and non-digital, split into the following two categories:
a) Mining Rewards through Staking Lition Tokens
In the Lition eco-system, individuals and businesses use and pay with LITION Tokens for transactions, staking and to spawn private
sidechains. These tokens will be sold in an initial coin offering (ICO) and listed at exchanges after the Token Generation Event (TGE).
Lition will have ICO revenues from tokens sold, as well as continuous revenues through staking. Initially, only ~60% of the tokens
will be distributed, so ~40% will remain with Lition (details see page 53). These ~40% will be used for staking, and statistically lead
to 40% of all transaction costs to be mined by Lition.
b) Intellectual Property (IP)
While usage of the blockchain infrastructure does not require special IP, just Lition tokens to pay for Gas, this is different for use
cases. Lition owns the licenses and trademarks on their developed public private blockchain use cases. While the code is open
source, only non-commercial use is allowed (see github.com/lition-blockchain). This intellectual property allows Lition to generate
non-digital revenues through the traditional IP revenue methods. Lition will exploit, license, askew, sell and share its IP to private
businesses and global industry players.
Depending on the product, industry and region, Lition will choose the most adequate method. Of course, this is also influenced by
the background and experience of the founders and core team. Currently the team’s focus is on creating and applying tech products
and services in the energy and banking sector.

29

Lition White Paper

Currently, Lition owns the IP on two working use cases, both described in this white paper. These are energy, which is commercially
live (page 30), and banking, with an MVP for syndicated loans with security tokens (page 37).
The business customers can either pay a one-time fee or a royalty on every sale/transaction for the use cases they desire.
Furthermore, Lition will share its knowledge with stakeholders, the community and clients. The paid training, coaching,
customization and consulting services provide additional revenue streams and work as a highly cost-effective marketing platform
to grow our brand awareness.

ACTIVE USE CASE IN P2P
ENERGY TRADING
LITION ENERGIE – THE WORLD'S FIRST MASS MARKET P2P TRADING PLATFORM
Alongside the Lition Foundation in Liechtenstein developing the standard blockchain infrastructure for business, the German Lition
Energie started with a P2P energy trading dApp and is now an officially licensed energy supplier
connecting renewable energy producers directly to consumers via its blockchain-based Energy
Exchange platform. By implementing a novel end-to-end energy exchange system, this Lition use
case bypasses unnecessary middle men within the energy supply chain. The combination of a
blockchain solution with highly efficient corporate processes and service operations that are built
on cloud-based solutions (SaaS) allows lower costs for energy customers while providing energy
producers with higher profit margins.
This Lition use case simplifies and standardizes the energy sector, shifting power from established
and traditional utility corporations to consumers and producers by providing consumers with
decision-making power regarding their energy sourcing. The exchange platform enables location
and preference-based offerings, thus leaving it to consumers to decide whether they want to
receive their energy from a photovoltaic installation on the neighbor’s rooftop or a solar park from
a renewable energy company in another state. This is the key difference from today’s industry
practice, in which consumers can choose their energy supplier, but not where the supplier
ultimately sources its energy. With the new approach, an increase in market demand for green electricity is directly routed to the
energy source and the consumer decides. Following the economic principles of matching supply and demand, the increased demand
is met by new, green power plants. This is how Lition Energie will democratize the energy sector.
In addition, by cutting out intermediaries, this use case results in green energy becoming more competitive. Using an efficient
blockchain-based exchange platform, Lition Energie simplifies the legal, operational and economic hurdles for green power
producers, allowing the consumer to buy genuine green electricity at a record-low price. Long-term industry expertise and
continuous market research clearly show that price is the prime decision criterion for consumers. Therefore, a large-scale rollout of
green electricity with fast adoption rates requires competitive pricing 7.
The energy use case currently supplies customers in more than 25 cities and has been featured in various news outlets like Coindesk8
and Huffington Post9.

HOW IT WORKS TODAY
For consumers, the local Lition supplier functions as an energy supplier with all country-specific licenses in place. In Germany,
consumers are supplied through the German Lition Energie GmbH. The German company holds a difficult-to-obtain license from
Germany’s Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur), and has signed contracts with over 600 grid distribution system operators
(DSOs) to ensure energy delivery to consumers and compliance with national legislation and taxation. Thus, Lition Energie can
officially guarantee power delivery to the consumer.

Figure 10: Description of the Lition P2P energy trading use case

Unlike traditional utilities in the “old world”, this use case changes antiquated processes in the energy sector. As outlined in Figure
10, it enables direct trading between consumers and producers or prosumers so that costly intermediaries, such as the European
Energy Exchange (EEX), are no longer necessary. The trade itself is a smart contract execution. The blockchain verifies the
authentication of buyers and sellers trading energy with each other, matches price and volume, and ensures that the quantity of
traded energy is sufficient (for details, see the blockchain section).

32

Lition White Paper

After the non-physical trade, the physical execution is carried out by the local Lition supplier (Lition Energie in the case of Germany).
It ensures that the grid is compensated, as this is an intermediary that cannot (currently) be taken out. The power is delivered
according to the country’s regulatory requirements and the customer receives billing and customer service. While the customer’s
energy exchange portal offers large self-service capabilities, traditional communication channels like telephone and email are in
place with a fully-operational call center. As quality of customer service is of utmost importance for a sustainable business, Lition
Energie has officially partnered with GASAG, a leading German utility with over 400 call center agents, to provide service operations
to Lition Energie’s customer base.

CONSUMER BENEFITS
Customers of Lition Energie enjoy tangible and unprecedented benefits making it a truly mass market product. As an enabler, Lition
takes out middle men that, in the energy industry, are conglomerates and have generated excessive profits for decades. As a result
of the blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading, highly efficient corporate processes, and dedicated focus on digitization,
customers benefit from record-low prices; their most relevant decision criterion. Currently, customers are saving approximately
20% on their monthly energy bill, which makes Lition Energie one of the cheapest energy suppliers in the market. Additionally,
customers get to choose and support the power plant directly, so the choice isn’t made by a big utility, but rather the customers
themselves. It is their contribution to a greener future.

Figure 11: Lition’s P2P use case customer benefits and resulting commercial success

With these mass-market benefits, Lition Energie was able to prove that offline revenues can be shifted into the blockchain space.
This makes Lition different from most of today’s popular blockchain solutions like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins, which
generate revenue solely from a closed community of Cryptocurrency-affiliated audiences. All solutions are not mass-market
products. Although they could create media hype, nearly all blockchain protocols on the market suffer from limited communities,
low token usage, and low revenues shifted from offline to their blockchain. In contrast, within just weeks of the commercial launch
in May 2018, Lition Energie has already attracted customers in over 25 cities and has contracted 7 green power plants, with many
more in the pipeline.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER P2P ENERGY TRADING PROJECTS
So far, there have been several blockchain-based energy solutions that have issued an ICO. The four main projects are WePower
from Lithuania, which is active with a PoC; Restart Energy, which is also active with a PoC (their existing customer base is solely
from their traditional non-blockchain energy business), Powerledger.io from Australia active with 4 pilots in Australia and New
Zealand and Electrify Asia from Asia which is active with a PoC. All those projects share a similar conceptual frame in that they use
a blockchain-enabled platform to trade energy. While these projects are all still working on establishing the platform and/or starting
in smaller markets, the Lition Energy Exchange is a) active, not only with a pilot but fully fledged and b) running in a 41 million
household mass-market. And all this has happened in Germany, the largest and most regulated market in Europe.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION OF BLOCKCHAIN USE CASE
As of May 2018, the distributed Lition blockchain application is running initially on the Ethereum public blockchain, to ensure
deployment on a trusted, well-working infrastructure. The section below describes the current blockchain application serving
today’s energy customers, which will be extended once migrated to the new infrastructure.
Technically, every customer and every producer can run an individual node in the current Lition blockchain network. Participation
is at their own discretion. As such, each participant confirms blockchain transactions and contributes to the succession of the
blockchain. Lition utilizes adapted blockchain clients based on market-leader Parity in combination with a specific, custom-developed
API interface that customers can access by choice, e.g. in case they want to optimize their energy algorithms themselves. Energy
customers just wanting to benefit from the producer of their choice and low energy prices can delegate blockchain engagement
and trading to their local Lition energy supplier (currently Lition Energie in Germany) similar to cryptocurrency exchanges holding
hot wallets for their customers. The latter does not hold the private keys. Hence, the local Lition Energy supplier runs a node acting
on behalf of all its customers, but still signs every transaction with the individual private key of the customer to ensure every
transaction can be reconstructed on the block, while giving non-technical customers a convenient and less tech-related energy
supply. These customers therefore benefit from the blockchain in a “fire and forget” mode after their initial signup. Hence,
customers don’t need to deal with the blockchain unless they actively choose to do so.
While the majority of energy customers fall into the low involvement category, Lition strongly believes in providing customers the
freedom of choice to receive direct node and trading access to the energy exchange while using their own nodes. As another layer
of trust, Lition provides the source code to the client and the blockchain smart contracts as open source to the developer
community. This allows every user to verify for themselves that energy transactions are carried out as intended. This applies to the
producers as well, who use the same blockchain node client, however as sell (as opposed to buy) smart contracts and functions.
The local Lition energy suppliers also run their own blockchain nodes to scan the stored blockchain transactions for settled
contracts, as this information is needed for settlement of the energy trades.
Prior to participating in transactions, the nodes need to register with their public keys at their preferred local Lition Energy supplier
for physical settlement of energy and funds. Only producers that can in fact physically deliver power to the selected region are
added to ensure market deals can be executed and that market participants are protected. The requirements are country-specific:
In Germany, this requires recognition as a green producer as part of the Renewable Energy Act (EEG), and the ability to physically
deliver power into the high-voltage grid with a balancing operator area (Bilanzkreis) registered at one of the 4 transmission system
operators. Customers that wish to consume energy need an active energy delivery contract with the local Lition energy supplier.
After registration, the market participant receives an 11-digit pre-shared key that is used once for registration of their public key at
the local exchange. Since this transaction is written in the public blockchain, all market participants can verify the registration of a
consumer or a producer with their provided public key. These are the registerProducer() and registerConsumer()
functions, that additionally pass an optional consumerData / producerData object describing the nature of the market
participant to its peers.

MVP USE CASE IN BANKING & STO

SUMMARY
Lition has secured a piloting project with a two cooperative Banks of the German Volks- and Raiffeisenbanken, which are part of a
Cooperative Financial Network holding assets summing up to more than 1 trillion USD (891 billion EUR) and a real estate
development company (>100 million USD).Lition has signed a contract to develop an MVP for a syndicated loan. Lition is, together
with the involved companies, developing a DApp on the Lition blockchain for syndicated loans, starting with a real estate loan of
>20 million EUR covering a syndication of two banks. A loan is ideal as it showcases public data – such as the approval that a loan
has been given – as well as private data such as the underlying documents used to apply for the loan. Using private keys, the
approval process of the banks can be further simplified.

Figure 14: Screenshot of Banking MVP

In a second stage, we are creating security tokens for the loan, thereby tokenizing it. While the syndicated loan application process
is done using a real loan, the tokenization is a technical showcase as the legal framework has not yet been developed for this –
though Lition is working on this topic as well together with the German government, as further detailed on our medium blog10.

PILOTED USE CASES IN OTHER ENERGY SECTORS

NETWORK EFFECTS
The energy industry is well suited to benefit from certain characteristics of blockchains, like immutability and direct connection
between peers. Many articles have stated that blockchain has the potential to disrupt the energy sector, for example PwC11
describes multiple use cases in their papers. The opportunities are widely recognized, but so far there has only been progress on a
pilot scale, e.g. by the Brooklyn Microgrid12 which tests how blockchain technology can be used to affect direct neighbor-toneighbor sales of solar energy. Other P2P-energy projects in MVP or pilot-scale include WePower, Powerledger, RestartEnergy,
Verv and Enosi. Other applications - like blockchain-based billing of electric vehicle charging stations with Motionwerk, or certificate
of origin trading like SolarCoin for Electrify.Asia – are all in the MVP/Pilot stage.
Leading the frontier to commercial readiness with a proven Peer-to-Peer energy trading application with real customers and power
plants, the Lition blockchain infrastructure already has a strong application prior to mainnet launch. As several partners are already
evaluating their blockchain-based solutions in energy to run on the Lition blockchain infrastructure, it is well positioned to become
the standard for the energy industry as all participants gain network effects.

the Lition Energy blockchain. Lition has already signed and lined up multiple international partners for this. More details can be
found in this whitepaper’s growth chapter.

USE CASES FOR SMART METERING AND ENERGY-DATA-DRIVEN RECOMMENDATIONS
End-to-end transparency is the guiding theme of Lition’s core P2P trading use case. By using the blockchain-based Lition Energy
Exchange platform, consumers can now choose their preferred renewable energy producers. While this novel transparency on the
production side is great, we want to take it one step further and also bring this transparency to households and businesses. This
enables any energy retailers and Smart Meter providers using the technology to offer additional services to their customer base.

Figure 16: Illustration of the Lition Smart Reader App

This is achieved by installing a smart reader, a small device connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or cable connection, next to the
customer’s fuse box. A smart reader is a Smart Meter at a significantly lower cost. The smart reader measures energy consumption
and sends the data privately to the blockchain, effectively providing the same functionality as a Smart Meter at a fraction of the
cost. Using a mobile app, customers are able to observe a detailed real-time visualization of the energy usage of all their household’s
electrical devices by utilizing energy disaggregation. A customer can detect which appliances are currently active, e.g. washing
machine, TV, fridge, etc., and review statistics on the overall energy consumption in kWh. The app further provides various smart
home features, like a safety alert when you’ve kept your oven on for too long or a security alert if a device like a light is switched on
when you’re not at home.
While these features are useful on their own, bundling them with blockchain-based energy supply contracts offers additional
benefits. By using a Smart Reader (equivalent to a Smart Meter but installed in the fuse box) to identify energy consumption of
individual household devices, a supplier using this Lition blockchain-based technology can offer an itemized monthly energy bill.

40

Lition White Paper

This means instead of charging an estimated monthly down-payment based on annual traditional meter readings, customers are
charged the exact amount as measured, and they benefit from a further breakdown on the bill for each detected device. This will
provide full transparency to consumers who want to know their exact monthly cost per device. Furthermore, consumers will be
able to replace high energy-consuming devices with more energy-efficient appliances by using our data-driven approach. Such
analysis and smart recommendations are additional services to provide in the future.
There is another major benefit of having a smart reader. By accumulating the data received from thousands of smart readers in
Lition’s customer households, energy retailers will be able to offer time-sensitive tariffs to customers. With these tariffs, customers
can save costs during off-peak hours e.g. in the very early morning hours. These tariffs will also enable demand-shaping, as
customers will have an incentive to relieve the grid in peak times and shift their load to off-peak hours. In Germany, for example,
only high-consumption customers (over 100,000 kWh annual consumption) can benefit from lower off-peak prices as of now.
Moreover, reasonable product recommendations (e.g. new fridge or AAA LED-Bulbs due to high costs) based on various partnerships
are further potential revenue streams, while providing customers with recommendations for saving energy and money. This global
marketplace for energy-data-driven, AI-generated product recommendations gives customers unique insights for the right appliance
decisions.
In summary, the benefits are:

Figure 17: Lition Smart Reader Benefits

Lition Energie is already a frontrunner in applying this use case in Germany and has already successfully integrated a Smart Reader
that provides the daily energy quantity for blockchain-based energy trading. The additional benefits such as device disaggregation
are currently being implemented and will be available to the consumer in the near future.
To make this use case possible, Lition has partnered with the Smart Reader pioneer Watty from Stockholm, Sweden. They are a
supplier of Smart Reader devices and developer of AI-based algorithms for device detection, and they are currently the market
leader in disaggregation technology.

USE CASES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES
The blockchain technology and the underlying Lition Token is well positioned to become the standard for charging electric vehicles
and will highly impact worldwide desirability and usage of e-mobility.

Background and Challenges of E-Mobility
Due to environmental problems and changes in global outlook on e-mobility, the market is growing rapidly. Based on
manufacturers’ launch plans and expected penetration rates, the market potential for electric vehicles is projected to reach
approximately USD 340 billion by 2020 13, which is equivalent to 10 to 15 percent of the global automotive market in that year.
Global plug-in vehicle deliveries reached 1.25 Million units in 2017, resulting in a sales volume 57% higher than in 201614. The
growing number of electric vehicles requires an increasing number of charging stations, and also increases the demand for
electricity; the average electric vehicle consumes nearly as much electricity as a four-person household per year. In other words,
electricity consumption per household doubles when an electric vehicle is purchased.
With today’s e-mobility infrastructure, drivers of electric vehicles face three major issues when charging their vehicles:
• Numerous payment systems for e-mobility solutions often make charging and payment for electric vehicles
unnecessarily complicated for customers.
• Pricing is expensive, inconsistent and non-transparent. Electricity prices vary by more than 100% between individual
charging stations.
• Buying electricity at charging stations involves high-priced intermediaries and lacks transparency. Again, large energy
suppliers are hoarding the profits.

Lition White Paper

Contrary to many customers’ beliefs, green energy charging stations don’t necessarily use green energy but often rely on traditional
local and nuclear energy sources. Suppliers can free themselves of their bad reputations by obtaining easy-to-access and cheap
green certificates. In fact, an electric vehicle can pollute as much as driving a dirty combustion engine vehicle.
Lition’s Blockchain Infrastructure as a Foundation to E-Mobility
The Lition blockchain infrastructure is the foundation to solve these problems with its unique and globally adaptable blockchain
approach. Lition is already partnering with a leading charging operator with whom the use case will be developed and then deployed
to their 1500 charging stations.
The underlying blockchain infrastructure will be the basis for this, which will result in the following benefits for the consumer:

Convenience

Cost

Smart

• Charge their electric vehicles at
any charging station

• Use their existing individual
record-low tariff to save money
when charging

• Use their individual smart
contracts within our end- to-end
energy exchange platform to
charge their electric vehicles

• Use their producer of choice for
charging their EV. This may be
the same producer they already
selected for their electricity at
home or a completely new one.

• Receive one bill for e-mobility
and electricity
• Earn money if car is used as
electricity storage while plugged

• Drive with genuine green
energy instead of coal or nuclear
energy

Table 4: Benefits for Consumers

USE CASES FOR SMART GRIDS
So far, Lition has commercialized one use case (P2P energy trading) and is actively developing three other use cases (e-mobility,
Smart Metering and data recommendations) as described above. On top of this, there are additional applications from within the
energy sector for which Lition is actively looking for partners, with smart grids being one of the most relevant.
By connecting customers and producers directly via Lition’s P2P trading use case, transmission and distribution grid companies gain
additional insights into their power flows. On top of this, Lition’s blockchain technology can support their businesses in various
ways:
•

Time-of-Use Pricing: To reduce demand during high-cost peak usage periods, communications and metering technologies
inform smart devices in homes and businesses when energy demand is high, and track how much electricity is used and
when. These technologies also give utility companies the ability to reduce consumption by communicating to devices

43

Lition White Paper

directly in order to prevent system overloads. For example, a utility could reduce the usage of a group of electric vehicle
charging stations or shift temperature set points of air conditioners in a city. To motivate them to cut back use and
perform what is called peak curtailment or peak leveling, prices of electricity are increased during high demand periods,
and decreased during low demand periods. It is assumed that consumers and businesses will consume less during high
demand periods if it is possible for consumers and consumer devices to be aware of the high price premium for using
electricity at peak periods. This could mean making trade-offs such as cycling on/off air conditioners or running
dishwashers at 9 pm instead of 5 pm. When businesses and consumers observe a direct economic benefit of using energy
at off-peak times, chances are high they will include energy cost of operation into their consumer device and building
construction decisions. Hence, they will become more energy efficient. As energy pricing is already defined by blockchainbased P2P-trading, time-based pricing is a logical and easy extension.
•

Distance Pricing: Applying the same principles as for time-of-use pricing, distance between the power plant and the
consumer can be factored into customer pricing offered through the blockchain solution. If a customer chooses a power
plant close by, he can save by paying a lower price compared to a power plant further away.

•

Reliability: The smart grid makes use of technologies such as state estimation15 which improves fault detection and allows
for automated corrections of the network without the intervention of technicians. This will ensure a more reliable supply
of electricity and reduced vulnerability to natural disasters. A blockchain provides the necessary infrastructure for this,
including a reliable source of underlying data and verifiable transactions to resolve issues.

•

Security: Grids using the robust, tamper-proof Lition blockchain will mitigate vulnerability to terrorism or cyberattacks
because data and transactions are highly secured. With cyberattacks on the rise worldwide, experts rate these features
as very important for the future.

•

Bi-Directional Energy Flows: Next-generation transmission and distribution infrastructure will be better able to handle
possible bi-directional energy flows, allowing for not only distributed energy such as from photovoltaic panels on building
roofs, but also the use of fuel cells, charging to/from the batteries of electric cars, wind turbines, pumped hydroelectric
power, and other sources. Classic grids were designed for a one-way flow of electricity, but if a local sub-network
generates more power than it is consuming, the reverse flow can raise safety and reliability issues. A smart grid aims to
manage these situations via Lition’s P2P-trading solution on the blockchain. As the underlying energy flows are already
contracted on the blockchain, managing the physical flows on the blockchain is a logical next step to avoid data duplicity
with a single source of truth.

USE CASES FOR CERTIFICATES OF ORIGIN
The Certificate of Origin (also Guarantee of Origin) is an instrument that labels electricity from a specific source, e.g. a specific power
plant or a certain type of renewable energy generation through legal means (Directive 2009/28/EC 16) in Europe. With this label,
customers can be certain of the origin of their electricity. In operation, a GO is a "green label" or "tracker" guaranteeing that one
MWh of electricity has been produced from renewable energy sources. GOs are traded. When a company buys GOs, as
documentation for the electricity delivered or consumed, the GOs are cancelled in the electronic certificate registry. This single

44

Lition White Paper

standardized instrument makes it possible to track ownership, verify claims and ensure that GOs are only sold once and that there
is no double counting.
While this practice works in theory, it is a highly inefficient process with many intermediaries such as the energy producer, its energy
reseller with market access, the exchanges on which certificates of origin can be traded, the distribution grid operator obtaining
the certificate from the producer, and the transmission system operator invoicing it to the energy retailer, who eventually bills it
to the customer. They all need to trust each other, and they all need to communicate.
This is a conventional use case in which the trustless, open nature of blockchains, together with asynchronous encryption at the
point of origin (the power plant), can simplify a process by taking out the many middlemen. As customers are already trading energy
with producers via the Lition P2P energy exchange, storing certificates of origin on the blockchain is an easy extension allowing for
global scale. In this way, the certificate of origin does not have to be linked to the physical energy delivery at all.

USE CASES IN
OTHER INDUSTRIES

Fast transaction speeds aren’t the only requirement of all use cases; regulated businesses also require data deletion and truly
private data. As no other current blockchain can fulfill these requirements as outlined in the previous chapters, Lition’s new
blockchain infrastructure is the solution of choice for the disruption of many additional use cases across a multitude of industries
as outlined in Figure 18.

Figure 18: Sample industries with use cases for blockchain infrastructure

A selection of some of the potential applications is detailed in the section below.

USE CASES FOR HEALTHCARE
Currently, medical patient data regarding diseases and insurance details are filed in different places. When a patient has to settle
insurance claims, he or she has to collect and file all of this data. With a blockchain solution, this highly sensitive information can
be stored on a private sidechain for doctors and insurance companies during claim settlement. After the claim is settled, the patient
can – with the new infrastructure – delete the data on the blockchain. Thus, patients’ privacy will be kept secure at all times and
this complex process can be managed efficiently.

46

Lition White Paper

USE CASES FOR PHARMACEUTICALS
Data privacy is crucial across the pharmaceutical industry. The research, development, and clinical testing data required for
approval of new drugs by public institutions like the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), and private patient data concerning
illnesses, medication, age, gender, and family medical history require absolute confidentiality. However, relevant parties still need
access to that sensitive information.
With the new Lition mainnet, confidential data will be stored on a private sidechain, providing access to involved parties, and
allowing for deletion of private patient data when it is no longer needed. This will significantly streamline and further secure the
entire approval process for new drugs.

USE CASES FOR ENTERPRISE DATA MANAGEMENT
Research recently predicted that the rapid digitization of consumers’ lives and enterprise records will increase the cost of data
breaches to USD 2.1 trillion globally by 2019 17. As data exchange between enterprises is indispensable, privacy and security is more
than crucial. The Lition Mainnet offers exactly the features needed to ensure privacy and security while effectively sharing data
with the appropriate parties. Confidential data is stored on private sidechains only accessible with private keys and deleted as soon
as the data is no longer required. The functionalities of decentralized data storage, limited availability of private data and highly
restricted access prevents data theft and sabotage.

USE CASES FOR BOND FINANCE
The worldwide corporate bond market requires myriad approvals (e.g. credit rating scores, balance sheets) and many middle men
(for settlement, custody, etc.). The Lition Mainnet enables decentralized storage of all prerequisites for a loan, plus automated
issuance using a smart contract. After the bond has been issued, the beneficiary company can delete the data they no longer need.
Bond financing can be fully described within the public/private logic of the Lition Mainnet, representing a much faster, more reliable
and cheaper way for companies to issue bonds around the globe.

USE CASES FOR PURCHASING/LOGISTICS
The infrastructure of the Lition Mainnet allows users to publicly store material inventory data such as stock items, certificates of
origin, quantities, prices, manufacturers and complaints. Linking this information to a private sidechain with purchaser information
can automate payment procedures, increase restocking efficiency, optimize transportation, and improve material quality and
response to supply and demand. But not all data in these processes is meant to be public; e.g. prices and demand. Again, the
advantage of the Lition Mainnet is the private/public logic of the blockchain.

USE CASES FOR AUTOMOTIVE
Odometer manipulation is a major issue in second hand car sales. Even in highly regulated countries like Germany, police estimate
odometer manipulation on 30% of all second-hand cars sold, resulting in annual damages for insurers between 6 and 7 billion
euros18. As odometer levels are classified as private data due to the connection to the car holder, they cannot currently be publicly

stored. With the Lition Mainnet, anonymous movement data can be stored on the private sidechain, ensuring privacy of the vehicle
holder, as well as fraud protection on purchase via the public availability of the car’s history.
Additional car details regarding accidents, repairs, etc. may also be shifted to a private sidechain and used to settle insurance claims.
Again, upon the driver’s request, personal data is deletable when no longer required.

USE CASES FOR TRAVEL
Common search engines for hotels, flights, and rental cars operate as middle men between the customer and partners of the
tourism industry, causing unnecessary costs on both sides. With the Lition Mainnet solution, all offers can be stored on a public
blockchain. The customers’ private information during the booking process (date of travel, prices, bank data, etc.) is held on a
private sidechain, where payment procedures and travel details are kept anonymous and secure. On request, data can be deleted
when no longer required.

USE CASES FOR SAP CUSTOMERS
Even though this was only a very brief description of potential use cases, it demonstrates the potential of the Lition Mainnet as
nearly unlimited in commercial and industry applications. SAP already forms the IT-backbone of many modern enterprises and can
integrate the blockchain into existing SAP systems running in more than 400,000 companies with more than 12 million users
worldwide. In this way, rapid market penetration is inevitable.

DISCLAIMER AND
RISKS

DISCLAIMER AND ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS RISKS INVOLVED
Please read this disclaimer notice carefully. Please note that the disclaimer set out below may be altered or updated, at any time in
whole or in part at the sole discretion of Lition. You should read it in full each time you visit the site.
All information is provided without any warranties of any kind. Lition and its advisors make no representations and disclaim all
express and implied warranties and conditions of any kind, including, without limitation, representations, warranties or conditions
regarding accuracy, timeliness, completeness, non-infringement, suitability of the Tokens for any prospective contributor, and Lition
and its employees, officers or professional advisors assume no responsibility to you or any third party for the consequence of errors
or omissions.

REGULATORY RISKS
The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions.
It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies or what tax implications could arise
for the holders of the tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to
existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications.
Such changes could negatively impact tokens in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that tokens are
regulated financial instruments that require registration. Lition may cease the distribution of tokens, the development of the project
or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to
continue to do so.
The industry in which Lition operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or
enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine the operations of Lition and/or
pursue enforcement actions against Lition. Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Lition in particular.
All of this may subject Lition to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Lition to restructure its operations and activities
or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Lition’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs,
which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the tokens and/or the development of the project.

Restricted Territories
Viewing the materials available hereafter may not be lawful in certain jurisdictions. In other jurisdictions, only certain categories of
persons may be allowed to view such materials. Any person who wishes to view these materials must first ensure that they are not
subject to any local requirements that prohibit or restrict them from doing so.
The materials are for information purposes only and do not constitute or form a part of any offer or invitation to sell or issue, or
solicitation of any offer, to purchase or subscribe for the tokens in any jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which such offers or sales are
unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction (restricted territories).
Accordingly, unless an exemption under the relevant securities law is applicable, the tokens may not be offered, sold, pledged,
taken up, exercised, resold, renounced, transferred or delivered, directly or indirectly, in or into a restricted territory where to do
so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of, or require registration thereof in such jurisdiction.
There will be no public offering of the tokens in the restricted territories. If you are not permitted to view materials on this web

Lition shall not have any responsibility in respect of access to it from territories whose laws prohibit such access or where any aspect
of the content of the site may be illegal. Those who choose to access this site from other locations do so on their own initiative and
at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.
Currency Regulation Risks
Governments are still grappling with public policy on the regulation of crypto currencies as a form of settlement in trade.
Governments adverse to the proliferation of the use of crypto -currencies in local commerce could issue laws and regulations
deeming the use of cryptocurrencies a regulated activity. Countries such as China and Korea have issued regulations or statements
prohibiting token sales, United States allowing only certified investors to participate to the sale while other countries have sought

68

Lition White Paper

to bring the sale of tokens within the regulator control of securities offerings. This could result in holders of token being unable to
use their token in the future without further regulatory compliance.
Risks Associated with Crowd Sale
Tokens are not investment products. Rather, token serve a specific function within the Lition ecosystem. For these and other reasons,
we believe the sale of token does not constitute a public offering of securities subject to prospectus registration requirements.
However, public policy towards token sales is changing, and it is conceivable that regulators may in the future seek to broaden the
scope of regulation of token sales. This could make token sales subject to registration requirements in the United States and similar
jurisdictions. If the token sale becomes subject to registration requirements, this would delay or potentially postpone the proposed
token sale indefinitely.
Taxation Risks
The use of token as a form of settlement currency may or may not be subject to local income tax, capital gain taxes, VAT or other
forms of taxes. This uncertainty in tax legislation may expose merchants and customers alike to unforeseen future tax consequences
associated with the use of token as a settlement currency, and/or the trading of tokens or token for capital gains.
Capital Control Risks
Many jurisdictions, such as China impose strict controls on the cross-border flow of capital. Holders of token may be subject to
these regulations and/or arbitrary enforcement of such regulations at any time. This would make the transfer of token out of the
local jurisdiction to overseas exchanges an unlawful activity exposing the user of token to government fines or other regulatory
sanction.
CTF and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations
The United States has issued a series of regulations to combat terrorist financing (CTF) and money-laundering activities. Many other
countries have enacted similar legislation to control the flow of capital for such illicit activities. The use of cryptocurrencies by bad
actors would breach such regulations. Any illicit use of the token could seriously impact the global reputation of the RED token
Network. In such event, it is not inconceivable that this could trigger scrutiny by CTF and anti-money laundering regulators and
potentially cause significant disruption to the distribution and circulation of tokens and Token in the RED token ecosystem.

Lition White Paper

BUSINESS RISKS
Lition plans to conduct closings of sales of token as funds are received. If insufficient funds received from the sale of token, Lition
may not be able to implement its plans along the timeline as described in this white paper. Lition’s ability to remain competitive
may depend in part upon its ability to develop new and enhanced products or services and to introduce these products or services in
a timely and cost-effective manner. In addition, product and service introductions or enhancements by Lition’s competitors or the
use of other technologies could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of Lition’s existing products and services. There
can be no assurances that Lition shall be successful in selecting, developing, and marketing new products and services or in
enhancing its existing products or services. Failure to do so successfully may adversely affect Lition’s business, financial condition
and results of operations. Lition’s ability to realize its objectives shall be dependent on its ability to attract and retain additional,
qualified personnel. Competition for such personnel can be intense, and there can be no assurance that Lition’s results shall not be
adversely affected by difficulty in attracting and/or retaining qualified personnel. The industry in which Lition operates is new, and
may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance
that governmental authorities will not examine the operations of Lition and/or pursue enforcement actions against Lition. Such
governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Lition in particular. All of this may subject Lition to judgments,
settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Lition to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or
services, all of which could harm Lition’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse
effect on the token and/or the development of the project.
Further on, any transaction concluded based on this whitepaper shall be considered as a random agreement meaning that the
length and even the enforceability of the rights provided herein is not known/entirely known at the moment of its signing, given
that the main rights and obligations of this agreement depend on one or several future events and therefore any of the signing party
bear the risk of winning or losing depending on future events.
Forward-Looking Statements
Lition makes no warranty whatsoever with respect to the tokens, including any: (i) warranty of merchantability; (ii) warranty of
fitness for a particular purpose; (iii) warranty of title, or (iv) warranty against infringement of intellectual property rights of a third
party; whether arising by law, course of dealing, course of performance, usage of trade, or otherwise. Except as expressly set forth
herein, recipient acknowledges that it has not relied upon any representation or warranty made by Lition, or any other person on
Lition`s behalf.
All estimates, projections, forecasts, prospects, expressions of opinion and other subjective judgments contained in this paper are
based on assumptions considered to be reasonable as of the date of the document in which they are contained and must not be
construed as a representation that the matters referred to therein will occur. Any plans, projections or forecasts mentioned in this
paper may not be achieved due to multiple risk factors including without limitation defects in technology developments, legal,
economic, or regulatory exposure, market volatility, sector volatility, corporate actions, or the unavailability of complete and
accurate information.

70

Lition White Paper

BLOCKCHAIN RISKS
On the Ethereum blockchain, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production can occur at random
times. For example, ETH contributed to the token distribution contract in the final seconds of a distribution period may not get
included for that period. Buyer acknowledges and understands that the Ethereum blockchain may not include the buyer’s
transaction at the time buyer expects and buyer may not receive token the same day buyer sends ETH. The Ethereum blockchain is
prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also intentionally spam the Ethereum
network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens. Buyer acknowledges and understands that
Ethereum block producers may not include buyer’s transaction when buyer wants or buyer’s transaction may not be included at all.
Token may be subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with
the token distribution contract or the token in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service
attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ethereum platform rests on open
source software and token are based on open source software, there is the risk that Ethereum smart contracts may contain
intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the token or result in the loss of buyer’s token, the
loss of buyer’s ability to access or control buyer’s token or the loss of ETH in buyer’s account. In the event of such a software bug or
weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of token are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation. Although Lition
and the blockchain are operational at the time of the ICO, it might not function as intended, and any tokens may not have functionality
that is desirable or valuable.

TOKEN CHARACTERIZATION AS A UTILITY
Lition Tokens are a utility token. By design, there is no proximity to financial instruments and no financial instrument is provided to
token holders in return. The token is only used inside the blockchain as described in the respective section in this whitepaper.
Further use cases, such as for charging stations and other additions will include elements that will not turn the token into a security.

BUYER KNOWLEDGE AND NO WITHDRAWAL RIGHT
Buyer has sufficient knowledge and experience in business and financial matters, including a sufficient understanding of blockchain or
cryptographic tokens and other digital assets, smart contracts, storage mechanisms (such as digital or token wallets), blockchainbased software systems and blockchain technology, to be able to evaluate the risks and merits of buyer’s purchase of tokens, including
but not limited, to the matters set forth in this white paper, and is able to bear the risks thereof, including loss of all amounts paid,
loss of tokens, and liability to Lition Parties and others for its acts and omissions. Buyer has obtained sufficient information in order
to make an informed decision to purchase tokens.
While deciding to enter and entering into any transaction based on this whitepaper the buyer/interested party is hereby informed
and undertakes it will not benefit from a right of withdrawal from the transaction and his decision of entering into such transaction
is final and under no circumstance he shall be given with a withdrawal right.

71

Lition White Paper

KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER (KYC) RULES
Considering the anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism national and international regulations, Lition reserves the right to
develop and apply KYC rules and procedure before the sale of tokens, before the trade of such tokens and before or during the
execution of any transactions; likewise, depending on the findings of such rules and procedure or when there exists a reasonable
doubt that a certain participant/interested party is involved in money-laundering or terrorism, Lition reserves the right to refuse at
its sole discretion a transaction, trade or sale of token to any third party and also has the right to refuse the access to its platform
and/or to suspend such access at any given moment. Our KYC service provider is using machine learning technology, to identity trust
worthy clients, by cross-referencing them against international credit and watch list databases.
