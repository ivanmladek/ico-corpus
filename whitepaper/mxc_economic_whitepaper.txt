MXProtocol
Solutions

The MXC “Machine eXchange Protocol” facilitates
the uninterrupted exchange of information between
connected devices. The intrinsic blockchain based
MXC Protocol ensures devices connect to the internet
using the most convenient LPWAN Gateway lying
in range. This “convenience” is determined using
essential factors:
•
Cost per Downlink,
•
Signal Quality,
•
Availability and
•

MXProtocol:
Smart Bidding,
Inter-Chain
data market
Street lights, garbage sensors send a lot of packets in a day,
which jam the free licensed bands. A door lock needs to be
unlocked in few seconds, Smart Bidding solves the
problem by doing the network resource auction, the
highest bid takes the link resource.
Platforms like Ethereum, Rootstock are quite data
hungry, they need Oracles to feed to smart contracts. Data
market is a protocol for different blockchains to purchase
data from MXC using their own token.
