BunnyToken: The Future of Payments in
the Adult Industry
BunnyToken is a project inspired by the adult industry which aims to offer all businesses related
to the industry a safe and reliable payment solution, to guarantee safety and minimise rejections
based on the nature of the business. Our vision is a future where a large share of the adult market
uses one unified token; Bunny, for all their transactions. The different sectors of the industry
will create an intricate ecosystem with thousands of interconnected businesses, in which the
token will be exchanged, and its value will be consistently on the rise. Our aim is for BunnyToken
to become the principal cryptocurrency which will largely replace fiat currencies in the multibillion dollar adult industry over the course of several years. BunnyToken will serve as a solution
to a prominent problem, becoming a highly used and valuable token for millions of businesses
and individuals. This whitepaper will explain the details of this vision and exactly how we see it
coming to fruition.

Introduction
The adult industry has been prominent since before print was even invented and has noticeably
expanded in the last decades due to technological advancements such as mainstream television,
pay per view and of course the internet. There are thousands of adult websites, magazines,
studios, movies even mainstream reality and award shows. The industry, however, continues to
be an ‘underground’ world, which faces not only criticism by the public but also many financial
limitations which affect users on both sides of the business.
At a time when viewers have access to free adult content at the click of a button, making the
decision to pay is encouraged by two main things: security and anonymity, both hard to acquire
by using conventional payment methods on the world wide web.
In comes BunnyToken. With the creation of Bunny we are building an ecosystem for the vast
types of adult businesses and consumers to have access to an advanced, safe and accessible
payment system built on the revolutionary blockchain technology which caters to both ends; the
business and the consumer.

A Look at the Adult Industry
“The widespread use of internet porn is one of the fastest-moving global
experiments ever unconsciously conducted”
US Science Writer, Gary Wilson

Adult content can be traced as far back as pre-historic times in cave art. On a more modern scale
the adult industry started in the form of novels from the 1740s, and erotic films commenced at
the dawn of motion pictures.
The adult industry has grown with every technological advancement, from print to television,
to cable, VHS and DVDs. The internet took it to another level, allowing images and videos to
become available on a much larger scale than previously possible. Live streaming was the birth of
adult live webcams.
Porn websites take up to 37% of total website space but aside from all the free content, porn is
a multi-billion dollar industry. There are big production companies that create and sell movies,
websites which offer high quality paid adult content, paid live cam shows, online sex shops, as
well as dating websites, apps and more.

The adult industry in numbers
It may come as a surprise to many that the adult industry in fact makes a large revenue which
can compete with some of the biggest and best performing companies in the world. According to
a 2017 TopTenREVIEWS report the industry was valued at a whopping 97 billion dollars annually.
The research included more than 10,000 sources such as websites and reports from international
media.
The adult industry also has its own union called the Free Speech Coalition (FSC) which was
preceded by the Adult Film Association of America (AFAA).

Among websites, porn competes with the biggest brands. SimilarWeb statistics places xvideos.
com in 5th place of top website ranking for all categories in the world. In 8th place we find
xnxx.com which is above Yahoo, Wikipedia and Twitter. This is a quick perspective of how the
adult industry is ranked in comparison to all other online industries.

The truth behind the glamour
The industry is driven by hard working men and women who should have equal rights to any
other entrepreneurs.
Unfortunately this is not the case. Despite the fact that nobody is harmed and no one’s rights are
breached, all sectors of the adult industry still face large limitations.

In truth watching pornographic content is an entirely natural human process, and neuroscientist
Nicole Prause says “lots of other things are as powerful [as porn]. For someone with lower sex
drive, for instance, watching porn evokes the same magnitude response as eating chocolate, in
similar brain areas”.
This industry caters to the fantasies and pleasure of people through an instinctual basic human
need, yet individuals and businesses in the industry, cannot find a steady payment system which
guarantees the security of their hard earned cash.
Existing payment systems and banks who do accept opening accounts for businesses in the adult
industry tend to place these accounts in the ‘high risk’ category and charge ridiculous fees which
can be as high as 20 to 30%. This automatically reduces profits for businesses and increases cost
for consumers.
In 2014 Cindy Gallop, founder of MakeLoveNotPorn said in an interview “I cannot open a
business account anywhere … I spoke to the startup banks, I spoke to Silicon Valley bank, I spoke
to Square One bank and they wouldn’t touch me”.
Colin Hodge, founder of Down, a hook-up app, was rejected by Chase bank because it doesn’t
allow accounts in “that industry”.
Even earlier than that, in 2002 Visa and MasterCard decided that adult content would
be classified as ‘high risk’, meaning businesses in this category are charged a higher fee,
consequently Paypal announced it would no longer work with adult content companies.
We believe BunnyToken is the future because there is great potential of creating an ecosystem
around this multi-billion dollar industry which has millions of participants and an undeniable
online presence. The adult industry goes beyond performers and consumers. There is a large tech
and innovation movement such as developers of dating apps, creators of sex related products,
sex shop owners and more. Based on the multitude and span of this industry, even if a small
percentage converted to BunnyToken, that alone would create enough exchange for BunnyToken
to become one of the leading cryptocurrencies on the market.

Breaking down the industry
Adult live webcams “camming”

Adult live webcam site
Adult live webcams also known as ‘camming’ is a popular form of paid adult content during
which viewers can tip performers to do certain sexual acts live. It is attractive mainly for the
fact that there is live interaction with the performer and that can be far more fascinating than
watching pre-recorded content.
In 2013 the New York Times reported that industry analysts and executives estimate the industry
brings around $1 billion in annual revenue, but how much of that is seen by the performers who
actually do the work? Not as much as one would expect. While some performers make a full
time living from camming, a large percentage of their hard earned cash goes into unreasonably
large fees for payment methods and in some cases their whole accounts are closed due to legal
restrictions on the nature of their work.
In some countries most noticeably Eastern Europe and Asia the risks of being underpaid are even
higher. Performers are hired by studios which are located in less than perfect locations where
internet is accessible, and the studios take a larger cut of the money than promised.

In order to avoid large fees many performers use private Skype or Facebook accounts, but this
exposes them to other risks. Cam4 performer development and training manager Nikki Night
explained in an interview in 2015 how cam girls who go solo risk not getting paid at all or having
their content recorded and shared without consent. Additionally, sharing private personal
accounts without a payment provider exposes their identity, email, name and more to complete
strangers.
There are thousands of camming websites which provide a fair platform for live webcam
performers to connect with paying viewers, however the fees are out of their control because the
payment providers charge them large fees and the effect trickles down.

Porn tube sites and galleries

Online adult tube site
Porn tube sites, are websites which offer pornographic content in the form of videos, photos,
or stories. There are thousands of porn sites and some are among the best paid websites in the
world. This is one of the largest forms of online businesses.

Online adult websites can be seen as the natural next step, rising up from print and film porn.
Pornography was one one of the first industries to get on the web, when connection speeds were
so slow it took several minutes for one image to load. Now porn websites offer thousands of
videos each with content which satisfies any fantasy, hence the coined term “If you think it, it
exists in porn”.
Porn websites are always on top of all technological advancements, the rise of Virtual Reality is
a relatively recent one, and continues to be far away from mainstream, yet websites with virtual
reality porn already exist.
There is a considerable amount of free content, but many websites offer premium accounts for
higher quality content, longer versions of the scenes or niche videos.
Porn websites are and will continue to be an attraction which receives the attention of every
person regardless of gender or ethnicity. Paid content however attracts a smaller audience
because not many people like a credit card statement with their name next to a porn website’s
name, or any trace of their viewing habits.

Dating services

Mobile dating application

10 / 41

It would surprise many to know that dating ads go as far back as the 17th century when personal
ads helped British bachelors find eligible wives.
In the late 90s the explosion of the internet created a new context for what was once known
as personal ads, the search for a partner became more concise and based on algorithms which
would help hopefuls find their match and thus the birth of Match.com. This was one of the first
dating websites which launched in 1995. By 2007 online dating had become the highest online
industry for paid content.
Dating services at their core are a way to link two people on a semi-blind date, based on specific
characteristics which indicate that the two individuals may be compatible. Nowadays these
searches are mainly conducted on apps, whereby the user browses through a large number of
options before deciding who they’d like to get in contact with.
Dating websites and even more so apps are the norm to look for love or hookups in this day and
age. Tinder was officially announced the highest grossing app on Apple’s App Store in september
of 2017, in the same year Forbes reported that Tinder was valued at around $3 billion.
Tinder is so popular and interlaced in society that the phrases “swipe right” and “swipe left”
are now used by millenials to indicate whether they are attracted to someone or not, as the app
allows users to swipe left if they don’t like a person and right if they do.
Such apps tend to allow users not to expose themselves until they have been liked back. This
maintains a certain level of anonymity and saves awkwardness or embarrassment.
Basic functions of these apps are also free, but for those who want to use them to the full extent
there are many premium options which give certain benefits like seeing the people who already
liked them before liking them back, finding people in different countries or controlling displayed
information in the profile.
While Tinder hit the big leagues there are hundreds of online dating services and apps which
fall in a grey area and face issues with their payment providers, and some are not as accepted
by society as tinder due to their sexual nature which may focus on niches and finding sexual
partners rather than dating and looking for a life partner.

Online sex shops

Online sexshop
In 2015 Forbes reported that the sex toy market had grown into a $15 billion industry. Online
and offline sex shops have managed to make a name for themselves, certain brands are front and
center in some of the busiest shopping spots. Ann Summers has over 140 high street stores in the
United Kingdom and was estimated at 101 million pounds between 2013 and 2014. Lovehoney
group is another online sex shop giant which owns several websites including Lovehoney.com.
The company even has the exclusive license to sell Fifty Shades of Grey merchandise, based on
the bestselling book trilogy and box office hit.
Physical sex shops still exist and are often visited by people wearing caps and large sunglasses
claiming to be “buying a gift” and very few societies have accepted the purchase of sex toys
as a norm. Online stores make the process easier, the search can be done from the comfort
and privacy of a home. However, packages have to be delivered in person, and once again the
dreaded eye to eye contact with a postal worker is faced, then comes the credit card bill with a
clear and agonizing statement of a full name and the purchased product. The awkwardness of
being handed a box with a naughty toy ends within a few minutes, while a record of the purchase
cannot be erased.
Still these stores make a large cap of the industry and some stores manage to succeed but the
same struggle persists when it comes to dealing with their finances.

Individual performers

Online video chat
Companies and businesses such as porn websites and live cam platforms need performers. These
are the people who appear in pornographic content and get paid for their acting. Performers
can work with studios or through larger online platforms, or make their own deals ‘freelance
style’ and get paid for each project separately, either through a studio, a company, a manager or
directly through the paying client in the case of live cams.
Adult industry performers and actors may be frowned upon by a conditioned society, but many
are professionals who build a big brand for themselves, get paid well and use their money for
good causes and to start new businesses.
Performers struggle to maintain a bank account which receives unidentified money from a
profession they cannot disclose because banks can shut down their accounts and freeze their
money.
In addition when these performers receive payments from clients through banks they expose
their personal and financial details to complete strangers putting themselves at large risk.
BunnyToken.com

13 / 41

Consumers
Consumers of the adult industry are countless. Every person who watches porn - who doesn’t? is considered a consumer. Approximately 28,258 people are viewing pornography every second,
while during that same time-frame 372 people are typing adult search terms. Supply needs
demand and it’s no coincidence that there are more than 4.2 million pornographic websites.
Then there are those who buy adult content. Considering the industry makes billions of dollars,
it is obvious that more people than we think are willing to pay for porn. This doesn’t mean that
the process is not problematic for them too.
Nobody likes linking their bank account and name to a pornographic purchase be it online
content or ordering a sex toy. Society has not reached a point of complete acceptance of the
industry or the needs it fulfills.
When BunnyToken becomes the mainstream currency for adult related products and content
around the world consumers will largely benefit too.
Anonymity is one of the most valued benefits in the adult industry. When BunnyToken becomes
a payment option for most adult related businesses, any consumer can make a purchase assured
that their personal and financial details will never be traced by family members, friends, business
partners or anyone.
Additionally costs for purchasing adult related content with BunnyToken will be lower, as fees
will be decreased for businesses allowing them to sell their products and services at a lower price.

How BunnyToken Improves the Industry
The BunnyToken ecosystem was built on a basic premise; adult industry performers,
entrepreneurs and businesses as well as consumers are all entitled to control their privacy, keep
their share of the money and guarantee their security. The blockchain technology is now viewed
as the future of all industries because of its ability to guarantee all the above mentioned and
more. It is becoming clear that those who master this technology will emerge as leaders in their
sectors. BunnyToken is taking the adult industry to the next level and ensuring a better, safer
and more lucrative experience for all parties involved.

Financial insecurity
At the moment, adult industry men, women and companies face roadblocks due to the fact that
many payment providers do not want their names publicly linked to the adult industry. This
also means that once they do open bank accounts they are vulnerable to having those accounts
closed due to law changes or bank terms and conditions. With fiat currencies once a bank decides
to freeze or close an account, it is very difficult and near impossible to unlock those funds even
when they rightfully belong to the account holder.
BunnyToken will act as the payment provider which accepts adult industry related businesses
without demanding high fees, presenting a risk of blocking accounts or exposing identities.

The problem for businesses in the industry
All businesses in the industry have two consistent things in common; they are related to the
adult industry and they have a problem with their payment providers.

Banned from payment providers
A large number of payment providers and banks do not accept any accounts related to the adult
industry.

High fees
Companies who do accept such accounts tend to add large fees because they consider such
industries “high risk”.

BunnyToken.com

15 / 41

No guarantees
Any changes in a bank’s terms and conditions, or general financial laws could lead to the
termination of a bank account.

No anonymity
All types of conventional payment methods require full personal details and will bill any
payments under the name of the service/ product and the payer.

The solution: BunnyToken
BunnyToken will approach all the aforementioned markets and offer a reliable payment
solution.

“Businesses make more profits while consumers spend less”

Full ownership of money
Digital currencies are independent of any third party. Transactions through the blockchain are
freed from conventional and traditional rules, they are not overlooked by a government, and only
the owner of the tokens has control over their money.

Low fees
The payment providers who do allow accounts for adult industry related businesses and
individuals charge very high fees, because competition is almost non-existent. With BunnyToken
those fees are much lower making them equal and even less than they normally are in any other
industry. This instantly means businesses make more profits while consumers spend less.

Security
The infrastructure which underpins the blockchain technology carries a huge advantage for
the banking sector of any industry. Through blockchain data of transactions is stored across
vast networks of computers that constantly check and verify information with each other. The
blockchain system is near-impenetrable even to the brightest cyber-minds.
BunnyToken.com

16 / 41

Guaranteed anonymity
Due to the Ethereum based blockchain platform, digital currency transactions will allow
guaranteed anonymity. Anyone who is uncomfortable with a billing statement related to
any form of adult content or products will remain anonymous when making purchases with
BunnyToken.

A united currency
Once more and more companies join BunnyToken, the use of of BUNNY in the industry will
eliminate large transaction costs, because all transactions will eventually be made through one
united currency.

Helping individual performers
With BUNNY performers can control their account and receive their payments directly, securely,
without large fees and with full anonymity towards the paying end.

Market Opportunity and Strategy
It all starts with the question “what is the point of BunnyToken?” our answer is simple:
Improving one of the biggest industries in the world, which has grown to become a multi-billion
dollar industry. We want to create a digital currency which will unify all sectors of the adult
industry making financial transactions safe, less costly and seamless.

The opportunity
The opportunity starts with the problem: despite its magnitude the industry continues to be
frowned upon at best and completely rejected by financial institutions at worst. While there are
many supporters of the industry it is still an industry where ‘rights’ are minimal, and fairness is
almost non-existent, however over the decades this is an industry which has fought against all
opposition and taken advantage of every new technological development to climb the ladders of
success. The blockchain technology is the exact revolution it needed to rid itself of all remaining
attachments to bureaucracy and discrimination. We have located all the separate problems and
found a solution for them.

“Sex Sells”

The market opportunity lies in the fact that this industry is huge with millions of participants,
and it has proven to bring in large and competitive revenues in many countries around the world.
This industry will not stop simply because sex sells. Sex is one of three universal languages. Sex
transcends ethnicity, social status and gender.
Over the next two years, BunnyToken will aim to recruit a number of these businesses, both
big and small. Even a small percentage will constitute hundreds of online businesses offering
BunnyToken as a payment solution and creating a large circulation which will give the token
value.
Once Bunny becomes the mainstream way to purchase and get paid for adult-related content
everything changes; bigger players will join in and add us as a payment method whilst new
businesses and individuals will choose us as an easy and safe choice for opening accounts.

Numbers speak louder than words, and the current numbers of the industry as well as the
growth of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies highly indicate that BunnyToken will be a
successful project.

Optimum marketing strategy
Success starts from the top and trickles down to the bottom; our marketing plan begins
with approaching the biggest players in the industry and introducing them to the concept
of BunnyToken. Once we acquire a handful of powerful partners who are onboard to use the
BunnyToken platform as soon as it is ready they will pave the way to a wider audience. We have
already partnered with more than a dozen porn websites including goldnude.com and
lbsextube.com.

Industry businesses already partnered with BunnyToken.
We expect every new partnership to increase the value of BUNNY.

All partners will be given a badge to add on their website with the BunnyToken logo. This will
increase awareness of the brand and place it on the fast lane to becoming the mainstream choice
among payment providers.

The BunnyToken badge for partner websites.
The first part of our marketing strategy will focus heavily on creating as much awareness about
BunnyToken as we can as it gets distributed into the community. Our blockchain specialists will
act as advisors to the marketing team.
The importance of marketing is not lost on us; 35% of the funding will be allocated for marketing
and 25% for business development. With this funding we will enhance the brand and give it more
reach through all marketing channels. Our channels will be managed by an experienced team of
specialists who will lead the way in branding, public relations, acquisition and sales.
BunnyToken will be listed on major websites which act as a ‘go-to’ for finding new
cryptocurrency opportunities and that will give BunnyToken major exposure.
Communities, social media and forums will be approached through our various channels,
which are already available, active and constantly growing. We will let the community in on our
prototypes, developments and every milestone we achieve to ensure full transparency and earn
their trust. Both organic and paid forms of marketing will follow.
Our marketing strategy is built upon actionable goals which we will reach through a carefully
crafted roadmap of online and offline events. We do not set vague goals, we set solid and
attainable goals like being one of the top cryptocurrencies by mid-2019.

The Bunny bounty program
3% of tokens will be reserved for the bounty program from the beginning of the project.

Referral program
The Bunny referral program will be based on a simple customized link that everyone who
registers to BunnyToken will receive in their personal account. This link can be shared on most
forms of social media or other websites to invite new people to register for BunnyToken.
For every referral who buys the Token a bonus will be offered to the link owner. The bonus will
consist of an addition of tokens to the owner’s account which amount to 10% of the invested
tokens his/ her referrals buy.

Airdrop
During quarter 3 of 2018 we will launch an airdrop. The airdrop will offer additional tokens to
everyone who has kept their tokens stored in a wallet. The airdrop will depend on how many
tokens will be spent on the referral program during pre-ITS and ITS. If a larger than expected
amount of tokens remains, we could potentially launch a second airdrop.

BunnyToken and its Components
A safe and professional payment provider
While our aim is to provide an easy and accessible payment system for the adult industry, we will
ensure all our clients are legal and produce ethical content which does not include any harm to
individuals, underaged performers, human trafficking or illegal acts of any kind.
We plan to partner with top performing websites who operate under ethical and legal standards
and offer content for entertainment purposes without mistreating any of their performers or
indulging in incriminating acts.
What we do support is giving freedom to adult content producers and consumers to be creative
without being judged and taken advantage of due to the nature of their business. We believe that
as long as all parties are consenting adult businesses, performers and consumers of the adult
industry should not be excluded from having their own fair and reliable payment system, and
this is the section of the industry we will cater to.
All merchants of the BunnyToken platform have to go through a registration and identification
process. This is to ensure overall security.

The BunnyToken platform
The BunnyToken platform is a payment system which facilitates the transfer of Bunny tokens
between merchants and acquirers. What sets this platform apart is it only offers the exchange
of a digital currency and is built on the Ethereum blockchain technology, ensuring security and
anonymity.
The core of the payment system is to act as a substitute to traditional online payment methods
such as PayPal. The BunnyToken can replace traditional banking systems for businesses related
to the adult industry.
The payment instrument will be the Bunny token (BUNNY), which can be purchased during pre Initial Token Sale (ITS) and ITS stages or later on through an exchange. The payment system will
be electronic based and the delivery channel will be the BunnyToken wallet, through a funding
page created for BunnyToken.

The Bunny wallet

We will develop our own Bunny wallet which everyone with a BunnyToken account will be able
to use. Through the secure Ethereum based wallet, payments can be made and received. Bunny
tokens however, can be stored on any wallet which supports ERC20. Most Ethereum wallets
support ERC20, a few such wallets: Ethereum Wallet, MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Mist, Parity,
imToken, Trust and Cipher. The BunnyToken wallet can be accessed through the Ethereum
network. Security is a top priority for BunnyToken and the wallet will be a reliable and safe unit
for cryptographic money.
The Bunny Wallet will be a desktop application and will become available as an app in native iOS
and Android.

The Bunny payment page

BunnyToken will offer a completely integrated payment system in the framework of any adult
website payment options. Merchants will be able to integrate their business with BunnyToken’s
customizable payment page in an easy and user friendly interface which will eliminate any
complications of working with cryptocurrencies.
The page will be supported by all browsers and responsive to be viewed on smartphones, tablets
and any other devices.
The page will be easy to integrate into existing payment pages and merchants will receive
technical help from the BunnyToken team if necessary. Merchants and consumers will go
through the payment process in the same manner as they would through any conventional
online payment method making the process seamless and easy for payers and payees.

The Bunny CRM

Anyone who adds BunnyToken as a payment method for their online business will have access
to a business account on the Bunny CRM. The CRM (Customer Relationship Manager) will
include statistics of all payments, current balance and settings. The CRM will offer the following
functionalities:
Transaction list
All transactions will be stored and listed in the CRM. Transactions can be sorted and filtered by
transaction type or date and they can be exported as CSV files. Every transaction can be clicked
to reveal full information about a particular transaction including blockchain related details.
Payment page
This is where withdrawals and transfers can be made between the merchant’s account to any
other account. This page will also be used for transfers between a merchant and their payees in
cases like webcam sites who have performers.
Permissions
The Bunny CRM will be designed with a permission model to allow different separate accesses
to different users. Administrators will have access to create new users under different categories
based on employee roles: admin, finance, developer.

Technological stack
Architecture is initially designed to take into account further expansion. All bottlenecks are
organized with the possibility of parallel execution on multiple servers. That is what helps us
organise horizontal scaling.
Key architectural principles:
Microservice architecture with duplication of key services
Geographically distributed storage, provides high availability and reliability due to
redundancy
High availability
Separate physical nodes
Unlimited horizontal scaling
Using an asynchronous model of interaction between client applications allows us to
achieve High performance
As data storages we use both relational databases and NoSQL solutions like PostgreSQL, Redis,
Elasticsearch. Backend implementation will be written on the Python programming language.
Our web part uses high performance modern stack of technologies, patterns and libraries.
That gives the best experience to our customers and offers ease of fast production to our web
development team. The heart of all of our web applications is Facebook’s React framework.
React allows us to create large web-applications that use data and can change over time without
reloading the page. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity, and scalability.
Obfuscation algorithms allow us to keep code confidence, and protect code from
comprometation. It enables the detection and removal of code injections, Man-In-The-Browser
(MITB) attacks, DOM-tampering and data exfiltration on the client-side in real-time.

Token Sale
The token
Bunny software will produce the BunnyToken platform which will issue the ERC20 Bunny token
based on the largest and most well-established, open-ended decentralized software platform;
Ethereum.
The premise of the digital currency BUNNY is that it will enter a transaction mechanism between
sellers and buyers through crypto exchanges and between parties of the adult industry. Liquidity
of Bunny will rise, as demand rises and it goes into constant usage. Payments via Bunny will
carry the security known to blockchain systems and information will be kept private through
security encryption.
To jumpstart the value of the token, during the pre-ITS and ITS phase we will increase the value
of the currency by 1% per day. This guarantees a noticeable increase for initial buyers. Minimum
payments to purchase a Bunny token will be 0.1 ETH or 0.009 BTC. Withdrawals will require a
minimum of 1000 BUNNY.
BunnyToken will be listed on crypto exchanges after the ITS and it will become available to the
public for exchange and trading.
Once the BunnyToken platform is ready, the use of Bunny will become active and ongoing
between the initial companies which add Bunny as a payment method and their consumers.
As the number of these companies grows, so will demand and hence the general value of the
currency.
An ERC-20 token is a smart contract which implements ERC20 interface. Smart contract is a
program written in solidity programming language and is being executed in the Ethereum Virtual
Machine of the Ethereum blockchain.
Smart contract guarantees that the BunnyToken allocation plan will remain unchanged, it will
be impossible to create more than 1,000,000,000 tokens. It means that after being listed in an
exchange the token’s price will depend exclusively on market demand and not on technical
manipulations.

BunnyToken.com

In our development we use OpenSource project OpenZeppelin which ensures security of our
source code and protects the project from hackers.

Investing in ITS
Early adopters and initial investors who register during pre-ITS and ITS can exchange their
cryptocurrency for Bunny tokens. 0.000100 ETH will buy 1 Bunny token. The price will increase
by 1% per day.
The Bunny token can be withdrawn from bunnytoken.com to a private wallet after purchase.
Tokens, however, can only be transferred between wallets as soon as ITS period ends.

Buying Bunny tokens
Following the ITS Bunny tokens can be bought through exchanges. Payment methods will
depend on the exchange. The tokens can be stored on any wallet which supports ERC20 tokens.

Token distribution
There will be a total supply of 1,000,000,000 Bunny tokens. No more tokens will be issued
following ITS and any unsold tokens will be burned.
All funding raised from the token sale will go into the development of the BunnyToken platform
and putting our marketing efforts to help the token reach the vision we have for it.
