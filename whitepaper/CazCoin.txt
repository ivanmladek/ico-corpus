3 What problems are solved by CazCoin?

3.2 Providing real-world places to
spend cryptocurrencies
The biggest problem solved by CazCoin is that owners
of cryptocurrencies don’t have real-world places to
spend it.
CazCoin and its supporting projects, CazShop, CazCharge
and CazEx provide a platform and a utility coin, the CAZ,
which can be used to pay for day-to-day purchases, starting
with clothing, electronic items and utilities such as electricity
and recharges for mobile phones.
Customers are not limited to the CAZ, as the platforms will
accept other cryptocurrencies and there will be the facility
to convert to and from ﬁat currencies. The CazEx exchange
will facilitate the ability of owners of smaller or newer
cryptocurrencies to use them for real purchases.

3.2 Providing the means for longterm income from investment in
cryptocurrencies
Many people invest in cryptocurrencies for
speculative purposes and in the hope that the value
will increase. This is often unsuccessful. Sometimes
this is because there is no real project underpinning
the coin. Sometimes it is because the coins have no
utility value. The market is extremely volatile, and
there is little certainty of long-term survival of the
coin.

Unlike many cryptocurrency projects, the CazCoin
platform is backed by strong projects. It is powered by
the CAZ coin, a utility coin that is designed and
embedded in the blockchain infrastructure. It can be
used as a means of payment not only within its own
ecosystem but also in day-to-day life. So, buyers of
CAZ coins can trade them on various exchanges if
they choose, but the primary purpose is to use them
for shopping. Owners of other currencies can trade
them for CAZ for the same purpose.

Investment

In addition, the masternode technology underpinning
the CazCoin blockchain allows owners of
masternodes to earn CAZ through the services they
provide to the network. This can be regarded as a
form of interest on the masternode. In addition,
masternode owners will earn a percentage of the
proﬁts on the 3 current projects and on any future
projects. This will provide ongoing income to them.
More detail on the masternode model is provided in
Section 7.5.

3.3 Providing access for small
players to crypto exchanges
One of the most diﬃcult hurdles for start-ups in the
blockchain and crypto space is to get market exposure and
adoption of their tokens or coins. Registration on crypto
exchanges is critical for this, but the cost and delay in doing
so can be crippling.
The CazEx exchange is a niche oﬀering to meet the needs of
start-ups and coins with small to medium-sized market
capitalization.

3.4 Providing solutions for typical Ecommerce problems
E-commerce has changed the face of business. Prior
to its evolution, successful trading hinged on the
strategic location of the business. Now it’s a global
marketplace where even a small retailer from a town
or village can have a global presence.
However, online trading does not come without its
problems. Some of these are:









Market domination by large players
Fees structures
Ownership of customer relationships
Rigid platform architecture
The time and cost of cross-border transactions
CazCoin has unique solutions for these problems
through its CazShop and CazCharge platforms.
These are provided in more detail in Section 7.4.

Data security and ownership
Transactional risk

4 The market opportunity

4.1 The e-commerce market
According to Statista, global e-commerce revenues are
projected to grow to $4.88 trillion by 2021, more than doubling
the 2017 ﬁgure of $2.3 trillion. In 2017, global retail sales grew
by 24.8% compared to 2016, and e-commerce accounted for
over 10% of these sales.

Figure 1: Global retail e-commerce sales 2014 - 2021

The same report forecasts a growth in the number of digital
buyers from 1.66 billion in 2017 to 2.14 billion in 2021. This can
perhaps be represented by the growth of PayPal accounts. The
following graph shows a steady growth, quarter on quarter,
from 2010 to 2018. People are clearly becoming more
comfortable with online and mobile payments. PayPal now has
237 million active accounts.

The growth in the use of mobile phones and internet
technology to conduct ﬁnancial transactions is shown in the
Global Findex report. Some interesting statistics emerged from
this report:
Figure 2: Number of PayPal's registered user accounts from the 1st quarter of 2010 to 1st

Globally, about 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked, but 1.1 billion
of them have access to a mobile phone and ﬁnancial services are
therefore becoming more accessible.

Another ﬁnding was that, globally, a billion adults who have an
account still use cash to pay utility bills. If more utility providers
offered attractive options for paying bills, both sides would
beneﬁt.

In high-income economies, 91% of adults without bank accounts
and 97% of those with bank accounts have sent or received
digital payments in the last year. In developing countries, the
number is 44% for those without bank accounts and 70%for
those with bank accounts.
In China, most mobile ﬁnancial services are provided through
third-party payment services like Alipay and WeChat, using
smartphone apps linked to a bank or ﬁnancial institution.
However in Africa, for example in Kenya, ﬁnancial services are
provided directly by network service providers and are not linked
to a ﬁnancial institution.
An interesting ﬁnding was that in most developing countries 53%
paid for online purchases in cash on delivery. In China, on the
other hand, 85% of those who bought something online also paid
for it online.

E-commerce is growing. All of the trends are positive
CazCharge
for business ventures like CazShop and CazCharge
that have identiﬁed a niche in this competitive market.
Both CazShop and CazCharge ﬁt in with the growing trends
towards digital transfers and the use of mobile
technologies. They will provide opportunities for digital
payments for online purchases and utility bills.

4 The market opportunity

4.2 The cryptocurrency market
The market for cryptocurrencies is characterized by both
growth and volatility.
According to investing.com’s March 2018 statistics, there were
1658 cryptocurrencies, with a total market capitalization of
$369 billion. The top 20 currencies accounted for 89% of this
value, so the rest – 1638 – were worth a combined ~$40 billion.
Clearly, not all cryptocurrencies are worth paying attention to,
and many will not survive.
Both the growth and the volatility of this market are shown by
noting that only 4 months later, in July 2018, the same website,
Investing. com was showing a total of 1907 currencies, but the
market cap had fallen by a hundred billion dollars to $269
billion. The pattern remained the same, however, with the top
20 currencies (1% of the total) accounting for 88% of the value,
and the rest – 1887 – being worth a combined $33 billion. The
bottom 20% of the total (>350 currencies) had zero market
value.

This view is supported by results from CoinTracking. They list a
total of 5745 coins, but only 1458 have a market cap above zero.
A total of 1953 are listed as "dead/scam".
This somewhat dismal picture should be balanced by noting
that the total market cap for cryptocurrencies in July 2017 was
just $95 billion. The current $269 billion represents a year-onyear growth of 183%.
However, to avoid risk it is important to carefully inspect
projects before deciding to contribute to them. The coins and
tokens with the least utility value are the riskiest.
According to Coinidol, the best chance of success may be in
“projects exteriorizing the real needs of cryptocurrency wallet
owners, like convenient payment solutions, blockchain
platforms, and infrastructure, as well as investment and trading
tools”.

If this deﬁnition is true, then CazCoin
has a really good chance of success,
as it meets every one of these
success criteria.

The CAZ is a utility coin, which can
be used as a means of payment for
day-to-day purchases

CazCoin provides a blockchain
platform and the infrastructure for
vendors of goods and services,
including utilities

CazEx provides an investment and
trading platform for holders of
cryptocurrencies, including the CAZ

5 The customer

5.1 The cryptocurrency market
There are a few categories of customers for CazCoin:
•Owners of cryptocurrencies who wish either to invest and
trade or to use the currencies for day-to-day purchases.
•Providers of goods and services who are looking for an ecommerce platform that will accept both ﬁat and
cryptocurrencies as a means of payment
•Start-ups looking for exchanges that will register their coins

5.2 Owners of cryptocurrencies
It’s fairly diﬃcult to know just how many people
actually own cryptocurrencies. Using unique accounts
is not very helpful as many are inactive or hold very
small amounts. Also, many individuals have multiple
accounts.

Similar ﬁndings came from an online survey of
Americans, also in March 2018, which showed market
penetration of around 10%. This survey also found that
as many as 40% of people were just not interested,
and about 35% were concerned about the risk.

Some indication of numbers comes from a March 2018
survey undertaken by CryptoNinjas, polling 30,000
people in the 8 largest cryptocurrency markets: the
US, UK, Germany, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, China,
and India.

Other ﬁndings from these surveys showed that

This study showed that, on average,
•2 out of 3 people were aware of cryptocurrencies
•7% of the sample owned cryptocurrencies. (The
people polled were internet users, so this percentage
may be lower for the general population.
•Japan showed the highest percentage at 11%,
followed by the UK and USA at 9%.
•China was lowest at 3% - but if this number were to
be extrapolated to the general population, that
would represent a large number of people.
•Only about 4% of those who didn’t already own
crypto said they were likely to buy any in the next 6
months.

•The level of awareness is growing quickly, although
ownership is still in a phase of early adoption.
•Those with higher levels of education are more likely
to be owners.
•More men than women are holding coins in Western
countries; the distribution is more even in the East.
•There is a generational skewing towards millennials.
•While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the most
popular, other cryptocurrencies are starting to gain
traction.

The average proﬁle for those trading on
crypto exchanges also shows that at least
50% have some sort of graduate or college
education and the 24 – 44 age group is the
most active user group.

5 The customer

The millennial market is important. This is the ﬁrst "digitally
native" generation, and their aggregate annual income is
expected to surpass $4 trillion by 2030. While the focus has been
given to their demographic size and buying power in the USA,
more recent studies are showing that 86% of millennials live in
Asia and the developing world. Chinese and Indian incomes will
surpass that of American millennials. Pakistanis will overtake
millennials in Europe. The highest growth in income for
millennials will be in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, and
Thailand.

“

Some recent comments about crypto assets as “commodity
money” deserve repeating:

Economists continue to debate the origins of
money, and why monetary systems seem to
have alternated between commodity and credit
money throughout history. If crypto assets
indeed lead to a more prominent role for
commodity money in the digital age, the
demand for central bank money is likely to
decline.
We cannot rule out the possibility that some
crypto assets will eventually be more widely
adopted and fulﬁll more of the functions of
money in some regions or private e-commerce
networks.

Giving attention to millennials in these countries will be
important for all marketing eﬀorts.
Probably the most important market indicator for the potential
growth in the number of crypto-owners is the commentary
coming from institutions such as the IMF (International
Monetary Fund).

“

For the skeptics, the comment from Christine Lagarde, MD of
the IMF, may be added:

Not so long ago, some experts argued that
personal computers would never be
adopted and that tablets would only be
used as expensive coﬀee trays, so I think it
may not be wise to dismiss virtual
currencies.

Managing Director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde in
September of 2017

Monetary Policy in the Digital Age
IMF Report, June 2018

The CazCoin project is well set up to meet the needs of customers:

Part of CazCoin's stated objective is to grow
the number of crypto users and providing
genuine use-cases such as CazShop,
CazCharge and CazEx should achieve this.

The target market for CazCoin is the East
and developing countries – which is also
where there is the greatest number of
millennials.

The CAZ is a utility coin. It might be
categorized as “commodity money” to be
used for day-to-day purchases. As such, it
will be ready for the anticipated move away
from “credit money” and should encourage
usage of cryptocurrencies.

In addition, CazShop will undertake a
signiﬁcant marketing exercise to persuade
manufacturers and sellers of goods and
services that appeal to the target market, to
accept crypto-currencies as a medium for
payment.

5.2 Start-ups looking for exchanges
Towards the end of 2017, at the height of the cryptocurrency
surge, exchanges were shutting out new users because they
could not keep up with demand.
As the number of cryptocurrencies has exploded, so too has the
number of exchanges. One estimate is that there are at least 500
exchanges. Despite this, most trading is done through the top
exchanges such as Binance, OKEx, bitFlyer, CoinEx, and Huobi.
Coinmarketcap lists 202 exchanges. On the day of writing, the
bottom 20 on this list traded just a few hundred dollars a day and
less.

Getting listed on an exchange is critical for a new coin or token.
Without it, market impact and adoption are almost impossible.
The pairings available – and access also to ﬁat conversions – give
access to the liquidity required by any new cryptocurrency
However, the cost of listing, especially on the larger exchanges,
can be prohibitive for start-ups. There are suggestions that these
costs can run to millions of dollars. Smaller projects can get lost
in the maze of projects on view.

There are a number of ways to rate exchanges. In general,
though, users look for user-friendliness, fair fees/exchange rates,
low downtime, security and access to a wide range of currencies.
If an exchange can oﬀer these, it has the potential to make a
signiﬁcant income. According to Bloomberg, top exchanges like
Binance are probably earning over $3 million, or nearly $1 billion
per annum. Fees vary, but on average exchanges charge 0.3% on
all trades.

CazCoin has approached
the issue of crypto
exchanges from 2 sides:

1

In the ﬁrst place, it is setting up
CazEx as a business that is
likely to generate signiﬁcant
income.

2

In the second place, it is
positioning the CazEx exchange
as a niche offering to meet the
needs of other start-ups and
coins with small to mediumsized market capitalization.

In summary:
It is clear that there is a place in the markets for the CazCoin
platform, and its CazShop, CazCharge, and CazEx projects, and that
they will be well-positioned and competitive.

6 The CazCoin business model
Anyone setting up a business today should be taking account of the shift in
business philosophy away from supply chain models towards the
development of platform ecosystems.

6.1 Supply chain models of business
Any student of strategy will be familiar with the so-called
“Porter model”. This model identiﬁes “5 Forces” that impact on
the success of companies:
Threat of substitute products and services
Threat of new entrants
Rivalry among the current competitors
Negotiation power of buyers
Negotiation power of suppliers

The model is based on a view of business where
companies control assets, protect them from imitation
and competitors and create value by controlling all
activities, from input (eg materials from suppliers) to
ﬁnal product output.

Supply-side economies of scale are the driver; the
goal is to have high sales to lower the average cost of
doing business, thereby being able to lower prices to
undercut competitors. There are high barriers to entry,
the most important of which is capital requirement.

6.2 Platform models of business
A platform1 brings together producers and
consumers. This is not new – for example, newspapers
have always linked subscribers to advertisers.
However, technology has signiﬁcantly reduced the
complexity and barriers to entry, particularly the need
to own physical infrastructure and assets.

The CazShop e-commerce site is a good
example.

There are four players in a platform ecosystem




Owners control governance and intellectual property
Providers interface with users
Producers create oﬀerings
Consumers/users use the oﬀerings

6 The CazCoin business model
Anyone setting up a business today should be taking account of the shift in
business philosophy away from supply chain models towards the
development of platform ecosystems.

The players in a Platform
A platform provides the infrastructure and
the rules for a marketplace that brings
together producers and consumers. The
players in the ecosystem ﬁll four main
roles but many shifts rapidly from one role
to another. Understanding the

Valu e an d dat a e xch an ge an d

PRODUCERS
PRODUCERS: Creators of the
platform’s offerings (for
example, manufacturers of
clothing)

vendors of clothing)

PLATFORM

Adapted from HBR diagram – April 2016

CazCoin is the owner, vendors of goods and services
are the providers, manufacturers or suppliers are the
producers, and buyers of goods and services are the
consumers/users. The platform can create incomes
for both vendors and manufacturers while building a
consumer base on the CazCoin platform.
The community and the resources contributed by its
members are the assets of this business. The driving
force is demand-side economies of scale. Value is
measured by the number of participants on the
platform and the number of interactions there are.
Suppliers and customers are assets that add value to
the platform, not threats because of their bargaining
power.
Companies are increasingly realizing the beneﬁts of
linking to other services and partners, with their own
platform being at the center. Some create diﬀerent
services of their own but link them all together via a
central platform.
The role of the owner is to attract participants,
facilitate interactions between them and provide
governance for behavior on the platform.
The “network eﬀect” comes into play. The larger the
network and the better the match between supply
and demand, the higher the value of each interaction
is likely to be. This drives further participation and
grows market share. So, for example, we have seen
Alibaba grow to take over 75% of Chinese ecommerce transactions.

www.CazCoin.io

Flexibility is the key to success. The power of a
platform ecosystem comes from the constant
innovation of the services it provides and its ability to
adapt to current trends and the potential threat of
new products and new entrants.
The ultimate power is the consumer base that has
been built up, as this can be leveraged if the platform
moves into new areas of business.
Google and Apple are good examples of platform
models of business. Google moved from websearching to maps, then mobile operating systems,
voice recognition, and now even into driverless cars
and home automation, always taking its customer
base with it. Apple has set up a central platform and
linked iTunes, the AppStore, iCloud and Apple TV to it.
They can all be accessed from a single account on
any Apple device. Apple is worth $945 billion today,
but it has also provided the opportunity for app
developers to earn more than $70 billion. Apple
created a platform that beneﬁtted its own devices and
also allowed huge beneﬁt to other participants.
This is a very diﬀerent way of thinking about
business.

development of platform ecosystems.

6.3 The CazProjects business model
CazProjects has set itself up to be part of this trend towards
platform ecosystems and is applying the new business
philosophies that underpin it.

The CazCoin platform ecosystem
CazProjects has deliberately chosen to develop a platform
(CazCoin) rather than a product.
It is leveraging the move towards cryptocurrencies, seeing
the gap in the market where owners of cryptocurrencies
don’t have real-world places to spend it.
It has introduced its own coin, the CAZ, to further encourage
the use of cryptocurrencies and to grow the community of
crypto owners.
It has introduced the latest technology in the form of
blockchain, together with Proof-of-Stake algorithms that are
at the cutting edge of research, and masternodes to provide
speed of transaction.
It is actively looking to create partnerships with competitors
and service providers in the same space.
It is looking to link a large number of suppliers and sellers to
e-commerce platforms (CazShop and CazCharge) and to
facilitate their success.
It has set up a platform that is robust enough to support its
ﬁrst project in the e-commerce space but is immediately
looking for other use cases to link to its central platform.
This will leverage the network eﬀect of the communities it
builds and drives the use of the CAZ currency.
•CazShopAn e-commerce platform, already a fullyworking product, with its online release in June 2018

phones and pay utility bills at MVP stage

business philosophy away from supply chain models towards the
development of platform ecosystems.

7.1 CazShop
The ﬁrst project to go live on the CazCoin platform is the ecommerce platform called CazShop. A working website was
launched in June 2018. The CazShop marketplace is a payment
processing solution that enables merchants to accept crypto
currencies from buyers while receiving their funds in ﬁat
currency.

The vision is to bring together buyers and sellers (B2B and
B2C) and to provide them with the opportunity to use
cryptocurrencies to buy and sell goods. CazShop will facilitate
their meeting and will provide the technical capability to
support their interaction and transactions. However, all
dealings will be on a peer-to-peer basis.

The global industry is dominated by major players
such as Amazon and Alibaba. Alongside them are
those providing ancillary services such as warehouse
logistics and fulﬁllment, customer relationship
management and payments. UPS and FedEx are
extending their logistics businesses to capture the
shopping basket for international orders. Everyone is
trying to own the payments side – this includes Apple,
Samsung, Google, Visa, PayPal and multiple others.
It can be very diﬃcult for new or smaller players to
break into the market.

7 The products
Anyone setting up a business today should be taking account of the shift in
business philosophy away from supply chain models towards the
development of platform ecosystems.

CazCoin response to market domination by large players
CazCoin is not trying to compete with the e-commerce giants. It has identiﬁed a niche market that
has the potential for signiﬁcant growth and aims to be its leader. It is leveraging the move towards
cryptocurrencies, seeing the gap in the market where owners of cryptocurrencies don’t have realworld places to spend it.

7.4.2 Fees structures
Fees for vendors can be high, with percentages of total
revenue and also per sale. These generally range from
10 to 50% of the total sale price.

The CazShop fees structure
Vendors will pay a monthly fee to register on the
site. Transaction costs will be held to a minimum.
For the ﬁrst six months of operation, there will be
no charge to vendors for registration on the site.
Vendors who agree to use CAZ as a medium of

7.4.3 Ownership of customer
relationships
An important issue is that many platforms take
ownership of the customer base, and the vendor of
products and services has little opportunity to
develop customer relationships and loyalty.
A key feature of today’s consumer is the need for
interactivity with a brand. The way to reach modern
consumers, and particularly millennials, is through
engagement. Increasingly, this is through “usergenerated-content”. This is the newest form of
word-of-mouth marketing and it happens by way of
chat rooms, blogs, videos and product reviews.
Traditional e-commerce platforms do not
incentivize customers to leave reviews or reward
them for sales that happen as a result. If they do,
this is open to abuse, resulting in multiple fake
reviews.

CazCoin solution for customer
relationships
Fundamental to blockchain technology is its peerto-peer architecture. While CazCoin may provide
the platform and CazShop or CazCharge will
facilitate the meeting between seller and buyer, the
actual dealings and relationships are directly
between the parties (B2B, B2C and even C2C).
For further information please visit our website
www.CazCoin.io

Contact us
support@cazcoin.io

Some additional features will be provided:
The facility for review of products and services.
Blockchain technology allows for authentication of
buyer status, to prevent fake reviews.
The facility to incentivize users who refer friends, write
reviews and promote products and services on social
media. They will be rewarded if their posts lead to
sales. Again, this is possible because of blockchain
veriﬁcation and tracking of transactions.

7.4.4 Rigid platform architecture
Increasingly, vendors on e-commerce sites are having
to rely on third-party providers – from marketing to
commerce-enablement and logistics. This is very
complex. Ideally, the platform architecture should be
ﬂexible enough to include these third parties as part of
an overall ecology. At the same time, there must be
strong discipline on technology choices and service
contracts.

The CazCoin response to the need for
ﬂexibility of system architecture
The basic philosophy of CazCoin is to create an
end-to-end ecosystem to support sellers and
buyers in the cryptocurrency e-commerce
environment.
Deliberate advances are being made right from the
start to integrate third-party providers into the site.
A good example is a partnership with ScoopTV to
add a streaming service that will accept the CAZ as
payment for services.
CazCoin is blockchain-driven. This means that the
relationships and transactions with multiple parties
are both transparent and clearly recorded in a way
that is impossible on traditional sites.
CAZ will later be used on mobile devices, especially
to pay for mobile services and utilities

Anyone setting up a business today should be taking account of the shift in
business philosophy away from supply chain models towards the
development of platform ecosystems.

7.4.5 The time and cost of
cross-border transactions
Cross-border or international payments are
problematic. This is mainly because the traditional
systems were developed before the age of the
internet and have not been suﬃciently updated to
keep up with it. They are slow, expensive and hard to
track. A typical payment moving from payer to
recipient may cross multiple proprietary ledgers,
banks and clearing systems. All of them add cost, time
and complexity.
There is a growing opinion that the only way to fully
solve this problem is through a global payments
network, built on blockchain technology. However, a
drawback with some of the ﬁrst crypto currencies has
been slow transaction times and scaling diﬃculties.

CazCoin solution to time and cost of
cross-border transactions
The CazCoin platform has a masternode
blockchain model. This removes all intermediaries,
signiﬁcantly reduces the time required for
transactions to be approved and makes it suitable
for the e-commerce environment.
Included in the technology is InstantSend, which
allows for transactions to be approved within
seconds. At the same time, privacy is assured
through PrivateSend technology.

7.4.6 Data security and
ownership
There are several problems for e-commerce sites here:






Fraud is prevalent. Merchants often cannot verify a
buyer’s credentials, including credit card details.
Buyers may be at the mercy of scam sites and
counterfeit products.
Manufacturers and sellers spend an inordinate amount
of money on photos, products videos, and product
descriptions. Yet ownership of these digital assets
often resides with the platform, and it is diﬃcult to
track who actually owns what.

The CazCoin solution to data
security and ownership risks
Using CAZ and other cryptocurrencies are anonymous –
it is like using cash. So vast amounts of personal
information are not required at all and are therefore are
not available for abuse.
Blockchain will to a large extent protect private
information that is there, especially as personal
information is encrypted for all transactions.
The CazCoin blockchain has advanced encryption and a
2-tier network for complete security. Privacy of
payments can be guaranteed through PrivateSend
technology.
Blockchain allows for the tokenization of digital assets.
This means that ownership of photos, videos, etc of
products can be recorded on the blockchain and the
owner can sell, rent or otherwise trade them. For
example, if someone wanted to use the images for
comparisons with other products, the owner can
negotiate a fee for doing this. This is important in a
platform ecosystem which combines and coordinates
intellectual and digital property from a variety of
stakeholders.

User information can be stolen or abused, sometimes
through breaches in the e-merchant's data protection
mechanisms. With the introduction of GDPR (General
Data Protection Regulations) for the EU and UK, this
becomes even more problematic. These regulations to
protect personal information applies to anyone across
the world who is in any way interacting with people in
the EU and UK, via suppliers, sellers and buyers.
Because CazProjects is registered in the UK, the GDPR
regulations will apply to every interaction on its
platforms.

them. This will include anti-money-laundering and Know

7.4.6

Managing transactional risk
E-commerce merchants may spend as much time and
resource dealing with risk management issues as they
do serving their customers. When customer
complaints deteriorate into chargebacks, they have
the potential to do real damage to an e-commerce
business.

CazCoin solution to the
transactional risk
The CazCoin blockchain will track transactions in
chronological order; the record is visible to everyone and
it cannot be changed. Transactions include product
orders, the dispatch of goods, payments made and
received. This removes many of the causes for dispute
and provides the “same truth” for all parties when there
is a dispute.
CazCoin will also apply an escrow system for payments
which guarantees payment to the seller, but only after
the buyer has received what was ordered.

SPEED
The list of solutions provided by CazShop points to a
genuine use-case for the CazCoin platform. In particular,
users can expect the following features:

LOW COMMISSIONS
Considerably lower commissions than most banks or
credit cards – often even free.

SECURITY
Advanced encryption and a 2-tier network for complete
security.

There will be an online dispute resolution mechanism,
connecting buyers and sellers directly.
The third area for consideration will be logistics. While
the plan is for sellers to deliver their own products,
CazCoin will provide some guidance and standards.

8 Technical speciﬁcations of CazCoin
Anyone setting up a business today should be taking account of the shift in
business philosophy away from supply chain models towards the
development of platform ecosystems.

8.1

Technical details

8.2

CazCoin is built on a bitcoin-based blockchain and is a
fork from Dash. It has its own coin, the CAZ, which is a
utility coin to be used to buy goods and services on the
platform.

Consensus, staking and
masternodes
CazCoin uses the proof-of-stake consensus protocol
with a two-tiered network system of staking and
masternodes.

The technical speciﬁcations are as follows:

Proof of stake protocol
=
validating the contents of a block, by
validators who own a stake in the
network.

CazCoin is a rebranding of Copico, which is why it
was necessary to pre-mine 30,000 CAZ to allow
owners of Copico’s XPCO coin to swap them for
CAZ.
The maximum number of coins will be 125 million. At
the time of writing, approximately 34.5 million were in
circulation.

Masternodes
=
special network nodes that run wallet
software on the blockchain and provide
certain services to the network.

Staking
=
retaining coins in a wallet and keeping
the wallet connected to the blockchain
network 24/7.
The CazCoin network is particularly safe and secure,
protected by a POSv2 consensus algorithm. In addition,
CazCoin has an In-wallet BIP38 encryption which does
not exist in most comparative networks.
It must be noted that while the Proof of Stake protocol
is in theory superior to Proof of Work, much of it is still
being developed. The developers associated with
CazCoin will
continue to monitor all developments in the ﬁeld2 and
make the necessary changes to the CazCoin
blockchain to beneﬁt all clients.

Platform Overview

8 Technical speciﬁcations of CazCoin
Anyone setting up a business today should be taking account of the shift in
business philosophy away from supply chain models towards the
development of platform ecosystems.

The chance of receiving a reward for staking coins depends
on the age and the number of coins held. So, for example,
someone holding 2,000 CAZ would have double the chance of
being chosen to validate the block then someone with 1,000
CAZ. However, the chance of earning a reward is still random,
which is why the time to earn a reward is "expected", and not
guaranteed.
People wanting to stake may sometimes decide to add their
coins to a pool to increase the chance of securing a block. The
CazCoin partner for this is Stake United. Their service keeps
wallets updated and coins connected all the time. This means
that owners do not have to maintain the 24/7 connection.
Masternodes form the backbone of the network by providing
resources and delivering services beyond simply relaying
blocks and transactions. In return, the owners will receive a
signiﬁcant portion of the rewards available on the network.

8.3
8.3.1

Beneﬁts of the masternode
model

Possibly the most important reason for CazCoin to use
the masternode model relates to the speed of
transaction it makes possible. Most decentralized
cryptocurrencies have to wait for enough blocks to
pass before there is certainty that the transaction is
irreversible and that there is no chance of “doublespend” of the same funds. This delay for a transaction
would clearly not work for eCommerce.
To avoid this, masternodes form oﬀ-chain voting
groups or quorums that can quickly check on whether
a submitted transaction is valid. They then “lock” the
transaction, don’t allow any further spending on the
inputs, and inform the network that it will be included
in a subsequent block.
In CazCoin, masternodes can lock transactions with the
special InstantSend function. This will allow for almost
instantaneous or real-time access to digital payments
from anywhere in the world.

Increased decentralization
Masternodes are part of the governance of the
network, with voting rights for management, budget
and development decisions. This function increases
the decentralization of the network – ie there are many
people involved in decision-making, rather than a
centralized system. Many currencies use a
"Foundation" for this function, but this is often
disconnected from users.
The more decentralized a system is, the more secure it
becomes. So, the more masternodes there are, the
better the security. Currently, there are over 300
masternodes on the CazCoin blockchain.

8.3.2

8.3.3 Instant transactions through
InstantSend

Privacy and anonymity through
PrivateSend
Masternodes ensure that the source of funds remains
private. This is done through a series of rounds of
“mixing” of coins, known as “PrivateSend”.

8.3.4 Driving the value of the CAZ
Any node can become a masternode, but it requires
the owner to deposit 50K CAZ and to have suﬃcient
computing and server capacity to host the full
transaction history of the currency – ie it must be a full
node and must continue to run 24/7.
These coins are not locked, in the sense that the owner
can’t use them for a predetermined period of time.
They remain in the owner’s wallet and can be spent or
sold at any time. If this happens, however, the
masternode status is removed from the node.
Because the coins must remain in the wallets, they are
removed from circulation, thus creating scarcity, and
often driving up the value. In addition, because the
coins actually remain in the network, they also serve to
stabilize it.
Masternodes attract investors, which can appreciate
the value of the coin.

50,000 CAZ coins. CAZ can be obtained from the
CoinExchange or CryptoBridge exchanges. There will
be an additional transaction fee and hosting fees, if
applicable.

2

The latest version of the CAZ wallet / or a VPS server
to manage your own masternode

CazCoin has developed very simple and clear guides on how to stake and how to install VPS or Windows wallet
masternodes.
Some people are a bit daunted by the technical requirements of running a masternode and prefer to use a hosted
masternode service. CazCoin’s partner for this is NodeShare, which has a global network of VPS servers to support the
cryptocurrency community.

8.5

The beneﬁts of staking or owning
a masternode on CazCoin
Staking and masternodes provide an alternative to mining. Not everyone has the computing power or technical knowhow to mine, but anyone can stake or own a masternode.
If the wallets on the nodes are thought of as bank savings accounts, then income can be regarded as interest on an
investment and as a way to create ongoing passive income. Once the technology has been set up, it continues to
generate income on a daily basis. Various sites, such as Masternodes.online, monitor these returns and provide an
indication of ROI.
At the time of writing, the cost of setting up a CazCoin masternode was approximately $1,300 and was indicating an ROI
of over 117%

The block time is 90 seconds. However, the reward structure per block changes depending on what the block count is.
This can be checked at Caz Explorer. The rewards for masternodes and staking can be seen below.

Platform Overview

8 Technical speciﬁcations of CazCoin
Anyone setting up a business today should be taking account of the shift in
business philosophy away from supply chain models towards the
development of platform ecosystems.

At the time of writing, the block count was nearly
114,000, which means that 40 new CAZ were being
created every 90 seconds, with 960 blocks being
created per day.
Masternodes are allocated a portion of the reward for
each new block even if they did not create it. CazCoin
is very focused on increasing the numbers of
masternodes. As a result, there is a very generous
allocation of nearly 86% of the block reward to
masternode owners. This represents approximately 34
of each 40 CAZ, with the balance going to staking.

Assuming 250 masternodes, each one would receive a
reward approximately every 4 hours or 6 times per day.
Even for the stakers, there are 960 chances per day to
receive a reward. Being part of a staking pool can
improve the chances.
This is an important part of keeping the balance
between masternodes and staking, as those who stake
provide the ﬁrst level of security to the network.
Masternode owners retain the choice to acquire
further masternodes or to use their additional coins for
staking and therefore beneﬁt from both sources of
income.

Here is an example of the returns for masternodes,
at the date of writing, with the value of the CAZ at
$0,025936:

On this date, the market cap of the CAZ coin was
nearly $700K. Of the 34,5 million coins in circulation,
44% were locked for masternodes and other staking.

Over time, the reward becomes less, but it is expected
that by that time the value of the CAZ will have
increased suﬃciently to make the lower numbers still
proﬁtable, and the risk will be much less.

At this date, the predicted $1 024.94 return on the $1

8 Technical speciﬁcations of CazCoin
Anyone setting up a business today should be taking account of the shift in
business philosophy away from supply chain models towards the
development of platform ecosystems.

8.5

Additional income for
masternode owners

In addition to the block rewards, masternode owners
also earn fees when members of the network use their
services (such as InstantX and Darksend) on the
blockchain.

This last form of income is important. There is always a
danger that people will invest in a masternode
because it seems like an easy way to create revenue.
This is risky. It’s important to look for a project that has
a solid team, a good idea, a genuine blockchain usecase and a working product. If it then has
masternodes, this is a bonus.

A signiﬁcant part of the CazCoin plan for masternodes
is the decision to also allocate a portion of the proﬁt
from the eCommerce operation to masternode
owners.

CazCoin meets these requirements and investing in a
masternode is, therefore, a good option.

For example, if the daily proﬁt is $10,000 and the %
share is 0.25%, this would be $250 per day shared with
the masternode owners. Assuming 250 masternodes,
this would be equal to $1 per day or $365 per year in
CAZ equivalent. At the current value of the CAZ, this
would be about 14,000 CAZ for the year.

9 The competition
Several established e-Commerce sites are starting to accept cryptocurrencies
as payment.

Some of the better-known ones
include
Microsoft: You can use cryptocurrencies to make
deposits into your account to buy movies, apps and the
like
Shopify: This is an e-commerce platform that allows
vendors to organize their own online stores. They have
recently introduced the option to accept
cryptocurrencies.
Expedia: This is a large online travel booking agency.
They will also allow crypt payments for hotel bookings
Overstock.com sells furniture, bedding, jewelry and
more. It has been accepting bitcoin since 2014.
PizzaForCoins is linked to major pizza outlets like Pizza
Hut, Dominos, and Papa Johns.

The more established and “traditional” sites start to
accept cryptocurrencies the more legitimacy will be
given to them. This is good news for startups such as
CazCoin.
There are only a few startups that are establishing ecommerce sites speciﬁcally for cryptocurrencies.

CazCoin, with its CazShop and
CazCharge products, is breaking
new ground in a market that is
steadily gaining acceptance.

Some of these are

Teky’s Ecosystem
The MEK store sells smart-tech toys and gadgets,
using a drop-shipping model, with distribution centers
in China and the USA. The target market is the techsavvy and millennial. It works together with the TEKY
Technology Academy, which teaches programming,
application development, robotics and other high-tech
courses to children aged 4 to 17. According to their
calculations, "The crypto nation" with a population of
over 15m coin owners, and a net worth of over $151B is
still in the early stages of development with high
consumer demand."

Blockscart
Blockscart: Blockscart is a start-up based in Europe,
developing an e-commerce platform oﬀering feesfree shopping options with crypto-payments. It will
also establish a crypto exchange. Its model is very
similar to the CazCoin model.

10 Marketing plan

All progress on the CazCoin project to date has been
self-funded. In order to proceed, it will be important to
attract funding. The intention is to do this by way of VC
or Angel funding rather than through an ICO.
The ﬁrst goal in marketing will, therefore, be to ﬁnd
investors. The mechanisms to do this will include followup on listings, trackers, forums, LinkedIn and Telegram
channels. The Marketing team already has a list of
Angels and funds that work in the crypto space, and
individualized proposals will be made to them and
meetings set up where possible. Digital media
advertising will be used to attract a wider pool of
investors, including those wishing to become
masternode owners. The CAZ will be listed on several
large exchanges to gain exposure.
At the same time, concentrated attention is being given
to ﬁnding appropriate manufacturers, vendors and other
partners for the CazShop project. The working website is
an important marketing tool for this purpose.

For CazEx, a portfolio is being
developed to deﬁne the
approach to be used to attract
new start-ups and coins.

The growth of the consumer base is critical to the
success of the projects. The initial goal is 30 000 users
on both the CazShop and the CazCharge platforms
within the ﬁrst 3 months. The ﬁrst approach is to set up
partnerships with other organizations that will bring in
their own consumer base. For example, there are current
negotiations with companies that provide payment
solutions, and that could immediately bring in tens of

11 Token economics
How is CazCoin going to make money, and how scalable is it?

CazCoin
The primary value of the CazCoin platform is its
potential to grow a large consumer base. The larger
this base and the stronger the network effect, the
better the potential will be to increase the revenue
from the current 3 projects and to establish further
platforms and businesses.

Income will also be derived from the value of the
CAZ coin itself. The more it is used as a payment
option for goods and services, the more its value
will increase. The CazCoin team hold 4 million CAZ
coins, and they also own masternodes, so will
continue to beneﬁt in the form of passive income.

CazShop
The revenue model for CazShop includes:

•Revenue from advertising
•Revenue from subscriptions
•Revenue from advance payment
•Revenue from commission
•Revenue from transactions

The goal is to attract 30 thousand users to the site within the ﬁrst 3 months. As noted earlier, this will be achieved
largely through partnerships which bring their own user base.
Vendors will pay a monthly fee to register on the site. Transaction costs will be held to a minimum. For the ﬁrst six
months of operation, there will be no charge to sellers for registration. Vendors who agree to use CAZ as a medium of
payment will be granted a further six months with no charge.
The amount charged to vendors will be scaled based on their turnover on the site, so this amount will increase for
larger clients, to a maximum of $250 per month. This can quickly grow the income to the site.
Example:
50sellers@$100pm + 80 sellers @$200pm + 20 sellers @$250pm = $26,000 per month or $312,000 pa
If buyers or sellers want to use a cryptocurrency other than BTC, ETH or CAZ, this will be considered, but there will be a
charge to add it to the site.
Buyers will pay in BTC/ETH/CAZ. Sellers will be paid in ﬁat if necessary. To start, this step will be handled by a third
party, but over time this option can be built into the CazCoin platform, and arbitrage income earned from the
transactions.

CazCharge

CazCharge

 The revenue model for CazCharge includes

CazCharge

•Revenue from commissions

•Revenue from other services
Income will be from commissions paid
by suppliers. This averages at 3%, so the
potential income is $3 per $100 spent.

Potential income

With 30,000 buyers on the site @ an average spend
of only $100, this is $90 000 per month or
approximately $1 million pa.

CazEx
The revenue model for CazShop includes:

 The revenue model for CazEx includes
•Listing Fees

•Trade commissions
•Revenue from other services

Potential income

The target will be small to medium-sized market
cap coins who currently struggle with the payments
to register on exchanges. There are currently more
than 3,000 small to medium coins in the market,
and hundreds being added. The anticipated volume
is 500 BTC per day, with an exchange transaction
charge of 0.15%.

Listing fees are still to be decided but will be
somewhere between 1 and 3 BTC. At the current
BTC price of $6353, the transaction revenue is
approximately $4,800 per day or $1,75 million per
year.

We have provided a modest projection of the income
potential for these projects. All of them are scalable, and
we know that much more is possible.

website.
They restarted, rebranding as CazCoin, ﬁnding new
team members, employing new developers for the
blockchain and wallet development, and continuing
development on the e-commerce website, newly named
CazShop. At the same time, they conceptualized and

13.3 Way forward
The team is looking for an outside investor to
accomplish the items set out in the roadmap and to
fast-track further development.

technical development. The focus now has to shift to
practical implementation of the platforms.
The most important task is to grow the number of
users – buyers, vendors and other providers.
Some of the focus will be as follows:
