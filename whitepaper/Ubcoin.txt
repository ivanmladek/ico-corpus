Executive Summary
Ubcoin Marketplace is a global mobile marketplace for buying and selling real world
goods for cryptocurrency.
The number of cryptocurrency holders is projected to increase nearly 10-fold, from the
current 22 million to 200 million worldwide by 2020. The simplest way to become an
owner of cryptocurrency is by selling goods for crypto. This approach will drive mass
adoption in the coming years.
Capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is around $300 billion. There is a great
demand to spend that wealth by buying real world goods for crypto.
Nearly half of all online buying and selling activity now occurs in marketplaces, while
mobile commerce will soon surpass web commerce as global smartphone penetration
reaches 37% of world’s population by 2020.
The Ubcoin Marketplace is not a greenfield project, but an extension of the Ubank
mobile app:
• A matured company, existing since 2009
• Our current product, Ubank, has over 16 million installations worldwide
• We consist of 50+ developers, top management and advisor talent
• Ubcoin will enhance and reinvent existing product value proposition
• Samsung and Fly pre-install our current product on all smartphones, sold in 10
countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, including flagship Galaxy 9
The token sale seeks to raise financing to expedite development of Ethereum
blockchain-based smart contracts, of AI-based screening and KYC technology, and to
fund global expansion. Ubank app’s unique distribution model through pre-installation by
manufacturers will be scaled to new geographies.!!

Problem Statement
Presently, tens of millions of people legitimately own cryptocurrencies. Hundreds of
millions around the world are aware of cryptocurrencies and would like to obtain them.
Many view crypto as a means of investment with stunning returns, and others seek
benefits of seamless digital transactions and new business opportunities aﬀorded by
blockchain technology.
Mass adoption of cryptocurrencies is inevitable and imminent. The cause and credit is
owed to many trail-blazing entrepreneurs and visionaries, including the source of our
inspiration and object of deepest respect, Telegram. The moment of mass adoption will
definitely come sooner rather than later. Consumers need a simple, fast and safe means
of obtaining digital currency.
Capitalization of cryptocurrencies fluctuates around $300 billion. Yet the governments,
banks, and international payment systems around the world drag their feet in
establishing clear rules of regulating crypto transactions to enable law-abiding citizens
buying and selling physical goods using their digital assets. A large portion of $300
billion is ripe for spending - conversion into physical assets.

The goal of our company is to empower consumers around the world to rtici t in
crypto and to enjoy the purchasing power of their crypto investments by creating a
Ubcoin digital marketplace where they can freely and securely buy and sell goods for
cryptocurrency.

Vision
1. Many people want a simple and safe way to obtain a stake in cryptocurrency, but do
not know how. They are not miners, not speculators, just individuals who see added
value in investing in cryptocurrency. The number of cryptocurrency owners is projected
to increase from a current 22 million to over 200 million by 2020.
2. Yet these same people are very comfortable with buying and selling on Ebay, Amazon,
WeChat, Etsy, Taobao and the like. In 2016, marketplaces accounted
for 44% of the world’s $2.44 trillion spent online in 2016.
3. Cryptocurrency wallets are primarily concentrated on mobile devices, with over 65% of
wallets being mobile. Global smartphone penetration is projected to reach 37% by 2020.
4. Global population of digital buyers will surpass 2 billion people by 2020.

5

These four pivotal forces combine in the global mobile marketplace where people can:
• Easily become owners of cryptocurrency by selling goods
• Easily spend their cryptocurrency wealth by purchasing real world goods
The global Ubcoin Marketplace, powered by Ethereum blockchain and the exchangetraded UBC cryptocurrency, enables these endeavors with peer-to-peer smart contracts
for buying and selling goods:
• Sellers are interested to receive cryptocurrency for their wares. Utility of settlement
+ Investment vehicle = mass adoption of digital currency;
• Buyers are realizing the cryptocurrency investment gains and purchasing power, yet
are spared the pain and risks of switching between crypto and fiat currency;
• Smart contracts ensure that transactions are seamless, secure, enforceable,
transparent and decentralized.
The smart contract technology allows the Ubcoin Marketplace, to ensure safety,
executability, intractability and verifiability of a transaction, successfully facilitating peerto-peer transactions.
As regulation concerning acceptance of digital currencies in a B2C arena evolves, the
marketplace will add business sellers and buyers to its roster. The smart contracts will
obliviate many existing intermediaries, the leeches of value chains. The delivery
economy facilitates explosive growth in the form of direct manufacturer-to-consumer
transactions, allowing for much more attractive pricing for both buyer and seller. Make-toorder manufacturing becomes a much more relevant business model.
Some transactions may, in the future, require additional KYC/AML procedures for
execution of smart contracts for certain types of deals, involving third-party providers (i.e.
delivery companies, couriers, notaries). The Ubcoin platform envisions seamless
engagement of these parties.
We pay special attention to ensuring the legitimacy of goods and services sold on the
Ubcoin marketplace. We are developing an advanced AI technology to help pre-screen
seller postings for any potential infringements of reason, morality, safety and due care.

Ubcoin Background and Team
We continue to see ICOs making bold assertions about transforming entire industries,
spearheaded by individuals with no tangible experience or background in the very
industries they plan to revolutionize. We tend to see eﬀorts led primarily by developers,
engineers, or tech entrepreneurs who bring in a panel of “advisors” to assist with
navigating whichever industry they aspire to “disrupt.”
The team behind Ubcoin has been working together since 2009. We ardently focus on
turning new technology into widely-adopted customer experience:
• We created Navifon, one of the best navigation software application at the time first 3D/voice guidance navigation app in Russia for J2Me and other OS phones,
even before Google and Yandex announced their 3D navigations. https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navifon;
• We launched uTalk. First aggregator of social network sites allowed for seamless
single-interface management of Google Talk, Facebook Chat, ICQ, Skype and many
other networks. By 2010, over 5 million users have used uTalk regularly. Samsung,
LG and Fly Mobile pre-installed uTalk app on more than 22 million smartphones.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utalk;
• We built Ubank. To date, over 16 million users had the app installed to ease the task
of managing their daily finances spread across diﬀerent banks, cards, services,
even countries. Ubank brought it all together in one convenient and intuitive
interface. The app processes tens of millions of transactions using its proprietary
payment processing technology. Leading smartphone manufacturers, including
Samsung, Fly and others pre-install Ubank on all of their smartphones destined for
the markets of a dozen countries.
We know how to treat investors well and deliver on our promises. Ubank was the
recipient of $8 million in investments, the largest in any fintech company in its home
market, in 2013. The investors exited the company in 2017 by means of a successful
sale to strategic investor.

We constantly infuse new blood into our team, both technical and managerial talent. The
technical team now numbers 51 superior programmers, designers, testers and other
technical staﬀ. In the recent 24 months, we recruited the head of the Brand Management

created the “2016 Best Mobile Banking App in Eastern and Central Europe” (according to
Global Finance magazine), and who also is a seasoned COO and CFO, with experience,

Ubcoin Marketplace Product
Product Value Foundation
Our product is founded on the following cornerstones:
Cryptocurrency mass adoption. We promote mass adoption of digital assets
that are both a means of settlement and an investment vehicle, thereby
enlarging benefits for all parties to everyday buy-and-sell interactions.
Peer-to-peer interaction. Cut out as many intermediaries from the value chain,
as possible. The platform facilitates smart contract execution between
independent parties. The Ubcoin Marketplace does not own any goods for
sale, it is not biased in its search results, and protects fairness of smart
contracts.
Legal marketplace. We pay special attention to ensuring the legitimacy of
goods and services sold on the Ubcoin marketplace. We are developing an
advanced AI technology to help pre-screen seller postings for any potential
infringements of reason, morality, safety and due care. Seller profile
transparency and verification will be strongly encouraged and promoted.
Decentralization of transactions and settlements. Blockchain allows for
decentralized initiation, settlement and fulfillment of transactions. Payments
are immediate upon performance under carefully crafted smart contracts. "
Impeccable interface. Our interface design brings a harmonious and seamless
experience of buying and selling goods globally. We will strive to open our API
to the community in order to develop the best adaptation of the platforms for
specific local needs of the global community."
Open community. Some transactions may, in the future, require additional
KYC/AML procedures for execution of smart contracts for certain types of deals
involving third-party providers (i.e. delivery companies, couriers, notaries).
Ubcoin platform envisions seamless engagement of these parties.

Product Target Audience
Ubank surveyed its current users to measure interest in Ubcoin’s potential product:
• 84% indicated their level of interest in cryptocurrencies was “high” or “above
average”;
• 79% expressed interest in Ubcoin service;
• 6% indicated they currently already own one or more types of cryptocurrencies;
• Among current cryptocurrency owners, only 2% indicated that they experience no
complications when converting crypto to fiat for further spending on goods or
services.
The target audience is comprised of individuals, ages between 25 and 45, with various
income levels, who actively use smartphones, and share, to varying degrees, an interest
towards the subject of cryptocurrencies and investments.
User personas based on interest in cryptocurrencies:
• Interested in becoming an in
tor in cryptocurrency, but do not see a clear
process path or deem acceptable the risks of obtaining cryptocurrency due to the
complexity of the process, safety risks (e.g. localbitcoins), potential repercussions
from tax and regulatory treatment.
• Current holders of cryptocurrencies, who had invested in them over time and
continue to do so. They wish to use crypto as a means of payment for goods to
increase their quality of life, but encounter constant complications when converting
to fiat currency due to the complexity of the process, safety risks (e.g. localbitcoins),
potential repercussions from tax and regulatory treatment.

19

User personas based on interest in buying and selling goods
• Individuals, who wish to buy or sell various goods. For example, a smartphone,
appliances, clothing items, artworks, jewelry, vehicles, property and so forth. In
2016, over 1.6 billion individuals sold or purchased goods online.
• Small-scale producers, who utilize marketplaces as the preferred format for selling
their wares. Today, over 63% of this segment sell exclusively through online
marketplaces, which allows them to avoid costs of building and supporting their
own online storefronts. Typical assortment of items for sale averages 50 SKUs,
focus is on selling in their domestic regional markets, and they employ no IT or
online marketing staﬀ.

Product Usecases
Buyers of goods and services:
Elsa, software engineer, Stockholm, Sweden
Elsa is a young software engineer from Sweden.
She got excited about Bitcoin way back in 2011 and
started mining. At first, she used her own desktop,
then bought a few pieces of professional
equipment. Today, Elsa has amassed quite a small
fortune in digital currency. Sometimes she
exchanges Bitcoin for altcoins as investment plays,
but with increasing desire she would like to
actually spend some of the coins on improving her
everyday quality of life.
Going through online exchanges and cashing out
into Swedish krona is quite cumbersome in large
part due to significant commissions, complicated
registration procedures and other limitations.
Lately, she has been worried about frequent
hacker attacks on coin exchanges. The last thing
Elsa wants is to have some hacker steal her
wealth.
Elsa’s solution - one-click shopping on the Ubcoin
Marketplace. She has bought home decorations,
cosmetics, even tickets for a sold-out event from a
guy, who would rather begin owning crypto than
go to the fabulous concert.

James, miner and crypto
, Vancouver
James is an early adopter and experienced user of
cryptocurrency. He mined his first bitcoins, then
expanded into altcoins, resulting in a diversified portfolio
of digital currency assets. He wishes to make use of his
digital investment foresight to build bridges into the
physical realm, enjoying the purchasing power aﬀorded
by the crypto coins he owns.
He wishes to purchase goods and services directly with
digital assets, and is dissatisfied with the current process
because:
• Conversion from digital to fiat takes incommensurate
eﬀort;
• Whether through an exchange or fiat-conversion
service, he pays high fees;
• Using p2p conversion sites, there is a high risk of fraud
and endangerment.
James decides to use the Ubcoin Marketplace because
transactions are settled in digital currency without fiat
monies in conjunction with a secure digital smart contract.
Furthermore, the marketplace oﬀers a wide variety of goods
and services he consumes in everyday physical life. He
prefers to buy from locally-listed Ubcoin sellers. For
example, he just bought a mountain bike from a guy living
in English Bay, James also hired a crew from Burnaby to
spruce up his front yard, and now has set his eyes on a few
properties in West Van that are listed for sale in coins. Truly
decentralized secure platforms have the potential of being
used in local applications.

20

Sellers of goods and services:
Yoo Mi, aficionado of vintage clothing and accessories from Seoul
Yoo Mi derives great enjoyment from regularly foraging and finding exquisite vintage clothing and accessories,
which she then puts up for sale on several specialized websites. Korean vintage is gaining steam and will follow
the footsteps of K-Pop, conquering new fans all over the world.
She is, however, quite hesitant in dealing with overseas buyers of her vintage items – she never knows whether
the buyers will deliver on the promise to pay. Additionally, each country has its own peculiar regulations and fees
for international money transfers. Unfortunately, those potential fees are expenses that she incurs, ouch!
Living in Seoul, Yoo Mi can’t help but be constantly surrounded by stories of her friends and relatives, down to her
nephew Jihoo, who is still in college, making a killing from investments in bitcoin and many other coins she has
never heard of. Yoo Mi knows she will never mine for cryptocoins, nor has she any desire to buy it on a digital
exchange. If only there were a way to turn vintage into crypto without too much stress or discomfort from the
unknown.
Yoo Mi discovered Ubcoin – she now sells her vintage goods and gets paid in Ubcoin
from Busan to Sao Paolo, without having to worry about all the complexities, which scared her before. She now is
a proud owner and crypto in
tor and uses the Ubcoin Marketplace on a daily basis to broaden the reach to
those who she makes happy with the joy of Korean vintage products. Most importantly, Yoo Mi learned she is
well-protected because smart contracts with any buyer from any country are just as safe as selling in the flea
market next door, and just as enticing in terms of investment like Jihoo’s fancy crypto investment returns.
She is even planning to sign-up for premium service for her little business, giving her an option of auctioning oﬀ
her vintage gems to the entire world and make more won for the buck, so to speak.

21

Marketing Strategy
At the initial stages of the project the main focus will be customer acquisition and rapid
geographic expansion. While exact timing of entering markets will change, we seek
markets with a combination of substantial cryptocurrency contributor base or interest
therein, warmer regulatory outlook on crypto transactions, underbanked population
and proliferation of peer-to-peer transactions. We see significant potential in
developing markets of Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Middle East and
Africa, Latin America.
One of the most important goals of
is to fund the global expansion. Depending on
the success of the crowdfunding eﬀort, we plan to spend between 25% and 40% for
international marketing. Another main driver of the growth of business, starting in 2019,
is attracting sellers from the SME sector who are more likely to actively use additional
paid instruments for promoting the sales of their goods.

We see average check for diﬀerent segments remain consistent with the current industry
indicators. Average fees will be set far lower, starting from 1% at the launch of the project.
Calculated ARPU is lower due to marketplace being available only a fraction of the year.
In the following years ARPU grows due to more volume coming from business customers
and from gradual increase in seller fees and development of additional paid features to
support freemium model.

Distribution model and international expansion
Ubank’s unique distribution model, where the app is preloaded by smartphone
manufacturers into all new smartphones, has garnered much success in the CIS markets.
We plan to extend this strategy and strike agreements with leaders in corresponding
international markets. Worldwide, we have excellent relations with manufacturers who
cover at least 40-45% of global smartphone sales.

Source: eMarketer, United Nations 2017

24

For each new country we enter, we plan to achieve “top of mind” position within two
years through our pre-installation strategy and joint promotion with smartphone
manufacturers.
To supplement our distribution strategy, we also plan to set up regional marketing teams
to support local immersion activities, including forming and developing regional user
communities, targeted advertising campaigns and coordinating marketing activities. Part
of the marketing budget raised via token sale eﬀorts will be spent on: deeper research of
local markets, attracting top marketing talent in those markets, their operating costs and
planned marketing campaigns.
Marketing activities for each geography will be comprised of the following:
• Brand management team;
• Traﬃc and ASO manager;
• SMM/community manager;
• Event manager;
• PR manager;
• User support team.
Marketing activities for each geography will be comprised of the following:
• SEO and ASO eﬀorts to promote the Ubcoin Marketplace app to the top of web,
AppStore and GooglePlay search results;
• Publications in local and regional press – at least 1,000 mentions for the first year;
• TV and outdoor advertising – at least 20,000 placements for the first year;
• SMM eﬀorts – video and posts of influencers, local celebrities who endorse the
project;
• Participation in regional networking opportunities such as conferences, seminars,
panel discussions that are meaningful for the local target audience.
Initial aggressive media strategy is necessary for quick growth of Ubcoin’s brand recognition and
user acquisition. Those eﬀorts will be then followed by creation of active social network
communities pertinent to local markets, where users will increase their product awareness, learn
about cryptocurrencies and peculiarities of their local regulation, engage and interact with crypto
enthusiasts, discover success stories of other users and so on. We view community-building as a
cornerstone of long-term marketplace success due to cumulative network and viral eﬀects, which
are critical for success in our industry. It also will allow us to gradually reduce direct advertising
expense and increase user retention rates, thus positively aﬀecting the bottom line of the
business. The speed of international expansion and level of marketing support will be hugely
dependent on the success of the Token Sale event.

B2C and B2B expansion
The Internet Retailer Report 2017, authoritatively asserts that “for many smaller
merchants, global marketplaces are a great place to reach consumers outside of their
home markets since the online retailers have the resources to handle the obstacles to
selling internationally, including language barriers, customs requirements and logistics
and shipping. Furthermore, finding lower prices from international retailers on
marketplaces is the top reason respondents say they shopped cross-border”. (Internet
Retailer 2017, p. 8)
Starting in 2019, we plan to engage traditional marketing instruments to penetrate the
b2c and b2b segments: lead generation, content-marketing, oﬄine events including
client conferences.!

Commission revenue streams
•

•

•
•
•

The marketplace plans to charge sellers a small commission for each
successful sale. For early adopters we will oﬀer two commission-free sales per
month. Users, who underwent a simplified KYC procedure, qualify for reduced
commission schedule;
The marketplace will develop a special commission schedule for sale of
luxury/expensive items (determined by certain price level), likely as % of sales
price;
The marketplace will charge a share of price excess over minimum sales price
for auction-type sales;
The marketplace will charge a fixed commission for choosing non-standard
smart contract schemes through the platform’s contract management tool;
Buyers will pay no commission.

Advertising revenue streams
•

A number of advertising/promotion tools will be made available to sellers in
the marketplace, including premium placement, segment targeting, demo
targeting, community creation, product/community feeds and blogs, virtual
storefront distinction items, bot tools, etc.

Technology
The Ubcoin Platform applies blockchain technology to create, manage, and operate
tokenized cryptocurrency. The platform operates on Ethereum-based smart-contracts.

Platform structure. Architecture scheme.
Basic system modules:
1) Authorization service Ubcoin-ID;
2) Billing system (wallet management, deposit/withdrawal, internal transactions);
3) Anti-fraud system (AI, internal regulations, ML);
4) Ad platform (placement and management, premium functionality, catalogue and
search);
5) Auction platform (auction placement and management);
6) Transaction management system (holding of funds, transaction confirmation,
transaction history);
7) Moderator and system administrator oﬃce;
8) Customer support and arbitration system.

31

Authorization and security
1. User authorization requires an email address and a password
a. Upon authorization the user enters an email address and a password.
b. If 2FA service is enabled, the user is to enter an additional password received via
Google Authenticator or the Telegram bot.
c. 2FA via Telegram
1. The user is to add UBCoinBot to his/her Telegram account
2. Each time the user enters the application, he presses the button to get the
password. After that, the Telegram bot generates a new password.
3. To enhance security in case that user data are suspected to be compromised,
the bot may request the user to send the current location. The received location
will be compared by backend software to the location of the user that is trying to
access the application.
2. Security of payment transactions and other Ubcoins operations.
a. In order to make a payment, it is necessary to enable 2FA service. In case of
money deposit/withdrawal the system will request 2FA user password.
b. Security keys to the wallets inside the system are stored on a separate server
which is diﬀerent from the one that stores the backend.

32

Billing system (wallet management, deposit/withdrawal, internal
transactions)
1. All Ubcoin wallet operations are performed in the application;
2. Upon registration in the system, the user receives access to an Ethereum wallet,
that belongs to the system and is linked to the user. In order to top-up a Ubcoin
wallet the user is to enter the wallet number that he received upon registration;
3. In order to withdraw funds, the Ubcoin user is to specify the Ethereum wallet to
which the money will be transferred. The transaction is protected by the payment
password.

33

Ad placement. Ad search. Ad management. Categorization. Verification, fraud
protection.
1. Ad placement:
a. Only users that went through the primary identification can place an ad;
b. The user presses the “create new ad” button;
c. Chooses the category;
d. Adds a description;
e. Attaches images;
f. Adds the price;
g. Specifies the meeting location;
h. At this stage, the user is oﬀered various additional paid services: premium ad, top
position placement for several days etc.;
i. After that, the ad is pre-moderated (including images validation, text content check,
anti-fraud filters etc.);
j. If the ad moderation is successful, it is published in the system, and the author
receives a push/email notification of the publication;
k. If the ad moderation fails, the author is notified via email of the refusal and the
reasons for it.

34

2. Ad search:
a. The system oﬀers the user the following ad search options:
i. Category search;
ii. Price filter;
iii. Publication date filter;
iv. Seller ratings filter;
b. During the search the user can perform the following actions with the ads he likes:
i. Add the listing to favourites;
ii. Use ad tracking service (price change and other dynamic parameters);
iii. Contact the seller via a personal message linked to the merchandise;
iv. To report the ad to the administration, specifying the reason: spam, abusive
content etc.

3. Ad management:
a. The user can perform the following actions with his ads:
i. See the whole ad list in the selected section in the application;
ii. Change the price, description, images. Any changes to the add lead to premoderation before publishing the ad again;
iii. Promote the ad in the search;
iv. Enable/disable additional services;
v. Stop the ad from appearing in the search.

4. Verification, fraud protection:
a. Verification includes two aspects: content check and anti-fraud.
b. Content check:
i. In order to detect inadmissible images and text, the application uses machine
learning technologies and AI. The system has a built-in set of regulations
describing inadmissible content criteria. Based on these regulations, the system
checks the content with the help of neural networks featuring innovative
technologies, such as Machine Learning и AI (TensorFlow, deeplearning4j etc).
The technological solutions are provided by the market leader TensorFlow.
c. Anti-fraud
i. Anti-fraud uses technologies similar to those in clause 4.b.i, but follows diﬀerent
rules.
ii. Examples of criteria used in anti-fraud mechanisms:

35

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

The number of ads from a single account in one category;
The total number of ads in the system;
Suspicious activity of a newly created account on the first day ;
Ads published by diﬀerent accounts from the same IP address;
Ads published by diﬀerent accounts from the same mobile device.

Transaction execution process
1. The user wants to buy the merchandise from the ad and presses the “buy” button
2. After that the sum equal to the merchandise price is held in his/her wallet inside the
system.
3. The buyer and the seller meet. The buyer examines the merchandise. There are three
scenarios of closing the deal:
a. the deal is successful
b. the deal is cancelled by mutual agreement
c. the deal is cancelled because either the seller or the buyer refused to proceed with
it.
i. The seller decided not to sell the merchandise for some reason. In this case, the
platform reimburses the money to the buyer and lowers the seller’s rating.
ii. The buyer is not satisfied with some details before the deal (the merchandise
condition, specifications etc.).
1. If the seller agrees to the cancellation, the further process is as described in
clause 3.b.
2. The seller does not agree with the buyer’s arguments and does not want to
cancel the deal. In this case, the deal goes to arbitration.
3. The buyer is dissatisfied within one day after the deal. In this case the buyer
has the right to go arbitration. The money can be reimbursed to the buyer only
with the seller’s agreement. If the arbitration results in the arbiter’s taking the
buyer’s side, it leads to lowering the seller’s rating.
If the parties agree that the deal is to be closed, the seller hands over the merchandise to
the buyer, the buyer scans the QR code on the seller’s phone (the QR code is generated
for the merchandise when the ad is placed on the platform) and thus confirms the money
transfer to the seller’s account. The money is withdrawn from the buyer’s account and
transferred to the benefit of the seller. The transaction is considered closed.

36

37

Dispute Arbitration Procedures
Smart contract requires both parties to sign oﬀ on settlement of the transaction. The
platform holds buyer’s funds in escrow while goods are in transit. Once received, if the
goods are not of described quality or condition, the buyer’s funds are not released to the
seller. If parties fail to settle amicably on their own, then the platform provides a two-tier
dispute arbitration service.
First tier of arbitration consists of two selected Ubcoin users with high enough rating and
relevant to the geography, product, type of sale that is in dispute. If the dispute parties
are not satisfied with the user arbitration, it goes to the second-tier – a Ubcoin arbiter
who is a support staﬀ member of Ubcoin. Funds/goods are released to the party found
wronged by non-performance of the other party. Guilty party’s rating on the platform is
decreased. Repeat oﬀenders are suspended for a limited time. Worst oﬀenders are
banned from the platform.
User of the platform are motivated to act as arbiters by a small fee reward and increased
profile/user rating for quality arbitration. High user ratings qualify the user for preferential
platform fee schedule and access to more premium features of the marketplace.

Integration with third parties and delivery services
The existing Ubank app, which Ubcoin Marketplace will become a part of once
developed, is a fintech business that relies on close integration with many third-party
providers of products and services oﬀered in the Ubank financial marketplace. Users can
apply for credit and debit cards from several banks, source loans form over two dozen
financial institutions, purchase insurance from leading insurers, pay to over 4000
diﬀerent service providers. We have also integrated with many payment providers,
processors, oﬄine and online businesses that drive value for the marketplace users.
Finally, we are already integrated with a number of delivery companies that allow for appto-door service. A plastic card ordered through Ubank is typically delivered to the
customer within 1-3 days, and that’s quite a feat in a country that spans 11 timezones and
stretches for over 9000 kilometers wide. Over the years we have built great expertise in
integration with delivery services and other third-party providers.

• Unsold Tokens
Tokens are minted only upon payment with ETH, thus no unsold tokens will be created at
the close of token-generation event.

• Token Payment Methods
We accept only ETH from ERC-20 token standard wallets, sending ETH from exchanges
may result in a loss of your funds.

• Team Vesting, Anti-Dumping Measures
Ubcoin team allotment of UBC is intended to be locked for the first six months after the
date of distribution, and will be vested over a period of 12 months following the end of
lock-up period, at 25% each quarter.
• Reserve Pool
During the initial stage of Ubcoin Marketplace development, at least 31% of the entire
supply will be retained by Ubcoin Reserve Pool to protect the nascent uti it to n
from speculative trading and to maintain flexibility at the early stages of the evolution of
the system. The Ubcoin Reserve Pool may be released in limited allotments by
decision of the Board of Directors to ensure the long-term returns and liquidity for UBC
community.

The Ubcoin Reserve Pool tokens will be priced according to the following formula:

F-+1%!)!]!G'0X%!W!F$01%/%)'!F-+1%!=!?T`!TaDKB!BBB!BBBA)

The price of each successive token will be higher than the previous one by one two
hundred fifty millionth. As a result, the additional supply coming from the Ubcoin Reserve
Pool will always be more expensive than the price paid by any of the existing buyers
during Token Sale.

• Token Sale Registration & Whitelisting
Our token sale requires users investing over 50 ETH to pass our KYC (Know Your
Customer) checks. Our registration form only requires very basic details. We request that
yous send one piece of ID (e.g. passport, drivers license), current residence address,
telephone number, and email to info@ubcoin.io with subject line: KYC for investment. We
will review this information and if everything checks out, your ETH contribution address
will be whitelisted and your address will be allowed to make contributions during the
token sale period. If there are any issues with your registration data, we will be sure to
reach out to make sure things are amended as soon as possible.
Registration opens as early as March for participants wanting to whitelist their addresses
as soon as possible.

• Exchange Listing
We are undergoing the listing process on five major exchanges. These undertakings
will be completed within reasonable timeframe of the finalization of

Summary of Long-Term Value Enhancing Measures
Ubcoin token is native to the peer-to-peer marketplace ecosystem. Smart contracts will
not accept any other cryptocurrency for facilitating transactions in the marketplace. As
volume of sales and purchases on the marketplace grows, demand for Ubcoin token will
organically increase.
Long term value for those tokens starts at utility and their price also relies on supply and
demand. In order to manage supply, help reduce volatility and enable persons who need
UBC to obtain them, Ubcoin has created a five-pronged approach:
TA The creation of a Reserve Pool, as described in previous section, ensuring that no
new tokens may enter into circulation at prices lower than those paid during Token
Sale.
DA We intend that holders of Ubcoin tokens will be oﬀered discounts on fees based
on their overall UBC holdings. The more UBC they own, the higher the discount will
be. This will likely incentivize clients to buy and hold UBC, further reducing the
available supply.
WA Reasonable vesting and anti-dumping prevention mechanisms, as set in previous
section.
PA The creation of a Token Buyback Program, funded with up to 10% of Ubcoins’s net
operating profits annually.
KA The creation of Burn Program, which will methodically reduce supply the more
successful the business becomes.
The details of items 4 and 5 are outline as follows below:
• Token Buyback Program
The UBC Buyback Program, funded with up to 10% of Ubcoins’s net operating profits
annually, will be created. Ubcoin intends to use the UBC Buyback Program to support the
stability of UBC on the exchanges as needed. To facilitate liquidity on both buy and sell
sides, UBC bought back by Ubcoin will be sold onto the exchange as needed depending
on the underlying demand. A key feature of the buyback program is that the buyback
oﬀer price is: the larger of (a) token purchase price during private limited pre-sale or
public token sale, or (b) current market price, (c) and the larger value multiplied by a
factor of 1.1.

IMPORTANT: Net Operating Profit here refers to net operating profits once Ubcoin is fully
operational and does not in any way relate to the sums collected by way of the
scheduled Pre-Sale or Token Sale. Purchasers have no rights in respect of the Token
Buyback Reserve and the use of the profits is at Ubcoin’s discretion and control. It is also
subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Gauging the possible size of this
reserve is diﬃcult at the outset of the initial Token Sale. Projections may generally be
based on market size and capitalization, as well as speculation based on published data
from competitors and general market research.

• Burn Program
We expect that demand for UBC will rise with usage of Ubcoin’s marketplace. Rising
demand may result in higher prices over time. Each time a fee is paid, an equivalent of
5% amount of UBC fee amount will be burned. As usage of the platform accelerates, the
availability of the UBC token will diminish, thus decreasing supply and helping to
maintain a competitive economic model for UBC.
However, there is no guarantee as to the price of UBC following the sale, nor that
Ubcoin’s secondary market will be available at that time. Any UBC price will depend on a
number of factors. Prospective purchasers should not buy UBC for speculative purposes.!

during the Ubcoin may be spent freely by Ubcoin on the development of its business

Token generation events are used by issuers before / in the early stages of a project, to
acquire tokens. Thus, the success of the Tokens themselves is hard to judge at the time
of acquisition, and if the project fails, the contributor could risk losing all they have
invested. UBC Tokens are not legal currency like US dollars, British pounds, Euros, or
Japanese yens. And in most of the cases, the Tokens themselves do not hold any
guaranteed value. Tokens may also carry the risk of programming bugs. There is a risk
of individuals having their account details stolen and having their Tokens transferred
without their permissions. When acquiring Tokens, there is a possibility of a third-party
to impersonate the Token issuer and to provide a fake address to steal Tokens from the
acquirer.
Due to the nature of blockchain and the need to verify and authorise exchanges, a
certain amount of time may be needed before Token exchanges are completed. While
the verification is taking place, there is a possibility of the exchange not being reflected
at the individual’s address, or the trade itself could be cancelled. As Tokens are
recorded electronically and they are transferred over networks, there is a risk of Tokens
vanishing away during exchanges.
Currently, laws and taxes regarding token generation events are not established
completely. And in the near future, we can expect governments to make a decision
whether to ban, limit or tax token generation events. This could lead to restrictions in
Token possession and trading and could aﬀect adversely on individuals in ways we can
not predict.
Cryptographic Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks
discussed in this documentation, there are risks that the Ubcoin cannot foresee. Further
risks may arise as unexpected combinations or variations of the described above risks
and new risks not described in the document.
