Section 1: The Vision

We envision a world made environmentally friendly through global adoption and growth of the
sharing and circular economies. A world in which the lifespan of electronics is extended to the point
where mining waste and landfills are a thing of the past.

“Our mission is to further environmental
sustainability by utilizing a decentralized, pre-owned
and refurbished ecommerce ecosystem designed to
advance the sharing and circular economies.”
Please support us in promoting global sustainability and a clean future!

The Galaxy eSolutions ICO is February 28th - March 31st, 2018.

Defining the Sharing Economy
The sharing economy, or collaborative consumption, refers to resource circulation systems which
allow consumers a two-sided role, in which consumers may act as both providers of resources and
obtainers of resources. This vision allows for a broad understanding of the sharing economy in regards
to the overarching criteria of changing consumer capacity. The sharing economy is NOT a black and
white ecosystem: it is a spectrum, and it is increasingly crucial to understand its different shades.
The driving forces behind the rise of sharing economy organizations and businesses include:
■
■
■

Information technology and social media
Urban lifestyle & demographic shifts
Increasing volatility in cost of natural resources

Now that we understand what the sharing economy is, and what’s driving the adoption of this
sustainable lifestyle, how do we define truly collaborative, sharing economy companies?
1. The core business idea involves unlocking the value of unused or under-utilized assets
(“idling capacity”) whether it’s for monetary or non-monetary benefits.
2. The company should have a clear values-driven mission and be built on meaningful principles
including transparency, humanness, and authenticity that inform short and long-term strategic
decisions.
3. The providers on the supply-side should be valued, respected, and empowered and the
companies committed to making the lives of these providers economically and socially better.
4. The customers on the demand side of the platforms should benefit from the ability to get
goods and services in more efficient ways that mean they pay for access instead of ownership.
5. The business should be built on distributed marketplaces or decentralized networks that create
a sense of belonging, collective accountability and mutual benefit through the community
they build.

Defining the Circular Economy
The circular economy aims to eradicate waste—not just from manufacturing processes, as lean
management aspires to do, but systematically and throughout the life cycles and uses of products and
their components. Looking beyond the current "take, make and dispose” extractive industrial model,
the circular economy is restorative and regenerative by design: Extending the life of products and
materials prevents the over-generation of waste and recovers the full value of products. Relying on
system-wide innovation, the circular economy aims to redefine products and services to design waste
out, while minimizing negative impacts. The circular model builds economic, natural and social
capital.

Section 2: The Problem

Refurbished Phones (B2B/C2B) Industry Pain Points
1. Phone Versions Unclear/Products Not as Described
In most phone trading websites, only the phone models are listed. Therefore, the exact versions of the
phones are not shown clearly. Phone version information is required so that buyers know that they are
buying the right phones for the right markets. For example, a local shop trader in Australia might not
be able to sell iPhones which are of USA versions, due to factors such different network bandwidth,
causing the phone to not work with local network frequencies. Different phone versions could cause
consumer dissatisfaction as well: for example, phones in Japan are required to have an alert sound
when taking pictures.
2. Potential Frauds/Scams
In many cases, phones are almost as good as cash, since it is highly tradable and of relative high
value. Hence, the phone industry often is littered with scammers. The typical scams include failing to
deliver goods after being paid, selling stolen goods on purpose and selling goods of questionable
quality. There are also suppliers who mix some bad products with good products just to increase their
margins. Clearly, the industry lacks trust.
3. High Cross-Border Transaction Costs
We all know that transacting for international payments is expensive and often incurs exchange
losses. In some cases, payments have to go thru intermediary banks, often taking days for one
transaction to complete. Add to this concern stricter AML (Anti-Money-Laundering) measures, and
we see even higher cross-border transaction costs.

Galaxy-eSolutions.com

5 | Page

4. Product Movement Verification
When deals are done, what is required next is the movement of the goods. There are many cases of
goods not being delivered on time, or that the tracking numbers need to be chased. There are also
cases of goods delivered to wrong addresses, held at customs or even being provided fake tracking
numbers.

Opportunity: A Profitable Sector in Need of Standardization
The refurbished phone trade is a multi-billion USD, high volume and high trading frequency globalized
business and yet it is a complex industry as it lacks standardization in areas such as trading terms,
product versions and compatibility, and especially in product grading and quality.
Industry Statistics:
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪

Double Digit gross profit %.
Double Digit Percentage Growth Year on Year.
Fragmented industry with chance for consolidation.
Environmental Friendliness (Government and Consumer Support).
30BN USD Market Size by 2020 (Just phones).

Market Trends and Predictions
Galaxy eSolutions predicts that the preowned and refurbished consumer electronics market will
continue to grow due to a variety of factors, including:
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪

Insatiable demand from developing countries.
Growing needs for a consumer to have a second phone (one for business/work).
Shorter life cycles of consumer electronics and the continuous upgrading.
Growing awareness of the need for environmental sustainability.
Large scale adoption of sharing and circular economies.

Section 3: The Solution

Blockchain: The Solution
1. Building Trust in a Trustless Environment
One solution to ensure the right products in the right markets is to obtain the phone IMEI
(International Mobile Equipment Identity) from the sellers, of which every phone has one (or two, if it
is a dual SIM version). This unique IMEI number of every phone will reveal information such as the
model number, the region and hence the version and the related network bandwidth.
The IMEI can be obtained simply by dialling *#06# and can be verified online. Our team will design
an API call to a online database service provider and put the information of the IMEI collection as
well as the tracking of it on blockchain.
Payment amount would be held in escrow by the smart contract until certain conditions are met, such
as the providing of IMEI and tracking numbers. The credentials of the sellers and buyers can also be
provided and verified against, based on their previous trading records and/or credibility based on
community voting.
2. Eliminating the Risk of Frauds and Scams
Since providing the IMEI numbers would mean that the supplier is likely to have the goods with
them. The IMEI numbers can also be used to ensure that the goods are not stolen goods. As such,
putting such critical information on blockchain would certainly help to stop scams as well as
improving trading experience. An API with IMEI database companies could facilitate the checks even
faster which is in the plan.

3. Reducing Transaction Costs and Time
Cross-border transaction fees will be greatly reduced by choosing to transact using cryptocurrencies
such as BTC, ETH or even using GES tokens. Time will also be saved and transactions could happen
within hours, rather than days.
Both of these are extremely important in the phone trading industry since it is a low margin, high
turnover business where quick turnaround is always critical in business performance.
4. Tracking Product Movement and Refurbishment Details
Information such as when items have been refurbished, who did the refurbishment, current status of
warranty period, courier used, dates dispatched, tracking numbers, shipment weight, and many other
logistics records can be put on the blockchain, improving trading experience, combating fraud, and
preventing shipment inconsistencies.

The Galaxy eSolutions Hybrid eCommerce Business Model
Galaxy eSolutions is an ecommerce ecosystem focusing on the pre-owned and refurbished economy
which is worth multi-billions. We have several strategic business units, including NDBD, Yabphones,
and Mobile Freak. NDBD and Yabphones are centralized, and focused on selling, while Mobile Freak
is a decentralized P2P buy-and-sell platform. Together, centralized and decentralized platforms create
the Galaxy eSolutions hybrid ecommerce ecosystem.
▪
▪
▪

NDBD: Currently a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) site evolving to become a marketplace with
approved suppliers).
Yabphones: A B2C and F2C (Factory-to-Consumer) site with own branding refurbished
products.
Mobile Freak (mobilefreak.com): a site to be built on blockchain to serve the C2C
(Consumer-to-Consumer), C2B (Consumer-to-Business) and B2B (Business-to-Business)
refurbished markets.

The reason for this hybrid model is Galaxy eSolutions’ belief that in the B2C model, where it is sending
goods to end consumers, the consistency in quality of goods and exceeding expectations are of utmost
importance. This is a retail experience and only in a centralized model can Galaxy eSolutions fully
control quality of supplied goods and consumer experience.
However, Galaxy eSolutions believes that a blockchain, or decentralized model, would suit a
marketplace serving the C2C, C2B and B2B markets. GES will use Mobilefreak.com for this
decentralized model and only focus initially on the highly tradable pre-owned and refurbished phones.

Galaxy eSolutions Platforms
Instead of selling refurbished electronics through a single, consumer-facing website, Galaxy
eSolutions operates a number of platforms, including NDBD, YABPhones, Android Reborn (under
renovation), and Mobile Freak (under development).
Galaxy-eSolutions.com

NDBD (live)
▪

▪
▪

▪

Concept/Appeal: NDBD simply means No Difference, Big Difference (as in general usage and
quality versus pricing). Targeting general market and consumers that look for savings and yet
wanted quality assurance. A place where customers will find most professionally refurbished
electronic products.
Now: Offering professionally refurbished Apple phones and iPads, Samsung, HTC, LG,
Google phones, and DJI Drones.
Future: Will offer more brands and other products, such as Samsung and Macbooks.
o Would evolve eventually into a marketplace plus direct B2C hybrid site (like
JD/Amazon). This would involve adding more brands, products and suppliers, as well
as talents with marketplace establishment and management experiences.
Over 30 subdomains which are locally translated and customized.

Site: nd-bd.com

Galaxy-eSolutions.com

15 | Page

YABphones (live)
▪
▪
▪

Concept/Appeal: As the focus is on young people, such as students/fresh grads/ new job
entrants, GES will rely on social marketing platforms such as Facebook and Youtube.
Now: Offering professionally refurbished Apple products, targeting at younger markets.
Future: Will focus solely on Apple products and penetrate such markets.
o YABphones will only focus on its own refurbished Apple products in order to meet
and exceed customer expectations and experience. It will also keep its range limited
to Apple for focused marketing.

Site: yabphones.com

Galaxy-eSolutions.com

Android Reborn (under renovation)
▪ Concept/Appeal: For general markets that have preference for Android phones.
▪ Now: Testing phase with professionally refurbished Android phones.
▪ Future: Planning to go live after supply and quality control for Android phones are secured and
funds ready.
▪ Remark: Android Reborn will only focus on its own refurbished Android products in order to
meet and exceed customer expectations and experience. It will also keep its range limited to
Android for focused marketing.
Site: android-reborn.com

Galaxy-eSolutions.com

17 | Page

Mobile Freak (under development)
▪

▪

▪
▪

▪

Concept/Appeal: Mobile Freak’s marketing slogan would be “Mobile Freak offers freaking
good prices to buy your phones!”. The site will list the phones it could purchase, and list the
different conditions and relative offer pricing, and market it to consumers wishing to sell
(either they have extra/unneeded phones or looking for an upgrade).
It will rely on online payment system and upon collecting the phones, they will be
consolidated and sent to Hong Kong for either re-selling or refurbishment. Due to the supply
chain and location advantage, highest prices would be fetched and hence profits maximized.
Now: Testing phase and site to be launched soon. Need funding to support full marketing,
operation and working capitals.
Future: Will include online-to-offline commerce and mall carts/kiosks in shopping malls that
we use to market buy-back services (buy the phone on spot after inspection) while also
marketing the NDBD range of products (if customer place orders, we dispatch from
centralised warehouse in Hong Kong or in that country).
Remark: Aihuishou, a Chinese site doing similar business and concepts but only on domestic
market, did 170M USD sales in 2017.

Section 5: What Makes Us Special?

Key Differentiators
Obviously, Galaxy eSolutions isn’t the only company operating in the refurbished electronics space.
There are a number of similar companies doing the same thing, but Galaxy eSolutions separates itself
from the pack in several key areas:

Branding
Galaxy eSolutions uses its own branding to build consistent consumer expectations across products.
This will encourage repeat buying as customers recognize that Galaxy eSolutions is a trusted
refurbishment provider.

Price
Galaxy eSolutions emphasizes lower costs through controls at every stage of the refurbishment
process. They own a refurbishment factory, and they process all retail transactions themselves. This
means they control the price and quality.
Not only that, but Galaxy eSolutions guarantees the best price/quality matrix.

Remarks: Foxconn is the Apple officially authorised refurbished factory that only produce Apple
C.P.O (Certified Pre-Owned). It currently has 1.5m workers.

Speed to Market
Galaxy eSolutions promises to get consumer electronics to the market more quickly than its
competitors. Because the company controls the whole supply chain, it’s in full control of all processes
required before reaching the market. Galaxy eSolutions doesn’t need to wait for suppliers or third
party refurbishment companies.

Warranty
Galaxy eSolutions has a 13-month warranty on all consumer electronics sold through their
refurbishment program, a warranty unmatched for professionally refurbished electronics.

Opportunities
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪

Inadequate funding restricted growth.
Market offers chance for consolidation especially for one that has supply chain advantage.
Huge potential in emerging markets and developing countries such as India, SEA, Brazil, and
Russia.
Chinese brands consumer electronics becoming a dominant force (e.g. Huawei, DJI etc).
Sales could be easily increased manifold by selling thru marketplaces (such as Amazon).
Market becoming more environmentally conscious and encourages recycling.
Generate B2B and Corporate Purchase sales.
Marketplace opportunities exist aplenty for further growth (e.g Amazon Renewed invited us
to sell there).

Threats
▪
▪
▪

▪

Global protectionism and nationalism (increasing trade barriers).
Waning popularity of Apple products.
Loss of Apple and Samsung refurbishment rights.
o Note: Once obtained, unlikely to be revoked given the special ‘Guanxi’ (relationship)
unless it’s a serious legal infringement, such as exporting to domestic China market,
which is not allowed in the bonded zone.
Big players coming into play (e.g. Amazon) as global cross border eCommerce giants are
looking for growth areas (however, this could be perceived as opportunity for cooperation
or as a M&A target).

Trading Hub: Hong Kong is a major trading hub for consumer electronics; Estimated 30%
of all second hand phones are sold/auctioned off here.
Logistics Hub: Due to historical reasons and location advantage, Hong Kong is a great place
for cross border eCommerce business like GES.
Low Corporate Tax: 16.5%, and for next year there will be further reduction for startups.

is critical due to supply and logistical issues.

Token Distribution

GES Token and Value Model
The GES token is exciting not only in that it can be used on the Galaxy eSolutions marketplace, but also because
of the buyback and burn model employed in conjunction with a very generous value protection mechanism. Just
another way Galaxy eSolutions can say thank you to our supporters!

Token Utility
GES tokens will have the following usages in the ecosystem:
▪ For listings services (applicable on suppliers).
▪ Upgraded services, such as accreditation of verified and /or featured suppliers.
▪ For Galaxy eSolutions services such as product refurbishment & inspection services (on
goods quality).

To act as ship-on-hold logistic centre (giving greater peace of mind on trading than smart
contracts).
GES tokens can be used on Galaxy eSolutions’ sites for purchases. The redeem value of each
GES token in the marketplace will be current token market price (according to
coinmarketcap.com).
Note: a 5% token-back reward on purchases will be issued at the end of each month.

Market Buyback and Burn Model
20% (for total) of Galaxy eSolutions’ quarterly profits will be used to buy back GES issued tokens
from the market and ‘burn’ at least 50% of them.
Galaxy eSolutions offers a Buyback and Burn value disbursement method, which is both efficient and
transparent, and which will not be considered as securities according to regulators, thereby not subject
itself to government interference.
Galaxy eSolution will systematically buy GES Tokens on exchanges and “Burn” them. “Burn” means
that purchased tokens will be taken off the market permanently, resulting in a decreased total number
of GES Tokens, thereby increasing the value of remaining GES Tokens over time.

Terms and Conditions
▪

▪
▪

▪
▪
▪

If not all tokens are fully allotted in the crowdsale/ICO, then the 20% profit allocation will be
on pro rata basis, using the following formula:
[Allotted Number of Tokens / Number of Initially Issued Tokens x 20% of annual profit]
Numbers will be audited annually as required by Hong Kong Tax Authority
Galaxy eSolutions will commit to continue buyback GES tokens with allocated profits up to
15 years.
o Year 1 to Year 10 (from April 1st 2018 to March 31st 2028): 20% of GES overall after
tax profit will be used to buy back GES tokens from the market.
o Year 11 to year 15 (from 2028 to 2032): [total tokens in market/total tokens issued x
20% of profit] will be used for market buyback.
Buyback will take place between June to Sept every year (Remark: Hong Kong Financial Year
End is 31st March).
Buyback price will be based on last 30 days weighted price to prevent possible market/price
manipulations.
GES will burn at least 50% of the bought back tokens from the market so that the token
supply on market will be reduced and when profits increase, holders will rewarded.

GES Value Protection Mechanism
Galaxy eSolutions will commit to redeem/buyback its tokens as long as prices fall below its average
ICO price (based on USD/USDT). This is regardless of profitability and we commit to eventually buy
up all tokens as long as prices fall below ICO averaged USD price, to give our backers the value
protection guarantee to illustrate our confidence in our project.

Jan 2018 Note: Galaxy eSolutions has now introduced more token usage which will boost the token potential value. On top of
that, we have a price protection mechanism introduced that when market price falls below listed price, we will conduct a market
buy back on GES tokens. As such, projection returns described above may not reflect the entire scenarios.

Key Assumptions and Findings
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪

ROI is based on averaged returns for all GES Token purchasers.
Over a 5 year period, GES Token purchasers could expect a 428% return on their investment
on average.
Over a 10 year period, GES Token purchasers could expect a 2214% return on their
investment on average.
Actual returns will depend on actual company performances, market sentiments, time of
selling, business cycles, macroeconomic factors as well as demand and supply of the tokens.
Galaxy eSolutions has no guarantee on its financial performance and its realisation of profits.
As GES Tokens work on a Market Buyback and Burn Model, as long as business is on track,
GES Tokens held longer are more likely to reach higher price. GES Tokens bought back are
‘burned’, causing a reduction of token supply.
GES token usage effect within the Galaxy eSolutions ecosystem could add a multiplier effect
to the token price.

Corporate Governance
Audit Requirement
All Hong Kong entities are required by law to submit their audited financial statements to the Inland
Revenue Department every year. Any non-compliance will result in serious consequences imposed
by government.
eCommerce Transparency
eCommerce business has no cash payments/transactions and hence all data are real and actual data.
Legality Issues
The terms and conditions, as well as the Galaxy eSolutions business deck, has been checked for
compliance by our legal advisor, Mr. Simon Choi, a renowned ICO lawyer who was the Head of Legal
in TCL for 10 years.
ICO and Security Issues
Galaxy eSolutions ICO and Web Security has been checked for maximum security by our Blockchain
Advisors, MR. Pranav Burnwal and Brennan Bennett.
