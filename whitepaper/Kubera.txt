Note:​ ​this​ ​is​ ​only​ ​a​ ​draft.​ ​Please​ ​go​ ​to​ h
​ ttps://kuberacoin.com​​ ​for​ ​the​ ​latest​ ​version.

I. Intro
Kubera is an innovative platform for playing online games with a crypto currency. We use the Ethereum
blockchain to provide a cryptographically secure payment system and provably fair gambling with smart
contracts​ ​for​ ​games​ ​in​ ​the​ ​future​ ​phases​ ​of​ ​the​ ​project.
Eliminate​ ​Player​ ​Deposit​ ​Risk
Kubera will enable players to have full custody over their funds by using Ethereum smart contracts to escrow
tournament​ ​buy-ins​ ​and​ ​autonomously​ ​distribute​ ​payouts​ ​based​ ​on​ ​game​ ​outcome.
Trust​ ​and​ ​Gameplay​ ​Fairness
Using peer-to-peer and cryptographic protocols by applying smart contracts in latter phases, all gameplay
outcomes​ ​reach​ ​consensus​ ​at​ ​the​ ​end​ ​of​ ​each​ ​game​ ​using​ ​a​ ​Byzantine​ ​Fault​ ​Tolerant​ ​consensus​ ​mechanism.
Reducing​ ​Player​ ​Costs
Our innovative architecture, powered by the Blockchain network of Ethereum, allows Kubera to considerately
eliminate expenses for payment. We aim to pass these operational savings back to our players to encourage
player​ ​retention,​ ​creating​ ​a​ ​more​ ​balanced​ ​game​ ​ecosystem.
Building​ ​a​ ​Decentralized​ ​Gaming​ ​Network
Kubera’s goal is to build out a core underlying decentralized online game network that developers and
third-party operators can plug-into and build upon. We hope that new functionalities are built on top of the
platform.
Short-Term​ ​Objective
The success of a new online game platform is largely dependent on network effects in maximizing liquidity
pools. Our short term goal is to be an innovative gaming platform with a breakthrough payment system
powered by Blockchain technology. As well as becoming the first decentralized online game platform to
market​ ​and​ ​to​ ​leverage​ ​this​ ​first-mover​ ​advantage​ ​in​ ​establishing​ ​Kubera​ ​as​ ​a​ ​legitimate​ ​market​ ​contender.
Long​ ​Term​ ​Objective
As for the long term goal, we want to lay a good foundation for the built-in currency, Kubera tokens (to be
explained more specifically later in this paper). We plan to reach out to other fields in order to create an
ecosystem in which our token is the primary currency. By owing Kubera tokens, people will have access to not
just the gaming platform to compete with each other and win tokens but also to be able to use those tokens
for a wide range of services including online shopping or trading on various exchanges. We believe with this
strategy will be the right move to rocket the price of the Kubera token and will bring substantial benefits for
investors​ ​and​ ​token​ ​holders.

II.​ ​Team
1. Core​ ​Team
Nakamoto​​ ​Masakazu,​ ​CEO
Over the past 20 years, Mr. Nakamoto has been active in creating a venture company of IT planning for many
companies in Japan and also throughout Asia. At the moment, he is engaged in numerous consulting services
for​ ​securities​ ​and​ ​gaming​ ​companies.
With years of researching on Blockchain technology, he is convinced that the Kubera project is the future
platform​ ​of​ ​online​ ​game​ ​development​ ​including​ ​casino​ ​development​ ​management.
Currently his company has about 20,000 users throughout Asia who are are consistently gaming. The Kubera
project​ ​hopes​ ​to​ ​develop​ ​new​ ​innovative​ ​environments​ ​for​ ​these​ ​users​ ​and​ ​create​ ​even​ ​larger​ ​markets.
Nakamoto​ ​Kengo,​ ​CMO
Mr. Nakamoto established an insurance company in 2015 and made his full entry into the field of encryption
currency starting from 2016. He also gained experience with Blockchain in Okinawa and developed a platform
for DAG technicians. Currently, Mr. Nakamoto teaches introductory courses on Blockchain and DAG to high
school students as well as some junior high and college level courses in Okinawa. He is also expanding his
business by offering consulting services of Blockchain all over Asian, especially in Japan, with the annual
revenue​ ​of​ ​approximately​ ​500​ ​million​ ​Yen​ ​from​ ​more​ ​than​ ​500​ ​individual​ ​investors.
Yonashiro​ ​Yuu,​ ​Director
Since 2011, Mrs. Yonashiro has started ​four businesses including real estate holding, car and motorcycle
rental, nursing care facilities and remodeling. She has also been running about ten new businesses and
helping two startups launch and scale up. After seeing the potential of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, she is
willing to combine those technologies with existing business and undergoing business development. As
Kubera coins function on Blockchain, she hopes that its characteristics of transparency and trust can be used
as​ ​a​ ​currency​ ​to​ ​shine​ ​light​ ​in​ ​the​ ​Japanese​ ​gambling​ ​industry.

2. Advisors
During the planning phase and implementation phase of the project, we have received invaluable advices
from:
Danny​ ​Kim​,​ ​expert​ ​in​ ​the​ ​field​ ​of​ ​IT​ ​computing,​ ​to​ ​sharpen​ ​the​ ​project​ ​strategy;
Daniel Jeppsson​, technical lead of VR (virtual reality) department of Google with office based in
California,​ ​to​ ​implement​ ​both​ ​traditional​ ​and​ ​VR​ ​games​ ​to​ ​be​ ​included​ ​for​ ​Kubera​ ​project;
Anders Jeppsson​, a digital innovator and creative IT strategist, to help the team to improve the UI/UX
of​ ​the​ ​games,​ ​build​ ​business​ ​development​ ​and​ ​manage​ ​the​ ​marketing​ ​plan​ ​of​ ​the​ ​project.
Kazufumi Miyaki​, ​experienced gaming consultant, who has worked in planning and developing a
leading SNS company and also been in charge of consulting on multiple game deals including large IP
titles, in advising how to make games in the Kubera system fancy and attractive to wide range of
users.

III.​ ​The​ ​Market
Turnover in the international gaming industry reached 50bn in 2017 with a projected turnover of 56bn [​1​]. 60%
of online gaming platforms belong to 22 leading networks. Another 30% are subsidiaries of popular offline
e-game​ ​platforms,​ ​and​ ​private​ ​individuals​ ​own​ ​the​ ​remaining​ ​10%.
In most cases, online games cause distrust on the part of the players. However, up until the development of
platforms​ ​like​ ​Ethereum,​ ​which​ ​enable​ ​automated​ ​trust,​ ​there​ ​hasn't​ ​been​ ​a​ ​viable​ ​solution.
Common​ ​Issues​ ​in​ ​the​ ​Online​ ​Gambling​ ​Industry
The vast amount of issues that currently impact all aspects of the gaming industry originate from trust. From
provability​ ​and​ ​user​ ​balance​ ​account​ ​management​ ​to​ ​security​ ​and​ ​transparency.

Global​​ ​Gaming​​ ​Market
The global gaming market is experiencing explosive growth, reaching US$108.9BN in 2017 and a projected
US$128.5BN​ ​by​ ​2024.
With 58% of the growth in 2016 coming from Asia-Pacific countries, BAP Co., LTD, headquartered in Tokyo
Japan,​ ​provides​ ​the​ ​perfect​ ​springboard​ ​to​ ​target​ ​these​ ​growing​ ​ASEAN​ ​markets.
Virtual​ ​Goods​ ​Market
The value of the Global Social Gaming market is estimated to reach US$17.4BN by 2019. Virtual goods,
advertisements and lead generation offers are the primary revenue generation sources of the global social
gaming market. Among these, the virtual goods segment is likely to expand the fastest at a compound annual
growth​ ​rate​ ​of​ ​15.20%​ ​over​ ​the​ ​forecasted​ ​period.
Mobile​ ​Game​ ​Market

2.2 billion gamers across the globe are expected to generate US$108.9 billion in game revenues in 2017.
Mobile is the most lucrative segment, claiming 42% of the market. In 2020, mobile gaming will represent just
over​ ​half​ ​of​ ​the​ ​total​ ​game​ ​market.

IV.​ ​Problems
1. Market​ ​problems
Due to the regulatory constraints placed on the industry, operators are restricted in their ability to serve
customers across major jurisdictions and regions. Jurisdictions are grouped into the following categories
based​ ​on​ ​regulatory​ ​response​ ​(exact​ ​nomenclature​ ​varies):
Black​ ​Markets
Black markets are jurisdictions that have either classified online gaming as illegal or only allow intrastate
games​ ​to​ ​be​ ​played.
Dark​ ​Grey​ ​Markets
Dark grey markets are jurisdictions that don’t explicitly prohibit online gambling and/or have legislation that is
unclear.
Grey​ ​Markets
Grey​ ​markets​ ​are​ ​jurisdictions​ ​that​ ​have​ ​regulated​ ​online​ ​gambling​ ​or​ ​have​ ​not​ ​taken​ ​any​ ​action
against​ ​remote​ ​operators.

2. Operators
Within this regulatory framework, operators choose either to operate in multiple markets with single or
multiple licenses, or all markets with a single or no license. These can be classified as “onshore” operators
and​ ​“offshore”​ ​operators.
Onshore​ ​Operators
Regulated operators have obtained at least one gaming license from a respected gaming authority and
typically operate in most grey and dark-grey markets. These operators adhere to AML/KYC, tax, and other
compliance​ ​policies,​ ​and​ ​many​ ​are​ ​publicly​ ​traded​ ​companies​ ​on​ ​various​ ​exchanges​ ​around​ ​the​ ​globe.
Offshore​ ​Operators
Unregulated operators often reside in offshore jurisdictions in Costa Rica, Curacao, Cyprus or on Indian
Reservations. They have usually offered their services to customers globally including black markets.
Relatively​ ​minimal​ ​data​ ​can​ ​be​ ​obtained​ ​on​ ​these​ ​operators.
An increased number of jurisdictions and countries around the world have begun regulating online gaming,
leading​ ​to​ ​a​ ​greater​ ​portion​ ​of​ ​regulated​ ​online​ ​gaming​ ​traffic.
Competition
Online gaming networks’ success is dependent upon establishing large global liquidity pools of players. Thus
over time, the market has been reduced to a few large operators within their respective target markets, leaving
players​ ​with​ ​limited​ ​playing​ ​options​ ​and​ ​enabling​ ​operators​ ​to​ ​charge​ ​higher​ ​fees.
Unregulated​ ​B2C​ ​Market

The unregulated online gaming market is slightly more fragmented. Sites put minimal investment into
anti-cheating practices such as bot detection or multi-accounting, leaving players to fend for themselves on
their platforms. Many players have gravitated to these platforms because of limited playing options, or high
competition on regulated platforms. However, the lack of due diligence and reporting requirements of these
companies leaves players with minimal insight into daily operations, and provides negligible recourse options
should​ ​these​ ​sites​ ​go​ ​offline,​ ​lock​ ​players​ ​out​ ​of​ ​their​ ​accounts,​ ​or​ ​be​ ​accused​ ​of​ ​wrongdoing.
Gaming​ ​Bots
Gaming bots can run without human oversight and vary in their complexity: they can be bought off-the-shelf or
can be custom built and employed by an individual actor. They vary in their degrees of success, and ultimately,
only the most sophisticated of bots can beat skilled professional players. Gaming bots pose a significant
threat​ ​to​ ​the​ ​future​ ​success​ ​of​ ​the​ ​industry.
Third-Party​ ​Tools​ ​and​ ​Software
Many online players use third-party tools and software that targets recreational players via a multitude of
methods.​ ​These​ ​tools​ ​include​ ​(but​ ​aren’t​ ​limited​ ​to):
Player Databases​​: A database of players that can be queried to find players with low win rates across multiple
gaming​ ​networks.
Auto-Seating:​ ​Automatically seats players at quality checked cash game and Sit & Go’s, as well as color
coding​ ​players​ ​based​ ​on​ ​player​ ​statistics.
Player​ ​Scanning:​ ​Scans​ ​players​ ​currently​ ​in​ ​a​ ​gaming​ ​site’s​ ​lobby​ ​who​ ​match​ ​specific​ ​criteria.
Heads-Up-Displays:​​ ​Displays​ ​real-time​ ​statistics​ ​of​ ​opponents​ ​at​ ​active​ ​games.
These tools are designed to give players access to information about their opponents and are used by regular
online gaming players. Unfortunately, these tools create a disadvantage for recreational players that are not
employing​ ​these​ ​programs​ ​and​ ​are​ ​unknowingly​ ​targeted​ ​by​ ​highly​ ​skilled​ ​professionals.
Conclusion
Players face several disadvantages in the current online gaming marketplace. They must combat malicious
software, high fees and stiff competition in regulated markets, and are forced into playing on sites that lack
accountability and transparency in black markets. Overall, increased competition, higher fees, and distrust
among​ ​recreational​ ​players​ ​has​ ​led​ ​to​ ​a​ ​growing​ ​strain​ ​on​ ​the​ ​global​ ​gaming​ ​economy.

V.​ ​The​ ​Kubera​ ​Solution
1. Overall
The Kubera team has spent years researching the current market dynamics in the industry. Our goal is to
address industry shortfalls through the creation of a new decentralized online gaming network with built in
trust,​ ​transparency​ ​and​ ​accountability.
We seek to reinvigorate online gaming through the utilization of the Ethereum blockchain, peer-to-peer
networking, user-owned identity, and cryptographically secured payouts. While also creating an improved
playing​ ​experience​ ​at​ ​a​ ​lower​ ​cost​ ​to​ ​players.

Using these new frameworks we will fix the broken gaming economy, provide reduced costs to players and
create the safest and most secure online gaming platform. This will enable all players to have a fun
experience​ ​and​ ​develop​ ​a​ ​more​ ​balanced​ ​online​ ​gaming​ ​ecosystem.
User​ ​Flow
Kubera will run without storing customer funds even it stores keystore files of their wallets as those wallets
are encrypted by a password which is defined and known by the customers only. This means if users forget or
lose access to the password they use to encrypt their wallets, we will not be able to recover access to their
funds.
Game​ ​Clients
The Game Client will initially be a state-engine desktop or mobile application that runs the game Logic and
includes​ ​a​ ​light​ ​wallet.​ ​It​ ​will​ ​connect​ ​to​ ​other​ ​players​ ​at​ ​a​ ​given​ ​game.
Registration
Users will be required to create an identity (if they haven’t already created one). The user will also have to
receive​ ​an​ ​attestation​ ​regarding​ ​country​ ​of​ ​residence​ ​and​ ​age​ ​prior​ ​to​ ​playing​ ​on​ ​Kubera​ ​when​ ​necessary.
Funding​ ​Wallets
The user will be brought to a page that directs them to fund the light wallet that is pre-built in for the client.
The built-in Kubera wallet uses Version 3 format of Ethereum blockchain wallet, which is the most popular
format used by well-known clients such as Metamask and MyEtherWallet. Because of this, users will find no
problems​ ​in​ ​importing​ ​and​ ​using​ ​the​ ​same​ ​wallet​ ​with​ ​a​ ​different​ ​client.
Create​ ​or​ ​Join​ ​a​ ​Game
The user will have the option to create a private game. He or she can invite other players to join or go to our
lobby​ ​which​ ​will​ ​show​ ​all​ ​publicly​ ​available​ ​games​ ​via​ ​our​ ​gaming​ ​registry.
Buy-In
The user can either join a public or private game by sending Kubera tokens, in-platform tokens (to be
discussed later), to the system’s Ethereum address to have the funds locked, this will play as assurance that
winners will be paid by the end of the game. The system address will sit on the Ethereum blockchain and act
as​ ​an​ ​escrow​ ​account​ ​while​ ​gameplay​ ​is​ ​conducted.
Gameplay
The​ ​peers​ ​at​ ​the​ ​game​ ​will​ ​form​ ​a​ ​P2P​ ​subnet.

2. How​ ​Kubera​​ ​w​orks​ i​ n​ ​the​ ​first​ ​phase​ ​without​ ​smart​ ​contracts
For​ ​the​ ​first​ ​phase​ ​after​ ​the​ ​ICO​ ​ends,​ ​we​ ​will​ ​release​ ​games​ ​which​ ​require​ ​only​ ​skills​ ​from​ ​the​ ​players
themselves,​ ​as​ ​well​ ​as​ ​games​ ​using​ ​Kubera​ ​tokens.​ ​ ​Because​ ​of​ ​this,​ ​smart​ ​contracts​ ​are​ ​not​ ​a​ ​compulsory
part​ ​at​ ​that​ ​time.​ ​System​ ​components​ ​consist​ ​of​ ​the​ ​following:

a. Identity​ ​Management
A registration and identity validation mechanism to prevent underage gameplay and multi-accounts. Users will
be​ ​required​ ​to​ ​sign-in​ ​via​ ​our​ ​system​ ​each​ ​time​ ​they​ ​want​ ​to​ ​play​ ​games​ ​on​ ​Kubera.
Illustration​ ​of​ ​Identity​ ​Validation

-

Step 1:​ A user goes to the user portal, creates an account with a personal email and password to
access the account later. A verification link will be sent to the specified email address and the user
needs​ ​to​ ​follow​ ​that​ ​link​ ​in​ ​order​ ​to​ ​verify​ ​the​ ​email​ ​address​ ​and​ ​proceed​ ​with​ ​the​ ​further​ ​steps.

-

Step 2:​ Next, the user has to provide a phone number and uses the verification token sent to this
number​ ​from​ ​the​ ​system​ ​to​ ​verify​ ​it.

-

Step 3:​ A scan of the user’s ID (resident card or passport), a selfie with the ID and other personal
information such as full name, date of birth, nationality are required and must be entered/uploaded
manually by the user themself. After submitting this, the information will be sent to administrative
system to proceed offline KYC/AML procedure in order to determine whether the user is legally
eligible to participate in the ICO. The KYC/AML procedure takes time and it is likely the most time
consuming step so users are urged to be patient while waiting for approval before continuing to the
next​ ​steps.

-

Step 4:​ After being approved by the system administrators, the user must proceed to initialize their
wallet to be able to invest in the ICO. Users can choose either to create a completely new wallet by
entering a passphrase or import an existing wallet into the system by uploading its keystore/JSON
file. The equivalent address of the wallet will then be imported into a list of authorized addresses
which are allowed to send money into the ICO contract a.k.a the ICO contract only accepts
investments coming from addresses specified in the authorized list which is stored inside the ICO
contract.

Please note that if the user chooses one of two options to initialize his/her wallet above, the wallet still stays
encrypted and the user needs to enter the passphrase in order to decrypt the wallet and make transactions from
it. The system stores only the wallet as the form of keystore/JSON file, the encrypted form, and does not store
the passphrase of the wallet which means the user will permanently lose the funds the wallet holds if he/she
does​ ​not​ ​have​ ​access​ ​to​ ​the​ ​passphrase,​ ​the​ ​system​ ​will​ ​not​ ​be​ ​capable​ ​of​ ​recovering​ ​ ​the​ ​wallet​ ​or​ ​passphrase.

b. Game​ ​server
As smart contracts will not be involved in the gaming process in this phase, a game server will be responsible
for handling the game outcomes and player payouts. Game records will be then be collected and sent to a
database​ ​by​ ​the​ ​game​ ​server​ ​and​ ​funds​ ​will​ ​be​ ​processed​ ​accordingly​ ​to​ ​payout​ ​for​ ​those​ ​who​ ​win.
Handling​ ​game​ ​outcomes
Player moves in games during this phase will be synchronized in real-time for all parties’ end via the game
server thanks to the P2P messaging protocol. As a result, the game server is able to keep track of the game
play, assure information that all parties have are identical, logical and relative to precedent moves so no one
will​ ​be​ ​able​ ​to​ ​fool​ ​the​ ​server​ ​or​ ​the​ ​other​ ​players​ ​in​ ​a​ ​game​ ​with​ ​a​ ​nonsense​ ​result.
Game​ ​payout
When a tournament or a game is completed, or when a player leaves, the platform will auto-execute and
payout each player when winnings are due. Those payouts will stay locked but available to use to play other
games in the platform. Those funds are available to transfer to any other wallet, whatever pre-built light wallet
of the system or external Ethereum accounts which are managed by popular tools such as Mist,
MyEtherWallet​ ​or​ ​Metamask.

3. How​ ​Kubera​​ ​works​ ​in​ ​latter​ ​phases​ ​with​ ​smart​ ​contracts
From the second phase of development, the Kubera platform will utilize several sub-components for different
purposes​ ​within​ ​the​ ​application:

Illustration​ ​of​ ​how​ ​the​ ​Kubera​ ​platform​ ​works​ ​with​ ​smart​ ​contracts

a. Identity​ ​Management
The registration and identity validation mechanism built in the first phase will remain consistent in latter
phases to assure that the system is stable and trustworthy from the risk of underage gameplay and
multi-accounting.

b. Ethereum​ ​Smart​ ​Contracts
Ethereum​ ​contracts​ ​are​ ​utilized​ ​for​ ​several​ ​purposes:
-

as​ ​a​ ​registry​ ​for​ ​all​ ​active​ ​games​ ​on​ ​the​ ​platform
as​ ​a​ ​short-term​ ​escrow​ ​service​ ​for​ ​players​ ​seated​ ​at​ ​a​ ​given​ ​game
as a repository for all game-specific parameters such as buy-in amount, payout percentages, and
game​ ​type
reporting​ ​end​ ​game​ ​results

c. Ethereum​ ​Smart​ ​Contracts
After a player has verified their identity and created their account, the user is brought to the e-gaming
contract.
Gaming​​ C
​ ontract

The Gaming contract contains a registry of all available games, as well as recently completed games. Its
functions include game creation as well as matchmaking and other frontend, user, and game-management
tasks.
It represents a single instance of playing a game in Kubera. When a decision is made to start a game of
gaming with a particular set of rules and limits and a given set of players. Pots get paid upon completion of
the​ ​game.
During play, the game contract serves several purposes. Primarily, it is the repository of all information
regarding the rules and settings for the game being played. It also maintains a list of the players in the game,
information about them needed by the other players and is responsible for distributing winnings. Additionally,
it​ ​is​ ​where​ ​funds​ ​used​ ​for​ ​gameplay​ ​are​ ​stored.
When a player joins a game contract, the funds needed to cover the game buy-in are transferred to the game
contract and credited internally to the player's stakes. The player then receives the necessary information
from​ ​the​ ​contract​ ​to​ ​communicate​ ​with​ ​the​ ​other​ ​players​ ​at​ ​the​ ​game,​ ​and​ ​play​ ​begins.
As play progresses, the contract is informed as to the state of the game and updates accordingly. When the
player leaves the game, the contract transfers any funds due to the same account from which the player
originally​ ​paid​ ​them.
Player​ ​Interactions​ ​and​ ​Game​ ​Contracts
As​ ​currently​ ​architected,​ ​transactions​ ​by​ ​players​ ​are​ ​sent​ ​to​ ​game​ ​contracts​ ​in​ ​the​ ​following​ ​instances:
(1)​ ​to​ ​join​ ​a​ ​game
(2)​ ​at​ ​the​ ​end​ ​of​ ​each​ ​game
(3)​ ​when​ ​a​ ​game​ ​is​ ​completed​ ​(for​ ​tournaments)​ ​or​ ​when​ ​a​ ​player​ ​leaves​ ​a​ ​game​ ​(for​ ​cash​ ​games)
Our goal is to minimize the number of transactions sent to Ethereum to reduce gas costs and improve
gameplay​ ​speed.
At the end of a game, each player cryptographically signs the end-results, and sends a transaction to the
game contract which updates each respective player’s stake accordingly. This consensus mechanism and
transaction submission by the peers at each given game functions as an “oracle,” enabling the contract to
keep​ ​an​ ​updated​ ​game​ ​state,​ ​and​ ​to​ ​know​ ​when​ ​to​ ​pay​ ​players.
This process happens asynchronously as games are played on the platform enabling players to move onto the
next​ ​game​ ​while​ ​a​ ​previous​ ​game​ ​result​ ​is​ ​validated​ ​by​ ​the​ ​blockchain.
Multi-game​ ​Tournament​ ​Contract
For tournaments that involve play across multiple games, the multi-game tournament contract acts as an
organizational tool for managing the distribution of players across the games. Any aspects of the tournament
that​ ​exist​ ​at​ ​a​ ​higher​ ​level​ ​than​ ​the​ ​game​ ​itself​ ​are​ ​governed​ ​by​ ​this​ ​contract.
Peer​ ​Validation​ ​and​ ​Contracts
A Validation is created by peers in the game. A special case of the player client software which participates in
the peer-to-peer gameplay of a game, but does not participate in play or place wagers. Instead, this peer is
externally incentivized to act as a "more trustworthy" peer in the game subnet in such a way that a set of them
at​ ​a​ ​game​ ​can​ ​be​ ​used​ ​to​ ​resolve​ ​certain​ ​potential​ ​disputes​ ​and​ ​to​ ​log​ ​the​ ​game​ ​data.
To both distribute the workload and discourage any potential for collusion between validators and players, the
validators are assigned randomly to games from a pool, and rotate through games after a certain number of
games. The Validation Management Contract is responsible for keeping a registry of available validators and
also​ ​assigning​ ​them​ ​to​ ​the​ ​games.

d. Peer-to-Peer​ ​Messaging
P2P​ ​Messaging​ ​for​ ​Game​ ​Client​ ​Synchronization
Decentralized technologies are required to provide a practical, consumer-oriented gaming service. The
downloadable game client software consists of separate "frontend" and "backend" processes. The front end
displays the current game state to the local user, accepts input when appropriate and passes it to the
backend, which then broadcasts it to the other clients in the game. The backend contains the logic needed to
apply the rules of gaming to the input events that it receives from the frontend and other clients. As a result,
every​ ​client​ ​is​ ​applying​ ​the​ ​same​ ​code​ ​to​ ​the​ ​same​ ​data​ ​as​ ​all​ ​the​ ​others.
Off-Chain​ ​Gameplay
A programmable blockchain technology like Ethereum makes it possible to have data storage for things that
might otherwise be handled by a single server, like managing the players at a particular game. The ability for
client software to interact with contracts on the blockchain also allows for the trustless, distributed
management​ ​of​ ​player​ ​funds​ ​and​ ​game​ ​stakes,​ ​and​ ​provides​ ​a​ ​tamper-proof​ ​record​ ​of​ ​these​ ​interactions.
The blockchain cannot simply be used as a replacement for a server for all aspects of the game partly
because data and instructions sent by a client take time to propagate across the chain. It is, therefore,
impractical​ ​to​ ​use​ ​in​ ​the​ ​management​ ​of​ ​game​ ​events​ ​at​ ​a​ ​finer​ ​granularity​ ​than​ ​at​ ​the​ ​game​ ​level.
Game events occurring at a higher rate, like betting, must be managed by the client software itself, or more
precisely: by the software that manages the peer-to-peer subnet consisting of the clients playing a particular
game.
The use of digital signatures allows each client to verify that messages received have been sent by the
claimed sender, preventing forgery. Fault tolerant consensus formation techniques are used to ensure that at
each step in the gameplay process, every client agrees with every other client as to what exactly has
happened. In addition to catching errors and hardware failures, Byzantine faults (intentionally bad data) are
also​ ​detected.
At the end of each game this consensus data - digitally signed by every client - is passed to the blockchain for
processing, and the clients themselves move on to the next game. Disagreements among clients, or peers at
the​ ​game​ ​are​ ​resolved​ ​by​ ​validators.

e. IPFS:​ ​Game​ ​Storage​ ​and​​ H
​ istory
To provide a permanent record of the actual play of each game, the signed game event messages need to be
stored,​ ​as​ ​well​ ​as​ ​the​ ​state​ ​information​ ​tracked​ ​by​ ​the​ ​blockchain​ ​when​ ​it​ ​processes​ ​the​ ​end​ ​of​ ​a​ ​game.
This turns up a second weakness in current blockchain technology: using the chain to store significant
amounts​ ​of​ ​data​ ​can​ ​be​ ​expensive,​ ​so​ ​sending​ ​all​ ​log​ ​data​ ​to​ ​the​ ​blockchain​ ​is​ ​not​ ​practical.
Fortunately,​ ​technologies​ ​exist​ ​(IPFS,​ ​Swarm)​ ​that​ ​can​ ​provide​ ​reliable,​ ​distributed​ ​data​ ​storage.
At the end of a game, before reporting to the blockchain, the client software sends the game's log data to
IPFS,​ ​which​ ​provides​ ​it​ ​with​ ​a​ ​single​ ​"hash"​ ​value​ ​that​ ​can​ ​be​ ​used​ ​to​ ​locate​ ​it​ ​at​ ​a​ ​later​ ​time.
That hash is included with the state data sent to the blockchain contract, and since each game's log data
includes the hash of the previous game's log, it is possible to request from the blockchain the most recent
hash,​ ​and​ ​use​ ​it​ ​to​ ​chain​ ​back​ ​through​ ​the​ ​entire​ ​logged​ ​history​ ​of​ ​the​ ​game.
A distributed storage platform removes singular points of failure present in various forms of centralized
storage​ ​systems.

f. Game​ ​Security
There​ ​are​ ​several​ ​forms​ ​of​ ​cheating​ ​that​ ​plague​ ​online​ ​gaming.​ ​Common​ ​forms​ ​are​ ​outlined​ ​below.
Collusion
Collusion is defined as two or more players collaborating at a game by sharing information and utilizing
cooperative​ ​betting​ ​strategies​ ​to​ ​create​ ​an​ ​advantage​ ​against​ ​other​ ​players​ ​for​ ​financial​ ​gain.
Multi-accounting
A single user may use several accounts across one or multiple machines and then take multiple seats at the
same​ ​game​ ​to​ ​create​ ​an​ ​unfair​ ​advantage​ ​in​ ​a​ ​tournament​ ​or​ ​cash​ ​game.
Data​​ M
​ ining
An unfair advantage is any instance in which a user accesses or compiles information on other players
beyond​ ​that​ ​which​ ​the​ ​user​ ​has​ ​personally​ ​observed​ ​through​ ​the​ ​user’s​ ​own​ ​game​ ​play.
Gaming​​ B
​ ots
As described previously, gaming bots are either off-the-shelf or self-programmed software programs that can
operate​ ​without​ ​human​ ​oversight.
Account​​ ​Sharing
Account sharing can be defined as when two or more players use one account to take advantage of the
gaming​ ​site​ ​or​ ​other​ ​players.
The gaming site can be taken advantage of if they offer higher % rewards. Other players can be taken
advantage of with nefarious actions such as selling an account deep in a tournament, as well as a stronger
player​ ​using​ ​a​ ​weaker​ ​player’s​ ​account.
Provability​​ ​System​​ ​to​​ ​Prevent​​ ​Cheating
In​ ​order​ ​to​ ​combat​ ​collusion​ ​and​ ​cheating,​ ​the​ ​Kubera​ ​team​ ​will​ ​be​ ​developing​ ​a​ ​validation​ ​system.
Validators are non-playing peers who provide security and protection to players on the Kubera network and in
exchange​ ​receive​ ​fees​ ​from​ ​players.
Validators on the Kubera network sign each outcome for every game on the platform and submit game
histories for storage to IPFS. The functions described below are automated: there is no manual oversight
needed​ ​for​ ​a​ ​user​ ​to​ ​run​ ​a​ ​validation​ ​node.
Dispute​​ R
​ esolution
In the rare instance where two peers at a game disagree about the state of the game at the end of a game, a
validator​ ​can​ ​resolve​ ​the​ ​dispute​ ​in​ ​real-time​ ​and​ ​award​ ​the​ ​pot​ ​to​ ​the​ ​winner.
Data-Feed
A validator submits each action of every game to Interplanetary File System (IPFS) so that game histories can
be stored. This is required by gaming regulatory bodies and ensures essential services such as collusion
detection,​ ​bot​ ​detection,​ ​and​ ​multi-accounting​ ​identification​ ​can​ ​be​ ​conducted.
Player​​ E
​ ncryption​​ ​Keys
Validators​ ​will​ ​store​ ​a​ ​decryption​ ​key​ ​for​ ​the​ ​players​ ​at​ ​the​ ​game.
The “dropped player problem” in games is defined as when a player drops out of a game before a game is
completed. This is problematic, as all players must share encryption keys for community cards to be revealed
and​ ​for​ ​a​ ​game​ ​to​ ​be​ ​completed.

Each player's keys can be encrypted and split amongst all players plus the validator. If the player drops, the
validator can request the pieces from each player and decrypt the assembled pieces so that the game can be
completed.
A validator node on Kubera can be activated by downloading the Validator client to a machine, opening the
application​ ​and​ ​activating​ ​the​ ​Validator.

VI.​ ​Kubera​ ​Architecture
Kubera​ ​is​ ​still​ ​under​ ​heavy​ ​development,​ ​parts​ ​in​ ​this​ ​section​ ​are​ ​subject​ ​to​ ​change.
For a short-term plan until June 2018, Kubera aims to offer a fully decentralized gaming platform made
possible​ ​through​ ​the​ ​use​ ​of​ ​new​ ​technologies​ ​like​ ​Ethereum​ ​and​ ​IPFS​ ​along​ ​with​ ​other​ ​solutions.
Games and applications of Kubera platform will be designed and implemented to be cross-platform
applications so we will use Unity framework for games and React Native for applications. For games, they will
include the platform engine, the gaming client and a network infrastructure that allows for communications
with the Ethereum blockchain as well as a peer-to-peer subnet for game instances to use for lower-latency
messaging​ ​required​ ​in​ ​human​ ​gameplay.

1. Components
The​ ​major​ ​components​ ​of​ ​a​ ​game​ ​that​ ​will​ ​run​ ​in​ ​Kubera​ ​platform​ ​are:
Game​ ​Engine
Contains​ ​the​ ​game​ ​logic.
Ethereum
Uses as a repository for game parameters, escrow service, results reporting, player management across
multiple​ ​games,​ ​and​ ​Validator​ ​Management.
GameNet
Provides​ ​a​ ​single​ ​component​ ​the​ ​engine​ ​can​ ​use​ ​to​ ​communicate​ ​with​ ​the​ ​outside​ ​world.
P2PNet
Used​ ​by​ ​GameNet​ ​to​ ​manage​ ​a​ ​game-instance-specific​ ​p2p​ ​subnet.
Web3.js
The Ethereum compatible JavaScript API which implements that communicates with the Ethereum nodes
(​https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/​). For those to be implemented in Unity, we will be using .Net version
of​ ​web3​ ​which​ ​can​ ​be​ ​found​ ​at​ ​https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum​.
Unity​ ​or​ ​React​ ​Native​ ​Application
Cross​ ​platform​ ​framework.
Game​ ​Client

The game client that will be used by players. Most games in the platform will be implemented with Unity
framework or React Native to make those games runnable not only on mobile platforms but also on web
browsers​ ​or​ ​even​ ​desktop.
IPFS​ ​Client
Interfaces with the IPFS network to store game records. Users have the option of running their own IPFS node
or​ ​connecting​ ​to​ ​the​ ​default​ ​Infura​ ​node.

2. Game​ ​Engine
State​ ​Machine
The game engine is the core of our application. Our game engine is a finite-state machine that controls the
transitions within the game state and implements the game rules. Depending on user interactions with the
application​ ​and​ ​the​ ​network​ ​responses,​ ​the​ ​game​ ​engine​ ​will​ ​trigger​ ​actions​ ​and​ ​will​ ​move​ ​to​ ​the​ ​next​ ​state.
Connected​ ​or​ ​Offline​ ​State
Kubera​ ​runs​ ​through​ ​the​ ​following​ ​process​ ​when​ ​a​ ​user​ ​logs​ ​into​ ​the​ ​application:
1.​ ​The​ ​application​ ​is​ ​not​ ​connected,​ ​so​ ​we​ ​are​ ​in​ ​an​ ​offline​ ​state.
2.​ ​The​ ​user​ ​inputs​ ​login​ ​details​ ​and​ ​performs​ ​a​ ​login.
3.​ ​The​ ​game​ ​engine​ ​will​ ​receive​ ​the​ ​input​ ​and​ ​triggers​ ​the​ ​action​ ​to​ ​perform​ ​the​ ​login.
4.​ ​After​ ​login,​ ​the​ ​game​ ​engine​ ​will​ ​move​ ​to​ ​the​ ​next​ ​action​ ​and​ ​notify​ ​the​ ​Game​ ​UI.
5.​ ​If​ ​the​ ​login​ ​is​ ​successful​ ​we​ ​will​ ​move​ ​to​ ​a​ ​connected​ ​state.
6.​ ​If​ ​the​ ​login​ ​has​ ​an​ ​error​ ​we​ ​will​ ​keep​ ​the​ ​user​ ​in​ ​an​ ​offline​ ​state.
Game​ ​records
Kubera uses IPFS to store and distribute game records in a decentralized manner, ensuring that no single user
is​ ​responsible​ ​for​ ​the​ ​integrity​ ​of​ ​the​ ​game​ ​data.
IPFS files are content addressed (meaning that their hash-based identification comes from the contents of the
file itself), any discrepancies between logs, that may have resulted from intentional or accidental changes, can
be​ ​easily​ ​found​ ​by​ ​our​ ​Game​ ​Security​ ​team.

VII.​ ​In-platform​ ​token
Kubera solution has its own tokens to let the whole system functions called Kubera token (KBR). Kubera
tokens are Ethereum-based assets which means they only function on Ethereum blockchain and it costs ETH
(built-in​ ​currency​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Ethereum​ ​blockchain)​ ​while​ ​using​ ​Kubera​ ​tokens.
As Kubera tokens run on one of the most stable and powerful blockchains in the world at the moment,
Ethereum​ ​Blockchain,​ ​investors​ ​or​ ​holders​ ​of​ ​Kubera​ ​token​ ​can​ ​benefit​ ​the​ ​following​ ​advantages:
-

-

Security and stability: as using Ethereum, one of the most robust Blockchain in the world, it is not
viable to attack the network nor hacking the whole system so Kubera holders will not have to worry of
losing​ ​funds​ ​from​ ​their​ ​wallets​ ​as​ ​long​ ​as​ ​they​ ​assure​ ​the​ ​access​ ​to​ ​the​ ​passphrase​ ​of​ ​the​ ​wallet.
Portability: Kubera token is created using the best practice with ERC20 protocol of Ethereum-based
tokens so it is supported by almost all exchanges. This also means that Kubera holders will find it is
trivial​ ​to​ ​keep​ ​track​ ​or​ ​trade​ ​Kubera​ ​tokens​ ​with​ ​other​ ​holders​ ​on​ ​various​ ​exchanges.

-

Transparency and immutability: every Kubera transactions will be stored publicly on Ethereum
blockchain so everyone can easily verify whether a transaction has actually happened and once it
happened,​ ​there​ ​is​ ​nothing​ ​that​ ​anyone​ ​can​ ​do​ ​to​ ​change​ ​or​ ​revert​ ​that​ ​transaction.

VIII.​ ​Token​ ​sale​ ​(ICO)​ ​terms
1. Token​ ​sale​ ​summary
Kubera ICO (Initial Coins Offering) is to be organized within 10 days from the beginning of November with a
stable rate of 19,000 KBR per 1 ETH. The ICO is expected to raise at maximum 110,526 ETH or 2,100,000,000
KBR to be sold. If the ICO fails to reach the minimum expectation of 13,684 ETH (~260,000,000 KBR to be
sold)​ ​when​ ​the​ ​time​ ​is​ ​up,​ ​all​ ​funds​ ​raised​ ​will​ ​then​ ​be​ ​returned​ ​to​ ​investors.
Even though, there are at maximum 2,100,000,000 KBR to be issued during the ICO, there will be an extra of
900,000,000 KBR to be distributed to the ICO owner (Kubera team by default) after the ICO ends and a
maximum of 105,000,000 KBR, equivalent to 5% of the total supply, as bonus for referrers. This means there
will​ ​be​ ​in​ ​total​ ​at​ ​maximum​ ​3,105,000,000​ ​KBR​ ​in​ ​circulation​ ​at​ ​a​ ​specific​ ​time.

2. How​ ​to​ ​participate​ ​in​ ​Kubera​ ​ICO?
In order to participate in the Kubera ICO, firstly, potential investors must register to our portal by following the
identity validation process of the platform. By applying the KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure, the Kubera
system can comply the AML (Anti Money Laundry) regulations. Secondly, only approved users with identity
validated will be able to send money into the ICO by using investment tools in the user portal. This means the
ICO contract is managed to accept investments from a list of certain people, those who are not tracked by the
system​ ​will​ ​not​ ​be​ ​able​ ​to​ ​arbitrarily​ ​send​ ​their​ ​ETH​ ​into​ ​the​ ​ICO​ ​contract​ ​and​ ​purchase​ ​KBR​ ​tokens.

IX. How will the funds collected from the
sale​ ​be​ ​used?
1. Overall
Platform​​ ​Development
The Kubera team has spent over 2 years developing games for the platform, and will need to continue to build
out our development team to create a fully functional platform, especially with the goal to make the system
fully​ ​decentralized​ ​with​ ​breakthrough​ ​features​ ​coming​ ​from​ ​smart​ ​contracts.
Kubera will hire developers to improve our P2P messaging backbone, create custom interfaces, write secure
and​ ​effective​ ​smart​ ​contracts,​ ​and​ ​implement​ ​storage​ ​functionality.
In addition, our team will integrate with ongoing Ethereum infrastructure projects including distributed storage,
and​ ​identity​ ​management.
Kubera will also re-skin our current applications and build out a user interface for our platform which meet
standards​ ​for​ ​a​ ​commercial​ ​quality​ ​front-end.
Marketing
Kubera will compete with market incumbents with large marketing budgets and sophisticated customer
acquisition​ ​processes.
We will dedicate significant marketing resources to guaranteed tournaments and freerolls, marketing
analytics​ ​software,​ ​and​ ​other​ ​paid​ ​marketing​ ​initiatives,​ ​including​ ​partnering​ ​with​ ​affiliates.
Sponsorships​ ​and​ ​Community​ ​Development
Kubera will sponsor popular gaming forums, websites, blogs, and events. In addition, our team will build a
vibrant​ ​community​ ​for​ ​our​ ​platform.
Legal
Our team has already begun consulting with well respected law firms and with regulators around the globe.
We plans to continue consulting with these resources as we navigate applicable legal and regulatory
frameworks. We also intend to pursue a gaming license prior to our launch to ensure our platform adheres to
compliance​ ​standards​ ​and​ ​our​ ​players​ ​are​ ​sufficiently​ ​protected.
Further​​ ​Development
The Kubera team is growing a core team and will use the proceeds from our sale to continue to develop our
team​ ​and​ ​the​ ​Kubera​ ​platform.
At the very first phase of the project, only racing games are selected in which require only player skills in order
to win the game. In order for our platform to be successful, in latter phases, we must also provide games of
luck and this is where smart contracts will come into play for the role of trustless middle-man. However, in
order to achieve this goal, the Kubera application must undergo significant testing to ensure the games are
sufficiently fair, the registration and identity verification method prevents low level multi-accounting and
underage gambling, and our data storage mechanism is able to track data points necessary for compliance
and​ ​to​ ​detect​ ​cheating.

Other services are under consideration for the team to implement with the goal to create the first and unique
ecosystem​ ​based​ ​on​ ​Blockchain​ ​and​ ​Ethereum-based​ ​tokens.
Improve​ ​P2P​ ​Messaging​ ​Backbone
The application uses runtime-swappable plugin implementations for different transports, and is currently
using a very basic HTTP-server-based message exploder. For deployment, Kubera will implement a more
industrial​ ​strength​ ​backbone.

2. Specific​ ​roadmap
- 01/2018:
Release​ ​open​ ​beta​ ​for​ ​games​ ​using​ ​KBR​ ​and​ ​wallet​ ​app
Multiplayers games and tournaments will be released for selected users around the world to play and test.
Kubera​ ​team​ ​will​ ​collect​ ​feedbacks​ ​from​ ​those​ ​players,​ ​conduct​ ​meetings​ ​and​ ​improve​ ​gaming​ ​UI/UX.
- 02/2018:
Integrate​ ​Kubera​ ​token​ ​in​ ​various​ ​cryptocurrency​ ​exchanges
One of the most crucial moves in order to make the project a successful one is to increase the visibility of
Kubera token on popular exchanges, hence increase the liquidity. A successful ICO can be considered as a
convincing​ ​factor​ ​while​ ​negotiating​ ​with​ ​exchanges​ ​to​ ​place​ ​our​ ​token​ ​in​ ​their​ ​system.
- 03/2018:
Public​ ​launch​ ​for​ ​games​ ​using​ ​KBR​ ​and​ ​wallet​ ​app​ ​on​ ​iOS,​ ​Android​ ​and​ ​Web
Official​ ​version​ ​of​ ​games​ ​in​ ​the​ ​first​ ​open​ ​beta​ ​vague​ ​should​ ​be​ ​ready​ ​after​ ​two​ ​months​ ​of​ ​improvement.
- 05/2018:
Release​ ​open​ ​beta​ ​for​ ​smart​ ​contracts​ ​games
At this phase, we will be releasing games which are based on luck and skills so this is where smart contracts
must involve to ensure the fairness and randomness of the game outcomes. There will be at least two games
to​ ​be​ ​launched​ ​for​ ​beta​ ​testing​ ​at​ ​this​ ​time:​ ​Rock-Paper-Scissors​ ​and​ ​Black​ ​Jack.
- 07/2018:
Public​ ​launch​ ​for​ ​smart​ ​contract​ ​games​ ​on​ ​iOS,​ ​Android​ ​and​ ​Web
As we need to make our games available to mobile OS such as iOS and Android, we will spend a lot of
resources for the testing process to make sure those games function well with smart contract features before
launching​ ​a​ ​public​ ​release.
- 10/2018:
Public​ ​first​ ​non-gaming​ ​services​ ​for​ ​Kubera​ ​ecosystem
Kubera team members, with not only software engineers but also economics experts, have been planning to
launch​ ​non-gaming​ ​services​ ​using​ ​Kubera​ ​tokens​ ​such​ ​as​ ​e-commerce,​ ​online​ ​shopping,​ ​lottery,​ ​etc.
- 11/2018:
Release​ ​open​ ​beta​ ​for​ ​VR​ ​games
As VR (Virtual Reality) has become so popular in the last few years, we firmly believe the Kubera platform
should follow the trend by developing VR games in order to be more competitive and stay relevant in the
market. The Kubera team already has engineers experienced in such domain and one year should be enough
for​ ​them​ ​to​ ​release​ ​interesting​ ​products​ ​for​ ​open​ ​beta.
- 01/2019:
Public​ ​launch​ ​for​ ​VR​ ​games
2 months after the open beta, a public release for those VR games is expected to be a highlight for the Kubera
platform​ ​to​ ​enforce​ ​its​ ​competition​ ​in​ ​the​ ​market.
