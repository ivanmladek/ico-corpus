INTRODUCTION

CARDbuyers is a new way to use crypto to buy your favorite games and
your favorite stuff safely using Amazon gift card, Steam card, Apple
card, Paysafe card or even Google play card. We are a new
decentralized and anonymous cryptocurrency. CARDbuyers
is open source and accessible to all currency. Our coin has

CARDbuyers.

CARDbuyers MISSION
Our mission is to provide our customers with the best working online shopping
platform, while accepting their privacy and their anonymity. To be able to do this,
we are integrating cryptocurrencies and a various number of gift cards as a payment
method. To maintain such a network, we have made the decision to have a
PoW/PoS/masternode coin. Having this masternode set-up allows us to offer our
clients a more stabile and faster working network, which will result in better
customer experience and a smoother cryptocurrency implementation.

INNOVATION
CARDbuyers is developing a new and innovating way to shop online. Therefore, we
will launch a beta version of our platform in the 4th quarter. The beta version will
then be completely examined with the help of our community and adjusted to their
needs. This will leave us with a state of the art online shopping platform.

GOAL AND PURPOSE
Our goal is to provide customers with a completely decentralized and anonymous
platform, where they are able to buy services and goods that fit their needs. This is
one of the reasons why we have chosen to accept a various number of gift cards as a
payment method next to CARDB coin. CARDbuyers will provide their customers
with an online platform where they are able to purchase their favorite games and
their favorite stuff.

START-UP PLAN
In todayâ€™s crypto market, turbulent as it is, we often struggle with the implementation of it.
This is why we have chosen to directly implement it on our CARDbuyers platform, to raise
more awareness and to reach more customers, we at CARDbuyers have decided to give
people the opportunity to buy at our store with gift cards. The beauty of this that it will
attract people who are unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies and give them the opportunity to
explore it. This way we are creating not only a platform which users can enjoy to shop, but
a platform which will bring more crypto awareness. Next to various marketing and
translation campaigns we will work strongly side by side with our community, which will
give as a view on the customers experience and an opportunity to optimize the
CARDbuyers experience for everybody.
