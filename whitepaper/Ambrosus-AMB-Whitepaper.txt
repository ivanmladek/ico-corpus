White Paper

Executive Summary
Origins of Ambrosus

I know that I am mortal and the creature of a day: but when I search out the
massed wheeling circles of the stars, my feet no longer touch the earth, but, side
by side with Zeus himself, I take my fill of ambrosia, the food of the gods...
– Ptolemy

The Ambrosus network is a blockchain-based ecosystem for supply
chains, ensuring the origin, quality, compliance and proper handling of
items tracked by the network. Ambrosus’ primary focus is on improving
supply chains for life-essential products, specifically food and medicine,
although the protocol can be applied to almost any complex supply chain.
By using distributed ledgers, data processing and sensor systems, the Ambrosus platform can integrate across supply chain flows and enable transparency at every point within them. These new capabilities allow buyers
and other participants in the supply chain to ensure that the standards of
their Quality Assurance programs are being met. Ambrosus also enables
the transmission of additional information between supply chain counterparties, as well as the creation of new applications and markets that utilize
the platform’s real-time data.
Ambrosus uses a novel incentive mechanism called the Amber token to
provide these functions in a decentralized manner. The Amber token is
used to keep information on the Ambrosus network up to date as products move across the supply chain without requiring a centralized actor
to maintain resources. This token enables a transparent ecosystem with
trustworthy data that can be freely accessed by interested parties.
This White Paper provides an overview of the Ambrosus platform, its architecture, and case studies. We have also created other guides that may be
of interest to those learning about the Ambrosus network. These guides
are available in English, Chinese (Mandarin), Russian, Arabic, Korean and
Japanese and are available online at: https://ambrosus.com/#tech-docs.

1. Introduction

Since the world began to globalize after the initial industrial
revolution, we have seen the rise of ever more complex supply
chains to manage the subsequent flow of raw materials and
goods around the planet[1].
These supply chains have been extremely successful, enabling
the explosion of manufacturing, trade and innovation around
the world that has been at the heart of globalization in the past
few decades. The technologies and methods used to run these
supply chains have not however kept pace with the growing
interconnectedness and complexity of our world. Supply chains
in many industries and sectors are creaking under the strain.
There are a host of challenges[1-2].
According to McKinsey, it has become a struggle for supply chain
stakeholders to maintain an adequate overview of their networks[1].
That has made it increasingly difficult to ensure the quality and
integrity of raw materials and finished products along the chain,
fight contamination and counterfeiting, handle distribution, and
maintain functioning and efficient logistics operations[3].
Highly complex chains with higher numbers of actors also create
increasing opportunities for fraud, negligence, or other threats.
Complexity also reduces transparency, making it more difficult to
locate problems in a timely manner[1].
On the commercial side, today's global supply chains are
riddled with archaic, slow and expensive processes that create
significant friction along the chain and often make life difficult
for participants, especially smaller producers or distributors. Even
in the best of cases highly complex supply chains with multiple
stakeholders imply intricate commercial relationships requiring
complex governance structures that are increasingly difficult to
manage using current practices[1].

5

At the same time, end consumers are demanding ever-higher
levels of transparency about the origins of their products, as well
as more personalization. This puts increased pressure on supply
chains to innovate just when they are struggling to keep up with
the status quo[1-3].
Many have – rightly – sounded the alarm, and are searching for
new solutions.

1.1. A Data-Centric Solution
At its core, the solution to improving global supply chains
revolves around handling data. Until now, it has been difficult to
gather accurate data about the state and integrity of materials
and products along the whole supply chain. Even where data is
available, it is challenging to collect it, aggregate it, disseminate it
and, above all, ensure its accuracy and integrity.
New technological developments are poised to change this.
These developments, which in particular include advances in
sensor technology and the Internet of Things coupled with
the capabilities of blockchain technology, smart contracts and
decentralized applications (dApps), allow us to boldly rethink
how global supply chains and markets might operate.
We envision a system of interconnected quality assurance
sensors that can reliably record the entire history of a product[4].
A blockchain can then protect the integrity and verifiability of
this sensor data. Finally, smart contracts can provide automated
governance of supply chains and manage commercial
relationships between actors along them[5-6].

1.2. The Ambrosus Project
Ambrosus is an ambitious project dedicated to making the vision
we have described a reality. The project is made up of some of
the world's leading experts and pioneers in the areas of sensor
technology, data encryption, supply chains, blockchain, smart
contracts and dApps, among others (see Team below).
Our team’s mission is to create useful solutions for supply
chains that enhance their quality, integrity and transparency,
thus improving the quality and integrity of the products we all
consume.
We believe this vision can be best achieved through selfgoverned, quality-focused networks to track products across
relevant supply chains. These would be true ecosystems based
on an open platform enabled by blockchain technology, with no
centralized owner. The Ambrosus protocol is being developed to
expressly allow the creation of such ecosystems.

1.3. Ambrosus Technology
Ambrosus is an end-to-end integrated solution that includes
hardware, software, a protocol layer and developer tools.
The Ambrosus protocol and the software layer on top of it are
built on the Ethereum blockchain as well as other distributed
technologies that allow information from IoT devices to be
recorded onto a decentralized network. We are also building a
developer toolkit to facilitate the creation of apps on top of the
network. This includes an open API tailored to the needs of food
and pharmaceutical supply chain participants, one that is flexible
enough to use with any type of commodity or consumer good.
A JavaScript interface to Ambrosus sits on top of the blockchain
layer, permitting users to develop to our platform without any
blockchain programming knowledge.

7

To demonstrate how this can work, we have built a functioning
prototype of an ecosystem that showcases the protocol’s ability to
collect information from IoT devices and record it on immutable
decentralized databases. At the time of writing, we have released
demo applications built on top of the current implementation of
the protocol. These are publicly available online.
At the same time, the Ambrosus team is developing hardware
sensors that feature plug-and-play compatibility with our
blockchain network. The hardware products we have built to
date include a range of non-invasive and rapid analytical devices
for on-site measurement of biological samples. We are in the
process of assembling IoT sensors around containers and printers
to transform passive supply chain components into smart and
intelligent systems.
Our development pipeline includes personalized tag methods as
well as food grade tracers and biosensors to transform passive
packaging solutions into smart conveying systems. These
products connect to our blockchain through different gateways
customized for different use cases.
Future iterations of our system will include ready-made and
reusable connectors to rapidly share supply chain information
with existing information services such as SAP or Oracle and
which leverage GS1 standards such as EPCIS (Electronic Product
Code Information Services)[7].

1.4. The Amber Token
The heart of the Ambrosus network is the Amber token, an
ERC-20 compliant token that underpins all transactions on the
Ambrosus network.
Amber is the world's first data-bonded token. It is used to bind
continuously updated and verified logistical, environmental
and biological data from the supply chain to its corresponding
product as it travels between counterparties. It is also used to
carry out transfers of value within the ecosystem. As such, the
token performs both the utility and transfer of value functions
within the ecosystem of applications built on top of Ambrosus
protocol.

1.5. White Paper
In our view, Ambrosus is the most advanced project to date to
tackle the complex and often life-essential challenges posed by
today's global supply chains.
In the following chapters, we examine the Ambrosus protocol
and the technologies being developed around the project. It is our
hope that, with Ambrosus, we are creating tools that will enable
all those involved in supply chains to meet industry challenges
and create a new generation of trusted supply chains to meet the
world's life-essential needs.

2. Ambrosus
Protocol

2.1. Overview
In the following chapter, we describe key components of the
Ambrosus protocol as well as important details relating to its
structure and implementation.

2.1.1. Protocol Components
The Ambrosus protocol is constructed from three main
components:
• Measurements Repository: Built around the Measurements
Smart Contract, this component manages a distributed
dataset for product-specific measurements that is built on top
of a programmable blockchain (Ethereum) and distributed file
system (IPFS). This smart contract is used to store readings
of specified attributes collected for a given batch at specified
points along a supply chain. Some of the properties of this
smart contract include:
◦◦ Authentication: The data source is authenticated and can
be cryptographically verified.
◦◦ Transparency: The collected data is publicly available to
any interested party.
◦◦ Immutability: The collected data is secured against
changes or deletion.
◦◦ Capacity: The system is capable of storing large quantities
of small data packages.
◦◦ Requirements Smart Contract: This enshrines the quality
requirements to be compared with the content of
Measurements Smart Contract. Some of the ways welldefined requirements can be used and reused include:
◦◦ Monitoring: Users can verify that the quality of a particular
batch of products fulfills pre-defined requirements.
◦◦ Agreements: Multiple parties can automatically execute
terms of agreements by comparing the content of the
Measurements Smart Contract against the definition in the
Requirements Smart Contract. This includes automatic
payments settlement on the blockchain.

11

• Amber token: The data-bonded token architecture intrinsically
ties data to AMB transactions on the blockchain, connecting
chains together as products move through the supply chain.
Together, these components form the foundation of the
Ambrosus protocol.

2.1.2. System Architecture
The Ambrosus protocol is built to support high data loads
from hardware devices and network participants with
substantially higher capacity than standard Ethereum software
implementations. The platform’s architecture is designed to
be reusable in different industries, even those outside of the
Ambrosus core team’s focus. We discuss our system architecture
in detail at the end of this chapter.

2.2. Measurements Repository
The Measurements Repository component of the Ambrosus
protocol manages a distributed database for product-specific
measurements. It is used to store readings of specified attributes
collected for a given item at specified points along a supply
chain. Key properties of the Measurement Repository include
authentication, capacity, transparency and immutability. We will
discuss first two in the following sections. The latter two properties
will be a natural consequence of overall design.

2.2.1. Authentication
The Ambrosus network authenticates devices using publicprivate key cryptography. Each device on the network signs data
transmissions with its unique private key in order to prove its
identity as an authorised device. Signatures from devices can be
verified against a list of authorised devices, which is a mapping of
public keys to devices that is publicly available in a smart contract.
The Measurements Smart Contract includes a defined list of
authorized measurement devices. Ambrosus-certified devices

12

can be added to the list through the Ambrosus platform. In future
implementations of the Ambrosus network, we plan to introduce
an open market for device manufacturers with associated
reputation systems.
When an authorised device sends a message to the Ambrosus
network, its public key is compared to the Authentication list for
verification. Once verified, the message is accepted and recorded
onto the blockchain.
If a non-authorised device sends a measurement, the signature
verification fails and the measurement is simply ignored.
The diagram below demonstrates a data transmission from a
measurement device to a customer device that is authorised on
the Ambrosus network.

Illustration of a data reading on the Ambrosus network

2.2.2. Capacity
Although a single measurement is typically less than 100 bytes,
the system is designed to collect potentially thousands of
measurements per batch, and a batch may include data from
multiple devices. Thus, in the long term, the Ambrosus network
will need to handle terabytes of data daily.

13

To achieve this network capacity, Ambrosus has created a custom
blockchain that integrates with the Ethereum blockchain and a
distributed storage system.
In our early design of Ambrosus, we found that relying exclusively
on the Ethereum blockchain for data storage was prohibitively
limited in its capacity to handle Ambrosus’ full data needs. The
dual architecture that Ambrosus has created provides a scalable
solution to the network’s data capacity while maintaining
decentralization, immutability and transparency.
New measurement data is stored as leaves in a Merkle tree. The
Measurements tree nodes are then mapped to IPFS nodes. A
Merkle tree is a structure that allows any party to quickly verify
the validity of data in a branch or leaf using the root hash of
the tree. In the Ambrosus network, this allows any network
participant to quickly verify that a particular measurement is
part of the given Measurements Repository. The root of the
Merkle Tree is permanently stored in the Ambrosus network’s
Measurements Smart Contract. Every new measurement added
to the Measurements Smart Contract creates a new version of
the Merkle Tree with a new root, which can then be stored in the
Measurements Smart Contract.
To retain a scalable system structure, Ambrosus chooses not to
save a new root of the tree every time the tree changes (i.e., when
a new measurement comes in). This would mean writing to the
blockchain whenever new data arrives. Instead, the root of the
tree is updated in the smart contract periodically (e.g., once every
100 readings).
Storing the Merkle tree root on the blockchain ensures the data
cannot be modified once it is written into a contract. Ambrosus
also maintains the entire history of all Merkle roots to ensure
that no data has vanished or been altered between Merkle tree
updates.

2.3 Requirements Smart Contract
The second component of the Ambrosus protocol is the
Requirements Smart Contract. This portion of the protocol is used
to define quality standards that can be directly compared to items
in the Measurements Smart Contract. It is important that users
create a set of well-defined, designed and tested Requirements
contracts which are publically available on the blockchain. The
requirements defined by users will be critical to applications
monitoring items in the ecosystem.
In its simplest expression, the Requirements Smart Contract
determines whether a product continuously meets standards
defined by an interested participant in the Ambrosus network. For
instance, a party may define distribution requirements to ensure
food or pharmaceutical products remain safe for consumption.
However, the concept of consumption is relative and depends
on the product’s purpose. For instance, a product might need to
meet different requirements for:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Consumption by humans
Consumption by babies
Consumption by animals
Consumption by people with allergies
Consumption by patients with certain conditions
Instant consumption or future consumption
Further processing (of different types).

For food products, Ambrosus can go further and define the
various levels of quality for a particular product (e.g., low/mid/
high/premium quality).
From a technical perspective, Requirements are lists of statements
based on the readings from sensing devices. We can define a
list of measurement ranges that are acceptable to an example

16

company in the food industry. The following is an illustrative list
of Requirements for a batch of milk, defining a set of the following
ranges:
• Temperature [4°C to 7°C],
• Fat [3.18% to 3.22%],
• Lactose [2% to 4%].
Similarly, monitoring systems in the pharmaceutical industry may
define the following Requirements for frozen vaccine storage:
• Temperature [-25°C to -10°C],
• Humidity [2 to 3%],
• No direct sunlight or fluorescent light.
Requirements may be described using different quantifiable
variables: range, binary (true/false) statements with information
supplied by specific devices, or input from a human inspector (with
the appropriate device and his own private key and reputation).
Complex statements are also permitted (e.g., the temperature
must be in the range [0°C to 10°C] for no longer than 10 minutes
and [4°C to 7°C] thereafter). An alternative complex statement
may define measurement timing (e.g., at least one temperature
measurement must be taken every 10 minutes). These complex
statements may also be coupled with instant financial rewards or
penalties for assuring or failing to assure high quality, respectively.
We expect more advanced Requirements to use statistical
analysis and machine learning to detect irregularities and support
automated decision-making and real-time auditing. Those
algorithms can be coded as Ethereum contracts or performed
off-chain and verified on Ethereum.
As Requirements are sets of smart contracts working together
and delivering from each other, in terms of object-oriented
programming, Requirements can be viewed as a composite
design pattern.
The diagram below provides a detailed overview of how
Requirements are structured.

2.4. Amber Token
Supporting the Ambrosus network is an ERC-20 compliant token called Amber. Amber is the first data-bonded token. As items
move through the supply chain and are transformed in the manufacturing process, the Amber balance assigned to a particular
batch can be split and merged into multiple other Measurements
Smart Contracts, which together create a graph representing the
history of a given item. Amber tokens are sent to the network
alongside readings and remain locked in the Measurements Smart
Contract until a batch has completed its movement through the
supply chain.
Amber tokens remain bonded to a product until a defined expiration date or until the “termination event”, which can be defined
by a purchase, delivery or any other event on the supply chain.
End consumers can claim tokens at the end of the cycle. In this
way, tokens can be recycled and return to the ecosystem. The
value gained by recycling tokens incentivizes consumers to purchase Ambrosus-tracked products. This cycle also benefits producers, who receive free promotion.

2.5. Optimizing Network Costs
To bolster adoption of Ambrosus, it is important to optimize the
costs of using the network. Each individual supply chain uses
unique transactions and contract deployments on the Ethereum
network to handle data as items move through the chain. Running transactions on the Ethereum blockchain has become fairly
expensive, and our custom blockchain implementation solves
this issue.
Instead of the main Ethereum network, the main transactional
network used by Ambrosus is the Ambrosus blockchain, a private
version of the Ethereum blockchain. Note that the term “private”
is potentially misleading here, as the network is public and can
be accessed by anyone. The term is only used in this context to
distinguish the Ambrosus blockchain from the Ethereum main
network. All smart contracts related to the Ambrosus protocol
will run on the Ambrosus blockchain, which will be periodically
copied to the Ethereum main network for further validation.
While the Amber token crowdsale will initially take place on the
Ethereum blockchain, Amber tokens will be transferred to the
Ambrosus network once the construction of the Ambrosus
blockchain is complete.

2.6. Architecture
2.6.1. Layered architecture
At the lowest level, Ambrosus is a set of core Ethereum smart
contracts (including but not limited to the Measurements and
Requirements Smart Contracts introduced in the previous sections). These serve as core business logic of Ambrosus and support data storage.

20

A JavaScript library sits above our contract layer. The JavaScript layer exposes the Ambrosus protocol interface to application developers. It abstracts the details related to particular implementation choices (e.g., we
currently use Ethereum as a blockchain and IPFS as a distributed storage).
This layer is also used to run software that does not need to be distributed
and/or is expensive to implement as a smart contract, such as offline measurement verification. On-chain and off-chain operations are combined
here into a single consistent interface.
The top layer of Ambrosus consists of a React Component library. It provides UI components for building applications on top of Ambrosus network. This layer can be accessed by any web browser and connects to the
JavaScript layer.

2.6.2. Data Architecture
Ambrosus uses an additional three-layer architecture for storing data:
1. The first layer is a library used to store large quantities of small data with
blockchain and distributed file systems. This layer can store collections
of individual data in a transparent, persistent and immutable manner.
Core concepts here are signed data and Merkle trees.
2. The second layer is dedicated to supply chains. It employs concepts
such as Measurements and Requirements Smart Contracts.
3. The top layer is Ambrosus.js, a protocol dedicated to food and pharmaceutical supply chains, with specific types of measurements and requirements related to those industries.
An overall technical overview of Ambrosus’ architecture protocol along
with the key dependencies is given below. We also provide a sample application to demonstrate how it interacts with Ambrosus.

21

Dependency diagram for an application using Ambrosus

Depending on the needs of a particular project, developers can
use some or all of the features of our JavaScript and React libraries and/or the Measurements and Requirements Smart Contracts.

3. Supply Chain
Data

The previous section focused on the software components of
Ambrosus. This section describes how data originates on devices
and its journey to Ambrosus’ software.

3.1. Tag, Tracer and Sensor Systems
A key attribute of the Ambrosus network is its comprehensive
support for IoT hardware and sensors, which provides the ability
to tag and monitor physical objects and transmit data associated
with them. This compatibility allows goods to be tracked
throughout the supply chain and assures full integrity of readings.
The Ambrosus network primarily collects data from tags, tracers
and sensors.
A tag is an element set on the product itself, generally on top
of the packaging, that provides information about the product
and its identity. 1D/2D barcodes and passive electronic RFID
stickers are examples of common tagging systems. A tracer
is a natural compositional feature of a product or an added
component inserted into a product, while a sensor is a device
that detects and responds to some type of input from the
physical environment. Sensors characterize the product and/
or its environmental physico-chemical properties. A tracer
will remain stable throughout its entire supply chain journey,
whereas the correct sensor solution would need to be designed
for each counterparty on the supply chain and will likely require
more upfront investment and knowledge of product properties.
Tracers are the ideal solution to track and trace products. When
implemented in a supply chain, sensor solutions assess quality,
safety and logistical conditions.

24

3.2. Detection Systems
Specific detection systems are selected and deployed by
Ambrosus at various stages in the supply chain to offer the most
effective and cost-efficient assessment of each product at each
stage. A product’s physio-chemical structure, composition and
quality attributes may vary throughout the supply chain and must
be continuously assessed to verify conformity with standards set
by participants in the network.
There are several types of sensor systems that can be used to
detect a product’s physical state. Analytical systems are based
on physical methods of analysis, including optical, electrical,
acoustical and nuclear techniques. Biosensors and chemical
sensors are further types of analytical systems which may be used
to detect pH levels, allergens and other types of physical properties.
Where appropriate, further methods such as immunological and
enzymatic techniques or DNA and protein assays are also used to
assess food. Environmental attributes such as temperature, light
exposure, humidity, movement and oxygen are also recorded.
Hardware devices provide a platform to automate the input of
data into a system and create a trusted basis of data input.

3.3. Data Transmission
When information is transmitted from a device to the Ambrosus
network, the data is bonded to an Amber token and sent to
the network. Common information that may be sent in a data
transmission includes:
1. Tag IDs, location and time, tracer, sensors and gateway IDs;
2. Digitized certificates and transaction IDs;
3. Product quality and safety attributes;
4. Transportation, handling and storage conditions as measured
by sensors;
5. Producer operability, capability and workability;
6. Integrity of detection systems;

25

An Amber token follows a product or batch along the supply
chain, acting as a digital certificate that ensures the transparent
transfer of information. All prior information can be retrieved at
any supply chain stage.
The diagram below shows how data is transmitted across the
Ambrosus network.

Ambrosus technology architecture

26

The data from the detection system is encoded and encrypted
at the sensor level using hardware cryptography technology.
The encrypted content is then sent to the edge gateway over
various local communication interfaces such as BLE, NFC or
RFID technologies, depending on the specific limitations of a
particular implementation (e.g., bandwidth, cost or distance).
The bundle is then decrypted by the edge gateway, which has
low power processing capabilities to analyse basic rules and
will only forward product information required by the network.
The edge gateway is a device composed of a microcontroller
with the ability to collect, aggregate and select data from various
devices, before performing basic analysis to transmit only the
necessary data downstream to another edge gateway or the
internal gateway. In many cases, the edge gateway will need
to be powered by batteries or energy harvesting and be able
to operate continuously for several weeks or months to enable
mobile solutions.
Thus, some logic can be embedded and distributed through
the edge gateways and even through sensors that have this
feature. The overall architecture can be adapted by developers
according to the specifications of each product, supply chain
and application.

APPENDIX

I. Case Studies
1. Initial Market Tests
Ambrosus is already actively working with industry partners
to study various potential uses of the protocol. The list below
contains market-fit studies we are currently running. Detailed
documentation on our studies and the output of the pilot projects
are regularly published in separate documents, which can be
accessed at https://ambrosus.com/#tech-docs.
We are actively testing different solutions with industry partners.
These solutions include:
•
•
•
•
•

Traceability of various raw materials
Brand protection for premium products
Deploying a real-time compliance auditing system
Monitoring correct delivery conditions for frozen goods
Recording factory manufacturing procedures for audit
traceability
• Secured data transmission and management for clinical trials
• Quality checker app for premium products originating from
China

2. Food Industry: Compliance and Auditing
The food industry is dogged by regular scandals, the latest
being the egg scandal in Europe, where consumers suffered
from fraudulent practices involving fresh eggs contaminated by
pesticides[8]. Mishandling and fraudulent processes are almost
always eventually discovered, but by the time they are brought to
public attention, the damage is done. Consumers have already
bought, and likely consumed, the product, leading to potential
health issues, loss of confidence, recalls, and other penalties.
These problems stem from a lack of auditing. Companies are
audited far too rarely, and the auditing process itself is time
consuming and inefficient.

30

Blockchain has the potential to transform many business
processes, making the data used in those processes more
available, transparent, immediate and secure. The immutability,
immediacy and transparency of information captured within
the Ambrosus blockchain means that all necessary data can be
recorded on the Ambrosus network and made available in near
real time. In such a world, stakeholders are no longer simple
recipients of post-hoc reports; they instead become part of a
real-time process.
By applying blockchain technology to the food supply chain,
Ambrosus is disrupting the whole food auditing process. One
of the most exciting features of blockchain from a compliance
perspective its practical immutability: as soon as data is saved
onto the blockchain, it cannot be changed or deleted. This
feature makes blockchain technology ideal for automated
and transparent operations, allowing companies to meet their
regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost-effective way.
In practice, digital smart tracers on a product will be connected
to the Ambrosus network. As the product moves along the supply
chain and passes different stages and sensors, Amber tokens
will be sent and follow it, recording actions and their outputs
immutably onto the blockchain. This creates an audit trail for
regulatory bodies or government agencies to verify compliance,
with all the information they require readily available in near real
time.
This information is clearly valuable to businesses too. With
its near real-time data, Ambrosus can support the greater
automation of supply chain processes. This has an impact on
the ongoing management of a supply chain, which can use on
these automated process to make the work of businesses and
government agencies easier at a fraction of the current cost.

31

The Ambrosus solution offers regulators direct access to the
supply chain, allowing them to continuously monitor products
and assure compliance with the most stringent laws and
regulations. By relying on trustworthy, up-to-date data recorded
on a blockchain, both businesses and governments can restore
consumers’ trust in the system.

3. Healthcare Industry: Data Information
Management
The healthcare industry has been trying for a while now to
encourage patients to take a more active role in managing
their own care by self-administering medicines[9] which are
usually taken at hospitals or bought in a pharmacy. Delivering
personalized prescriptions to patients’ homes would free up
much-needed capacity elsewhere in the system and is thus an
important challenge for the pharmaceutical industry.
But migrating from a system in which care is provided in a
relatively small number of hospitals, clinics and surgeries to
one in which care is provided through a widespread network
of nurses and community carers has enormous ramifications.
Pharma companies will need to distribute products to many
more locations, including patients’ homes. It will have to be
able to deliver new therapies requiring rapid and constraining
shipping solutions, especially to emerging markets, with better
risk management and in compliance with more stringent quality
requirements. The pharmaceutical industry will therefore have
to harness the most efficient ‘final mile’ distribution networks in
order to deliver medicines as economically as possible.
The immediate challenge is for healthcare to change its
business model to a consumer-centric one, with a demanddriven supply chain. The key to preventing such a supply chain
from becoming too fragmented and complex is seamless
bidirectional management of information between patients and
pharmaceutical companies. Information about patients and the
medicines they need will thus be as important as the products
themselves.

Ambrosus is designed for long and complex supply chains. For the
healthcare industry, the Ambrosus protocol can connect digital
smart tracers to medical products, with Amber tokens serving
to connect the medical product and the sensor-generated
data about it. As a product moves through the supply chain and
passes along different stages and sensors, Amber tokens follow it
persistently. This creates the highest assurance of traceability and
compliance for all ingredients and components of drugs, while at
the same time monitoring proper handling conditions for them. If
necessary, the solution can even be tailored to the personal needs
of individual patients. Any parameters can be encoded through
the smart contracts which power the Ambrosus protocol.
The Ambrosus protocol acts as the backbone for the information
platforms needed by logistics systems to record and exchange
data securely and economically with suppliers around the world,
to recall and analyse data very rapidly and to respond to sudden
changes in supply and demand. The protocol is complemented
by Ambrosus tracers and sensor systems that assure advanced
tracking capabilities, which enable logistics systems to monitor
products from the factory gate to the patient’s door efficiently
and securely, eliminating any scope for human error.
Amber tokens are tied to data for a specific product, from
components of a medicine to logistics, and to the patients
themselves. This information is directly bound to the physical
product. The patient can thus use the Amber attached to their
drug to extract all the information they need before taking the
medicine. Ambrosus provides this functionality via a simple and
intuitive user interface. Amber can thus act as a digital certificate
attesting to product compliance, guaranteeing that the entire
process and shipment procedures were carried out properly
and following high standards. This will avoid manipulation and
process failure and protect patients’ health.
In short, Ambrosus offers an integrated supply chain solution
dedicated to solving the challenges faced by the pharmaceutical
industry of today and tomorrow.

II. Current State and Future Work
At the time of writing, we have implemented a prototype of a
protocol along with example apps which use the protocol.

1. Prototype
The screenshot below is from an application using the protocol.
The app provides a distributed marketplace for food, where parties
can agree on the quality of food delivered. Quality is measured
and stored on distributed storage. An escrow allows agreement
to be automatically settled based on sensor readings, allowing
the creation of quality-conditional contracts.
A demo is available at: ambrosus-demo.com.

2. Protocol
The current state of the Ambrosus protocol is available on our
Github page (https://github.com/ambrosus).
