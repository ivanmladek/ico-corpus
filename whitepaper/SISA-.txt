ABSTRACT
Strategic Investments in
Signiﬁcant Areas (SISA) is a
pla9orm built on a unique
business model which enables
individual investors to
parAcipate in a pooled fund to
make strategic investments in
interesAng new projects in
diversiﬁed ﬁelds.

The primary objecAve of every
investor is proﬁt making, yet
individually they all have
certain limitaAons in terms of
fund arrangements, idenAfying
a potenAal project so on and
so forth. But choosing a
pooled fund provides many
beneﬁts, speciﬁcally, pooled
funds enable investors to
invest in stocks and projects

they normally may not have
access to due to capital
requirements while also
maintaining liquidity and
diversity. Furthermore,
invesAng in block chain related
projects is even more
challenging due to the ever
present risk of scams and
hacks as well as a steep
technical barrier to entry.

We aim to mi6gate these issues with a revolu6onary new plaBorm, A Democra6c Pool Fund
(DPF). Through this unique investment vehicle, token holders gain all the beneﬁts of a pooled
fund:

Liquidity

Diversity

Professional assistance in
investment decisions

Scale

Capital allocaAon

But the major add-on to our pla9orm is the introducAon of voAng rights and they play a pivotal
role in investment decisions and fund allocaAon. Through this pla9orm investors have the right
to vote and choose which projects receive funding. This, we believe, creates a sense of
authority and ownership among the investors.
The cryptocurrency market has showed great capacity to raise funds and drive capital towards
revoluAonary, next-generaAon protocols and technologies. However, we strongly believe that
the market has not been used to its fullest potenAal.

INTRODUCTION
At SISA, our mission is to oﬀer a
distributed pooled investment
vehicle with a low barrier to entry
and a decentralized, democraAc
management mechanism. By
uAlizing the Ethereum blockchain,
we will issue ERC20 compliant
tokens to every investor in order
to guarantee safe payout and
distribuAon of the fund’s proﬁts.
SISA is not only a pla9orm for
raising funds for a pooled
investment, but also a pla9orm
for pitching, veWng, and selecAng
new, innovaAve ideas. In this way,
we can bring investors and
investment seekers together to
collaborate via a common
pla9orm.
The SISA pla9orm includes a
voAng system available to all
token owners who will have

voAng rights equal to their
ownership stake. Each new
project will be proposed to the
token holders. Whether or not
the fund invests in the project is
enArely determined by the voAng
of the SISA holders. This system
sets the bar for crypto-fund
transparency policies and allows
SISA token holders to exercise
their authority in selecAng which
projects will receive investment.
SISA also will provide research
and analysis services to its token
holders, employing top experts in
any given ﬁeld to review the
prospects of each proposal. This
analysis will be made available to
the token holders as they make
their decision.
We aim to create a robust debate
and informaAon-based decision-

3

making mechanisms while
keeping the decentralized nature
of the project intact.
SISA will invest in blockchainrelated projects as well as making
strategic investments in
tradiAonal businesses around the
world. The SISA team recognizes
major funding gaps for
infrastructure projects in
emerging economies such as
India and China. Both are
currently planning major
infrastructure projects in need of
short-, medium- and long-term
investments. For example, China
is rebuilding the silk route, which
itself is a mulAbillion dollar
project. India is building smart
ciAes, huge hydro power projects,
solar power plants, and much
more in the near future.

VISION
At SISA, our vision is to disintermediate access to sophisAcated investment pla9orms
previously reserved for the ultra wealthy and the well connected. By democraAzing our pool
fund, we can oﬀer a previously unaaainable level of service, diversiﬁcaAon, and transparency in
wealth management to the casual investor. At the heart of our mission is the aim to use
decentralized blockchain technology to distribute the tools and informaAon necessary to allow
the individual to compete with the resources and scale of major ﬁnancial insAtuAons, thus
eliminaAng the market advantage provided to them by a system of gatekeepers and
intermediaries. UlAmately, we envision a future of ﬁnancial markets driven by liquidity of
informaAon and the agency and autonomy of the individual investor.

Strategic Investments in Significant Areas

THE BLOCKCHAIN
The blockchain is the cornerstone of the SISA project. It provides
the foundaAon for many of the primary innovaAons in ﬁnancial
technology that will allow us to disintermediate access to
sophisAcated wealth management. The blockchain not only
allows our team to issue cryptographically secure shares in a pool
fund, but also allows us to eliminate any barrier to entry for the
small-Ame investor. The blockchain allows us to eliminate
several costs that would be associated with accepAng
investment in a pooled fund as well as issuing a dividend. SISA
will be able to execute on an alpha strategy and distribute
returns from said strategy to the investor regardless of
capital requirements. Whether an investor has 0.001 ether
or 100 Ether, our DemocraAzed Pool Fund gives them equal
access and proporAonal agency over the capital allocaAon.

Cryptographically secure
shares in a pool fund

Further, the blockchain allows us to set the standard for
radical transparency. By issuing tokens through an ICO, we
give each investor access to a full log of capital ﬂows from
our fund as well as the valuaAon of any given token and
dividends paid. This transparency gives the investor the full
suite of informaAon needed to decide whether or not they
want to join the fund. Once investors are members of SISA,
the blockchain will provide an uncensorable authenAcaAon
mechanism for access to SISA’s provided markets and
prospectus analysis.

Eliminate any barrier to
entry for the small-time
investor

Finally, the blockchain allows SISA to provide all the beneﬁts of a
pooled fund while maintaining investor agency in investment
decision through our DemocraAc Pooled Fund. By using the
blockchain to aggregate funds, investors are able to ensure that
funds are used properly and that all the fund’s transacAons
remain transparent. This allows investors to parAcipate in
investment opportuniAes that require a scale much larger than an
individual may be able to achieve while maintaining the ability to
direct capital allocaAon decisions through a provably fair
blockchain-based voAng mechanism.

SISA TOKEN
ERC20
TOKEN

SISA will issue an
ERC20 token to all
investors.
The token represents a propor6onal share of
the total fund.

This token will provide the holder the right to
claim their share of the fund’s quarterly
dividends, as well as enabling them to par6cipate
in vo6ng and proposing projects.

Addi6onally, the tokens provide investors with
access to the analysis and research for proposed
projects provided by SISA’s analysts.

SISA TOKEN
The SISA token will be minted with a ﬁxed supply of

50 million tokens
each divisible to 18 decimal places.
The token’s smart contract interface will expose a
funcAon allowing the holder to withdraw their share of
the fund’s quarterly dividends from a dedicated smart
contract.

SISA investments will be auditable via blockchain technology.
By providing watch-only API keys on various trading
pla9orms, we will be able to provide investors a simple
pla9orm for monitoring investments and performance.
addiAonally capital allocated to various cryptocurrencies
will be auditable via simple blockchain address look-ups.
TradiAonal ﬁnancial investments will have their
documents notarized using a crypto-notary
implementaAon, then uploaded to IPFS for distributed
transparency.

INITIAL COIN OFFERING
(ICO)
The SISA token will be distributed through an iniAal coin oﬀering (ICO) on the Ethereum
blockchain. SISA’s iniAal token distribuAon will allocate 7.5 million SISA tokens to be
sold during an ICO presale while 32.5 million will be oﬀered during the ICO itself. Seven
million tokens will be reserved by the fund’s management team to facilitate
development and cover research and analysis expenses while another 3 million will be
set aside for community bounAes.

The ICO will be implemented via a smart contract on the Ethereum network.
This contract will ensure that all limits, bonuses, and requirements are hard
coded into the ICO’s plaBorm, allowing users to simply contribute Ether and
automa6cally receive SISA tokens. At the conclusion of the crowdsale, any
tokens yet to be sold will be burned.

DIVIDENDS AND
REDEMPTIONS
Each token en6tles the holder to redeem a propor6onal share of the proﬁts
generated by the fund during that quarter. The fund will begin paying
dividends every quarter star6ng from Q1 2018. Dividend payouts will be
structure as follows:

70%
of quarterly proﬁts will be paid
out as a dividend

20%
will be reinvested in order to grow the funds capital

10%

will be allocated to a reserve fund that acts as a ﬂoor for investor capital

DIVIDENDS AND
REDEMPTIONS
Strategic Investments in Significant Areas

In the event of a quarterly loss, the dividends func6on will remain
inac6ve. During a window of 6me at the end of each quarter, Q1
Jan 2018, token holders will be able to withdraw their dividends
using a speciﬁc func6on revealed in the token smart contracts
interface.

For example, if the fund returns a
quarterly proﬁt of 1000 Ether, 200
Ether will be reinvested to grow the
capital pool and take advantage of
larger investment opportuni6es while
100 Ether will be placed in a reserves
fund to act as a ﬂoor for investors
token value. The other 700 Ether will
be available for withdrawal as a
dividend to the token holder. So, an
investor holding 1% of the total SISA
tokens will be able to withdraw 7
Ether from the dividend smart
contract.

METHODOLOGY
As block chain futurists we are in a perpetual search to ﬁnd new areas for block chain
adopAon, not just online but throughout our global economy. We have already recruited
a team of world leading corporate personnel, literaA and tech developers to build
revoluAonary business process management sogware based enArely on block chain
technology.
SISA operates as a unique, closed-end fund in that it gives autonomy and agency to its
investors by allowing them to pitch and vote on various proposals. This allows the
investors to act as allocators of their own capital through a pooled investment vehicle.
The SISA management team’s primary objecAve will be to ensure and maintain
transparency, decentralizaAon, and informaAon.
SISA’s analysis team will be focused on idenAfying and ﬁltering business opportuniAes
on the back end. Projects that fulﬁll certain criteria will be presented for voAng along
with a complete analysis of the associated risks and beneﬁts.

SISA will look to idenAfy investments that clearly display an opportunity for conAnual
growth as well as a well-deﬁned and sizable target market. The project should be able to
display a sizable market need for its soluAon. Other important factors will be used to
determine the viability of a parAcular investment, such as the amount of capital required
to achieve scale and whether or not the project has a notable advantage over its
compeAAon. SISA will also look towards qualitaAve factors when veWng a project’s
team. A potenAal partner should display a willingness to incorporate and entertain ideas
from market parAcipants, including customers and investors, while also acAng decisively
in execuAon of its business plan. SISA should see that the project has gathered a
dedicated, uniﬁed team capable of implemenAng the projects vision.

16

Strategic Investments in Significant Areas

Once SISA has fully veaed and researched a given project or
industry, a full report will be made available to the token
holders who can use this informaAon to engage in a robust
debate and discussion with the project’s leaders as well as
other SISA token holders.

Token holders can use their votes in favor of any
project of their discreAon. At the end of the poll,
projects with the highest number of popular votes
will be allocated the appropriate funding.

Token holders will then be able to take on an acAve role
alongside the SISA team to monitor and ensure that the funded
project is meeAng requirements. Investors can both evangelize
for the projects beneﬁt’s as well as hold its management team
accountable for delivering on its vision.

DEMOCRATIC POOL FUND
The deﬁni6on of democracy in the modern
world is, ‘a system of government where ci6zens
are allowed to par6cipate in the proposal and
crea6on of laws’.

Pooled funds are created from many individual
investors who are aggregated for the purposes of
investment. The major disadvantage of most
pooled funds is that the funds are controlled by
the money manager or the fund management
company, and they alone make all decisions about
what to buy, when to buy, and when to sell
assets/stocks/bonds etc. We thought it is a bit
odd not to take account of investors’ opinion
while making these decisions. Ader all, it is their
money.

19

Strategic Investments in Significant Areas

In order to mi6gate this problem, we pioneered a new approach called

Democra6c Pool Fund (DPF)
It works on the principle of democracy. Just like ci6zens have rights in
democracy, in DPF investors are given rights to take part in decision making.
Not all investors are able to judge the viability of a project or company.
For this reason, pooled funds are operated by professional fund
managers. The average investor oden has limited informa6on and
therefore is unable to compete with managers of larger funds. This
is where we come in to assist the investor. At SISA our team of
experts will perform due diligence on
all projects, and prepare a project
viability report, only allowing
appropriate projects to be
pitched to our token holders.
Addi6onally, we make project
owners available to our
stakeholders so that they can further
clarify details of the project.

20

Strategic Investments in Significant Areas

SISA operates two
kinds of funds.
One is a closed end fund which is exclusively
available to our ini6al token owners. This fund
prominently concentrates on blockchain-based
projects and makes investments in projects which
receive the majority of token holder support via
vo6ng. This fund also receives prime preference
while making investment decisions.

1

Second is an open fund which is available to all
investors. This fund makes investments in all

2

prominent sectors both online and oﬄine. We are
also planning to further develop DPF as a tool which
can be provide decentraliza6on, agency, and
transparency to third-party fund operators, stock
brokers, and more.

21

RISK AND
CONSIDERATIONS
As with all investments, there are risks associated with inves6ng into venture projects,
especially within the blockchain space. For this reason, it’s impera6ve that SISA diversiﬁes its
investments into mul6ple sectors distributed globally. Addi6onally, the SISA team will take on
security and research opera6ons to protect funds from the risk of hacking. It is important for
investors to recognize that cryptocurrency is an experimental technology. Although SISA will
diversify into other industries, the primary investment mechanism for the fund is on the
blockchain.

LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
SISA is the natural evolu6on in capital alloca6on and wealth
management, allowing investors to pool funds while giving them
the unique opportunity to exercise vo6ng rights for the fund’s
alloca6ons. With the technology available today, each investor will
have immediate and autonomous access to their por6on of the
proﬁts created by the fund. By u6lizing the blockchain, we aim to
set the standard in closed-end fund transparency. We will also
provide a unique value-added proposi6on to our investors by
allowing them to maintain their righBul authority over alloca6on
decisions through vo6ng based on informa6on and analysis
provided by our researchers.

CONCLUSION
Every SISA member will iniAally receive a token representaAon of their ownership stake in the
fund. This will allow each user to register a personalized account on the pla9orm in order to
gain access to project viability reports and other research produced by the SISA team.
Further, SISA members will be able to use the pla9orm to connect with the project
owner and gain more informaAon about a given project’s investment prospects. This
peer-to-peer dialogue between investors and entrepreneurs eliminates
intermediaries and vastly increases transparency and communicaAon. As the fund
begins to grow and allocate its capital towards various projects, SISA holders
will be able to use the pla9orm in order to monitor voAng and proposed
investments as well as the fund’s trading history, por9olio balance and
performance. This user portal will grant SISA holders access to
personalized return reports, dividends and Amely news
and updates from the SISA team.
At SISA, our mission is to create a unique and
disrupAve investment vehicle in order to
disintermediate and decentralize pooled
investments. By reducing the barrier to entry for
certain investments, we aim to liberate dead capital
currently controlled by the underbanked populaAon
who may not have access to tradiAonal ﬁnancial
tools, and thus are unable to generate revenue
with their capital. Further, we aim to provide
radical transparency in all of our dealings
while allowing individual investors in the
fund to maintain agency over their
capital allocaAon via a democraAc
pooled fund.
