ABSTRACT—
The life insurance industry generates billions of
dollars in premiums every year. In 2016 alone, the
total market size for premiums in the OECD region
(40 reporting countries) was more than US$3.86
trillion dollars. Emerging Asia will be the fastestgrowing market for life insurance with an estimated
real compounded annual growth rate of 10.2%.
As an oligopoly, insurers have traditionally been able
to benefit from the opacity and byzantine operating
standards of the sector. One of the many examples
of this is the inability of the insured to monetize
their policies.
Most people do not realize that policies with cash
value can be traded in the market for a higher cash
value, that is, an individual could sell his policies to
a third party instead of surrendering the policy. In
2014, policy lapses and surrenders were in excess
of US$112 billion dollars in the US alone, of which it
is estimated US$57 billion (250,000 policies) could
have been resold in the market.

This is also the case for companies due to
employee turnover. The individuals who purchase
and maintain the policies rely on practices that
are handed over without a comprehensive
understanding of the necessary obligations and
task, relying on agents or third-party advisors to
assist when the need arises. Agents and advisors
themselves change over time, resulting in late
premium payments, void claims and a biased
portfolio that does not serve the current needs of
the individual and company.
fidentiaX is the world’s first marketplace for tradable
insurance policies. Our vision is to create a trading
marketplace and repository of insurance policies for
the masses by leveraging blockchain technology.
This blockchain-powered marketplace will provide
a trustless, immutable, auditable and transparent
environment to disrupt the status quo. fidentiaX
Open Source Foundation (FOSF) will be setup
with the mission of proliferating the adaptation of
blockchain technology in the Insurance Industry.

There are many advantages of buying an insurance
policy on the open market. For example stable
returns (superior to a similar asset class with the
same risk ratings); fixed tenure; liquidity; and low
correlation with other asset classes.
The minority of policyholders who know they
can extract higher value from their policy face
challenges in finding interested buyers as there is
no recognizable marketplace. Buyers looking to add
policies to their investment portfolio are confronted
with similar, if not more, barriers to safely executing
the purchase.
The disintermediation of the industry is also
necessary on the after-service fulfilment of the
insured. Many traditional companies have focused
on creating value using technology to enhance
periodic portfolio review, advisory or record keeping,
but there is a bigger opportunity in ensuring the
immutability and the peace-of-mind transition
when the unfortunate circumstance of a claim
arises. Whether the policyholder is an individual or a
company, the fact remains that many individuals do
not update their next of kin or beneficiaries when
they change their portfolio or will.

ABSTRACT • PAGE 1 OF 31

INTRODUCTION—
Insurance, as a means for transferring or
distributing risk from the insured to the insurer,
has been around as early as the 3rd Century BC.
Chinese merchants ‘transferred’ or ‘distributed’
their cargo before embarking on a dangerous
voyage so as to lower their risk. Babylonian traders
took insurance further by hedging their risk with
an additional payment to lenders to write-off
their loan if the shipment was stolen or lost at sea.
The first life insurance policy was written in the
early 18th Century and has since morphed from
a single application into numerous iterations
with many product innovations. There are
insurance policies addressing every need of an
individual through their life stages, for example,
Endowment1, Whole Life2 , Investment-Linked3 ,
Term4, Universal Life5, Key-man6 with various riders
such as critical illness7, terminal illness8, premium
waiver 9, etc.

The potential market size for surrendered policies
in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Malaysia and
Singapore alone exceeded US$5 billion in 2015,
and yet there is no recognizable marketplace
(online or offline) for policyholders and buyers
to transact.
fidentiaX will disrupt the status quo and break
the tethers of the insurance companies by
empowering policyholders to monetize their
policies. This is also a fantastic opportunity for
us to demonstrate the numerous advantages
of building a portfolio of tradable policies with
stable returns and developing a trustless platform
for trading of these policies.
Xchange with confidence.

The insurance industr y is dominated by a
monopoly of a few major players that have been
innovating and coming up with new products
and features to grow their business empire. The
same cannot be said for the after-sales options
available to policyholders.
The oligopolistic nature of the industr y has
resulted in policyholders being tethered to
one insurance giant and having to play by their
rules, although the holder of the policy is the
very reason for the existence of the insurance
company. One example would be the lack of
options for policyholders facing a change in their
financial circumstance or a change in their needs.
Many policyholders are under the impression that
they can only go back to the insurer to surrender
the policy, or subject themselves to above-market
interest rates to borrow against their own asset.
There is also an increasing trend of buyers
looking to purchase tradable policies from
the market due to the various benefits of this
instrument. However, they face challenges such as
accessibility to tradable policies and the manual
transfer process. These challenges have curtailed
the growth of this segment.

INTRODUCTION • PAGE 2 OF 31

CURRENT SITUATION—
Existing Policy-Holders
Policyholders facing a challenging financial situation or a change in life stage wherein their existing
insurance policy no longer meets their needs are faced with two options:
1.

Surrender their policy at existing cash value which is determined by the insurer and lose their
protection (sum assured). This brings about an added risk of being unable to invest in another
policy due to their current medical condition or with disadvantageous terms due to age.

2.

Secure a fully collateralized loan (90%~95% quantum) on their existing policy from their insurer
at an interest rate of 5%~7%p.a.

There are types of policies (such as Investment-Linked) with only one option, that is, to surrender their
policy, as insurers are unwilling to accept these policies as collateral even though the interest rate charged
is five times that of the deposit’s interest.
In a few mature markets, there is the alternative of selling policies to a third party (individual or company)
at cash value plus a negligible cash incentive. However, these companies are very selective in the policies
they are willing to purchase, for example, endowment or whole-life policies which are near their maturity
date are not favoured.
Limited options and the lack of awareness and accessibility have created an inequitable situation for
policyholders leading to a status quo which has not changed for centuries. Insurance companies prefer
that policyholders surrender their policies (thus releasing them from their sum-assured obligation) rather
than encourage trading of these policies.
Some regulators are trying are correcting this bias by imposing advisory requirements on insurers to inform
policyholders, before deciding to surrender their policy, of the availability of a market for traded policies.

CURRENT SITUATION • PAGE 3 OF 31

BUYERS
Increasingly, individuals and corporates are viewing insurance as an asset class within their investment
portfolio. However barriers to entry, such as high mortality charges10 which increase with age, difficulties
in sourcing policies and the manual transfer process make it prohibitive to invest in an insurance policy.
Policies purchased from the open market have various advantages due to the nature of how insurance
products are structured:

Inherent Capital Preservation
Feature
Cash value of a policy consist of guaranteed
and declared returns by the insurers. i.e.
cash value is effectively preserved and
backed by the insurer
Fur thermore, insurance companies
are highly regulated by central banks/
governmental bodies which have stringent
guidelines on the reserve requirements for
the insurance companies

Fixed Investment Tenure
Maturity date (for endowment plans) is
defined and allows cash flow management
and portfolio planning.

Mortality Upside
Policies purchased on the secondar y
market typically focused on the cash
value of the policy and does not price in
the element of Sum Assured in the event
of mortality of the life assured. The Sum
Assured amount could potentially be
significantly higher than the cash value.

Eliminating “Setup” Cost Of
Insurance
Original policy holder takes the brunt of the
setup cost in the first couple of years due to
how insurance policies are structured. The
cost of distribution (commission payable to
agents, underwriting cost, etc.) is deducted
in the first couple of years of the policy.

Liquidity
Tradable policies can be resold in the open
market or surrendered at the insurer for
immediate liquidy

Smoothing Of Returns
Insurance companies do not typically
declare all revenue earned in a good year
and keep the undistributed returns as a
reserve. These reserves are distributed
during a bad year to smooth out the
performance of the underlying funds.

The advantages of purchasing a tradable policy from the open market are apparent, however, getting
access to tradable policies from a trustless and reliable platform is not as straightforward. There is no
notable marketplace that provides easy access to potential buyers seeking to include tradable policies
in their portfolio.
Furthermore, there is no standardized fulfilment process for the transaction of such policies, which often
requires the buyer to place trust on the third-party provider.

CURRENT SITUATION • PAGE 4 OF 31

OUR SOLUTION—
fidentiaX the world’s first marketplace for tradable insurance policies, will be a membership-based
ecosystem focusing on the key stakeholders:

Policyholders –
Providing a liquidity alternative to existing policyholders through a transparent, fair and efficient platform
which allows tokenization of their existing policies.

Buyers –
Developing a trustless marketplace for buyers exploring tradable policies as part of their investment
portfolio by leveraging on blockchain technology and its benefits to provide a secured transactional
ecosystem.
Our platform features will be designed and developed with these member stakeholders’ needs as a
guiding principle.
fidentiaX members’ platform will provide the following features depending on the membership category:

OUR SOLUTION • PAGE 5 OF 31

POLICY LEDGER

MEMBERS AUCTION (BID YOURSELF A

Individuals and companies are overly dependent on
the trusted intermediaries (agents) who sold them
the policy to provide after-sales fulfilment. However,
due to the high turnover of intermediaries in the
insurance industry, the after-sales fulfilment is often
found wanting.

fidentiaX strongly believes that tradable policies
should form part of any investment portfolio and
will conduct periodic (minimum once a year)
private sale for members only.

When an unfortunate event of claim ocurrs, it often
falls upon the next of kin or the beneficiaries to
scour through the belongings of the insured to
locate the necessary policy documents in order to
make the claim.
fidentiaX’s Policy Ledger breaks from the traditional
reliance on intermediaries by creating a digital
ledger for policyholders:
1.

Consolidate and manage your insurance
policies on a distributed ledger.

2.

Creating an immutable record of your policies
on the blockchain.

3.

Premium payment alert

4.

Coverage summary

5.

Multi-signatory access for beneficiaries and/
or trustees on mortality event

LISTING OF POLICIES FOR TOKENIZATION
1.

Database on acceptable insurance policies
which will include Endowment, Whole Life,
Universal Life, Key-man, Investment-Linked,
Annuity, etc.

2.

Real-time pricing engine with an automated
submission of relevant documents for more
efficient quotation.

3.

Re-purchase option for policyholders who
want the option to buy back their policy
within a stipulated timeframe.

4.

Policies would be tokenized onto the 		
blockchain.

POLICY)

Policies from the model portfolio will be auctioned
for a minimum number of fidentiaX (fdX) tokens
and the auction will be open for members to bid
on the policy (a real-world asset). The successful
bidder will take ownership of the policy and could
either cash out the policy or add that policy to their
investment portfolio.
We believe this will add stability to fdX token prices
in the secondary market.

MARKETPLACE FOR PURCHASE OF
TRADABLE POLICIES
1.

Marketplace to browse available tradable
policies for purchase.

2.

Filter based on key criteria (tenure, yield at
maturity, amount, etc)

CUSTODIAN SERVICES
1.

Buyers could engage to provide custodian
services and hold the policy in a trust 		
structure.

2.

Facilitate payment of annual premium

3.

Realizing the cash value of the policy

Memb er s w ho purchas e p olicie s v ia th e
marketplace will be able to choose between
transferring the purchased policy to their name or
engage fidentiaX to hold it in trust.

PORTFOLIO BUILDER
The Portfolio Builder is a bespoke service for
buyers looking to customize and build a portfolio
of tradable insurance policies. fidentiaX will provide
professional services for sourcing, validation and
transfer of the desired policies.

BUSINESS REVENUE MODEL—
fidentiaX membership marketplace will be generating revenue via the following:

Membership Fees

Model Portfolio

Access to products and services of the platform
would be via membership fees which will be levied
on an annual basis.

Building a tradable-policies portfolio allows
fidentiaX to grow its revenue via the following:

Transaction Fees
Fa cilit at in g m e mb e r s of t h e e co s y s te m
(policyholders and buyers) on transactions which
will be subjected to transactional fees for selling
and buying.

Portfolio Builder
Providing professional services to construct
customized portfolios by sourcing and acquiring
policies from the open market according to buyer’s
investment objectives.

Portfolio Returns
Our model portfolio of tradable policies could
potentially return 3.5%p.a~4%p.a which is
significantly higher than a similar risk-class portfolio.
Mortality Upside
The model portfolio main engine of growth would
be the returns on the policies, however in the event
of the demise of the original policyholder prior to
the maturity of the policy, the policy would be paid
out to fidentiaX as the owner of the instrument.
Sale of Policies
Selected policies within the portfolio will be put up
for sale with a reasonable markup.
Repurchase Option Fee
Policyholders who sold their policies to fidentiaX
will have the option of repurchasing their policy
within a stipulated timeframe by paying a
Repurchase Option Fee. The Repurchase Option
Fee would be dependent on the type of policy and
timeframe of the option.
Revenue from the model portfolio will be used
to fund operations and development cost of the
marketplace.

BUSINESS REVENUE MODEL • PAGE 10 OF 31

DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP—
Upon successful completion of the Initial Token Offering, fidentiaX will allocate the raised funds to the
following categories:

MODEL PORTFOLIO
70% of the funds raised will be set aside to purchase tradable policies from the open market to create
a model portfolio with the following objectives:
-

Demonstrate the benefits of having tradable insurance policies in an investment portfolio. Key
statistics of the portfolio will be shared on the platform (e.g. portfolio size, average yield at 		
maturity, average investment tenure, etc.)

-

Facilitate trades on the platform during the initial stage, this will be done through direct 		
acquisition of policies in a number of countries and listing them on the platform. This is 		
necessary while we build market awareness of the first global marketplace for tradable insurance
policies.

-

Utilize the portfolio returns (3%p.a.~4%p.a) to fund future development of the platform as well as
funding a non-profit foundation to proliferate the adaptation of blockchain technology in the
Insurance Industry.

DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP • PAGE 11 OF 31

Funds collected from the Crowd Token Contribution will be transferred to a Trust (managed by a Legal
Firm as Trustee) with a clear mandate on the utilization of the monies towards building the world’s first
marketplace for tradable insurance policies and proliferation of blockchain technology for the insurance
industry.

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM—
fidentiaX’s platform will be based on a customized version of NXT blockchain (www.nxtplatform.org).
Following is an outline of the high-level aspects of the platform.

1.

TOKENS
The platform will use 3 different types of token:

-

Crowd Token Contribution (Ethereum Blockchain) - fdX

-

Currency Representation Tokens – (eBTC, eETH, eUSD, eEUR, eSGD, eJPY, eKRW, eMYR, etc)

-

Platform Unified Tokens – ISX

CTC
Tokens

Platform Unified
Tokens

Currency Rep.
Tokens

Token issued during
Initial Token Offering via
Ethereum Blockchain.

Platform specific token
pegged to USD to
facilitate transaction
within the platform.
Non-exchangeble,
Non-transferrable and
exclusively used within
the platform.

Named after their flat
counterpart for members
to deposit their fiat in
exchange for ISX tokens.

On a regulatory level, sellers may only cash out the policy using the currency in which the policy was
issued (e.g. a Singapore Dollars Policy will only be able to cash out in Singapore Dollars).
To allow seamless transition between currencies, fidentiaX’s cash management system will include
various fiat currency accounts linked to internal Currency Representation Tokens which can be exchanged
against the Platform Unified Token (ISX) that is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar.
This allows buyers to top up their fidentiaX account by purchasing ISX with their preferred fiat currency,
and sellers can cash out ISX at its USD value against the fiat currency in which the policy was issued
with minimum forex charges.

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM • PAGE 13 OF 31

2.

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

fidentiaX’s platform relies on asymmetric cryptography to manage its user accounts. This process includes
the generation of a private key used to log in and digitally sign data and transactions.
A private key is not just a password, it is a unique representation of a user’s identity and should never be
shared. Consequently, its safe storage is extremely important, and recovery procedures are more complex.
Nonetheless, as a great majority of internet/app users are used to password recovery systems, fidentiaX
will implement a hybrid method to ensure the user safety and the ability to recover credentials.
-

After registration, a hardware signing device can be used to log in and sign transactions.

-

Administrators will hold special rights, allowing them to transfer user metadata and policy 		
ownership from one account to another after a multi-step confirmation procedure initiated by
the private key owner. This transfer will require the digital signatures of several administrators.

When a user initiates an account recovery procedure, administrators will:
-

confirm the legitimacy of the request.

-

create a new account on behalf of the user.

-

transfer metadata, balance, and policy ownership to a new account.

-

send the user a new hardware signing device containing the new account’s private key.

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM • PAGE 14 OF 31

3.

USER TYPES

The fidentiaX platform aims to make its user experience as seamless as possible. Because not all users
will perform the same actions, three user types will be defined, each focused on a different user role:

User Type

SELL ONLY

BUY AND SELL

Users wishing to sell their policies without engaging
in trading

Users wishing to trade policies to build a portfolio

- No membership required
- Cannot buy policies or access policy 		
		marketplace
- Automated/Semi automated KYC and
		 policy metadata population

- Membership required
- Can buy and sell policies on the Policy
		Marketplace
- Access to policy ledger function
- Automated/ Semi-automated KYC and
		 policy metadata population

Trusted 3rd Parties/ Partners
Partner trading of policies as a service on behalf
of others
- Membership required
- Can buy and sell policies
- Manual entry of third party’s KYC and policy
		metadata
- Responsible for verification of their clients
		 KYC and policy metadata.

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM • PAGE 15 OF 31

4.

PAYMENT

When a user’s ISX balance is sufficient to process a payment, fees will deducted from the balance. Users
whose balance is insufficient to process a payment will be prompted to top up.
Top ups will be available via several online payment methods using their respective APIs.

5.

CASH OUT (WITHDRAWAL)

Users will be able to cash out their balances monthly, at a fixed date
-

User decides on an ISX amount to cash-out.

-

ISX amount is deducted from user’s balance

-

U.S. Dollar value of ISX is transferred to user’s fiat account on the next cash-out date.

-

User can decide to cancel the cash-out any time before cash-out date.

6.

POLICIES

Policies are unique, non-duplicable objects comprising a unique ID, a set of metadata (policy details and
requirements) and a set of supporting documents (KYC, photo of the original paper policy, etc). Each
policy is verified by fidentiaX before being listed on the marketplace.
Policies previously processed through a standard (off-platform) sale cycle don’t require extra processing
since their metadata has been verified by their respective insurance companies at inception.

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM • PAGE 16 OF 31

7.

METADATA

The term ‘metadata’ refers to the set of information which defines a policy’s content and lifecycle, including
but not limited to:
-

Ownership history

-

Supporting documents URL

-

Creation timestamp

-

Currency

-

Validation timestamp

-

Price

-

Supporting documents hashes

-

Policy details

8.

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS

Supporting documents added to a policy will be hashed and uploaded to a cloud storage service.
Calculating hashes of each document will allow the verification of uploaded data.

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM • PAGE 17 OF 31

9.

COVERAGE

At launch, fidentiaX will cover a limited range of countries and insurance companies. This number will
increase with the opening of local fidentiaX branches to process local KYC verification and regulations.

10. KNOW-YOUR-CUSTOMER (KYC)
KYC is required for every user of the fidentiaX platform. In the future, users will be able to share their
fidentiaX KYC and policy details with other services on a need-to-know basis.
KYC must at least include:
-

Permanent currency settings for the account. This guarantees that an account can only buy and
sell ISX tokens within the system using selected currencies (policy specific), and cannot use the
fidentiaX platform as a general currency exchange, which may expose fidentiaX to a different
class of regulatory requirements.

-

Local fidentiaX branches will be progressively opened to process country-specific KYC.

11. CONSENSUS
fidentiaX’s platform blockchain will be based on custom consensus rules, developed to support and
streamline the specifics of insurance policy trade and its corollary regulatory requirements, including:
-

All transactions (except trivial transactions) on the fidentiaX Blockchain which are initiated 		
by a buyer or a seller will be implemented as ‘phasing transactions’ which will be pending until
fidentiaX performs the correct action or verification (such as changing the policy owner with the
insurance provider, verifying the existence and ownership of a policy to be listed, etc.)

-

The fidentiaX Blockchain will be private and not directly accessible to the public, with one or
several nodes being operated by each fidentiaX office. User applications will work against 		
middleware which then operates on the private blockchain.

-

fidentiaX controls the nodes and has direct economic incentive to do so. The public cannot
directly post transactions on the blockchain, and forging fees can be entirely disabled. Actions
such as buying or selling a policy automatically generate a charge to the user, so the system
cannot be overwhelmed with bogus transactions.

-

Country offices and trusted partners run independent nodes that form the global fidentiaX
Blockchain. This makes it difficult for an internal malicious actor to compromise the integrity of
the blockchain and is one of the core strengths of running a blockchain.

-

The status of the blockchain can be explored via a blockchain explorer exposed only to paying
members or other relevant parties, as dictated by the permissions set in the middleware.

12. Encryption
Key exchange on the fidentiaX platform is based on the Curve25519 algorithm, which generates a shared
secret key using a fast, efficient, high-security elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman function. This algorithm is
implemented in the same way as the Nxt.org Blockchain, on which the fidentiaX Blockchain is based.

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM • PAGE 18 OF 31

CROWD TOKEN CONTRIBUTION—
fidentiaX will be issuing 100,000,000 fdX tokens for Crowd Token Contribution (CTC) with bonus program
for early contributors based on the following:

CTC (Day 1~2)

1 ETH = 575 fdX (15% bonus)

CTC (Day 3~5)

1 ETH = 550 fdX (10% bonus)

CTC (Day 6~30)

1 ETH = 500 fdX

fidentiaX will conduct a Private-Contribution exercise prior to the Public-Contribution for strategic partners,
company affiliates and angel investors.

CROWD TOKEN CONTRIBUTION • PAGE 21 OF 31

fdx TOKEN UTILITIES—
There are 3 main utilities for fdX tokens issued during the CTC, namely:

Membership
fidentiaX is a membership-based platform whereby users need to be a member to access the range of
services available on the platform.
The annual membership fees shall be payable via fdX tokens and any token collected will be consumed.
This would effectively decrease the total float of fdX in the market.
For example:
fidentiaX’s marketplace has 200,000 users and each membership is set at 20 fdX tokens per annual.
A total of 4,000,000 will be consumed that year. This will reduce the total float by approximately 3%
assuming 100% of the tokens were distributed during CTC.

Member’s Auction
fidentiaX will hold exclusive auction for fdX token holders whereby policy will be put up for auction at
a significant discount off the cash value.
For example:
fidentiaX list an endowment policy with cash value of $100,000 at 25% discount, i.e. $75,000. Holders of
fdX tokens would then be able to place a bid on the policy using fdX tokens. Successful bidder would walk
away with a substantial discount for a real-world asset which he could put up for sale in our marketplace.

Exchange for Platform Unified Token (ISX)
Transactions on fidentiaX platform will be conducted with a platform unified token (ISX) for better
management of forex risk and risk management (Anti-Money Laundering).
fidentiaX will hold exclusive and limited sale for fdX token holders, giving them the opportunity to
purchase ISX tokens at a discount. ISX tokens are pegged to US$1.

fidentiaX FOUNDATION—
Establishing the fidentiaX Open Source Foundation (FOSF)
The insurance industry, in its current oligopolistic state, will consistently seek to undertake innovation
and transparency in a commercially self-beneficial manner. With its legacy systems, antiquated business
models and its undying focus on cross-cannibalizing each other’s market share to increase shareholder
value, we believe that altruistic technology changes can only materialize if they are built on an open
framework. The establishment of the fidentiaX Open Source Foundation (FOSF) will be a framework that
is built by the community, to serve the community.
The FOSF provides an established framework for intellectual property and financial contributions that
simultaneously limits potential legal exposure for our project committers. The FOSF’s seeks to create
an equal opportunity community of contributors from both developers and industry contributors to
successfully collaborate to develop freely available enterprise-grade insurance blockchain solutions,
benefiting millions of users and insurers worldwide. Its core focus is to develop, proliferate and promote
an open-source blockchain architecture that is not owned by any traditional large insurance institution
or blockchain development firms.
The funding derived for the FOSF will support, elect and facilitate a panel of non-partisan cross functional
industry experts to drive meaningful technological contributions and to engage like-minded contributors
to become FOSF members. The members will periodically elect a Board of Directors to manage the
organizational affairs of the Foundation which will adhere to the FOSF by-laws. The Board will, in turn,
appoint a number of officers to oversee its day-to-day operations with the public records of the Foundation
made available to the community on the blockchain. We envision a future where all stakeholders of the
insurance industry use the solutions distributed under the FOSF free-to-use license; and the community
actively participates in FOSF activities, mentoring initiatives and development conferences.
More information will be made available in the middle of 2018.
