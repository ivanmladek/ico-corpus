Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

1. Background
The issuance of cryptocurrency has brought a revolutionary development to
the blockchain domain. On the one hand, blockchain companies have issued more
and more cryptocurrency. And on the other hand, Investors show a spurt of
growth. However, as the lack of a good financial order to regulate the
cryptocurrency trading like the secondary market, good companies cannot obtain
more investment while bad currency rather than good currency has occupied the
market and many investors are unable to obtain satisfactory rate of investment
(ROI). At the same time, the existing mature methodology to analyze stocks and
invest in stocks, experienced analysts and consulting companies participating in
the secondary market have not appeared in the currency market yet.

1.1 Traditional Wall Street Financial Order Introduction
Represented by Wall Street, traditional finance connects company,
investment bank, exchange, fund, rating company, research company, consulting
company and audit company through the stock market to build a financial order
in the secondary market.

1

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

Through a common participation of investment banks, audit companies, and
consulting companies, a company’s stock can be publicly traded in exchanges.
Analysts of investment banks can conduct fundamental analysis and technical
analysis of stocks through researches, and therefore carry out stock analysis
reports, stock ratings and forecast of stock price to help investors make
investment decisions on funds and so on.
Rating companies review various financial products in the financial market
and assist investors to engage in investment by rating industries, stocks, securities
and funds.
The traditional financial market is in a huge scale. It can be conservatively
estimated that the overall market value of such a huge traditional financial market
2

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

has exceeded USD1 trillion. However, a similar consensus of its logic has not been
formed in the blockchain domain. At the same time, due to the centralized
management, non-transparent relationship and various gray areas and obscure
boxes filling everywhere, it is often seen in news reports of various countries.
The traditional financial market is flooded with kinds of data mediators, who
cash in huge economic benefits on trading data. However, data are still of low
credibility and numerous deceptions remain common.

1.2 Current Status of Blockchain Domain
The blockchain domain is a start-up, lacking management concept,
management tools and platforms corresponding to decentralized management
methods. Uncompleted rules and platforms for companies’ information disclosure
leave investors no opportunities to participate in the companies' management
and operation.

There are numerous blockchain companies, featuring in cross-border and
cross-language with less information in their early stages, which has formed
plenty of information silos as well as false and fraudulent information. Investors
cannot analyze the project objectively due to asymmetric information and
companies cannot find independent and objective analysts to analyze, interpret
and audit project channels. The news that investors couldn't get their money back
after investing can be found everywhere.

Simultaneously, financial by-products such as cryptocurrency funds in the

3

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

cryptocurrency industry are nascent, and corresponding credit rating companies
like Standard & Poor's have not yet emerged.

Generally, blockchain companies always have issued cryptocurrency in their
early stages and financed in two stages, both in ICO and in Exchange, which are
main channels for investors to participate in. However, existing rating of
cryptocurrency remains extremely unprofessional and analysis methods in the
secondary market have not yet taken into the blockchain market. Some media
and independent analysts still get unreal data sources and information without
rigorous researches. Beyond that, there is no professional platform for analysts to
involved.

In addition, the fact that analysts are short of scientific methods for research
with poor current information has resulted in poor timeliness of ratings. Without
real-time information like ratings and indexes, there is still no established standard
in this industry.

4

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

2. Insight Chain Concept
From the background mentioned above, it can be seen that the blockchain
industry has begun to take shape while still lacking a Wall Street-like financial
order established in the secondary market for hundreds of years. In order to solve
above problems existing in the blockchain domain, Insight Chain has proposed a
new solution combining with the technology of blockchain.

6

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

Insight Chain, a decentralized research ecosystem chain based on blockchain,
will focus on data ecosystem on the blockchain domain firstly, works on building
Wall Street-like financial order in the blockchain domain. It integrates companies,
media, analyst and investor with blockchain technology, co-constructs a
decentralized platform integrating information sharing, review & index, data
trading and interaction based on research and promotes the upgrade and healthy
development of the blockchain industry.

Insight Chain is a convergence platform designed to serve all participants
involved with good rules and architecture, so as to re-construct a reliable,
decentralized, Wall Street-like financial order in the blockchain domain.
7

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

Established on an research public blockchain, Insight Chain stores research
data of analysts, media, companies and investors on the blockchain, laying
researches to be trusted and traceable. Research data on cryptocurrency, funds
and media made by analysts are also stored on the blockchain. As well, upon
comprehensive analysis of these data, analysis reports, credit ratings and analysis
results made by analysts on cryptocurrency and funds will be stored on the
blockchain too. At the same time, all participants can conduct decentralized data
trading on the blockchain platform: information, research, reports, etc., so as to
achieve intermediation and there will be no third-party middlemen to obtain
profit margin. Therefore, all participants can get maximum benefits. Based on
various trusted data, the platform will use smart contracts to generate a series of
index information for the cryptocurrency market, which is used to represent the
health and development status of the market to serve for investors and analysts.

Insight Chain aims to develop the cryptocurrency review, credit rating, and
indexes generated by analysts and the platform to trustworthy industry standards.
Beyond that, we can guide investors in this platform and also can serve for the
whole industry, such as offering currency trading standard for exchanges and
reference for various cryptocurrency funds.

Insight Chain will issue an Ethereum-based token: INB being the currency of
the platform. INB meets Ethereum ERC-20 token standard and is able to be freely
traded on Ethereum's public blockchain: in the system actions like trading, awards
8

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

and voting will use INB to pay for decentralization.

Innovation concept of Insight Chain is shown as follows:

2.1 Insight Chain Participants
Firstly, participants of the platform are as follows.

9

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

2.1.1 Company Role
Companies cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency fund issued by companies
should be key objects in financial researches. First of all, it is necessary to establish
the management concept of blockchain companies and timely disclose the
companies’ various information like project progress and financial status, allowing
investors to participate in the management and operation of companies. Then,
companies can invite analysts on the platform to analyze and audit information
to ensure the interests of investors and provide investment advice for investors.

10

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

2.1.2 Media Role
In news researches, media are main participants, who will disclose relevant
information about companies or the industry outside for reference by analysts
and investors.

2.1.3 Analyst Role
Analysts as main implementers of the researches, conduct investigations to
companies, media, and investors through user researches, fundamental analysis,
technical analysis and desktop researches to give research results about
companies, cryptocurrency, industry and cryptocurrency funds, which are
available for investors to use for free or paying with INB.

Moreover, analysts can disclose real-time investment strategies of
cryptocurrency for investors' reference.

There is a ranking system in which analysts can upgrade themselves through
user review, company review and system review. The ranking system includes:
11

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

Candidate Analyst, Level 1 Analyst, Level 2 Analyst and Level 3 Analyst.

2.1.4 Investor Role
Investors can supervise and inquire about invested companies.

Investors can participate in research requests put forward by other roles in
the system and can be rewarded with INB.

Investors can use INB to buy analysis reports, real-time investment advice
and more made by analysts.

Analysts can be rewarded for their good advice.

INB can be used to vote on cryptocurrency trend and reward will be given
for success.

12

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

2.1.5 Public Blockchain Role
Based on the public blockchain, the platform provides rules for all participants
to effectively participate in all aspects of the blockchain companies’ financial order.

Fraud prevention systems based on big data are prepared to prevent
fraudulent actions by all participants from affecting the interests of investors.

Decentralized index rules and ranking rules are also prepared. Using smart
contracts in the blockchain to automatically generate various cryptocurrency and
related indexes and rankings of cryptocurrency funds is to characterize the
development of the entire market and to guide investors.

2.2 Insight Chain Ecology
Ecology of the platform is as follows.

2.2.1 Data Research
No matter who you are, general or institutional investor, researches must be
done before making decisions. Meticulous and deep researches can firstly bridge
match our investment decisions and the actual trend in the future subjectively and
objectively. Scientific plan is indispensable to do good researches. Fortunately, the
300-year history of world finance with the Wall Street at the core has recorded
everything we need. In the blockchain financial world, the Wall Street-like financial
order is the most urgent need for current development. Therefore, by disclosing
all research data to investors, Insight Chain will establish the new decentralized
and trusted financial order with stimulation ecology.

In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, every investor plays a dual
role, owner of the business and the producer of data. Serious unfairness has been
generated from existing asymmetric information and non-transparent data
between blockchain projects and investors. However, that the blockchain
technology has improved makes the traditional financial research system to be
upgraded authentic and reliable. As well, massive data, efficiency and timeliness
and continuous trading make it possible. Based on this, Insight Chain will establish
an IFM (Investors Feedback Management System) for investors of blockchain
14

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

companies.

Via Insight Chain, investors can finish researches released by companies,
analysts and media through the Insight Chain, and realize continuously unclosed
research data output of monetized motivation. Data output includes but not
limited to questionnaires, voting, evaluation, user feedback, testing, interviews
and other scientific research methods and forms. This is an ecosystem to activate
the r-coefficient of investors and blockchain companies.

The r-coefficient is an amount of linear correlation between blockchain
companies and investors. Insight Chain uses the following formula as the
correlation coefficient:

𝐸𝑟(𝑋, 𝑌) =

𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋, 𝑌)
√𝑉𝑎𝑟[𝑋]𝑉𝑎𝑟[𝑌]

where, X represents the variable of the company; Y represents the variable of
investors; Cov (X, Y) is the covariance of X and Y; Var[X] is the variance of X, and
Var[Y] is the variance of Y.

R-coefficient is to evaluate whether the price of cryptocurrency is reasonable
and whether it fluctuates around the value of the company. Apart from helping
investors judge the reasonableness of blockchain companies’ operational
capabilities and price of cryptocurrency, it also can help analysts and investors
judge the long-term trend of cryptocurrency, which contributes to value
15

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

investment.

2.2.2 Information Sharing
The biggest innovation of a blockchain company derives from overturning
the management framework of traditional company investors, among which the
core management concept is “disclosure of all information”, including financial
information and project progress. However, global investors sorely need a trusted
and professional platform to know all information of the company and then
participate in it.

Based on the decentralized research data ecology, Insight Chain connects
Chartered Blockchain Financial Analyst in the whole world, no longer being limited
by geographical restrictions. Analysts and investors can be related seamlessly.
Analysts can help investors know about companies’ dynamics with all details and
provide professional investment decisions, covering market timing and
investment portfolios. Analysts have rights to conduct independent third-party
researches on companies, integrating research data and professional analysis
methods to rate companies and publish analysis reports. On the Insight Chain
platform, analysts can connect both companies and investors, in which news
organizations and self-media can participate in to provide analysts with instant
information and data, so as to realize the decentralized information sharing
mechanism of blockchain companies and investors.

16

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

2.2.3 Review & Index
One of the core goals of Insight Chain is to establish an review & index system
for blockchain cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency funds: Exponential Evaluation
Method refers to make a multiple evaluation to a participating unit. Insight Chain
can review not only blockchain companies but also cryptocurrency, containing
comprehensive evaluations of correlation coefficients between these two parts, as
well as credit ratings of cryptocurrency-related finances such as cryptocurrency
funds. In the entire evaluation index system of the Insight Chain, the following five
index systems are mainly established.

The first type is a rating index given by independent analysts for
cryptocurrency, including the industrial index and the cryptocurrency index. Based
17

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

on scientific researches, analysts help investors make more accurate investment
decisions through analyzing reports professionally. The system will provide some
rating dimensions serving as the output of analysts as shown in the following table.
Analysts can also establish their own evaluation dimension, each dimension
scoring from 0 to 100;

Rating standard of cryptocurrency are in two types: the rating standard
before trading in exchanges, which can be used by investors to assess whether
the cryptocurrency is worth investing in private equity and public offering stages;
and one after trading while the analyst is required to give the available time for

18

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

rating.

The second is credit rating given by independent analysts on financial
products such as cryptocurrency funds. Similar to the first type, it is also made for
investors to refer after that the analyst does complete researches on financial
products such as cryptocurrency funds.

The third is the real-time voting index. Insight Chain will provide a forecast
system based on blockchain technology for investors to predict the rising or falling
of cryptocurrency by voting. The RONI index can reflect forecast results and the
confidence index towards the market.
19

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

The fourth is the Insight benchmark indexes including the classified industry
index, the Insight 500 index, the sentiment index and the confidence index,
targeting to service investors with credit rating, independent analysis and research
as well as investment consultation. The Insight 500 Index focuses on factors like
cryptocurrency and the number of issuance, which are counted in accordance with
the price of premium cryptocurrency listed in all global exchanges. These indexes
are precise and of great continuousness, which are one of the most important
indexes for investors to make decisions. To some extent, blockchain companies
and cryptocurrency can be selected into the Insight 500 composition currency can
reflect high-quality investment objectives in this industry.

The fifth is exchange index. Digital currency exchanges are spread all over
the world. Therefore, investors need to use multiple exchanges at the same time
for a long period of time, which will lead to information asymmetry and inequality.
Hence, based on blockchain technology, Insight Chain will give at least two
evaluation indexes with one relating to the ratings of cryptocurrency and the other
relating to the ratings of trading volume.

Insight Chain will be a mood index provider for investors of blockchain and
cryptocurrency, technical analysts can measure how much the market will rise or
fall using Trin statistic:

𝑇𝑟𝑖𝑛 =

𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦⁄𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦
𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦⁄𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑓𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦

20

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

If the Trin statistic in the market exceeds 1, the market may be considered as
a bear market. Because the falling currency has a higher trading volume than the
rising currency, that is net selling pressure. In addition to the Trin indicator, more
emotional indicators will be given in Insight Chain to evaluate investors’ optimistic
mood.

Insight Chain puts forward the concept of ROEI (Raise Or Not Index),
encouraging users to participate in predicting the rising or falling of
cryptocurrency by means of INB voting, reward for successful forecast and
punishment for failed one. Predicted changes will be divided into several periods:
10 min, 1 h, 12 h, 24 h and 72 h. RONI=R/(R+N) X 100, where R is the number of
people who voted for rising and N represents falling. The larger the index is, the
greater the likelihood of an increase is.

21

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

Insight Chain puts forward the concept of the BSRI (Buy Sell Ratio Index) and
obtains the current purchasing and selling condition of mainstream exchanges
through technical analysis. BSRI=B/S X 100, where B is the quantity of purchasing
and S is the quantity of selling. The larger the index is, the greater the probability
of an increase is.

Insight Chain and blockchain analysts gathered evaluation indexes.
Evaluation methods include fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Data
sources include desktop researches and user researches. Among them,
fundamental analysis includes blockchain projects, teams, news, progress,
community governance and policy analysis; and technical analysis is mainly about
currency analysis and index analysis. Insight Chain will provide analysts with a big
22

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

data monitoring system to monitor the activity of fans of project community (such
as Twitter, Telegram, Wechat, Reddit, Steemit and Medium), and cooperate with
the Insight research system to maximize the participation of investors. A large
amount of data is the core foundation of analyst output evaluation index,
cryptocurrency rating and forecast analysis report of currency price.

We target at developing the ratings and indices in the Insight Chain into
trustworthy standards in this industry. On the one hand, investors use these
standards to make investments and on the other hand, companies can use these
rating indexes as standards in some related applications, such as new
cryptocurrency being issued in exchanges.

The following table indicates some common evaluation indexes in Insight
Chain:

23

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

2.2.4 Data Trading
For hundreds of years, the data exchange market was centralized market
mechanism filled with a large amount of incredible data. In view of the high
requirements for samples in volume, authenticity, effectiveness and methodology,
24

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

companies prefer to choose professional third-party research companies or
consulting companies such as Nielsen and McKinsey. However, even worldfamous research company ACNielsen is unable to complete all the projects. The
imbalance between supply and demand provides environment for a large number
of middlemen between the data producers and the companies. Therefore, a very
complex supply chain is formed to get the final data and multiple suppliers
participate in this chain, which results in that the authenticity of the data cannot
be guaranteed. Such misleading and even deception may appear in companies’
management decision and investors’ investment decisions. Insight Chain's
decentralized precision research system can solve these problems.

Moreover, Insight Chain is a blockchain-based data exchange market, in
which: analysts assign data research tasks and pay tokens to investors; investors
vote for and pay tokens for rise and fall of cryptocurrency; companies buy data
from investors sustainably; investors or companies can buy professional reports
from analysts and pay for subscription of premium media services; and analysts
can trade on cryptocurrency analysis models with each other.

25

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

2.2.5 Interaction & Consultant
It can be said that every analyst in Wall Street has a Bloomberg terminal and
every stock investor longs for an investment consultant. The Wall Street market
has been formed between buyers (brokers) and sellers (funds) with well-paid
financial analysts. However, an individual investor is unable to directly enjoy
services of financial analyst in Wall Street, and also, he cannot afford a Bloomberg
terminal. Extremely high costs have brought rejection to individual investors by
Wall Street analysts. They cannot enjoy the most professional investment advisory
services anytime and anywhere, as well, the highly asymmetrical information
makes it difficult for them to judge the long-term value of a company, by which
26

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

they can make accurate investment decisions. Apparently, this is unfavorable to a
company. Similarly, for investment advisors who are skilled at technical analysis,
there is still no credible community platform for them to communicate with
individual investors anytime and anywhere. More importantly, there are often
various mistrust issues between investors and investment advisors as well as
between analysts when involving the return on wealth investment. Insight Chain
will provide innovative solutions based on blockchain technology to create a
reliable and interactive community system of cryptocurrency in the financial sector.

In Insight, a decentralized and trusted community, companies and blockchain
analysts establish good relationships of research, disclosure and interaction.
Analysts can obtain instant information from companies, including financial
information, project progress, major events, strategic adjustments and other
information that affects price fluctuations of cryptocurrency. The consulting
interaction between investors and analysts is the core of this community. Analysts
can not only provide users with monetized investment decisions, analysis reports,
market timing advice, but also can initiate customized research tasks such as
research and voting to users, realizing an interactive consulting eco-community
where users and analysts can carry out data research and data trading. In addition,
both news media and We-Media can participate in community interactions.

27

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

3. Insight Chain Product Solution
Insight Chain will provide numerous systems and modules to ensure that all
participants can fully participate in the Wall Street-like financial ecology of the
blockchain domain, so that all participants can enjoy the benefits of the ecosystem.
It mainly consists of eight systems and nine modules. There into, the system, as a
logic implementation of the module, is built on the blockchain, and the module
refers to each part of the applications used by the user.

28

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

3.1 Eight Major Systems
Eight major systems include decentralized precision research systems,
decentralized voting systems, decentralized evaluation systems, blockchainbased fraud prevention systems, authentication systems, decentralized data
exchange systems, social systems and on-chain search systems. The following is
a detailed introduction.

3.1.1 Decentralized Precise Research System
Analysts adopt this system to conduct researches on companies, provide

29

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

analysis reports and ratings, and then preserve data on each link on the blockchain.
When sponsors pay INB, researches are conducted and will be in good operation
to maintain ecology in the form of researching objects getting INB. At the same
time, the system will provide an analysis system of the research results, which is
convenient for analysts to view and analyze them.

As a key item in the research, the questionnaire will be accurately assigned
to the research subjects based on the user image given by the analyst.

There are two important processes, including the launch of research by the
company and the implementation of the research task by the analyst. The
following Swim lane chart shows the complete process of the entire research
process.

30

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

3.1.2 Decentralized Voting System
The platform provides a decentralized voting system and saves voting data
on the blockchain to ensure the credibility of the voting process and results. It has
two important applications for voting: voting research and voting index. The
former means that the analyst can investigate user data by means of voting.

The latter refers to the concept of RONI (Raise Or Not Index) proposed by
the platform. Users are encouraged to participate in predicting the rise and fall of
cryptocurrency by INB voting. If the forecast is successful, the reward will be given,
and if not, the penalty will be given, which represents the user's expectation of a
31

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

certain cryptocurrency price. The forecast will be divided into several periods: 10
min, 1 h, 12 h, 24 h and 72 h. After the end of the current forecast period, smart
contracts built on the blockchain will reallocate INB based on the current number
of winners and losers and the total number of INBs. That is to say, all INBs will be
allocated to winners without any fees.

3.1.3 Decentralized Review System
The platform consists of two aspects. One is the review of companies,
cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency funds and the industry by analysts and the
platform, and the other is review feedback to the initiating trader after completing
the trading.

Based on various research data, analysts will analyze the company,
cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency funds, and provide analysis reports and
ratings for investors' reference. At the same time, the platform will give a
comprehensive rating based on the rating result and the logic agreed by the smart
contract and save it on the blockchain.

Based on information such as ratings given by analysts, the platform uses the
built-in algorithm to give the index and rankings of cryptocurrency,
cryptocurrency funds and the industry. The platform proposes the concept of BSRI
(Buy Sell Ratio Index), which means to obtain the current buying and selling of
mainstream trading through technical analysis. BSRI=B/S X 100, where B indicates
32

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

the purchase quantity and S refers to the sales volume. The larger the index, the
greater the probability of raising.

Both analysts who complete company's rating and users who purchase
analysis report can review the system by voting with INB. According to the
feedback, the system uses smart contracts to mark analysts and analysis report,
and finally give reward or punishment for all participants, which aims to maintain
the positive operation of the entire ecosystem.

3.1.4 Blockchain-based Fraud Prevention System
There are various fraudulent practices in the current market, such as the fraud
of analysts’ research data and the falsify of company’s research data and
questionnaires. By introducing blockchain technology, the platform records data
33

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

information on the blockchain, greatly strengthening the credibility of the data.

At the same time, the system cooperates with INB tokens, with the addition
of reward-penalty mechanism. Each participant should be responsible for his
actions. People who cheat would be punished with INB. Conversely, active
participants would be rewarded with INB.

The system also proposes the concept of cryptocurrency-day, which
represents the total number of days that the cryptocurrency assets are in the
hands of the user. The less the number of days is, the lower the user's trust level
is. It is an important reference indicator for anti-cheating.

INB

3.1.5 Authentication System
The authentication system is used for real-name authentication of companies,
media, investors and analysts of platform, aiming to prevent problems such as
34

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

data fraud resulted from non-authentication. It is the first step to make the
platform in a good order.

3.1.6 Decentralized Data Trading System
All kinds of data trading on the platform are completed on the blockchain,
achieving a real decentralization. Both sides directly use INB for trading, and the
platform does not participate or earn any price spread income.

Data trading includes the trading of company research tasks, analyst research
tasks and analysis reports. It truly realizes a decentralized trading based on the
Insight Chain.

35

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

3.1.7 Social System
The social system has created the basis for all kinds of communication
between the various roles on the platform, including the establishment of good
relationships and the support of functions, such as chat, live broadcast and post
bar.

3.1.8 On-Blockchain Search System
The system is applied to search information and data related to blockchain,
including project progress, data search saved in the blockchain, usage of project
tokens, which is used for analysts and investors to further understand the
company.

36

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

company will also respond to some relevant questions in real time.

4. Insight Chain Technical Plan
The operation of Insight Chain focuses on the blockchain domain, and the
technical plan also adopts the blockchain technology of Ethereum and public
chain. INB is released on Ethereum and various INB-based trading in its earlier
stage are conducted on Ethereum, ensuring the decentralization of trading. In the
later stage, the system will develop a public blockchain, employ it as a basis to
store various data generated by the system and support decentralized trading
based on internal cryptocurrency to achieve full trustworthiness, traceability and
decentralization. The complete technology stack diagram for the entire platform
is shown below:

43

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

Blockchain technology originates from Bitcoin, and then Ethereum launches
blockchain that supports smart contracts. We believe that EOS will become the
next major blockchain technology since it uses a new algorithm of block
production and achieve a higher trading throughput than Bitcoin and Ethereum.
It introduces a new blockchain architecture design that allows decentralized
applications to scale horizontally and vertically, which is accomplished by building
an imitation operating system on which applications can be built. The software
provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communications and

44

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

application dispatch across hundreds of CPU cores or clusters. Based on the
software, the blockchain architecture emerges. It can process millions of trading
per second, eliminate user fees, and allow for quick and easy deployment of
decentralized applications and this is the main reason that why we may choose
EOS as the underlying blockchain technology. A stable version of EOS will be
released for the community staff in June 2018 and then it will be applied to the
system.

At present, many blockchain applications publish their own private chains
that have no decentralized features in essence. No other blockchain application
participates in the operating ecology of the entire chain and the data is still stored
in the centralized system. Insight Chain will develop and launch an public
blockchain and run the cryptocurrency of INB in blockchain to ensure normal
operation of the public blockchain ecology. We will have a complete set of rules
to guarantee the rights of INB holders and make a complete mapping of their
holdings on the INB. The new INB will no longer carry out ICOs or trading in
exchanges. All rights to use the Insight Chain will be in the hands of the original
INB holder.

45

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

Insight Chain is committed to building an ecosystem in which the right to
use various resources in the chain is directly proportional to the holding of INB.
This ecosystem contains all Insight-related DApps, including but not limited to
research, voting, indexes, ratings and other related applications. With the
similarity of the business model and the unified use of INB, the ecosystem will
share the data and users of each application, so as to achieve mutual benefit
and jointly build a large ecosystem.

5. Insight Chain Roadmap
The development roadmap for Insight Chain is as follows:

46

6. Insight Chain Token Economy
Insight Chain will issue INB based on the ERC-20 standard at Ethereum and
raise the Ethereum required for the project operation through the private sale and
public sale. The raised Ether will be used in product development, team expansion,
community operations and marketing in accordance with the agreed ratio. As the
project progresses, the team will release a certain percentage of tokens to
47

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

maintain the healthy development of the entire community.

The INB issued amounts to 10,000,000,000, and the raising is planned to last
30 days. During this period, a total of 3,000,000,000 tokens will be sold, and all
the tokens have been sold out. The token will land on the main exchanges as
soon as possible after the raising is completed.

The distribution of tokens is shown as follows:

• Raising: 30%, private raising for funding, only for institutional investors, will
be locked for one year;

• Community: 30%, being used to reward partners in the public blockchain,
such as DApps and nodes;

• Team: 20%, being used to reward teams, consultants and other participants
48

Insight Chain – A Decentralized Research Ecosystem Chain Based On Blockchain

as well as foundation operation. It will be locked for 3 years;
