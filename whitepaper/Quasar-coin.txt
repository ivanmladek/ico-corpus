1.1 Introduction

www.quasarcoin.org

Bitcoin, an innovative currency developed by Nakamoto Satoshi in 2008, Ethereum, a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts
developed by Vitaly R. Buterin, are just the two examples of more than a thousand cryptocurrencies that are developed and traded
worldwide.
However, it is true that the original cryptocurrency lacks the most important function, the real-life transaction ability. Due to the
characteristics of the block-chain such as delayed settlement due to consultation time, the variability of the value of each coin in real
time as well as the difference in exchange, these are some of the barriers to the activation of cryptocurrency in real transactions.
It is also the case that most new coins concentrate solely on technological advances, are designed for trading purposes on coin
exchanges, or one coin is aimed at multiple uses too much that it fails to achieve one objective well.
The Quasar project team focused on the realization of the cryptocurrency that is actively used in the real world, the development of APIs
related to the payment system that enables users to easily and conveniently make payment, while they enjoy the journey that people like
and enjoy.

"Travel makes people feel excited, but it also makes them afraid of unknown and unfairness in a strange place!"
Quasar aims to realize a fair travel ecosystem platform that allows people to travel comfortably and happily around the world through
block-chain based encryption.

1.2 Fairness

www.quasarcoin.org

"Fairness" means equal and justice in general, and refers to the fair distribution of service and wealth to a group or a society.
"Fair trade" is a trade that makes benefits equal between countries where international trade takes place,
In the past, developed countries have exploited the developing countries’ labor force and natural resources with unfair treatment, “fair
trade” is a new social movement encouraging a new trade culture.
In this respect, the significance of “fair trade” means that it is possible to provide trade in favorable terms to producers who are
alienated based on the trust between producers and consumers, guarantee their rights. This is also called 'alternative trade’.
The basic principles of “fair trade” are as follows.
First, the buyer guarantees the producer a minimum purchase price, pays a fair price agreed through dialogue and participation, prepay
before harvest or production to assist production financing. In addition, it will be able to take advantage of the profits by reducing the
circulation process by direct dealings with the producer groups, and protect the production environment through long-term contracts
rather than short-term contracts. And establish community development funds to help producers and workers' communities realize their
social benefits.
Second, the producers shall abolish discrimination related to race, nationality, religion, age or gender, and abide by the principle of
equal pay for equal work. We respect the rights of children, provide a safe and healthy working environment, and strive to protect the
environment.

1.3 What is Fair travel?

www.quasarcoin.org

"Fair travel" is also referred to as 'good travel' as a concept derived from fair trade, in which producers and consumers form a
comparable relationship. It has been promoted in European and other English-speaking countries since the 2000s to reflect the

environmental pollution, destruction of civilization and waste caused by the trips, and to give a little help to the residents of difficult
countries.
The tourism industry grows 10% every year worldwide, but most of the profits gained from tourism go to multinational corporations
belonging to G7 countries. Therefore, it is possible to use local inns and restaurants through “fair travel”, including the purchase of

locally produced goods.
Quasar aims for a ‘fair travel ecosystem platform’ by using the characteristics of block-chain such as said that P2P direct transactions in
the global environment without the intervention of third parties, transparency through the open distribution ledger, redistribution of

wealth through decentralization, and trust based on transactions. We want to build a platform in which travelers, hotels, restaurants and
stores around the world can mutually satisfy each other through fair trade.
Technically, we have built up an advanced reputation system based on a block chain, a simple payment system in the form of a credit

card, various APIs, an instant transaction system to minimize the variability of cryptocurrency, In business, it provides discounts through
discounted quasar cards and eliminates anxiety factors by using proven companies, and provides companies with promotional effects
and sales increase within the Quasar platform.

2.1 Business summary

www.quasarcoin.org

In order to become a successful currency that can be used in real commercial transactions out of the coin exchange, it is necessary
to overcome these two obstacles, namely the related infrastructure system for common use besides the encrypted money self
system, It is advantageous to concentrate on one category rather than multiple uses in order to enter the market steadily.
Quasar coin minimizes settlement time within 1 minute of block time,
In the case of small-amount settlement of trust, transaction processing is performed based on a transaction, not on a block basis.
The volatility is resolved through the exchange immediately after the buyer can sell the stock at the time of settlement.
In addition, we provide a credit card payment method and various APIs for easy settlement. We have built a reputation system and
e-commerce system using block chain technology as well as cryptocurrency, (hotels, restaurants, transportation, shopping) provide a
platform for ecosystems that mutually benefit through direct transactions without third party involvement.
On the stable platforms of these quasars, travelers can enjoy the affluent 'fair travel' with the benefit of the quasars, and the travel
companies can achieve the ultimate business purpose of promoting the effects, sales, and profits with the quasar policy and system
in place.

3.1 Quasar Coin

Summary

Specifications

Quasar Coin has adopted the bit coin platform, which has been proven
to be safe as the first cryptocurrency, and applied Light Coin to reduce
block time for quick settlement in daily transactions. In addition, for
smooth block mining, it solves the difficulty-bomb problem which
intentionally raises difficulty to make it difficult to mine.

Since the development of the quasar coin has already been completed,
the project team has focused on the development of the related
infrastructure system in order to activate the transaction of the
cryptocurrency.

3.5 Immediate Exchange

www.quasarcoin.org

In addition to the price fluctuation in the real time on the coin exchange, the cryptocurrency may have a difference in transaction amount for each
exchange.
In the case of a business that has received payment by coin in general commercial transactions, there may be a situation where the coin is not paid
because of the economic loss if the price drops at the time of converting the coin into cash. Therefore, in order to distribute coins smoothly, it is
necessary to guarantee the value of the point of settlement to a company receiving settlement by coin.
Some white papers say that it can be guaranteed by the forces that think the

value of coins will rise in order to prevent a decline in value, and they will
maintain the present value with future values. In this way, we can consider the
futures market of coins, but it also takes a certain period of time to settle down,
which is problematic in securing the value at the point of the transaction.
In order to overcome these problems and to guarantee the value at the time of
the transaction, the concept of "immediate trading" must be introduced. When a
selling company immediately puts a sell order, It is not easy.
The quasar will have the cash to sell the discounted quasar card to the traveler,
using the cash, the Quasar Foundation will become a buyer and open an Immediate Exchange, and provide an environment in which the business
operator can securely receive a quasar coin.

Of course, since the transactions in the Immediate Exchange are available only for the exclusive use of the business, the selling is possible only for
coins paid for by commerce.

3.6 Reservation system

www.quasarcoin.org

In the case of overseas trips, it is necessary to make reservations regarding accommodation, food, transportation, etc. in order to make the planned budget and
schedule management. However, the problems that can often arise between travelers and related businesses are as follows.
The first is proof of the correct booking of the reservation and mutual verification. If you have not made an intention between a traveler and a business operator, but
you have made a mistake in making a booking reservation, time, or place reservation with one of the mutual mistakes, this can be a nuisance. Moreover, it may be
more embarrassing because it is outside of Korea. In such a situation, it is more so if one side does not acknowledge a mistake and makes a deterrent.

Secondly, it is a transmission of reservation fee problem. In order to pay the deposits to
foreign operators, it is necessary to pay by internationally accepted credit card or to remit
overseas. Fortunately, if you have an international credit card this can be done easily but with
manual transfers there are various problems such as manual process and confirming whether
the remittance has been done properly.

Third, it is a matter of disposal if either party has not fulfilled the contract. It induces conflict

management

by the issue of refund or compensation.
Quasar tries to solve the above problems through a block chain based reservation system.
Solves the first problem through transparent recording on a block chain that can not be
modified or altered, solves the second problem simply by transmitting the quasar coin, after
securing a certain amount of mutual reserves through the smart contract of the block chain,
we try to solve the third problem through automatic execution according to contract.

3.7 Reputation system

www.quasarcoin.org

Distributed Reputation System
In the distributed reputation system, there is no central server for reputation management, and transaction records and reputation values ​of users are
distributed and stored. Individual users participating in the service store the reputation information of multiple users by using DHT (Distributed Hash Table),
provide it when the user requests it, and the reputation information requester and the provider can not know each other.
In a distributed reputation system, it is impossible to monitor users 'transactions by the absence of a central server that acts as a trusting authority, and it
is also difficult to distinguish between users' behavior. There is a disadvantage in that communication traffic can be weighted by querying reputation
information to a plurality of users because it is necessary to make a separate request to obtain reputation information from the users.

Although reputation information can be obtained from other users even if a specific user does not provide information, it can provide scalability compared
to a centralized reputation system. However, trustworthiness of reputation value obtained from various users and trust of users are evaluated. And more
thorough control over how to communicate reputation between providers is required.
The transaction requester computes the reputation of the transaction target based on the evaluation received from multiple users. Participants in the

distributed reputation system provide individual reputation calculation methods to calculate the reputation of the transaction target based on their
reputation.
