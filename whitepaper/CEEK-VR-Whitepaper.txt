can share their knowledge or skill and
earn CEEK Tokens, so those who have a
special skill that others will pay for,
whether that is teaching piano lessons, a
course study or a martial arts class –
there will be opportunity to earn.
•
Developers earn CEEK Tokens by
leveraging CEEK’s VR authoring tools,

provide developers and those looking to
create custom VR content an environment
where they can work together so that
everyone has equal opportunity in CEEK’s
VR marketplace.
•
Voting plays a big part in CEEK
VR and it pays! For example, CEEKERS
will be able to vote to approve sponsors
who will bid on naming rights for several
existing

CEEK’s existing content distribution platform
solves a massive problem for the VR industry
by offering a platform that can be accessed by
any hardware device. For developers this is
great news because they can create content
that is no longer limited to a single hardware
manufacturer. This has been a limiting factor
until now- stifling the entire VR industry for
developers, headset manufacturers and
content creators. Combining this factor with
the ability to leverage virtual reality and the
blockchain to extend reach for world-class
entertainment partners will allow CEEK VR to
accelerate mainstream adoption of virtual
reality, while providing massive revenue
opportunities for the blockchain community,
artists, labels, fans and CEEKERS world-wide.

VR HARDWARE &
CONTENT ECOSYSTEM
Pages 7-14 offer a technical overview for developers
There are a number of considerations within
today's virtual reality hardware and content
ecosystem that are hindering mainstream
adoption of virtual reality:
1. Desktop VR, such as the HTC Vive, are
tethered devices and require an expensive
gaming computer to work. This is far too
expensive for most people. Moreover, a
desktop VR is impractical for movement.

2. Console VR, such as PlayStation VR (PSVR),
requires the added expense of a gaming
console, therefore also priced too high for
many consumers and not practical for
movement.
Both are geared more towards gaming, which
limits the practical application and ability for the
mainstream adoption of virtual reality. CEEK is
going to change that.

3. Many headsets are too complex and have
a difficult time selling without relevant content.
(9)
Mobile VR is the most cogent mechanism for
delivering VR entertainment for everyday users.
CEEK offers simple, ready-to-use mobile VR
headsets requiring no setup, no wires (no
tethers!) and, most importantly, are cost
effective. People will be able to use the mobile
phone they already own. Imagine that.

THE CHALLENGE FACING
MOBILE-POWERED VR
The most obvious and well discussed challenge
facing mobile virtual reality applications is the
much more limited power budget and thermal
constraints when compared to its desktop
PC equivalent. Running intensive graphics
applications from a battery means that lower
power components and efficient use of energy
is required to preserve battery life. In addition,
the proximity of processing hardware to the
wearer means that the thermal budget can’t
be pushed any higher either. For comparison,
mobile is typically operating within a sub-4
watt limit, while a desktop VR GPU can easily
consume 150 watts or more.
Looking back at your typical mobile SoC, this
creates additional problems that are less often
appreciated. Although mobile SoCs can pack
in a decent octa-core CPU arrangement and
some notable GPU power, it’s not possible
to run these chips at full tilt, due to both the
power consumption and thermal constraints
mentioned previously. In reality, the CPU in a
mobile VR instance wants to run for as little time
as possible, freeing up the GPU to consume the
bulk of the limited power budget. Not only does
this limit the resources available for VR logic,
physics calculations, and even background
mobile processes, but also puts a burden
on essential VR tasks, such as draw calls for
stereoscopic rendering.
The industry is already working on solutions for
this, which don’t just apply to mobile. Multiview
rendering is supported in OpenGL 3.0 and ES
3.0, and was developed by contributors from
Oculus, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Google, Epic, ARM,
and Sony. Multiview allows for stereoscopic
rendering with just a single draw call, rather

than one for each view point, reducing the
CPU requirements and also shrinking the GPU
vertex job too. This technology can improve
performance by between 40 and 50 percent.
In the mobile space, Multiview is already
supported by a number of ARM Mali and
Qualcomm Adreno devices.
Another innovation expected to appear in
upcoming mobile VR products is foveated
rendering. Used in conjunction with eyetracking
technology, foveated rendering lightens the
load on a GPU by only rendering the user’s
exact focal point at full resolution and reducing
the resolution of objects in the peripheral vision.
The complements the human
vision system nicely and can significantly
reduce GPU load, thereby saving on power
and/or freeing up more power for other CPU or
|GPU tasks.

BANDWIDTH AND HIGHRESOLUTIONS
While processing power is limited in mobile
VR situations, the platform is still beholden to
the same requirements as other virtual reality
platforms, including the demands of low latency,
high resolution display panels. Even those who
have viewed VR displays that boasts a QHD
(2560 x 1440) resolution or the Rift headset’s
1080×1200 resolution per eye will probably
have been a little underwhelmed by the image
clarity. Aliasing is especially problematic given
that our eyes are so close to the screen, with
edges appearing particularly rough looking or
jagged during motion.
The brute force solution is to increase the
display resolution, with 4K being the next
logical progression. However, devices need
to maintain a high refresh rate regardless of
resolution, with 60Hz considered the minimum
but 90 or even 120Hz being much more
preferable. This puts a large burden on system
memory, with anywhere from two to eight times
more than today’s devices. Memory bandwidth
is already more limited in mobile VR than it is in
desktop products, which use faster dedicated
graphics memory rather than a shared pool.
Possible solutions to save on graphics bandwidth
include the use of compression technologies,

CEEK GLOBAL INNOVATIONS All Rights Reserved

TECHNICAL DOCUMENT
such as ARM and AMD’s Adaptive Scalable
Texture Compression (ASTC) standard or the
lossless Ericsson Texture Compression format,
both of which are official extensions of OpenGL
and OpenGL ES. ASTC is also supported in

hardware in ARM’s latest Mali GPUs, Nvidia’s
Kepler and Maxwell Tegra SoCs, and Intel’s
latest integrated GPUs, and can save on more
than 50 percent bandwidth in some scenarios
versus the use of uncompressed textures.

(10)
Alternatively, developers can make sacrifices to
image quality in order to reduce the stress on
system bandwidth. Geometry density can be
sacrificed or more aggressive culling used to
reduce the load, and vertex data resolution can
be lowered to 16-bit, down from the traditionally
used 32-bit accuracy. Many of these techniques
are already being used in various mobile
packages, and together they can help reduce
the strain on bandwidth.

Displays are a particularly important part in
the overall latency of a virtual reality system,
often making the difference between a
seamless and a sub-par experience. In an
ideal system, motionto-photon latency – the
time taken between moving your head and the
display responding– should be less than 20
milliseconds. Clearly a 50ms display is no good
here. Ideally panels need to be sub-5ms in
order to accommodate sensor and processing
latency as well.

Not only is memory a major constraint in
the mobile VR space, but it’s also a rather
large consumer of power too, often equal
to the consumption of the CPU or GPU. By
making savings on memory bandwidth and
usage,portable virtual reality solutions should
see longer battery life.

Currently there’s a cost performance trade-off
that favors OLED, but this could soon change.
LCD panels with support for higher refresh rates
and low black-to-white response times which
make use of cutting edge techniques, such as
blinking back lights, could fit the bill nicely.

LOW LATENCY AND
DISPLAY PANELS

last year, and we may see other manufacturers
announce similar technologies too. (11)

Audio and sensors

technology with the visuals rendered in
immersive VR environments creating an
appreciably enhanced degree of depth and
interactivity, along with producing rich and
engulfing soundscapes. This all combines in
creating what is rightfully described as audio
bliss.

Although audio in virtual reality is a critical
factor, it is largely ignored. With CEEK’s
innovative and technical expertise, we deliver
a considerably-enhanced listening encounter.
Great image quality without high-fidelity and
positionally-accurate 3D audio, along with lowlatency sensors, leave many VR experiences
lacking. Playback of spatial audio on mobile
devices is primarily being done with plug-ins
and sound objects, all on a restricted mobile
power budget. This affects the CPU, GPU, and
memory, presenting further challenges. (12)

Enhanced
Audio
Capabilities
CEEK has proprietary 4D Audio Visualization
software and hardware. Additionally, it has
integrated 3rd-party 3D audio decoders for
enhanced audio capabilities.
The CEEK 4D audio technology combines
original sound files with geometry data for
visualizing audio within the VR environment.

What You Hear is What You See
The human brain requires an audiovisual sync for generating a feeling
of presence and emotion, making our
auditory and visual senses the most
important factors in creating true
immersion. What we see and feel is
largely dictated by what we hear.
The CEEK 4D audio technology
combines haptic feedback and
proprietary physics-based 3D audio

Unlike other 3D techniques using sound objects
positioned statically in pre-set locations in the
environment, our approach enables sound to be
dynamically rendered. Furthermore, it does not
require the content creator to learn new software
or plug-ins, since the output is compatible with
most existing sound systems and do not require
custom audio playback systems.
Typical head related transfer function (HRTF) and
convolution reverb processing required for
realistic-sounding source positioning is very
processor intensive when performed with the
CPU. Our approach is much more effective as it
involves creating and offering a dedicated Digital
Signal Processor (DSP) with efficient processing
time and power for 4D positional audio

Developers and software
Finally, none of these hardware advancements
are much good without software suites, game
engines, and SDKs to support developers. After
all, we can’t have every developer reinventing
the wheel for every application. Keeping
development costs low and speeds as fast as
possible is key if we’re going to see a wide
ange of applications.
SDKs in particular are essential for implementing
key VR processing tasks, such as Asynchronous
Timewarp, lens distortion correction, and
stereoscopic rendering. Not to mention power,
thermal, and processing management in
heterogeneous hardware setups.
CEEK will offer open SDKs to streamline and
accelerate these key processing tasks for
application developers. Additionally, CEEK will
include an SDK with multi-language support,
wallets and payment gateways that are

available as completely open source solutions
that allow developers to customize their VR
environment for music, entertainment, gaming
experiences and more.
Fortunately all major hardware platform
manufacturers offer SDKs to developers,
although the market is a rather fragmented
resulting in a lack of cross-platform support.
For example, Google has its VR SDK for
Android and a dedicated SDK for the popular
Unity engine, while Oculus has its Mobile SDK
built in conjunction with Samsung for the Gear
VR. Importantly, the Khronos group recently
unveiled its OpenXR initiative which is aiming
to provide an API to cover all of the major
platforms at both the device and application
level layers, in order to facilitate easier cross
platform development. CEEK leverages
OpenXR, along with an open SDK to offer a
better cross platform, streamlined solution for
developers.

VR HARDWARE &
CONTENT ECOSYSTEM
CONCLUSION
Despite some technical challenges, the
technology is under development and mostly
already here, making VR workable for many
mobile applications. Mobile VR also has
benefits that simply do not apply to desktop,
all in one and console equivalents, which will
continue making it the platform desired by
consumers. The portability factor makes
mobile VR a compelling platform for
multimedia experiences and even light
gaming, without the need for wires connected
to a more powerful PC. While desktop and
console VR offerings focus on hardcore
gamers, CEEK’s VR Headsets were created for
increasing mainstream adoption of VR by
everyday mobile consumers of content, such
as movies and music, as well as attracting
casual gamers.

With CEEK’s multi-platform content engine,
accessibility from any VR headset device is as
easy as “one, two, three”.
The rapidly-expanding number of mobile
devices on the market being equipped with VR
capabilities makes CEEK the platform of choice
for reaching the largest target audience for
mainstream adoption. Until now, VR could not
be experienced to its fullest potential due to
overly-complex hardware and lack of quality
content. CEEK solves these challenges by
offering a device and platform agnostic solution.
Customers will have an easy-to-use headset,
coupled with premium VR content and
accessibility, all at a competitive price point.
It is a new World!

VR DELUXE BUNDLE
CASE STUDY:
CEEK VR BUNDLES MARKET VALIDATION
The importance of having a bundle for VR is
comparable to the early stages of the MP3
device player marketplace. In the early 2000s,
the MP3 market was fledging because only
“techies” who could rip and format music files
were able to use it. When Apple bundled the
iPod with iTunes, they made digital music
accessible to everyone. It became simple for
anyone to access, download, and listen to
digital music.
In much the same way, CEEK’s patent awarded,
virtual reality bundle is making VR easily
accessible for non-techies, whereby users buy
the headset bundle, sign up through the CEEK
app and gain access to a premium VR
experience with mainstream appeal.

For the release of Megadeth’s Dystopia album,
Universal Music partnered with CEEK VR to
create a VR companion called Dystopia VR,
which helped the album reach #1 on the rock
charts and open at #3 after Adele and Justin
Bieber on the Top 200 album chart. This was
completely unheard of and spoke volumes for
the demand of quality VR experiences by fans.
An artist or group has not done anything this
elaborate and groundbreaking since Pink Floyd
did “The Wall.” The same week Dystopia VR
launched, a major VR device-maker was giving
away expensive headsets, but they had few
takers. In stark contrast, CEEK sold out of units in
575 Best Buy stores. The Megadeth VR package
sold for $16.99. Check for Dystopia VR in your

Virtual Reality “Mega” Studios & Performance
Stage Implementation
CEEK is partnering with a worldclass facility
and transforming part of their location into a
360-degree VR “Mega Studio” equipped with
a Live Performance Stage.
CEEK Studios will provide music artists and
entertainment industry professionals with a
state-of-the-art audio, visual, 360-degree

blue screen and rock ‘n’ roll lighting inside a
full virtual reality digital production facility for
expanding

high-quality
and
customized VR content experiences and VR

CEEK 360-degree Studio Grade, Mega and
Micro- Studio Production facilities provide the
opportunity for enhanced, fully immersive VR
content creation for true 3D experiences.
People will be able to get up close and
personal with their favorite bands, or enjoy
time inside an interactive VR experience with
friends. Don’t just watch it, be there virtually!
Until now, CEEK has been setting up ad-hoc

(Temporary) production studio facilities as an
interim solution to meet entertainment industry
demand for creating quality virtual reality
content. This has worked well for CEEK in
years past, but not ideal as we seek to scale
VR content creation for premium entertainment
partners.
Our goal is having a permanent studio replete
with rendering farms, ultra-fast connections,
camera tracking and light field camera
technology enabling continuous capture of VR
content. This content will include interviews,
documentaries, multiple levels of education,
entertainment, movies, and music. CEEK already
has interest from top entertainment artists and
major studios interested in recording VR
experiences in our facilities.
At CEEK, our vision is to make VR content
creation universally accessible. We will make
this possible by building several state-of-the-art,
360-degree Performance Studio Grade “Mega”
Studio locations in key cities across the USA.
Then, we will expand this initiative by building
Micro-Studios the average content creator can
use for creating virtual reality content for the
CEEK environments.

key cities commensurate with the level of
support generated during the token sale.

We believe anyone should be empowered
with the ability to create quality VR content, as
this will help expand opportunity for partners
and creators inside the entertainment
metaverse.

In the event we exceed the soft cap and
depending by what margin, CEEK plans on

Micro-Studio partner locations, which will
allow
CEEK
an
acceleration

What we plan to do initially is building the
Studio grade facility for our
industry
partners at Sacramento HQ. In order to do
that, CEEK must meet the minimum
required token sale soft cap (as detailed on
our Token Structure section). If the soft cap
is not met, CEEK plans to continue
building ad-hoc studios to produce VR
content
with
entertainment
industry
partners.

The below demonstrates our desired Studio

cost 60%-75% less to build than Mega Studio
locations, but actual costs will vary for each
location. CEEK will review and publish full
specifications and projected costs for each
location prior to each location build.
Note: CEEK will measure carefully the
operating costs and profitability of each Mega
and Micro-Studios to ensure that we maintain
a solid balance sheet. Governance agreements
and safeguards will be put into place for each
location.

ECOSYSTEM ROLES
There are several ecosystem roles within CEEK VR, specifically inside CEEK CITY, where there will
be many different venues, activities, music events, movies, gaming and plenty of immersive VR
experiences. CEEKERS will play many roles in CEEK CITY and won’t be limited to any single one.

CEEKERS

DEVELOPERS

Over the last couple of
years, people started using
this as a general term in
reference to anyone using the CEEK platform
and the term stuck. CEEKERS are everyday
consumers of content and information,
primarily entertainment enthusiasts who want
an immersive VR entertainment experience for
music, VR, education or movies.

CONTENT
CREATORS
We believe that anyone should be empowered
with the ability to create quality VR content, as
such CEEK Studios will help expand
opportunity for content creators with the
CEEK Studio initiatives. CEEK Studios
locations are replete with camera
tracking and light field camera technology
to enable continuous capture of content
from content creators. Just like what
Youtube did for video content creators,
CEEK will do for VR content creators
enabling them to scale and monetization
content in
virtual reality.

Developers are the backbone
of our ecosystem creating
a wide range of applications driving a robust
VR economy.
Our goal at CEEK is to
keep development costs low and speeds
as fast as possible for developers to
accelerate processes. After all, we can’t
have every developer reinventing the
wheel for every application.
CEEK provides a suite of open SDKs that are
essential for implementing key VR processing
tasks, such as Asynchronous Timewarp,
lens distortion correction, and stereoscopic
rendering. Not to mention power, thermal, and
processing management in heterogeneous
hardware setups. Additionally, CEEK includes
an SDK with multi-language support, wallets
and payment gateways that are available as
completely open source solutions that allow
developers to customize their VR environment
for music, theatre, gaming experiences and
more. Developer bounty available.

CURATORS

Curators are paid CEEK Tokens to
play a crucial role in CEEK CITY by finding and
submitting a wide-range of high quality VR
content for CEEK community approval, building
artist demand lists for live show approval,
immersive educational courses and much more.

PARTNERS
CEEK boasts a
growing ecosystem
of world-class partners who
are using the CEEK Platform
to scale existing content in
virtual reality as well distribute
original experiences. CEEK’s
solution for Entertainment
Partners is to create new
revenue streams to replace
declining, traditional revenue
sources.

BLOCKCHAIN CONGRESS
The Blockchain Congress is a group of voting members within CEEK appointed to submit various
proposals for vote approval. The Blockchain Congress is headed by the Governor of CEEK CITY
who is the CEO who can add or remove various members in the organization. Any member
added can make a proposal, which is in the form of an Ethereum transaction to send ETHER or
execute a specific Smart Contract that other members in the Blockchain Congress and general
voters can vote for or against the proposal. Once a predetermined amount of time and a
certain number of members have voted, the proposal can be executed by the Smart Contract:
The Smart Contract will count the votes automatically and if there are enough votes it will
execute the given transaction. Click here to see the Solidity code behind the Blockchain
Congress.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
The Executive Committee is made up of key members of CEEK VR INC. that
possess corporate governance powers over Elected Officials, Blockchain
Congress and Election Voters.

VOTERS
CEEK takes Interactive Voting
to a “next level” experience in
CEEK CITY allowing CEEKERS
to access self-governing, user curated
content by providing vote based venue and
programming controls. Additionally, CEEKERS
will vote to approve sponsors for venue naming
rights, branded experiences, elected officials
and much, much more.

ELECTION
VOTERS
Election voters will vote for
officials, but before doing so, must first
“officially” register in CEEK CITY. Future
elections can leverage zero knowledge proof
protocols. Election voters can also be part of
the Blockchain Congress.

VALIDATORS
Validators play an active role in
consensus by relaying relevant
meta-data, proposals, blocks, and votes to
peers. A node that has the private keys of
an active validator and is engaged in signing
votes is called a validator-node. All nodes (not
just validator-nodes) have an associated state
(the current height, round, and step) and work
to make progress. Between two nodes there
exists a Connection, and multiplexed on top
of this connection are fairly throttled Channels
of information. An epic gossip protocol is
implemented among some of these channels
to bring peers up to speed on the most recent
state of consensus.

cryptographic key-pair for signing and have
some amount of “Voting power” in proportion
to the number of staked CEEK Tokens. Some
Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithms aim to
create a completely decentralized system
where all stakeholders – even those who are
not always online – participate in committing
blocks. Tendermint has a different approach
to block creation—CEEK validator nodes
need to be able to demonstrate 100% uptime.
Maintaining high availability potentially involves
multiple ISPs, redundant server power, and
backup hosting locations.
Economics:
Validators can bond their own CEEK tokens
or have CEEK “delegated”, or staked, to them
by holders of the token. The validators are
determined by who has the most stake
delegated to them — the top 100 full nodes with
the most stake that can demonstrate
required
uptime
will
become
CEEK
validators.
Validators and the parties that delegate
stake to them will earn CEEK as
transaction fees and block rewards through
execution of the Tendermint consensus
protocol. If validators double sign, are
frequently offline or are compromised in
some arbitrary way, their staked CEEK can
be slashed.
Validator economics about bonding period,
slashing conditions, etc. will be finalized by the
Blockchain
Congress,
Governor
and
Budgetary team.

NODES
The CEEK Hub will have 100 validator nodes

validator’s private keys. Validators have a

A consensus round begins with a proposer and
with each node broadcasting a pre-vote, which
signals that they saw, or did not see a proposal

they broadcast a pre-commit. If they are not >

VENUES &
PROGRAMMING
CEEK takes Interactive Voting to a “next level”
experience in CEEK CITY allowing CEEKERS
to access self-governing, user curated content
inside private VR experiences and in public VR
experiences through interactive vote based
venue and programming controls. All Votes
are cast using CEEK Tokens or Custom Venue
Tokens.

Private Venue Programming
Private Venues are self-governing, user curated
and do not require a vote. Simply select the
experience and enjoy.

The Director of VR Programming will establish
the programming schedule options as requests
are voted for and confirmed by Voters.

Public Venues

Additionally, CEEKERS will vote to approve
sponsors for venue naming rights, branded
experiences, elected officials and much more.
Voting bounties are included with many of the
interactive voting features as detailed below.

The first public venues that will enable
interactive vote based venue and programming
control will be the Concert Arena, Sports
Complex and Movie Theatre.

NAMING RIGHTS
CEEKERS will vote to approve naming rights for
sponsors of non-branded venues within CEEK
CITY. Currently, CEEK CITY has several nonbranded venues that are available for sponsors
to request the naming rights for. Sponsor
requests will be submitted through an online
submission form at a future date TBD.
Here’s how it works:
Once we compile the list of sponsors who
submitted requests for naming rights we will
open the voting for CEEKERS who will then
select and vote for the sponsor of their choice
for each of the following venues:
• Theatre
• Concert Arena
• Sports Complex
• Hangout Lounge
Each sponsor will be able to submit an
application for any of the venues listed above,
but can only be approved for a single venue
sponsorship during a sponsorship term (2
years). In the event that a single sponsor wins
the vote for two venues in a single term, the
winning sponsor will be required to select
which venue they prefer naming rights for and
the next runner up will then secure the naming
rights for the alternate venue.
During the application process sponsors will
submit an application with a sponsorship bid
denoted in CEEK Tokens or required Venue
Token, which will be reviewed by the Governor
and City Manager who will in turn issue a list of
accepted sponsors for the community vote for
final approval.
Voting bounty available.
A percentage of the winning sponsor’s
bid tokens to be determined (TBD) will be
distributed as community bounty rewards
to Voters who participated by casting votes

during the sponsorship selection process. The
Governor and Budget committee will set the
percentage of distribution during the budget
and appropriations meeting after the Token
sale.

BRANDED VENUE
EXCLUSION
Venues that are already branded will be excluded from naming rights for obvious reasons.
For example, the Space Center and Empire State Building are venues that we are in discussion
to launch soon and will be branded experiences in CEEK CITY.

CUSTOM VENUE
EXPERIENCES VOTING
Existing venues have the ability to institute voting for custom experiences. The venue manager can simply put out options for visitors
to choose from to vote for future venue experiences. Venues can also choose to coordinate with the City Manager for more mainstream
exposure.
Voting bounty available.
Each Venue Manager will set the bounty for
participation. Some Venues will choose to announce Airdrops to gain widespread exposure
for their venue.

NEW VENUE VOTING
New venues can be recommended by and put
to a vote within the community by anyone. The
best way to do this is to join or lobby a member of the Blockchain Congress to issue a smart
contract proposal that will be voted on by the
community. See Ecosystem Roles “Blockchain
Congress” section for more information.
Voting bounty available.
CEEKERS issuing a new venue proposals or
other considerations up for vote can include
a bounty for participants.

VR LIVE STREAM VOTING
VR live stream voting will be fun and engaging
for all and with an interactive VR environment,
CEEKERS will be given many opportunities to
vote inside various venues such as:
• MUSIC CONCERTS
• THEATRE PERFORMANCES
• SPORT EVENTS
During a live VR performance at the Concert
Arena audience members can vote for the
next song or the virtual skin the artist will wear
during the next set they play, OR for Theatre
the next act or an impromptu change in script
(Think of “Whose Line Is It Anyway”) for improvisational, interactive comedy. There are many
possibilities and we are sure to see many variations take place in CEEK VR as these events
and interactions unfold.
Voting bounty available
Artist or Venue’s choice. For example, the performing artist may set a bounty of 10 VIP tickets to a special performance that will be given away during the event to select voters, or
it could be a combination of bounties, such as
autographs of virtual album covers, never released song by artist, skins give-a-way, digital
download and more. CEEKERS may also cast
votes for requests that Venues can approve in
advance.

proud to announce the first ever VR LiveStream
event for the World Of Dance (WOD) finals that
will be VR live cast by CEEK in 2018! Get
Ready to Vote!!!
Here’s how it will work:
For example, CEEK would mint a custom
ve-nue token for voting. CEEKERS who
want to vote alongside judges during the
event will first register inside of CEEK VR to
purchase WOD COIN with CEEK Tokens prior
to the event.
• One CEEK will = 5 WOD COINS
• Throughout the WOD Finals CEEKERS will
watch each performer and then vote for
their favorite act to win during a series of
open voting periods announced during the
show.
• CEEKERS can vote as many times as they
want during the open voting period.
• As votes are cast they will be validated
through blockchain consensus providing
near real time results that will be broadcast
on a live results dashboard in CEEK venues
around the globe.

VOTE AS JUDGES
CEEKERS will be able to vote alongside judges
during special VR Live Stream events, such as
a major Music Awards show where CEEKERS
will vote in virtual reality during the live event
and decide on the spot who the winner is during the show. This is unprecedented and will
set a new standard for interactive entertainment! Imagine voting and then moments later
the artist who CEEKERS voted to win walks on
stage to accept the music award! Very exciting
indeed..
CEEK envisions that this will be “the next big
thing” for interactive entertainment and is

CEEK will use the Tendermint Consensus Engine
for voting via Proof-of-Stake mechanisms across
an array of cryptocurrencies implemented as
ABCI applications.
How it works is that participants in the protocol
are called validators; they take turns proposing
blocks of transactions and voting on them.
Blocks are committed in a chain, with one
block at each height. A block may fail to be
committed, in which case the protocol moves
to the next round, and a new validator gets to
propose a block for that height. Two stages of
voting are required to successfully commit a
block; we call them pre-vote and pre-commit.
A block is committed when more than 2/3 of
validators pre-commit for the same block in the
same round.
There is a picture of a couple doing the polka
because validators are doing something like a
polka dance. When more than two-thirds of the
validators pre-vote for the same block, we call
that a polka. Every pre-commit must be justified
by a polka in the same round.
Validators may fail to commit a block for a
number of reasons; the current proposer may be
offline, or the network may be slow. Tendermint
allows them to establish that a validator should
be skipped. Validators wait a small amount of

no +2/3

block

Prevote
Block

Wait for

from +2/3

time to receive a complete proposal block from
the proposer before voting to move to the next
round. This reliance on a timeout is what makes
Tendermint a weakly synchronous protocol,
rather than an asynchronous one. However,
the rest of the protocol is asynchronous, and
validators only make progress after hearing
from more than two-thirds of the validator set. A
simplifying element of Tendermint is that it uses
the same mechanism to commit a block as it
does to skip to the next round.
Assuming less than one-third of the validators
are Byzantine, Tendermint guarantees that
safety will never be violated - that is, validators
will never commit conflicting blocks at the same
height. To do this it introduces a few locking rules
which modulate which paths can be followed in
the flow diagram. Once a validator pre-commits
a block, it is locked on that block. Then,
1. it must pre-vote for the block it is locked on
2. it can only unlock, and pre-commit for a
new block, if there is a polka for that block
in a later round (14)
During the World of Dance Live Stream event
the Tendermint Protocol will be used to successfully broadcast validated votes during the
WOD event.

BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS
CONSENSUS PROTOCOL |
TENDERMINT
CEEK Protocol Network
As previously discussed, CEEK VR will use
Tendermint technology as a secure protocol
network. Tendermint is a partially synchronous
BFT consensus protocol derived from the DLS
consensus algorithm. Tendermint is notable
for its simplicity, performance. The protocol
requires a fixed known set of validators, where
each validator is identified by their public key.
Validators attempt to come to consensus on

one block at a time, where a block is a list of
transactions. Voting for consensus on a block
proceeds in rounds. Each round has a roundleader, or proposer, who proposes a block. The
validators then vote, in stages, on whether to
accept the proposed block or move on to the
next round. The proposer for a round is chosen
deterministically from the ordered list of
validators, in proportion to their voting power.

CEEK SCALABILITY
MODEL: SHARDING
As mentioned, one problem is that each node
needs to store the updated state of each
account on the network. ‘Sharding’ draws from
a traditional scaling technique called ‘database
sharding’, which effectively breaks a database
into pieces and puts each part on a different
server.

needs to know about transactions or blocks
that it doesn’t store, then it finds another node
with the information it needs.
CEEK plans to use sharding within a validated
network: State split into shards, each CEEK
account is in one shard, user can only transact
within the validated CEEK platform (Buy virtual
assets, mint virtual goods, Voting, etc.) as all in
shard, in CEEK VR Network transactions using
‘cryptoeconomic incentives’ that drive actors
in a system to act responsibly to ensure that
nodes are passing on valid information to other
nodes.

The goal of sharding is to move away from
requiring ‘full’ nodes – those which store the
full state of the network and every transaction
that occurs.
Instead, each node stores a subset of this data
and only verifies those transactions. If a node

Every transition specifies a Shard ID
( each asset will have own ID)
A transition “In” shard “X” implies that Shard
ID sends from to an account in shard “X”

Think of the top-level as a non-scalable,
Ethereum 1.0 style, blockchain, with a state
transition function
Tx is valid if:
Pre-state root equals shard root in global
state
Signatures (⅔ of randomly pre-selected set
of 135 are valid)
Shard root in global state becomes poststate root

A transaction grouping in shard “X” contains
zero or more transactions in shard X
Specifies pre-state root and post-state root for

THE ECONOMICS
In a scalable model, contract to contract calling
requires actual transactions, not just virtual
messages. This can be made censorship
resistant, there is common knowledge that info
to create sub call exits, so sub calling can be
compelled.
First k bits of an address is a shard ID, attempting
to synchronously call a contract outside of shard
triggers on CEEK like expectation. Transaction
groups on all K have same gas limit

KITS.

CEEKERS can update the global state through
transactions made on the CEEK blockchain
or through off-chain VR channels (ChainLink).
Time-stamping through the CEEK blockchain
ensures that all participants in each VR
reach consensus on the shared VR state in
a decentralized and provably fair way. We
believe that the key to successful blockchain
VR implementation lies in solving the scalability
problem.

CEEK SMART CONTRACTS AND
CELEBRITY COIN MINTING
CELEBRITY COIN AND VIRTUAL
MERCHANDISE MINTING
CEEK allows celebrity artists to use a special tool
called the Celebrity Coin Mint, whereby unique
custom minted coins are created as event
tickets that provide artists access to new,
untapped and unlimited revenue streams.
These celebrity minted coins and virtual
merchandise items take on the traits of
cryptocurrency as each are assigned their own
Ethereum address, therefore offer fans the
ability to cash in by owning rare items that can
gain in value very quickly in virtual reality. At
times, celebrity artists will sign these items with
special cryptographic token signatures that
cannot be duplicated and are authenticated on
the blockchain as to their rarity and value.
1. CEEK VIRTUAL ITEM MINT
The CEEK Virtual Mint, smart contract is a token
conversion protocol that will enable Celebrities
to easily create a custom venue tokens or coins
that allow them to create their own “in game”
currencies and that can be used for other
purposes, including those with special token
signatures or for those creating voting
applications that use tokens. The CEEK Mint
also allows for creating of virtual goods and
other virtual items such as:
• Concert Tickets that have adaptive,
transformative properties. Tickets could be
programmed to change after admission into
a VR concert for example, changing into an
album cover signed with a cryptographic
authenticated signature by the performing
music artist or the ticket could allow
someone to win access to an after party
VIP event. So many possibilities.
• Virtual Skins - These can be created and
offered for sale to other CEEKERS or if
worn by one of the celebrity performers
could become quite valuable.
• In-game items (Swords, GEMS, etc.)
• Frequent visitor coupons offering venue
perks
• CEEK PET accessories could be created
that increase the characteristics and value
of pets. Again, many possibilities and
variations will be seen in the future.

The following customizations can be made
during the virtual item creation:
• Name
• Total Supply
• CEEK Token exchange rate
• Tradable Item or Locked
• White List Transfer Options - transfer only
to approved exchanges
• Melt percentage fee - Developers can
program items to have a fee that they can
recoup if the item were ever melted by the
purchaser.
NOTE: Once an item is created as a “tradable”
virtual good, then it will always be tradable or
transferrable. This opens up an exciting option
for people who want to create marketplaces
where they can profit from trading fees or if
they want to only allow their virtual items traded
through approved exchanges.
For example, Clash Of Clans could decide to
create their GEMS inside of CEEK Virtual Reality
and could allow Clashers to use these in-game,
creating an entirely new opportunity and market
place for their players to take advantage of.
2. The CEEK Virtual Mint Registry will keep
track of all created virtual tokens, coins, and
other virtual items which will be recorded onto
the blockchain for immutable tracking. This
Smart Contract stores all virtual goods in one
“monolithic” Smart Contract which will save 10X
gas cost for transactions.
Each virtual token, coin or item created will be
ERC20 compliant and be provided their own
unique Ethereum address through a type of
ERC20 Adapter that uses the Bancor Protocol.
3. Payment Gateway, Smart Contract will
govern the on-chain and off-chain payments
through ChainLink.
4. Smart Wallet will allow CEEKERS to store
their valuable, virtual items, custom tokens,
coins, tickets, CEEK PETS, custom gaming
items and anything of value in virtual reality
that allows CEEKERS to carry and control their
virtual goods!

utilize smart contracts as often as feasible. Our
long term plan is to process all transactions on
blockchain.
Content & Licenses (25%)
We will finalize the build of our innovative
360 bluescreen facilities for capturing original
content. We built an ad-hoc (temporary) VR
Capture Studio at Center Staging in Burbank, CA
for the filming of the Dystopia VR experience.
Our goal is to have a permanent studio replete
with camera tracking and light filed camera
technology to enable continuous capture of
content from artists. We already have interest
from Top artist from all studios to record VR
experiences in our facilities once completed. If
we do not raise the required capital to build a
permanent studio, we will continue to build the
ad hoc studios at various locations.
Part of the proceeds will also cover licenses,
publishing, acquiring and creating original
content and enabling content creators to easily
distribute through our platform.
Marketing and Business Development (25%)
We will leverage our channel partners and high

profile artists with large fanbase for revenue
generation and organic user growth. Our
marketing efforts will leverage the amplification
benefits of having channel partners with
billions of our target users. Our content and
social efforts have driven more users than
any other channel. This is a systematic way
that we can grow our users, since we have a
pretty good indicator of our user metrics. We
are also creating marketing automation and
a highly scalable referral engine through API
integrations. We have already completed this
kind of integration for our marketing promotions
with Apple iTunes.
These integrations will continue to be a big
focus for us moving forward. In many cases
with no API’s of this kind existing for most of our
partners, this becomes a huge distinguishing
advantage. These integrations will serve as
a structured referral engine to drive ongoing
users to the CEEK community.
We will also engage with App Platform
promotions (ios, Android etc), event marketing,
content marketing, SEM and other influencer
marketing.
36 months of live operations (10%)
This will provide us financial stability to build
strong market share and leadership through
community growth in the early months while
there is high interest but low awareness of
options in VR entertainment.
