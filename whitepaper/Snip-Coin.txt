Snip
The​ ​decentralized,​ ​user-generated​ ​news​ ​platform
09.25.17
Abstract​ ​(Vision)
News is broken. A small group of corporations decide which information is worthy of
print, promoting clickbait and biased articles, and people who create great content are
rarely rewarded for their hard efforts. No wonder that trust in the media is at an
all-time​ ​low.
Snip is a new type of news platform, decentralized and powered by the community. On
Snip, anyone can write a news story about any topic, and readers can find news that
matters to them. Contributors are rewarded with tokens according to the popularity of
their posts and comments. A community-based news site, owned by the community,
can become the top news site in the world and cover any subject, from breaking news
to​ ​entertainment​ ​and​ ​everything​ ​in​ ​between.
The content on the platform is personalized for each user using an open-source
newsfeed algorithm, and users can choose their own algorithm. Since people prefer
reading short and concise stories, the default algorithm assigns higher value to short
content.
At Snip we strongly believe that there shouldn’t be a single arbiter of the truth and that
relying on content selected by the mainstream media is a form of censorship. Snip
content is not censored and is stored in a decentralized manner. Users will choose their
own trusted content filters, allowing them to ignore specific words or sources of
content, but any legal content meeting basic community standards (e.g. not spam) will
be​ ​allowed​ ​to​ ​stay​ ​on​ ​the​ ​platform.

“Not​ ​everyone​ ​can​ ​become​ ​a​ ​great​ ​writer,
but​ ​a​ ​great​ ​writer​ ​can​ ​come​ ​from​ ​anywhere.”

1.​ ​Introduction

The Internet has profoundly changed the news industry. In the past, local and
national publishers enjoyed a monopoly on the distribution of information, providing
them with a strong hold on reader’s attention, which in turn provided them with a
constant stream of revenue from advertisers. The barriers to entry for new publishers
were​ ​high,​ ​requiring​ ​them​ ​to​ ​have​ ​enough​ ​capital​ ​to​ ​buy​ ​or​ ​rent​ ​printing​ ​presses.
The first sign of change appeared in 1996, when an e-mail list named Craigslist
turned into a website for classified advertisements. Classified ads were a strong source
of revenue for newspapers worldwide, and in a few years Craigslist and similar
websites practically destroyed this source of revenue. A study shows ​[1] that from
2000 to 2007 the news industry lost approximately $5 Billion in classified ad revenues
to Craigslist. From the launch of Craigslist in 1996 to today, it’s safe to assume that the
industry​ ​has​ ​lost​ ​more​ ​than​ ​$10​ ​Billion​ ​in​ ​revenue​ ​due​ ​to​ ​Craigslist​ ​alone.
Classified ads aren’t the only reason news outlets became less profitable. When
news outlets moved from printed papers to the Internet and started offering advertising
space, they no longer held a monopoly. The same ads that appeared on their websites
appeared in blogs and in non-news platforms, and eventually superior ads appeared on
Google and later Facebook. With more advertising options, brands paid less for ad real
estate,​ ​leaving​ ​publishers​ ​with​ ​less​ ​income.
At the same time, the Internet created a major new problem for publishers - the
need to create unique content. When distribution was owned by publishers they could
afford to create poor content which was substantially similar to content from other
news providers, and readers couldn’t easily switch to a different news outlet. On the
Internet, users are always a click away from a competitor’s website, and if a
publisher’s content isn’t engaging enough, it is quickly ignored in favor of another
news​ ​outlet.
The Internet brought another important revolution - the rise of user-generated
content. Instead of readers hoping to get a column published in a known newspaper,
now anyone can create a website and broadcast their thoughts to the world. This
change has been facilitated by early platforms like Geocities and Blogger.com and
later WordPress, Tumblr, Medium, Facebook, and others. User-generated content has
gradually gained more and more of reader’s attentions, leaving classic publishers with
a smaller share of attention and a smaller share of ad revenue. The competition with
user-generated content is especially tough for news outlets, since many users create
basic news content for free, hoping to propagate their ideas and not necessarily
expecting​ ​profit.
Most news outlets were unable to create high-quality content good enough to
compete in the Internet age, and in order to stay in business they pivoted to three main
types​ ​of​ ​content:
3

1. Entertainment - For example. quizzes like “Which Harry Potter character are
you?”​ ​or​ ​ ​amusing​ ​photos​ ​like​ ​“5​ ​of​ ​the​ ​best-looking​ ​politicians​ ​in​ ​the​ ​world.”
2. Clickbait​ ​Articles​ ​-​ ​For​ ​example​ ​“You’ll​ ​never​ ​believe​ ​how​ ​this​ ​girl​ ​...”
3. Provocative Op-eds - For example, “This scandal shows everything that’s
wrong​ ​with...”
In some cases, several types of content are combined together, such as “Three
reasons why the Democratic/Republican party is ruining America”. Users don’t value
this kind of content and most of them don’t develop loyalty to news brands who
publish it, but the entertainment and outrage drive user traffic, which provides enough
ad​ ​revenue​ ​to​ ​keep​ ​the​ ​publisher​ ​in​ ​business.

1.1.​ ​Monetization​ ​of​ ​Internet​ ​Content
At the beginning of the Internet age, text and image ads had a relatively high
conversion rate ​[2]​, allowing corporate and independent websites to monetize their
content directly. Over time, users got used to the ads and started ignoring them,
causing click rates to go down and revenues to decline. Many websites responded with
more disruptive ads (pop-ups, autoplay videos, etc.), which in turn alienated users and
encouraged the adoption of ad-blockers. Today, publishers of internet content have to
use​ ​one​ ​of​ ​the​ ​following​ ​methods​ ​in​ ​order​ ​to​ ​be​ ​able​ ​to​ ​generate​ ​revenues.
1.1.1.​ ​Subscriptions
The most direct method to monetize content online is to charge for access to
the content. Subscriptions are growing as a source of revenue, partly thanks to the
2016 elections ​[3,4]​, but are mostly limited to high-end brands like The New York
Times, The Economist, and The Wall Street Journal. Most news outlets don’t have an
enthusiastic, affluent following which is willing to pay, and must provide their content
for free to survive. A large majority of people view news content as a product which
should​ ​be​ ​provided​ ​to​ ​users​ ​for​ ​free​ ​and​ ​subsidized​ ​by​ ​ads.
1.1.2.​ ​Ad​ ​Networks​ ​&​ ​Tracking
Traditional ads are still an important part of the news ecosystem and the main
source of revenue for most news outlets. Instead of serving their own ads, most
websites present ads through ad networks, companies which track users across the
Internet, gather various types of information about their habits, and attempt to present
the most relevant ads. This is achieved by planting “cookies” (a kind of digital tracker)
on Internet browsers, allowing the ad networks to follow a single user as they browse
various websites. In an attempt to create more engaging ads, sometimes ad networks
will also purchase data on users from online data brokers, who collect data on users in
various methods ​[5,6]​. The tracking methods applied by ad networks are generally
hidden, and users are kept ignorant of the data collected on them. The most famous ad

4

network is Google’s AdSense, but there are many lesser-known ad networks that are
quite​ ​widespread.
For a growing number of users, the price of ad networks is not only less
privacy but also a higher data bill. On many websites the browser loads more ad
tracker data than actual content, and most of the loading time on the website is various
ads and ad trackers ​[7]​. For users who are browsing the Internet on a mobile device,
this means higher data costs and an inferior user experience. The data costs have been
another contributing factor to the prevalence of ad-blockers, especially in developing
markets,​ ​as​ ​seen​ ​in​ ​the​ ​following​ ​chart​ ​[8]​:

Despite the massive use of trackers on Internet websites, ad-blockers and low click
rates have reduced the efficiency of standard advertising, encouraging the rise of native
advertising.
1.1.3.​ ​Native​ ​Advertising
Definition​ ​from​ ​Wikipedia​ ​[9]​:
Native advertising is a type of advertising, mostly online, that matches the form and function of the
platform upon which it appears. In many cases, it manifests as either an article or video, produced
by an advertiser with the specific intent to promote a product, while matching the form and style
which would otherwise be seen in the work of the platform's editorial staff. The word "native"
refers​ ​to​ ​this​ ​coherence​ ​of​ ​the​ ​content​ ​with​ ​the​ ​other​ ​media​ ​that​ ​appears​ ​on​ ​the​ ​platform.

The most noticeable examples of native advertising are the promoted search
results on Google and the sponsored posts on Facebook. These ads are very effective
and account for more than 80% of the revenue of the two companies ​[10]​, or $107
Billion in 2016. The main reason that native advertising is so effective is that most

5

users fail to notice that a specific piece of content is sponsored, and click on it
assuming​ ​the​ ​platform​ ​is​ ​actually​ ​providing​ ​them​ ​with​ ​the​ ​most​ ​relevant​ ​content.
In the past years, news websites have gradually embraced the trend of native
advertising. Since the native format of these websites is news articles, their ads consist
of commercial content disguised as a regular news article. Some news outlets mark the
content as sponsored but many do not ​[11]​, and many times users reach these articles
via​ ​social​ ​media​ ​and​ ​don’t​ ​ever​ ​see​ ​an​ ​indication​ ​that​ ​the​ ​content​ ​is​ ​sponsored.
As opposed to commercials on ad networks, native advertising requires the
advertiser to create content specifically for a single platform. This provides a
significant advantage to large platforms, which have the scale needed to make native
content creation worthwhile, and also have the sale force necessary to engage the
advertisers. Effectively, small news websites and bloggers can’t utilize native
advertising.
1.1.4.​ ​Affiliates​ ​&​ ​Donations
Small news outlets and bloggers use ad networks but usually can’t generate
significant income from them. Instead, they depend upon affiliate ads and reader
donations.​ ​The​ ​profits​ ​are​ ​meager,​ ​but​ ​enough​ ​to​ ​maintain​ ​ ​many​ ​sites.
1.2.​ ​The​ ​Consolidation​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Internet
The trends described previously have created a winner-takes-all environment,
in​ ​which​ ​Facebook​ ​and​ ​Google​ ​reap​ ​a​ ​large​ ​majority​ ​of​ ​the​ ​revenue​ ​[12,13]​:

Facebook, specifically, holds a great deal of user’s attention, allowing the company to
influence the type of content made by news publishers. For instance, to satisfy the
preferences of the Facebook newsfeed algorithm, news outlets are creating original
video​ ​content​ ​which​ ​is​ ​intended​ ​solely​ ​for​ ​their​ ​Facebook​ ​audience​ ​[14]​.
6

In the past few years, news outlets have created a significant amount of native
content on Facebook to encourage users to engage with their website, with Facebook
enjoying the ad revenue associated with the content and refusing to share it with
publishers. Independent bloggers who want to reach a large audience also post on
Facebook, with no hope of receiving a portion of the income that Facebook reaps from
user’s engagement with the posts. Alternatively, they can post on a blogging website
like Medium or Tumblr, or even on Twitter, but there still have no hope of receiving a
cash​ ​reward​ ​for​ ​their​ ​great​ ​content.
Facebook’s control over the Internet is especially worrisome because of its
walled garden. The content on Facebook isn’t on the open web and is blocked to
search engines. Users who try to access it without a Facebook account encounter
annoying pop-ups encouraging them to sign in, and often cannot access the content at
all.​ ​The​ ​same​ ​is​ ​true​ ​for​ ​Twitter​ ​posts,​ ​though​ ​to​ ​a​ ​lesser​ ​extent.
The people who suffer the most from the current system are independent
bloggers and small news outlets. Unless they succeed in creating extremely viral
content, these content creators have basically no way to create content profitably.
Unfortunately, even high-quality viral content may not be profitable enough to pay the
bills. In 2016, a Mother Jones story on private prisons in the US reached a massive
audience and was discussed nationally, but only racked $5,000 in ad revenue, while
costing the magazine $350,000 ​[15]​. This example demonstrates that the current
system is not sustainable for great investigative journalism outside of the main news
outlets.

2.​ ​Solution​ ​-​ ​Snip

Solving the problems of the news industry requires a product which isn’t an
incremental improvement but a revolutionary advancement. Such a solution would
have to create significant value for news consumers, be transparent and fair in the
distribution​ ​of​ ​news,​ ​and​ ​award​ ​great​ ​content​ ​creators.

2.1.​ ​Overview
Snip is a decentralized, user-generated news platform where anyone can write a
news story (“snip”) about a topic of their choice, and read news on the issues they care
about. The platform has no editor deciding what’s fit to print and the decision which
content​ ​to​ ​view​ ​is​ ​made​ ​personally,​ ​by​ ​community​ ​users.
Snip’s goal is to become the place where people go to learn and stay updated
on any subject - politics, tech, sports, art, philosophy, etc. The stories are presented to
readers in an algorithmic feed, tailored to each user’s interests using open-source
algorithms (detailed in section 2.4). People are busy and prefer to read concise content,
so the platform will be oriented towards short content. Writers will be able to post
content​ ​of​ ​any​ ​length..
The platform is powered by the community, with members writing stories,
voting on the best stories, engaging in discussions, and rewarding contributors with
tokens. The important role of community feedback gives writers an incentive to create
high-quality content. The voting mechanism also assists in personalizing content for
users,​ ​creating​ ​a​ ​feed​ ​which​ ​is​ ​truly​ ​valuable​ ​and​ ​interesting.
By harnessing the power of the community, Snip aims to become the top news
destination on every subject. Importantly, the product will be accessible to anyone, and
will​ ​not​ ​require​ ​an​ ​understanding​ ​of​ ​cryptocurrencies​ ​and​ ​tokens.
The Snip platform will feature a new Ethereum-based (ERC20) token named
SnipCoin, which is used to buy products on the Snip network and to reward content
contributors.​ ​The​ ​role​ ​of​ ​the​ ​token​ ​is​ ​detailed​ ​in​ ​the​ ​following​ ​pages.

2.2.​ ​Freedom​ ​of​ ​Speech
As opposed to other platforms, users in the Snip community will enjoy freedom
of​ ​speech,​ ​without​ ​a​ ​centralized​ ​authority​ ​dictating​ ​right​ ​from​ ​wrong.​ ​Therefore:
1. Snip​ ​does​ ​not​ ​censor​ ​content​ ​on​ ​the​ ​platform.

2. Users​ ​will​ ​never​ ​be​ ​banned​ ​or​ ​shadow​ ​banned.

3. To ensure the integrity of the content, all posts and comments will be stored in
the​ ​decentralized​ ​service​ ​IPFS.

4. On the Snip website, content may be redacted according to local law, for
instance​ ​in​ ​cases​ ​of​ ​copyright​ ​violations​ ​or​ ​violent​ ​threats.

8

2.3.​ ​Content​ ​Creation
News stories need to be original and provide insight. Stories that copy content
from an existing news story (without consent of the creator) remain on the IPFS
network but do not appear on the Snip platform, and the writer is notified. Content
contributors are asked to provide references for stories (if such a reference exists), and
to decide on the percentage they want to share with the referenced publisher, with a
10% minimum, a figure which is subject to future changes based on the discretion of
the Snip company. Revenue sharing rewards original journalism and helps it flourish,
especially once Snip becomes a large platform where many people get their news. The
Snip company will share revenue with individual contributors, publishers or
non-profits (such as Wikipedia) but not with corporations or governments that offer
content for free. Of course, regardless of the Snip company’s policy, members of the
community​ ​can​ ​reward​ ​tokens​ ​for​ ​content​ ​on​ ​their​ ​own​ ​terms.

2.4.​ ​Personalization​ ​&​ ​Content​ ​Filtering
The Snip platform is intended to be the most complete news source on any
topic or current event. As a result, the volume of content will certainly be more than
any single user can consume. The solution is a personal feed with customized content.
The algorithm aims to reach a high ​hit rate​, meaning that the feed should contain a
large percentage of articles which interest the reader. This enables high quality
notifications,​ ​ ​keeping​ ​users​ ​informed​ ​about​ ​the​ ​topics​ ​they​ ​value​ ​most.
To reach a high hit rate, the content is personalized for each user using
open-source algorithms, some developed by the Snip company and some by the
community. Users choose their own preferred personalization algorithm when they
register, and can change it at any time. They can follow favorite contributors, boosting
them in the algorithm. By making the algorithms open source, as opposed to those of
platforms like Facebook or Twitter, Snip ensures transparency and allows for the kind
of constant improvement that only a community of contributors can achieve. In stark
contrast to today’s news publishers, Snip has no editorial board and does not decide
which​ ​stories​ ​are​ ​fit​ ​to​ ​print​ ​and​ ​which​ ​are​ ​not.
To assist developers, Snip provides an API and publishes sample datasets to
allow developers to test their own algorithms. The following is a partial list of features
which​ ​are​ ​or​ ​will​ ​be​ ​available​ ​to​ ​developers:
1. Post​ ​publish​ ​date.
2. Text​ ​features​ ​-​ ​keywords,​ ​topic,​ ​length,​ ​etc.
3. Reactions​ ​from​ ​similar​ ​users.
4. Likes.

5. Dislikes.
6. Marked​ ​as​ ​spam.
7. Comments.

9

8. A​ ​list​ ​of​ ​the​ ​user’s​ ​followed​ ​contributors.

9. Contributors’​ ​metadata​ ​including​ ​number​ ​of​ ​followers,​ ​region,​ ​language,​ ​etc.
The Snip company rewards developers for creating useful personalization algorithms
with​ ​tokens​ ​reserved​ ​for​ ​that​ ​purpose.

2.5.​ ​Safety
Users need to feel safe when using the Snip platform. Therefore, along with
choosing their preferred news feed personalization algorithm, users can add their own
rules to filter out content that they prefer not to see. For example, users may choose not
to view content they believe to be fake news, or content deemed to be of poor quality
by​ ​community​ ​members​ ​they​ ​trust.​ ​This​ ​ ​can​ ​be​ ​done​ ​in​ ​a​ ​few​ ​ways::

1. Blocking​ ​posts​ ​or​ ​comments​ ​from​ ​specific​ ​users.
2. Blocking specific words (or word groups) from appearing in the personal
newsfeed​ ​or​ ​notifications.
3. Choosing a spam filter - users can choose their own spam filter (or no filter at
all),​ ​in​ ​the​ ​same​ ​manner​ ​as​ ​the​ ​personalization​ ​algorithm.

By default, these filters are not public so that each user’s privacy is protected. Of
course, users can choose to share these filters publicly if they want, allowing others to
utilize​ ​them.

2.6.​ ​Encouraging​ ​Diverse,​ ​High-Quality​ ​Content
Snip’s goal is to cover everything happening the world, but some things are
much easier to write about than others. For instance, it may take a writer 30 seconds to
share a funny anecdote, whereas explaining a complicated scientific breakthrough in
simple​ ​words​ ​could​ ​easily​ ​take​ ​the​ ​same​ ​writer​ ​30​ ​minutes.
If the only incentive for content contributors is the number of clicks or likes,
most of the content on the platform remains basic, easy-to-create content, and
high-quality content is not rewarded. To avoid this, the Snip company uses a portion of
the​ ​tokens​ ​as​ ​an​ ​incentive​ ​mechanism​ ​in​ ​the​ ​following​ ​manner:
1. Rewarding scarce content - Tokens will be added to content categories that are
poorly represented on the platform. If, for instance, there is a shortage in live
sports coverage on the platform, bonus tokens will be rewarded specifically to
live​ ​sports​ ​snips.
2. Suggestions from readers - If readers express interest in an event or a news story,
these requests are posted anonymously, and writers receive bonus tokens for
writing​ ​a​ ​snip​ ​on​ ​the​ ​requested​ ​subject​ ​or​ ​story.
Categories and reader suggestions are visible to everyone in the community
and all writers have the opportunity to collect the bonus tokens by writing an engaging
story.
10

To assist the news feed algorithms and the incentive systems, contributors are required
to​ ​note​ ​the​ ​category​ ​of​ ​their​ ​snip.​ ​Some​ ​of​ ​the​ ​suggested​ ​categories​ ​are:
●
●
●
●

Breaking​ ​News
Science​ ​and​ ​Technology​ ​News
Politics​ ​Op/Ed
Live​ ​Sports

Machine Learning algorithms can help contributors with the categorization and
readers are encouraged to flag content if it is categorized incorrectly. An additional
algorithm receives the writer’s decided category and user feedback and decides on the
appropriate​ ​category.​ ​All​ ​algorithms​ ​are​ ​open-source​ ​and​ ​available​ ​to​ ​the​ ​community.

2.7.​ ​Privacy
User data is private and is never shared with third-parties. User votes are
private​ ​and​ ​cannot​ ​be​ ​seen​ ​by​ ​anyone​ ​else,​ ​unless​ ​the​ ​user​ ​decides​ ​to​ ​share​ ​them.

2.8.​ ​Snip​ ​and​ ​the​ ​Open​ ​Web
The content published on the platform is searchable and available for everyone
to read and does not require logging in or providing personal information, such as an
email​ ​address​ ​or​ ​Facebook​ ​login.
Professional content, intended for subscribers, will be locked to non-paying
users.​ ​This​ ​is​ ​expected​ ​to​ ​be​ ​only​ ​a​ ​small​ ​minority​ ​of​ ​the​ ​content​ ​on​ ​the​ ​platform.

11

3.​ ​Distribution​ ​&​ ​User​ ​Acquisition

A major challenge in consumer media is distribution and user acquisition.
Many media companies which create valuable content are unable to gain users at a low
price, and high customer acquisition costs (CAC) combined with the low lifetime
value (LTV) in the ads business, create unprofitable businesses. Therefore, creating a
viral product is crucial to building a successful media company. In Snip, we’re
applying three unique methods to solve this problem and to build a company which is
consistently​ ​profitable.

3.1.​ ​Referrals
Users who refer their friends to the platform will receive a small token reward,
helping to attract a critical mass of users to the platform. The referrers will only be
rewarded if their friends become day-to-day users of the platform, substantially
reducing the risk of gaming the system. The cost in tokens is expected to be
significantly lower than ad spending since people are much more inclined to receive a
friend’s referral than respond to advertisement. In addition, users will probably refrain
from referring friends who won’t be interested in the product because those will not
help​ ​them​ ​to​ ​gain​ ​tokens.

3.2.​ ​Token​ ​Holder​ ​Promotion
Token holders have a vested interest that the platform prospers and offers more
content and services. Therefore, they are likely to promote the product to family and
friends,​ ​without​ ​cost​ ​to​ ​the​ ​company.

3.3.​ ​Discovery​ ​of​ ​Viral​ ​Content
For the past 18 months, the Snip company has been collecting high-resolution
data on the virality of content online, with a focus on social networks and news
websites. Using this data, the company is applying Machine Learning technologies
(NLP, statistical analyses, etc) to find topics which are most likely to gain traction in
social networks. The topics will be recommended to our community of writers,
allowing them to produce extremely viral content and collect token rewards. This
technology​ ​has​ ​already​ ​proven​ ​itself​ ​in​ ​the​ ​current​ ​product.

4.​ ​Business​ ​Model

To keep the Snip ecosystem healthy and prosperous, Snip relies on a variety of
income​ ​sources:
1. Subscriptions
2. Tipping
3. Advertising
4. Ad-free​ ​version
12

Users don’t like ads and the goal is to minimize the revenue from ads and focus
on other revenue streams, but for the foreseeable future we expect our revenue to
include all four of these sources. A majority of the revenue in each category goes to
content contributors, further incentivizing people to create great content. The Snip
company takes a small cut, allowing for hiring talent, product development, and
day-to-day​ ​operations.

4.1.​ ​Subscriptions
Snip offers an engaging subscription service, paid for monthly, with tokens.
Our first widespread offering is audio snips. Audio snips is a personalized feed of the
stories users find most interesting, in audio form. Audio snips can replace or
supplement listening to the news on the radio. This is aimed at commuters, people with
disabilities, and anyone who enjoys listening to the news. This is projected to be a
very​ ​popular​ ​offering.
An additional subscription service Snip offers is a professional content stream,
meaning summaries of technical developments in a specific field or profession. The
professional content service can help users keep up-to-date in their professional field,
whether it is cancer research, database technology, or South African politics. Some
topics are, of course, geared towards a small niche market. The expectation is that
these topics develop a devoted, if small, following. In this offering, the community can
request professional content and offer payment, allowing writers will to supply the
content​ ​that​ ​readers​ ​really​ ​need.
It is important to note that these offerings are provided as streams, rather than
dailies.

4.2.​ ​Tipping
Readers have the option of tipping content contributors for great posts or
comments, similar to tipping on Reddit via Reddit Gold. The tipping is facilitated by
tokens, allowing for small, cheap micro-payments. The content creator receives 97%
of the tip, with only 3% going to the Snip company. This figure could change in the
future, upwards or downwards, based on the discretion of the Snip company. The
company​ ​is​ ​incentivized​ ​to​ ​reward​ ​writers​ ​and​ ​keep​ ​the​ ​best​ ​writers​ ​in​ ​the​ ​platform.

4.3.​ ​Advertising
Snip has a duty to provide users with the most interesting and relevant
advertisements as possible. Ads are native and are required to present content that
provides value for users. Ads are visibly marked and users always know when they’re
seeing an ad. Users can flag bad or misleading advertisements, and those ads and ad
creators are policed and removed if necessary. Users can always see their advertising
profile and understand why they are shown specific ads. User information is never
provided​ ​to​ ​advertisers​ ​or​ ​other​ ​third​ ​parties.
13

4.4.​ ​Ad-free​ ​version
Users are offered an ad-free version which is funded by a monthly subscription.
Since ad income can be tenuous, and users often dislike advertisements, Snip hopes
that​ ​most​ ​users​ ​will​ ​choose​ ​to​ ​go​ ​ad-free.

14

5.​ ​The​ ​Snip​ ​Token​ ​(SnipCoin)

SnipCoin is the exclusive token of the Snip platform, and can be used both for
rewarding​ ​content​ ​contributors​ ​and​ ​for​ ​rewards​ ​for​ ​the​ ​various​ ​services.
The total number of SnipCoins is 10,000,000,000 (ten billion), minted in
advance.​ ​The​ ​Snip​ ​company​ ​rewards​ ​contributors​ ​with​ ​SnipCoins​ ​from​ ​two​ ​sources:
1. An initial pool of 2,100,000,000 SnipCoins designated in the token sale (to be
detailed in this paper). The initial amount of weekly SnipCoins is 15,500,000,
and will decrease by 57,500 SnipCoins every week, until reaching 0 over 267
weeks​ ​(5​ ​years).
2. The platform’s revenue - A large portion of the platform’s revenue (in
SnipCoins) is added to the pool, and a small cut of the revenue is passed on to
the​ ​Snip​ ​company.
Revenue from subscriptions and ads is expected to increase over time as the network
grows, and its share out of the total pool size will constantly grow. Eventually the
share of pre-allocated SnipCoins is expected to become negligible, as demonstrated in
the​ ​chart​ ​below.

15

7.​ ​Business​ ​Landscape
7.1.​ ​Competition

Snip’s competitors can be divided into two main categories - news publishers
and​ ​social​ ​networks.
7.1.1.​ ​News​ ​Publishers
Publishers like Fox, CNN, and the New York Times manage large newsrooms
where journalists create content guided by editors. The created content is then
presented on their website, mobile app, and in some cases, a TV network. These
platforms do not host user-generated content and their news stories are moderated by a
small group of editors. Often their content is longer than necessary, allowing them to
fit​ ​more​ ​ads​ ​into​ ​each​ ​article.
7.1.2.​ ​Social​ ​Networks
Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit are based on user-generated content but do not
reward contributors for the value they produce. Facebook is less focused on news
compared to Reddit and Twitter, which are used by many as news platforms. A major
problem with both platforms is that the news stories are provided as links, without
enough relevant information. Advertising cannot be controlled in this situation. Snip,
instead,​ ​provides​ ​short​ ​snippets​ ​with​ ​all​ ​the​ ​relevant​ ​content.
Steem is a Reddit-like social network in which content creators are rewarded
for their publications, but users usually don’t create news stories and the platform is
hardly​ ​used​ ​by​ ​mainstream​ ​users.

7.2.​ ​Snip​ ​Advantages
7.2.1.​ ​Decentralized
In contrast to mainstream publishers and social networks, the Snip network is
decentralized and owned by the community, with all the content saved openly on the
IPFS network. Content cannot be censored and users on the Snip website choose their
personal​ ​news​ ​feed​ ​algorithm.
7.2.2.​ ​News-oriented
Snip is a place for people to read news and discuss the news stories they care
about. Snip covers a wide variety of topics, allowing users to stay up-to-date on their
favorite​ ​topics​ ​in​ ​a​ ​shorter,​ ​more​ ​efficient​ ​format.
7.2.3.​ ​User-generated​ ​content
The news stories on the platform are created by the community and users
receive the vast majority of the reward for high-quality posts and comments, as
decided​ ​by​ ​the​ ​community.
17

7.2.4.​ ​Personalization
In contrast to mainstream publishers, the content on Snip is personalized for
each user. When two different people access the platform, they see two different feeds,
based​ ​on​ ​their​ ​personal​ ​preferences.
7.2.5.​ ​Ad-free​ ​option
Many users don’t like ads, and some are willing to pay for an ad-free
experience. In contrast to Facebook and Twitter, Snip gives users the option to
subscribe to an ad-free version, and users know that their payment goes directly to
content​ ​creators.

18

8.​ ​Crowdsale

To raise the funds required to continue platform development and maintenance,
a​ ​SnipCoin​ ​crowdsale​ ​will​ ​be​ ​held​ ​on​ ​September​ ​29th,​ ​2017,​ ​at​ ​23:00​ ​UTC..

● Our goal is to raise ​$8 million USD ​(hard cap). Upon reaching the goal the sale
will​ ​stop​ ​and​ ​no​ ​more​ ​contributions​ ​will​ ​be​ ​accepted.

● The minimum goal for the crowdsale is ​$0.8 million USD ​(soft cap).
Contributors​ ​will​ ​be​ ​refunded​ ​if​ ​the​ ​goal​ ​isn’t​ ​reached.
● The​ ​duration​ ​of​ ​the​ ​sale​ ​will​ ​be​ ​no​ ​more​ ​than​ ​30​ ​days​.

● 10 billion SnipCoins (SNP) will be minted, of which ​80% are designated to
the community and the contributors​. The initial distribution of tokens will
be:
○ 28%​ ​is​ ​available​ ​in​ ​the​ ​crowdsale​.

○ 30%​ ​will​ ​be​ ​sold​ ​in​ ​the​ ​future​ ​token​ ​sale​ ​and​ ​will​ ​be​ ​locked​ ​for​ ​3​ ​years.

○ 21% is reserved for the initial pool of contributor rewards. This is kept
in a time-locked vault and released every month according to the
amount transferred to the contributors during that month, with a hard
limit of 90,000,000 SNP. A portion of the contributor reward pool is
reserved for community developers (bug bounties, contributing
algorithms,​ ​etc).

○ 20.5% is designated for the Snip company and will be used internally
and for advisors and partner companies. Snip employees and founders
will not hold tokens prior to the sale and will not be rewarded with
tokens in the first 6 months after the sale. In the period of 6 to 12
months after the sale, Snip employees and founders will be rewarded
with​ ​no​ ​more​ ​than​ ​4%​ ​of​ ​the​ ​total​ ​tokens.
○ 0.5% is designated for the Snip bounty, helping to spread the word
about​ ​the​ ​Snip​ ​platform​ ​before​ ​the​ ​crowdsale.

19

● Exchange​ ​rate:

○ The current exchange rate is ​1 ETH = 76K SnipCoins (SNP). Since
the price of Ethereum fluctuates, the official ETH/SNP conversion rate
will be announced publicly a day before the sale. Unless Snip provides
an official update of the ETH/SNP conversion rate, the conversion rate
will​ ​stay​ ​constant​ ​during​ ​the​ ​sale​ ​period.

● The​ ​sale​ ​will​ ​start​ ​on​ ​September​ ​29th,​ ​2017,​ ​23:00​ ​UTC

20

9.​ ​Budget​ ​Allocation

The following charts shows a breakdown of the planned allocation of funds
raised in the token sale. The values may change over time due to unexpected
developments. Specifically, legal costs could grow significantly and take a larger share
of​ ​the​ ​pie.

● Platform Development - Most of the funds are used for building the platform:
web and mobile applications, tools for content creators, personalization
algorithms,​ ​and​ ​other​ ​necessities.
● Sales & Marketing - Funds used for creating brand awareness and attracting
the​ ​best​ ​writers​ ​to​ ​the​ ​platform.
● Internal Content Creators - The Snip company hires content creators to
ensure constant news coverage and topic diversity. This is a bootstrapping
technique​ ​that​ ​is​ ​required​ ​mainly​ ​in​ ​the​ ​early​ ​stages​ ​of​ ​the​ ​platform.
● Administration - Funds used for ensuring platform security, hiring legal
counsel,​ ​and​ ​other​ ​day-to-day​ ​administrative​ ​operations.
● Reserves​ ​-​ ​Additional​ ​funds​ ​reserved​ ​for​ ​unexpected​ ​expenditures.

10.​ ​Frequently​ ​Asked​ ​Questions
What’s​ ​Snip?

Snip is a decentralized, user-generated news platform where anyone can write a news
story (or “snip”) about a topic of their choice, and read news on the issues they care
about. The platform has no editor deciding what’s fit to print and the decision is made
solely​ ​by​ ​the​ ​community.
What​ ​does​ ​the​ ​name​ ​mean?
The word Snip is derived from the word snippet. We have found that users prefer short
snippets of high-quality information to long, articles, which often contain more filler
than​ ​information.
What​ ​are​ ​the​ ​Snip​ ​tokens?​ ​What​ ​can​ ​token​ ​holders​ ​do​ ​with​ ​them?
SnipCoin is the exclusive token of the Snip platform, and can be used for both
rewarding content contributors and paying for the various services. The tokens are sold
only for use on the Snip platform and do not provide equity or rights in the Snip
company. A Snip token is not a security and is not recommended for speculators of
any kind. Do not purchase tokens if you don’t thoroughly understand the concepts of
cryptographic tokens, token sales, and blockchain technology, and purchase them only
if you plan to use the tokens to consume Snip services. If the crowdsale reaches the
minimum​ ​amount​ ​(noted​ ​below),​ ​then​ ​the​ ​tokens​ ​are​ ​not​ ​refundable​ ​once​ ​delivered.
When​ ​will​ ​the​ ​crowdsale​ ​begin?
The crowdsale is expected to start in September and last until the earlier of 30 days, or
until $8M are collected. An official date will be announced at least 10 days before the
beginning​ ​of​ ​the​ ​crowdsale.
How​ ​much​ ​is​ ​being​ ​sold​ ​in​ ​the​ ​crowdsale?
The crowdsale goal is to sell $8M, with a minimum sell of $800K. If $800K isn’t sold,
the​ ​transferred​ ​funds​ ​will​ ​be​ ​returned​ ​to​ ​buyers.
What​ ​currencies​ ​are​ ​accepted​ ​in​ ​the​ ​crowdsale?
The accepted currencies will be announced at least 10 days before the beginning of the
crowdsale.
What​ ​will​ ​the​ ​funds​ ​be​ ​used​ ​for?
As detailed in section ​9, the money is expected to be used mainly for platform
development, and to a lesser extent for administration costs, sales and marketing, and
content​ ​creation.
Are​ ​Snip​ ​tokens​ ​transferable?

22

Yes, Snip tokens are transferable and are not in control of the Snip company.
As described in this white paper, some of the tokens are locked in time-vaults, a
measure​ ​applied​ ​to​ ​protect​ ​the​ ​token​ ​buyers.
