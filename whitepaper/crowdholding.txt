Mission
Unite global businesses and the public on a co-creation
platform, ensuring prosperity for both.

Crowdholding

1_Problem
In 2017 more than 90% of startups will fail due to entirely solvable issues (Forbes). Of
founders who faced failure, a massive 42% attributed it to a lack of market need for
the product, while a staggering 29% of startups fail due to a lack of capital (Fortune).
C-level execs agreed that their companies were bad at identifying problems, most
notably in their products, often due to a lack of outside perspective (HBR).
Plenty of these companies have a great idea, capable team, and even a solid
company structure. What’s often missing is the ability to build an audience —
something often critical for many modern products to function properly.
There is a severe disconnection between companies — small or large — and the
public. Whether it’s to validate a new product, or iterate on an existing one. There is
enormous untapped potential, which with the right tools, can be leveraged to benefit
everyone.

2_Solution
People around the world are willing to validate products, solve problems, and voice
their opinions. This great potential simply needs facilitating, and Crowdholding is
designed to do exactly that, encouraging a new wave of co-creation.
Since July 2016, the Crowdholding team has worked hard to build the perfect
co-creation platform, attracting hundreds of dedicated participants, and dozens of
interesting startups looking to make use of the wisdom of the crowd.
Crowdholding enables the public, or ‘the crowd’, to help validate, iterate on, or
build awareness for products or services. In return, the product or service owner
rewards the crowd for their activity, building a mutually beneficial scenario where
businesses and the public are brought closer together, aligning goals rather than
merely exploiting one another.
This reward process is facilitated by the Crowdholding YUP token, and other
ERC-20 compatible tokens (including Ether itself) — allowing value to be efficiently
transferred between parties in a decentralized manner.
As Eric Schmidt says, the next hundred-billion-dollar companies will be those
who can effectively learn from the crowd. There’s a new dawn in co-creation coming,
and Crowdholding is positioned to make it impact society as much as possible.

3_Market
Open innovation
”We are seeing the emergence of an economy of the people, by the people, for the
people’”
- HBR
The most basic change has been a shift in the role of the consumer — from isolated to
connected, from unaware to informed, from passive to active. In the traditional value
creation process, companies and customers had distinct roles of production and consumption. But this distinction disappears in co-creation, forming a new customer-to-business (C2B) dynamic, where customers are directly engaged in production or
distribution of value (Academy of Marketing Science).
The market is expected to grow to $15 billion in 2020 (IbisWorld). In 2016, the
fintech sector represented 15% of the co-creation market, or approximately $1.2
billion. Investments of fintech companies into this market are growing 20% year over
year.
To increase market adoption, it’s essential to target unique user segments.
Our priority is on blockchain-based businesses, with an initial focus on the fintech
segment, aiming to take 20% of the fintech co-creation market by 2020. Our next step
is to open the platform to ecommerce startups that are related to blockchain already.
In our last step we will target all global companies who require capital and support.
With so many companies being launched every year it’s becoming harder for
the community to engage in the right projects and invest their time efficiently.
Current solutions lack transparency, process integrity and fair appreciation of the
community’s contributions.
A decentralized open innovation (DOI) platform fueled by our native YUP token
— or custom ERC-20 tokens — allows co-creation and exchange ideas crossing the
boundaries of the close teams and close-minded decision makers. As Crowdholding,
businesses and supporters are paid in YUP, the interests of everyone are aligned.
After the businesses build a community and verify the concept, they can raise
capital via a token crowdsale on the Distributed Online Funding platform (DOF). The
DOF is tackling the Alternative Finance market described in the next section.

2

Crowdholding

Alternative finance
The exceptional growth of crowdsales makes it harder for the community to support
the right projects. Crowdholding wants the businesses to increase transparency,
validate products and build a community on the DOI platform before launching an
ICO on the DOF platform. According to the “Wisdom of Crowds” phenomenon (JBE), a
large crowd can provide a better assessment of the company’s potential than groups
of experts. This means, that on average, investors are better off trusting the crowd
rather than analysts.
HBR expects blockchain startups to raise more capital through ICOs than any
other form of financing in 2017. ICO crowdsale investments are estimated to reach
$2.3 Billion by 2020. Raising funds with the ICO token crowdsale model is notably
superior to the traditional funding methods, especially for the Pre-Seed and Seed
stages.

Companies require a shift in perspective. Ironically, the key to successful online
fundraising isn’t asking for money. It’s not aiming for the wealthy 1%. But instead,
it’s about building and engaging a community of followers in advance. Crowdholding
helps companies to prepare, promote and engage with potential community members before launching their product or ICO.
The DOI & DOF platforms (see next section) mitigate the risks and deals with the
volatility of the digital asset industry. With the introduction of all new technology, the
future of money and asset management morphs into the new era of finance where
there is much to gain from being aware of what is coming — what is here.

4_Product Description and Development
Crowdholding is designed to facilitate very efficient, and highly productive,
communication between businesses and the crowd.
At its core, crowdholding utilizes a primarily text-based exchange between users,
whether the users are multi-million dollar companies, or members of the public
with little stake in the platform. This type of exchange has been refined over years
by websites which have become important hubs for much of the internet, utilizing
commenting and voting methods to sort content. Crowdholding expands on this by
adding a reward to the activity, giving people an even greater incentive to participate
in a community.
Our system revolves around projects, containing tasks for the community to
interact with:

· A project can be almost anything, from an entrepreneur with an idea,
to an established company. The project summarises the venture, providing
context for tasks.

· A task can be a challenge, discussion, question, or anything else which
catalyzes discussion in the community. Content should ideally be fun and
shareable, but it can be more technical and challenging.

Fig 4.1 Example task card

This is a simple but powerful method of interaction, which we are expanding on
in the near future in order to better facilitate more complex tasks such as ICO bounty
campaigns.
When a project joins Crowdholding, they buy into the system by exchanging
a mainstream cryptocurrency (currently ETH) for our local token — YUP — which
functions as a generic fuel for the Crowdholding ecosystem. YUP can be used as the
sole reward for completing tasks, or they can be used as a supplement for a reward

4

Crowdholding

in a custom token specified by the project being launched. Currently we facilitate all
ERC-20 based tokens, including ETH and all ETH based derivatives. These processes
are all facilitated and secured by the Ethereum blockchain, so while we are open to
developing a custom solution in the future, this is a powerful solution for the present.
We will also explain the further uses of the YUP, in that it can be used to invest in
businesses, or pay for products and services.

Stage 1: Decentralized open innovation (DOI) platform
Crowdholding provides decentralized innovation in the sense that it is an aggregate of the public view which helps to judge the content submitted through tasks. We
believe that allowing an entity to steer the community both impacts the validity of
feedback received, and stifles the potential of that community — to connect with
the business in a productive manner. In a more technical sense, Crowdholding will

Fig 4.3 How the Crowdholding economy connects with the traditional economy — exchanges
are now commonplace, and we have already laid out plans with a few good ones.

I. Reward with fixed credit system
Initially our platform follows a simple reward structure, whereby companies
which join purchase a portion of YUP with which to reward active members of the
community. This has been made more flexible by allowing companies to use an
alternative ERC-20 based token to reward users.

Crowdholding

Fig 4.5 Adding custom tokens as a reward

Fig 4.4 and 4.5 contrast the addition of custom tokens to crowdholding. Both are
quite straightforward reward processes, where the company creates a project,
and offers some reward in the form of tokens to users, for their participation in the
community.
One of the primary purposes for this direct reward system is to facilitate bounty
campaigns, which are particularly helpful for companies utilizing a token — our main
target audience for the moment. This bounty system is already live on the platform,
and we are using 5% of our YUP token pool to stimulate some initial projects.

Fig 4.6 How our blockchain solution interacts with the product, covering both YUP and custom
ERC-20 tokens.

In Fig 4.6, the basic user journey of join, co-create, reward is displayed in relation
to our blockchain-wallet structure. In the ‘join’ stage, the example business, has a
‘project wallet’ assigned to it, while other users have regular wallets assigned to
them. The business deposits a quantity of YUP, and potentially their own token into
their wallet. During the ‘co-create’ phase, the business’s ‘project wallet’ deposits
a specified amount as a reward for a task they launch to the ‘task wallet’. In the
‘reward’ phase, the ‘task wallet’ transfers the specified reward to the wallets of
users who participated in the task, with a small cut of custom tokens going to the
Crowdholding wallet as a nominal fee.

Crowdholding

II. Reward with revenue sharing system
The next phase of development adds our goal of allowing companies to pledge a
share of their revenue to the crowd as a scaling reward — meaning that the more the
crowd helps the company, the greater the success of the company, and the greater
the success of the crowd. This also means that companies can be pledging costs
which will only apply in the future, making it easier for early stage companies to draw
on resources, without relying on spending time only traditional the venture capital
process.

Fig 4.7 Introducing revenue-share rewards, and how they would play out over time

10

Crowdholding

Fig 4.8 displays how we expect revenue sharing to work over time, allowing
companies to dedicate future resources to reward users for their activity. Initially
the startup pledges a % of their revenue (in this example, 1%, but as mentioned,
we are encouraging initial projects on our platform to share up to 5% — and ideally
this will prove the effectiveness of the platform, resulting in more projects being
generous with future revenue. An important point to consider at this stage is the
return on investment for mid-long term commitments like pledging revenue shares
— something we are making sure we can measure — and communicate — effectively
with our product. It’s crucial that companies can really see how helpful crowdholding
is to them.

Fig 4.8 Increasing revenue based reward reward year by year

One of the key concepts we want to apply with Crowdholding is rewarding people
over time with shares of revenue, facilitating a beneficial relationship between
businesses and the public. Fig 4.7 illustrates how rewards provided to the crowd
should grow as the revenue of the company grows. In step 3, the company is
generating revenue equivalent to 1000 YUP, resulting in a 9 YUP reward being shared
with the crowd, and a cut of 1 YUP going to Crowdholding. In step 4, the company is
generating 5000 YUP of revenue, resulting in a reward of 45 YUP being distributed to
the crowd, and 5 going to Crowdholding.

11

Crowdholding

In summary, the core points of the revenue sharing stage are:
· Smart contract for tasks and revenue share rewarding
· Wallet for each startup
· 100C% token are created for each startup/year
· Start of year 1, 1% revenue of year 0 is pledged (equivalent YUP are transferred)
· New task:
n YUP are pledged for a task (task dividend duration = 2/5 years)
· Expired task:
· n YUP distributed to users based on votes
· End of year 1:
· CH get startup revenue information, and inject into CH smart contract
Based on revenue and token distribution, smart contract distribute YUP to
users
· Start of year 2, TOP UP revenue: 1% revenue of year 1 is pledged (equivalent
YUP are transferred)
· End of year 2:
· CH get startup revenue information and inject into CH smart contract
· Based on revenue and token distribution, smart contract distribute more
YUP to users

Crowdholding

Stage 2: Decentralized open funding platform (DOF)
The next major step in the development of Crowdholding is facilitating funding
of businesses with YUP, or custom ERC-20 based tokens. This will create a cycle,
whereby tokens can be distributed from businesses to users via the DOI, and invested
back in businesses via the DOF.
This is currently a very competitive space, and the best option may be to partner
with an existing crowdfunding platform in the future. For now, we are building
product infrastructure to handle it ourselves.

Stage 3: Marketplace
Completion of step 3 and thus the Crowdholding Ecosystem is scheduled for the
end of 2018. Businesses on Crowdholding can start selling products/services and
receive YUP as a method of payment. Businesses offer solutions to people, other
businesses and to the Crowdholding platform itself. All the payments are done in
YUP, both providing convenience, furthering the use of our token, and growing the
strength of the community.
During this phase, we will be focusing on scaling the usability of the website,
integrating Dapps, and improving our API to better work with partners.

Fig 4.11 The complete Crowdholding cycle

The Crowdholding cycle when both DOF, DOI, and Marketplace stages have been
implemented, meaning that YUP facilitates businesses rewarding the crowd, and the
crowd investing in or purchasing from businesses. As an example:
1. A company creates a project outlining the product, in order to verify whether
there is a reasonable degree of demand, and get some general feedback.
2. The business launches appeals for crowdfunding via YUP, or launches their
ICO in tandem, to generate more funds through their own token.
3. The company initiates a marketing campaign making great use of the
established community. Keen supporters can easily use YUP they have been
rewarded with to directly fund businesses for more significant gains in the future.
4. Those who wish to invest, but have not earned YUP from doing tasks can
acquire them directly from Crowdholding, or in a p2p fashion directly from the
market.
5. The business then launch their ICO and continues to receive active
management support from us. We take a 3% fee for ICO campaigns.

15

Crowdholding

5_Business Model
Profit Generation
The Crowdholding model is based on the simple principle of everyone using YUP to
transfer value — which means that we are creating our own ecosystem. As long as the
benefits are sufficient for users, it’s very convenient for us to take a nominal cut of
any transfers which take place on the platform.
After completion of the Crowdholding platform in 2018, businesses on the
DOI platform pledge to share with supporters between 1-10% of the company’s
revenue paid in YUP for a set period of time. Crowdholding will take 10% cut of these
transfers.
The Distributed Online Funding (DOF) platform will allow startups to raise capital
through ICO by selling YUP. Essentially, businesses are sharing revenue with their
supporters. We take as a fee 3% of ICO campaigns.

6_ICO details
Role of the YUP token
Important part of Crowdholding ecosystem is how YUP are used to build the circulation of the currency and create supply and demand mechanisms. YUP will be used
within the Crowdholding platform, but they won’t be limited by the platform in the
future. YUP tokens can be used in the following ways on the platform:
For Crowdholding
· Fuel for the crowdsourcing and crowdfunding processes on the platform.
For Businesses
· Payment for qualified business evaluation and validation, translation
and proofreading services, creative content development and web design,
advertising and promotion, bounties and etc.

· Crowdholding bonuses paid in YUP proportionally to all holders. If backers
decide not to sell the tokens immediately after the ICO, but keep them, they will
be rewarded with bonus YUP tokens.
For Supporters
· Investing tokens into companies on the platform.
· Purchasing products/services on the Crowdholding marketplace with tokens.
· Crowdholding bonuses paid in YUP tokens paid proportionally to all holders.

Token supply
YUP will be created prior to the ICO, and they will be capped, meaning we are not
able to create any more in the future. No inflation is intended.
445 million tokens created. 284 million directly sold to public.
Token supply is fixed, we create immediate deflationary currency that will be as valuable as our growing community (startups and crowd) in our ecosystem. Any unsold
YUP created for sale during the pre-ICO and ICO will be burned.

17

Crowdholding

Token Distribution
The initial issue of YUPIE tokens is programmed by a smart contract and will be
carried out in the following order:

· Bounties (1%)
· Seeding businesses (5%)
· YUP reserve (10%)
· Locked for future use (19%)
· Team & experts (20%)
· Pre-ICO & Main ICO (45%)
Fig 6.1 Token distribution

· Bounty campaign promotion (1%)
· Award for first 10 businesses on our platform (5%) which will pay for tasks
with YUPIES.

· Allocation for unforeseeable expenses (10%). We want to have the deposit
of YUPIES that would be only used to solve the token-threatening situations.
All our wallets will be auditable via a publicly shared address.

· Kept as a reserve for future growth (19%). To be utilized for future
partnerships or acquisitions. This block of tokens will be set aside for
a minimum of 24 months, never be sold directly on the market and be
constantly auditable on a publicly shared address.

· Allocated to the current and future team members, advisers and experts
(20%). The team tokens will be reverse vested with a 6- month cliff and then
linearly vested over 18 months, with the team wallet publicly auditable.

· Crowdsale (45%) The success threshold is $1M.

18

Crowdholding

Spending Allocation
The main focus of our expenses will be on the technical development of the platform.
However, marketing & sales will be allocated a growing importance, as the success
of the platform depends on attracting the right supporters and businesses through
diverse paid advertising tactics. Other expenses include paying for IT infrastructure,
rent, patents & trademarks. Crowdholding will be cash flow positive soon after the
launch and will utilize additional capital to support international expansion and
opening of new locations.

Crowdholding

Token Demand & Liquidity
Since startups are sharing rewards (at least partially) in YUP, they have to purchase
YUP tokens either from Crowdholding or from the market, raising the demand, and
therefore the price.
To facilitate the needed liquidity, Crowdholding will initially proceed with an
ERC-20 token foundation for easy acceptance on major marketplaces.
The YUP token is still in its infancy. As more startups join our platform, the more
YUP are used to pay for services and promotion. As businesses collaborate with the
crowd and share their revenue, the crowd receives increasingly valuable YUP. The
bigger the crowd, the stronger the YUP.

Burning tokens
Following success of the ICO, we will burn surplus tokens, ensuring that people who
have participated in the ICO will have a reasonable share of the token sum. At the
end of this process, pre-ICO and ICO pool will represent 45% of total tokens.
Investors for both pre-ICO and ICO will receive a 300% bonus (if you own 3000
YUP this will be increased to 12,000 YUP). This does not include bounty holders,
in order to protect the YUP value for investors. However, bounty will continue as
planned until we reach the 1% as shown on our YUP distribution breakdown.

7_Business Development
Our diverse team of open-minded millennials is fertile ground for the realisation of
our business plan. Working together for over a year consolidated us to revolutionise
the world’s economy through crowdsourcing, and return wealth to the public by providing an unprecedented revenue sharing reward system.
We have set a reasonably steady pace for product development, considering how far
we got while bootstrapping. Now we are more stable than ever, and have put together a solid team to create something amazing.

Future plans
We aim to reach 100 startups and 25,000 active users on the application by the end
of 2018. Sharing of revenue by other startups is a major milestone, since that will
ensure Crowdholding to be established as the Nr.1 Crowdsourcing platform, offering
ICO preparation. Sharing revenue by other startups means distributing our token to
more users, increasing the token flow, i.e. boosting our market capitalisation.
We have pledged to share 5% of our YUP pool to invest in blockchain startups on
Crowdholding — if you think you have an interesting startup, and would like some of
this funding, please get in touch with us. This funding pool will ignite the co-creation
process. This approach showcases our system to be valid and eventually startups
join the application themselves to share revenue with the crowd and utilise our
system. The steadily evolving crypto community will accelerate our growth until we
reach the maturity stage, scheduled for the second half of 2018.
Our moonshot is scheduled for 2019 when we want to create a secondary
marketplace for revenue futures, thus allowing all users to trade their unique
cryptocurrency.

Company history
The first milestone was launching a prototype in autumn 2016, after two of our
co-founders put in USD 24,000 to start the operations, on which we could build the
basic framework up. A hundred alpha users were leaving feedback and ideas while
we collected data on how our system worked. This data was used in parallel to work
on a development domain we could later launch as our beta version with initial 15
startups onboard.
After we got our second investment from Richfox Capital and the Vakoč brothers
the beta was successfully released to the public and we started to run marketing and
PR, which helped us get published in several online magazines and blogs. Beyond
that we attended a variety of startup events in whole Europe, such as Pioneers, White
Bull and Startup Vienna to connect with the community, meet investors and get the
word out about Crowdholding. The traffic and awareness created and supported our
growth.
During beta, we learned a lot about our users and how to communicate our
philosophy to both supporters as well as businesses, especially startups. From the
technical side we ran through several changes and improvements so that we now
use a Python/Django framework on the backend and a Bootstrap/LESS framework
on the frontend, which enables separation from code and visuals besides the fact
that the Python community is big, young and innovative. Continuously improving
the application we are adding/customising features like notifications, the news feed,
user profiles and “create your own project“. The current weekly user growth rate is
approximately 10%.

8_What makes Crowdholding Special?
Crowdholding aims to connect the crowd (anyone from around the world) with
entrepreneurs allowing anyone to co-create with startups, therefore creating
worldwide think tanks to accelerate startups like never before. Imagine a
entrepreneur comes up with a new app concept and launches it on Crowdholding.
Within a matter of 24 hours they can have feedback, connections, possible investors
or future staff members from all over the globe.
What makes Crowdholding groundbreaking is that it benefits both the
entrepreneur and the crowd due to our innovative business model. Entrepreneurs
don’t just receive the benefit of co-creation, but also because the startup is not
sacrificing any of their equity (instead their awards are worth a small percentage
of future revenue) meaning the entrepreneur remains in complete control of their
project.
Another factor that is different in the marketing strategy, projects on the platform
can create lasting relationships with potential customers. We focus on pushing the
projects through social media marketing and through the crowd due to the fact
that the standard paid ad is becoming less and less valuable. According to WOMMA
“word-of-mouth impressions drive sales 5x greater than the equivalent number of
paid impressions.”
For the Supporters, our system allows anyone to develop their skill set, whether
you are a 20 year old college student with innovative, new ideas or a middle aged
professional with 10 years worth of experience, Crowdholding can offer the chance to
co-create, showcase your skills and build new connections. On top of that because of
the cryptocurrency we are implementing, Supporters will be able to work and receive
a digital currency for their contributions.

Token Compliance
Crowdholding is working with outside legal counsel to ensure full compliance.
However, the emerging cryptographic token space is sparsely regulated right now.
Our goal is to be as compliant as possible within such a regulatory environment,
and some have raised the possibility that US securities regulations would apply. For
the question of whether they apply, the appropriate framework is the Howey Test
established in SEC v. Howey [14]. Our understanding and interpretation of this test
is that YUP tokens are not classified as securities because 1) ownership of YUP does
not provide any ownership or related rights in a company, 2) YUP are deployed in
production and have real utility via the crowdholding service, and 3) YUP serve a
distinct function more akin to application credits than a financial instrument. That
said, the contents of this document do not constitute legal advice and we encourage
prospective purchasers with concerns to consult with an attorney. We expect the
regulatory environment to evolve as the cryptocurrency space matures and we will
do everything we can to maintain compliance.
The tokens have not been and will not be registered under the United States
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may not be offered
or sold in the United States or to or for the benefit of US persons (as defined in
Regulations under the Securities Act) unless they are so registered, or an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. One such
exemption allows the resale of tokens purchased for their own account and for
investment purposes only by investors who (i) are not otherwise affiliated with the
Polybius Foundation, (ii) have been exposed for some me to the economic risks that
ownership of tokens entails, and (iii) are not part of the distribution of the tokens.
