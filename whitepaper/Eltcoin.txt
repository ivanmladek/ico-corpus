What is ELTCOIN?
ELTCOIN or ‘Ethereum Limited Total Coin’ is a community driven limited
supply token on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in November 2017 as
the largest Airdrop token of its time, the ELTCOIN community has been
making strides to add real value and utility to the Ethereum Network.
Since November 2017, the ELTCOIN development community has published

ELTCOIN Mission
The ELTCOIN mission is individual sovereignty accessible to all, built
on crypto. For some time crypto technology has been open to those who
have reason to use it. We have seen p2p trustless networks, made up
from decentralised nodes; we observe the mutual benefits freedom from
trust affords us, this is foundational.

A

picture

of

the

future;

as

we

transition

to

crypto

platforms,

environments will form where trust will be redefined as an implicit
transaction parameter. This is a future where individual sovereignty
can actually be realised.

It is of this future, ELTCOIN dares to dream.
ELTUniverse, an ecosystem consisting of DAO communities; detailed in
this paper we demonstrate the bootstrap nature of such organisations.
Staking ELTCOIN to exercise, the freedom granted via the very nature
of the ELTUniverse economy is the how and also the why.

The future we create, is fundamentally incompatible with hierarchical
structures of governance. Our model is open source and decentralised the mission is simple:

Stake your claim to freedom.

ELTWallet
ELTWallet is an open-source mobile wallet app available for iOS and
Android. The wallet has all the essential functionality required for a
Ethereum and ELTCOIN holder and supports other ERC20 tokens.
ELTWallet will not transmit your private key over the network, your
private key is securely stored on your device.
Features include:
1. Generate a new Ethereum wallet
2. Import an existing wallet with your private key
3. View ETH and tokens transactions
4. Send ETH and tokens
5. Share your wallet address to receive ETH and tokens
6. PIN code and biometric authentication
More features to come such as new transactions notifications, Ethereum
forks

support

and

PocketBook

integration

(see

below).

ELTCard
ELTCOIN has a unique and innovative approach to offering liquidity
through payment cards. Traditionally companies have partnered with the
likes of VISA and MASTERCARD to produce a prepaid card. These prepaid
cards are typically expensive and only less than hundred thousand are
issued. Either the company absorbed these costs and shuts down after
they release the model is unsustainable or the cost is passed on the
consumer.
Enter the challenger banks.
ELTCOIN is integrating with the world's most popular banks. Utilising
open API’s to provide seamless liquidity to our users existing card
prepaid cards. As you spend money on your card, ELTCARD liquidates
your crypto in real time using Apollo’s infrastructure and tops your
card back up in Fiat.
Transactions made through ELTCard will show in your ELTWALLET app in
real time.
ELTCard is currently being beta tested in the wild with challenger
banks in London and New York City.

PocketBook
PocketBook

is

a

censorship

immune,

decentralised

human

network,

implemented as a block explorer. Spanning all Ethereum forks, such as
Ethereum Classic, Expanse, Ubiq to name just a few.
The key principles of PocketBook:
1. Multichain compatibile explorer
2. Individual sovereignty via cryptography
3. Distributed & trustless identity platform
4. Web of trust key signing
5. Easy deployment of standardised

cross chain smart contracts

6. Standardised individual trust tokens, implementing a trustless
rating system
7. Decentralised

asset

in

which

traders

interact

directly with vendors either on chain or via escrow contract.

Multichain Compatibility
Each Ethereum fork use the same public & private key pairs, which
PocketBook pulls together from each chain into one address.

A Human Network
PocketBook is a new kind of network, where you have total control over
your

information

by

authenticating via signature with your private

key.
Users

can

claim

addresses,

including

for

contracts,

on

PocketBook

using their private keys. Once claimed, an owner of the address can
add metadata to public profile.
This is unique to PocketBook and does not exist elsewhere to date.

9

Web of trust
PocketBook

uses

a decentralised web of trust to avoid pitfalls of

centralised key signing authorities, maximising user security, without
compromising privacy.

The trust balance of an
address is regulated by a
voluntary, trustless, rating
system.
All parties must agree to
issue positive or negative
token rating with each
transaction.

10

User Friendly Contract Deployment
PocketBook has a friendly user interface for its users to build and
deploy smart contracts. Currently building smart contracts requires
expensive engineering resources who write code which is notoriously
hard to debug.

Illustration showing smart contract code vs. PocketBook UI

Building smart contracts via a user interface reduces the likelihood
of bugs, reduces engineering time and time spent deploying distributed
applications.
Smart contracts have endless possibilities such as
1. Fulfilling orders.​ Whitelisted crowdsales.
2. Multisig wallets.​ ​Joint accounts, corporate governance​.
3. Tokens.​ ​Initial Coin Offerings.
4. Escrow.

5. Secure contracts. [​ZK snarks, linkable ring signatures etc]

Decentralized Assets Exchange
The PocketBook marketplace consists of crowdsale contracts issued by
vendors,

simply

from

holders

who

their addresses. Additionally users have the

choice to register their contract with our crowdsale tracker contract.
The exchange automatically pulls together all crowdsales registered
with our tracker contract. The interface applies filters and organises
the information to form an exchange UI. Typical tools such as trading
pairs,

depth

charts

and

prices

are

folded

into

a

modern

user

interface, which beneath the surface is radically different to both
other centralised and decentralised exchanges.
PocketBook makes use of asset-relay contracts so multichain trade is
to be supported. Support is not limited to only Ethereum forks, for
example, a BTC relay can be deployed.
The design intention is to build relay contracts on each supported
chain to create an open, cross chain asset-relay contract standard.
PocketBook tokens will be of a limited supply and can only be issued
by

Partnerships
ELTCOIN has partnerships with leading cryptocurrency organisations who
have significant holdings in the currency which is staked into their
product offerings.

HODL.vc​ builds, stakes and

cryptocurrency & blockchain
ventures.
The fund is currently raising
$50M USD (soft cap) in a private
placement to invest in
groundbreaking crypto projects
which including the ​Apollo app
and ​Moon Assets​.

exchange.

Despite

cryptocurrencies entering mainstream media and consumer usage, buying
cryptocurrencies for the first time is not easy. Finding a trustworthy
exchange with transparent fees, understanding a KYC process and poor
customer service is hampering an industry that doesn’t yet care.
Enter Apollo, the mobile app where users can purchase cryptocurrency
with Apple Pay having entered only their name and email address.

Apollo is currently in Beta testing for full launch, offering crypto
services in BITCOIN, ETHEREUM and ​ELTCOIN​ exclusively on launch.
