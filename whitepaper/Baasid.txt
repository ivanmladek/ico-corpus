BaaS

"Blockchain as a Service" is a concept that means enabling many unspecified internet
suppliers to easily borrow blockchain based technology and infrastructure. (Example) SaaS :
Software as a Service

"BaaSid"

As one BaaS project, this project means various login, personal identification, and other
certification services developed on a public network.
BaaS + ID(Identification)

BAS

"BaaSid" refers to the unit of cryptocurrency all internet service providers and users
(participants) provide, use or exchange with one another that originates through the service.

COPN

The abbreviation for Certification of Public Network, which is a public network
infrastructure where an internet service provider’s database or a third party certification
authority, user or device all have a centralized database, or through the voluntary
participation of nodes (participants) in a non-storage public network, important personal
information is split into other fragments and divided among each other before splitting,
distributing and saving.

Split ID

These are the smallest units of encrypted data that are split, distributed and stored in ways
different from each other on the fastest, most optimized nodes for the user after personal
information in a wide variety of formats (text, images) is encrypted, and split into thousands
of small fragments using a split engine.

Split Block

This is the smallest block unit that is composed of one participant group where split IDs that
are split and divided in ways different from each other on the fastest, most optimized nodes
(unspecified partcipants) for the user.

Instant
Access

This means a one-time instant access privilege where Split IDs are called, which were saved
in ways different from each other by an unspecified number of providers within the split
block one belongs to, to quickly and safety proceed with login, instant membership, and
payment authentication.

Hyper
Confirm

Through a safe and easy verification via instant access, login, instant membership, payments,
and wire transfers can be performed through the Certification of Public Network (COPN)
without any intervention by a provider database, third party certification authority or Payment
Gateway (PG).

1. Background of "BaaSid"
1.1 What is "BaaSid"?
In this white paper, BaaS is the abbreviation for Blockchain as a Service, which is a
concept where a blockchain infrastructure is borrowed partially, or in its entirety, for the
development of internet services related to exisiting web services, app services, and
blockchain services (cryptocurrency exchanges, etc.).
In this BaaS infrastructure, “BaaSid” will offer certificate services to the internet service
provider from an unspecified number from a P2P based split and divided powerful, yet
safe database that is based on a public network.
Also, it is intended to replace a third party certification authority, or payment gateway (PG)
with a shortened procedure that is safer and more convenient.
All the unspecified OSP providers on the internet have partially borrowed existing SasS,
IaaS, PaaS or ASP services to use according to their business goals.
In the new world of the blockchain, via the concept of BaaS, diverse software and
technology will be borrowed from the necessary parts of the Blockchain Infra API,
database, or going one step further, the mobilization of node members (users or
participants), network resources, and other diverse forms of blockchain infrastructure that
are experiencing explosive growth.

["BaaSid" : Blockchain as a Service for Identification]
"BaaSid" was designed to help process the various phases of verification, offering all
internet service providers and all users a more convenient and safer way to login, and this
could act as an enabler for more lively communication between the providers and user.

1. Background of "BaaSid"
1.2 Decentralization?
The most central goal of blockchain from a technological standpoint lies in the technology
that offers tight security and perpetuality for participants' property using a public ledger to
block any forgery or falsifications by hackers.
In all internet services, various forms of personal information is saved and used on the
database servers of many online service providers (OSP), third party certification
authorities, and user devices. Based on this, many important activities take place over the
internet, uninterrupted such as login, various verifications, shopping, and financial
payments among others.
Even in blockchain services that are oriented towards decentralization, this shows the
limits that already exist in other types of centralization.

1.3 Decentralization!
In the "BaaSid," via "one-time instant access" that utilizes a certification of public
network, participants and providers alike can attain quicker verification with tighter
security and greater ease.
In particular, sensitive personal information including, name, phone number, email
address, ID, password, credit car numbers, biometric information, etc. is split, after which
it is split into data fragments unique to the hundreds and thousands of nodes, which are
then distributed and saved different from one another, enabling verification, login and
other functions to be peformed in the absense of a source of such personal information.

[COPN : Certification of Public Network]
Here, this means that an individual temporarily makes oneself centralized, then summons,
descrambles and combines the split ID that was encrypted thousands of times from the
Certification of Public Network of the “BaaSid” via a “biometrics verification key,” after
which the information is instantly discarded the instant the “one-time instant access” is
complete.

9

The "BaaSid one-time instant verification" is a method where an internet service provider
develops and maintains another centralized database, or undergoes a "third party
certification authority" or in the absense of a source to compare, based on the Certification
of Public Network of "BaaSid," an unspecified number of participants are verified.
This is the total opposite method that has been employed so far on the internet which was
composed of an individual certification structure for everyone. Yet, the goal of "BaaSid" is
to create a link between blockchain and non-blockchain methods, perform verification in
the absense of a source, and to achieve complete decentralization through a public network
consisting entirely of participants (users or nodes) without the necessity of an authenticated
certificate from a third party certification authority.

1.4 Why "BaaSid"?
The philosophy behind the blockchain dreams of world that is free from the centralization
of existing vested interests such as governments, banks, institutions, corporations (various
forms of political, economical, social and cultural powers and for-profit or non-profit
powers of concerned groups) from where asset trading and credibility is maintained by
means of a public ledger for individuals to create proactive opportunites for themselves
amongst a wide range of parties concerned.
The direction the era is taking greatly demands transcending the distrust that arises when a
centralized power group, that takes many forms, supplants the public sphere, and replacing
this with a massive network consisting of individuals directly taking part.
Blockchain is significant in that it protects the various forms of individual property (money,
real estate, intellectual property, and all other types of property) through decentralization,
with the same information promised to the public by organizations or corporations that are
susceptible to hacking, loss and falsification, enabling individuals to enjoy a higher quality
of life and obtain better value.
However, with such blockchain technology and use, other types of centralization continue
to come into being and there are doubts and limitations as to how they stand up to the threat
of hacking. And this situation is spawning a slew of diverse companies and services.
The most prominent case is centralizing, saving and maintaining information on various
internet service users based on the blockchain.
Already, there were many cases where databases (DB) with personal information stored, or
other centralized databases were hacked. And event today little can be done to ease the
anxiety surrounding such cases.
The blockchain technology itself nearly completely guarantees permanence and security
against forgery or falsification, but the various services that are linked to this are already
showing many limitations.
Despite these limitations, in virtual currency exchanges that use blockchain technology and
in the various free and charged services attempts to collect and hack important and
sensitive personal information is still a source of anxiety for participants, users, and service
providers.

10

Even among services that are not based on the blockchain, when it comes to various
internet based services, regardless if blockchain technology is being applied or not for:
login information (ID & PW), new registration for services (entering personal information),
virtual currency wallet (development of a DB through personal information registration)
shopping payments (registration and exposure of credit card numbers and other sensitive
information) IT corporations or institutions face a wide range of threats and challenges
from the severe storage and leakage of personal information at all stages of internet
services.
And a more serious problem is that one's personal information can be leaked anytime,
anywhere, anyhow with the individual unaware about how this information is being abused,
and even if the individual becomes aware, by that time it is too late.

1.6 Split ID
The personal information of participants is split into thousands of fragments using the split
engine and all these fragmented Split IDs are then encrypted and the Split IDs that are
different from one another are then stored within the split blocks they belong to.
This resembles the process of the biggest advantage of Peer to Peer (P2P), taking the values
of separated data allocation and split and distributed fragments and finding the fastest nodes
and data most rationally, then combining them to form something that resembles the one
source that can be downloaded or restored.

1.8 One Pass: an all-in-in sophisticated verification
“BaaSid” sanctions and confirms all verifications based on the consent of an unspecified
number of participants.
This is based on participation by a number of blockchains, and values that are more creative
and unique from one another give it more value.
The logic where it would seem personal information or privacy should be respected and
protected.
Even within the blockchain service, the practice of saving personal information on a third
party institution's or provider's server that persists is no different from the centralization of
banks, financial institutions and certain groupsthat preceded the start of the block chain.
However, the blockchain still has no answer to that no offers any guarantees.
“BaaSid's” BaaS API enables providers to free themselves from the accountability of such
protections and of the management of unique important information, and offers various
services to release providers from the personal information policy, implementation and
stages that can prove to be puzzling.

For personal originality and privacy protection “BaaSid” saves the small fragments on an
unspecified number of nodes after a random splitting and distributing of the characteristic
values, and through the exchange of BAS tokens, and various verifications, ledgers of
verification, which creates and preserves credibility.
This uses a verification method known as Proof of Access (POA), which is an active
ecosystem that periodically verifies utilization through major activities on line including
the login and all other aspects of internet service by the user.

The BaaS based Certification of public Network (COPN) API verifies and continually
connects based on the active and natural activity of such users.

1.10 "DB Governance” of BaaSid Participants
"BaaSid" does not particularly discriminate between blockchain based services and web
or app based services. The user (participant) needs both services, and this is because the
users benefit providers in various ways.
"BaaSid" participants are clients that are already aggressive and have potential, and
they make up the database for a safe login and verification where they trust one
another and verify one another.
In other words, "BaaSid" participants can access all websites (application standard of
"BaaSid's" API) including those of financial institutions, banks, brokerages, and retail
with tight security and convenience, quickly and safely. "BaaSid" has this type of
potential customer infrastructure and users and is also a form of "verification managed
governance."

2. Introduction
2.1. Limitations of and problems with blockchain
As was mentioned above, all intenet services store and later use a large amount of
personal information that is stored on databases. Based on this, login, information
confirmation, payment and all other user requests are verified by a provider and a third
party verification authority.
This goes for services other than those that apply blockchain technology and includes all
agencies, organizations, corporations and all free and charged services. And as a given,
various security systems are developed and operated to protect such databases.
Also, the problem major leaks and hacking has resulted in governments of several
countries to enact protecive legislation regarding personal information over the internet,
and along with messages condemning the leakage and piracy of such personal information,
many individuals, and all companies, financial institutions, agencies and organizations
that have an online presence are requesting more effort be devoted to this problem.
Further, the blockchain world that is oriented towards decentralization is continually
becoming more centralized, and with various targets susceptible to hacking and new
problems that arise as a results, more ironic limitations are taking shape.

2.2. Borrowing the DB of BaaS based participants
All blockchains save transactions records the same way and offer tight security against
forgery or falsification. This is because the same data, users’ sensitive personal
information and important information, and verifications keys are held by everyone
making it difficult to store any of that information.
"BaaSid" takes the most fundamental uniform data storage problems and limitations of
blockchain, and offers an interpretation in a completely new perspective.
When verifying information required for the personal verification a "BaaSid" participant,
there is no source to forge because it is not stored anywhere thus blocking any hacking
attempts.
In other words, with "BaaSid" the personal information, biometric images and any other
information of a user does not exist in any format whatsoever and does not even exist on
one's device. It is only saved after being split and distributed (means some of the
encrypted data fragments are separated from one another and distributed to participants)
as fragments on the nodes of public participants (users).

2.3. Split & Distribute Data
The personal information of all participants of the COPN(Certification of Public Network)
is split into thousands of fragments, and the encrypted data fragments are split up and
saved among hundreds of thousands of unspecified individuals participating in the split.
The encrypted, split personal information fragments are called the Split ID, and the
thousands of split fragments are then again split and divided into hundreds and thousands
of split blocks.
The capacity, distributing and saving will be optimized to increase the real-time speed of
recognition, and the node numbers of the split block that were distributed based on the
safety of blockchain against hacking attempts will be optimized as well.

When logging in to an internet service, applying for membership, or performing other
major activities such as shopping, wire transfer or the movement of other financial assets,
the split password fragments are saved on a split block and then temporarily the split ID
(split data) fragments are verified via the instant verification that uses an individual's
biometrics (fingerprint, iris, voice recognition, etc.) or a password (option) and One Time
Password (OTP) that reminds an individual of the password and immediately discards the
source afterwards.

As if recognizing the uniqueness of each participant, the unique split ID is encrypted data
that is uniquely different from other data. A block of a participant group where one

All individuals or internet service companies agencies and others participating in BaaSid
protect one another, but also free from being responsible for each other. And they look to a
large cooperation and community that is reliable and that has reponsibility, and they intend to
present the standards and goals for the compensation and sharing for each entity.
Based on "BaaS," this links existing online service providers (OSP), blockchain service
providers (BSP), and all individuals participating in the Certification of Public Network
(COPN) in a large cooperation of trust known as the "BaaS Union" which is how the mutual
trust and balance can persist.
To accomplish this, "BaaS Union" was designed for all the OSPs, BSPs, and users
(participants) taking part in the BaaSid to share in the mutual benefit through the solidarity of
each stakeholder's role, responsibility and activity.

3.2 The Benefit of User and OSP using "BaaSid"
Benefit.1) Vast database & security system “Reduction of both development and maintenance costs”
The COPN API of "BaaSid" is provided to all internet service providers enabling easy
application for all. Internet service providers are no longer required to invest large sums in
the installation and operation of a database and security system for relevant proprietary
services.

Benefit. 2) "Removal of the legal risks" regarding personal information leaks
There are no legal risks involving hacking attempts and exposure as all internet service
providers that apply the COPN (Certification of Public Network) of "BaaSid," do not
receive or store personal information on a separate database.

verification] through a temporary centralization through instant verification via fingerprints,
iris scans or other biometrics enabling participants to immediately obtain membership on
their own, and enable them to gain immediate access without any additional verification
steps. From a service providers standpoint, this prevents many customers from being lost
due to the procedure for membership application.
The irksome development of various databases for login and other verification steps, and
for other verification or all the access steps not necessary.
In other words, it means that the services of all providers can be quickly and easily used.
This equates to freeing providers from marketing costs and the various difficulties in
attracting members to apply for membership. As an optimal method for enhancing the
marketing effectiveness of internet service suppliers this is a dramatic simplification and
credibility enabler for both procedure for membership application, and the verification
steps that actions within the service entail, which could become an important strategy for
enhancing the service revenue of suppliers.
The development of an IA-API(instant Access API) based on "BaaSid's"
COPN(Certification of Public Network)is expected to be completed by the first quarter of
2019 and ready for distribution.

Benefit.4) Quick and easy important verification: “Hyper Confirm API”
All banks, financial institutions, brokerages, retail and other paid content payments
require a diverse and complex series of steps that includes a certification procedure from a
third party certification authority, and a link-up with a Payment Gateway (PG).
With "BaaSid," there is plan to develop and offer a HC-API(Hyper Confirm API) which
can more easily and safely resolve current complex and inefficient verification steps that
should be followed with a COPN(Certification of Public Network) infrastructure.

4.1. Instant Access API
"BaaSid" is an easy, quick and safe verification service for logging in to all internet
services (no membership application required) and performing important activities online
as it takes the Certification of Public Network and personal information and divides it into
thousands of fragments, after which it randomly saves the information on participants'
nodes, which is then encrypted and descrambled temporarily.

4.2. “BaaS” User Database
The goal of "BaaSid" is to create instant access for internet services without storing
personal information or any source of a user's personal information on any service
provider database, with any national verification agency, with any third party verification
agency, or even on any storage device of users.

[Four things that do not exist with BaaSid]

30

4.2.1 Non-existence of User Database
No database exists for the internet service provider to operate enabling near perfect
decentralization.

4.2.2 Non-existence of Private information
Name, phone number, email address, bankbook number, credit card number and other
sensitive information is divided into small bits divided to optimal node groups, distributed
and stored, without leaving a source of personal information.

4.2.3 Non-existence of Identification
Nothing is saved anywhere, not a personal identification card, or other information used to
verify who one is or verification information creating a situation where one is safe from
hacking or loss.

4.2.4 Non-existence Original Certificate
No certificate or source data exists either on a third party certification authority's server,
or any user's device (smart phone, PC, tablet pc). This means certificates nor biometrics
information is not saved anywhere.

4.3. PoA(Proof of Access) & PoH(Proof of Holding)
“BaaSid” BAScally follows the mining policy of Ethereum, but has another unique
verification method. This method is PoA and PoH.

4.4 Transaction validator
The login of all of “BaaSid’s” block groups (split block, exchange block), the verification
and history of all internet activity and transaction verification of the ledger includes minor
and separate participants.

PoW(PoS)
PoW uses Ethereum mining (plans to change to PoS) as is, and pays BAS tokens as a form
of compensation for blocks generated. Also, transaction fees are paid separately to PoW
miner.
PoA(Proof of Access)
The Online Service Provider (OSP) or Blockchain Service Provider (BSP) provides part
of the fee occurring from the instant access of the participant and pays it to the data
storage provider of "BaaSid" (PoH miner).
PoH(Proof of Holding)
Blocks are generated separately for Split ID (Split data) management in the interplanetary
file system of the Certification of Public Network (COPN), and the compensation when
creating a new block is paid out using BAS tokens. Also, part of the fee occurring from
PoA is paid to the PoH miner.

4.5 BaaS (Blockchain as a Service)
Even without suppliers developing and operating a separate centralized database (DB)
required for login, payment or any other verification procedures, “BaaSid” Blockchain
can provide a high fidelity simple verification by using a “BaaSid” blockchain network
among users instead.
BaaS takes the split ID information of mine that was stored under an anonymous
community that focuses on individuals, calls it up and combines it, and uses a new form of
verification that can divide, distribute, save, encrypt and descramble, making it
completely different from the diverse verification methods and verification systems we
have seen so far.

Ultimately, BaaS means one large verification system of a “BaaSid” blockchain network
linked to many individuals. All companies and agencies can be free from the authority and
accountability that comes with a separate centralized database (DB) and can offer services
and perform verification activities to all users via the certification of public network based
on the “BaaSid” Blockchain that has a completely credible public ledger with a high
degree of reliability.
This way, we do not save individuals’ or users’ sensitive information on the provider’s
database, but rather enable the possibilities for the services of all providers to be safely
and conveniently accessed without the risk of leaking personal information by using the
certification of public network, which is based on the “BaaSid” Blockchain among users.

32

4.6 Specifications
“BAS,” which is a “BaaSid” token, is an important form of the exchange value of a public
network verification infrastructure achieved by all participants who take part in BaaSid.
The major goals of BAS are to enable network participants to be compensated for the
value of their user activities and to enable instant access and hyper confirm.

5. Vision of "BaaSid"
5.1. Standard of BaaS
Various services that borrow the use of the BaaS are provided with blockchain services,
and connectivity to web and app services.
By connecting this blockchain service and web and app services, and providing the
highest level of decentralization to both users and providers to implement a safer and
more active form of service, “BaaSid” will open to the door to safe and convenient
internet service.
This will provide more fundamental solutions to the even more sensitive and important
activities taking place on the internet compared to when the internet was first invented.
A wide range of service providers and users participating in the Certificate of Public
Network can create new services and broaden the service offerings through the Certificate
of Public Network based on such safety, convenience and efficiency.

5.2 Internet Service Market
The Certificate of Public Network of the “BaaSid” frees service providers from the most
sensitive field of operation, the database, security system, various payment gateways and
all other verifications. This will enable efficiency and autonomy to be enjoyed in the
current internet service market as in the future, each country, organization, and agency
will increase the requirements of rules and regulations.
Agencies and financial markets will confirm and verify personal information easier and
more conveniently. Banks can perform safer more reliable verifications and Certification
of Public Network for personal wire transfers and transfers.
The Certificate of Public Network of "BaaSid" in the insurance market can provide
convenient personal verification, and offer the safer sharing of personal information such
as medical history with hospitals and other organization, and inter-operabilit can be
achieved among various systems for various transactions with external agencies.
The market for online shopping malls can secure higher profits and more users through
the access to users and convenient purchase procedures. Further, this can be widely
applied as schools, hospitals, healthcare facilities and other diverse markets will require
the personal Certificate of Public Network of "BaaSid".

35

5.3. Big Data Service “BigBaaS”
Online service providers (OSP) perform various login, payment, and finance verifications service by
receiving a user verification from "BaaSid." Then, because there is no DB held in-house, OSPs are
unable to perform other services requiring a DB such as various independent promotions or events.
Therefore, there is a plan for “BigBaas,” which is developed and operated based on “BaaS,” to
provide internet service providers with the various activity data gathered from the instant access of
users (participants) and even provide email and various alert services to users (participants) that
accessed the relevant internet service even once. )
The BaaS User (node or device) will safely ensure the anonymity and personal privacy of the
websites accessed, what was viewed, how long the user remained on that site, what was purchased,
and what activity was engaged in while enabling such information to be recorded and effective and
clear target marketing can be performed based on this information.
“BaaS UTMS”(BaaS User Target Marketing Service)” is a big data service with such power security
features, and it will help accelerate the spread of “BaaSid.”

PoA & PoH compensation system and BAS token demand / supply
OSP (Online Service Provider) and BSP (Blockchain Service Provider) shall be pay to BaaSid by
BAS token for users and miners (PoA / PoH). Because, they are saving the cost from database
construction / operation and security system construction / operation cost through use from BaaSid
infra. In addition, for the use of BigBaaS, OSP/BSP must pay the BAS token for costs.
Also, BaaSid will be positioning to PG(Payment Gateway) for online Payment Market.
This means that the BAS token is a continuous and essential demand, and the OSP/BSP need
continuously purchase a certain amount of the token to hold the extra amount or purchase the
necessary amount of the token, thereby increasing the token purchase ratio
