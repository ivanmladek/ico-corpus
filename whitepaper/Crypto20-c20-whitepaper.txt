EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The only opportunity for future participants to buy these tokens
post-ICO will be from ICO participants on exchange – no further
tokens will be sold or minted. 98% of the ICO funds will go
towards purchasing the underlying assets. A full breakdown of
funds utilization and token distribution is available in sections VI
and XIII.

Cryptocurrencies have grown exponentially since their creation
in 2009, with the total cryptocurrency market capitalization
currently standing at over $150 billion. While growth has been
strong, the market capitilization of cryptocurrencies as a whole is
still only a fraction of that of the S&P 500 index - which is itself
only a fraction of the global stock investment market. There is still
room for considerable growth.

The index hyperparameters for the portfolio and rebalancing
methodology were carefully determined via a structured data
science approach. A trading strategy was put in place to mitigate
the risk of front-running and a viability study was conducted
to confirm that a portfolio at the maximum raise size would be
able to effectively acquire sufficient coins without paying a large
premium. The minimum effective portfolio size is $2m and if this
is not achieved all investor funds will be returned. A maximum
component weight of 10% was selected to prevent any single asset
from dominating the index.

There are now thousands of cryptocurrencies to choose from,
with more appearing each day. Choice paralyzes - choice adds
cost, complexity and the need for advice. High risk, extreme
volatility and practical difficulty compound to render buying
and safely storing an effective and diverse portfolio of coins
(cryptocurrencies) a complex problem.
CRYPTO20 is the worlds first cryptocurrency-only tokenized
index fund, and aims to provide a solution to this problem. The
portfolio will autonomously maintain a diverse portfolio of the top
20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in the same way that
funds such as the Vanguard 500 maintain a portfolio based on the
market capitilization of the top 500 publicly listed US companies
(the S&P 500). In order to continue to track the market (index)
over time, CRYPTO20’S asset portfolio is adjusted regularly in a
process called rebalancing.

Security is extremely important and the smart contract code
was audited by an independent third party (Hosho Group). Expert
advisors were consulted, best practices implemented and strong
identity verification procedures put in place to prevent Sybil attacks
and bad actors from compromising CRYPTO20. CRYPTO20’s
holdings will be audited and the audit report made public post-ICO.
A full list of advisors is available on the CRYPTO20 website.
A public ICO will be held from the 16th of October to the 30th
of November 2017. CRYPTO20 will use the ICO contributions to
acquire assets and test rebalancing over December and the coin is
expected to be listed on exchange in January 2018.

CRYPTO20 is not a platform, it is a fully functioning product.
CRYPTO20 cuts out the middleman and is thus able to offer the
lowest fees in the industry.
Index funds have consistently outperformed actively managed
funds since their inception. For the 12-month period ending May
2016, investors poured more than $375 billion into index funds,
while actively managed funds experienced outflows of roughly
$308 billion during the same period. One reason why index funds
outperform actively managed funds is due to their low annual fees.
CRYPTO20 has an annual fee of only 0.5% whereas competing
crypto offerings have fees of 3% per year. All crypto offerings
built on one of the many recently launched fund platforms will
apply their fees over and above those of the platform. CRYPTO20
can offer such low fees because it is independent and automated.
Index strategies are a set of rules that an algorithm can act on with
no human intervention required.

All trading data will be stored during CRYPTO20’s operations this valuable data includes order books, pricing, coin volumes and
more. After approximately six months of trading this deep dataset
will be utilized by our machine learning partner, DataProphet, to
optimize rebalancing and produce trading strategies for future fund
types. CRYPTO20 ICO participants will have priority access to
these very limited cap funds and the C20 token will be convertible.
In conclusion, CRYPTO20 is a closed-cap, tokenized
cryptocurrency portfolio that autonomously tracks the top
20 cryptocurrencies with weekly rebalancing to a maximum
component weight of 10%.
Instantly owning a diverse cryptocurrency portfolio is now as
easy as holding a single token.

C20 is a utility token that is representative of a portion of the
total value of the CRYPTO20 cryptocurrecy index. The initial
tokens can only be acquired during the token offering process
which is a one off, closed cap offering. The tokens provided will
represent a participant’s share of the portfolio. 98% of the total
amount contributed during the offering will go directly towards
buying the underlying cryptocurrencies. C20 is an ERC20 token
based upon the Ethereum blockchain. Operating on the blockchain
allows for global accessability, 24/7 trading, transparency, public
verification of CRYPTO20’s holdings and no expensive legacy
banking fees.

”Don’t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy
the haystack!”
– John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group and
inventor of the index fund.

The tokens value is linked directly to the 20 underlying
cryptocurrency assets held by CRYPTO20 via the innovative price
floor mechanism implemented in our smart contract. The smart
contract allows participants to cash out for their share of the
underlying assets at any time. This means that C20’s value on
exchange will be protected - it will be irrational to sell at a price
lower than the tokens share of the underlying assets if a higher
price is offered via the smart contract. Token holders are free to
sell or exchange their tokens at any time and pay no exit fees,
broker fees or advice fees.

I. INTRODUCTION
The benefits are simple and many: convenience, no
broker fees, no exit fees, full transparency, full control and
a lower price bound. There is no need to keep your C20
tokens on a centralized platform and you are free to sell
or exchange your tokens without restriction. Automation
allows CRYPTO20 to operate with fees of only 0.5% p/a as
opposed to the market average of 3% p/a.

ABSTRACT
CRYPTO20 is an autonomous cryptocurrency-only portfolio
composed by utilizing an index strategy. The token sale funding
will be used to buy the underlying cryptocurrency assets
and CRYPTO20 will hold the top 20 cryptocurrencies by
market capitalization. CRYPTO20 cuts out the middleman,
the platform, and is thus able to offer significantly lower fees.
Index funds have consistently beaten the average managed
fund since their inception.
CRYPTO20 is not a platform, it is a fully functioning
product and its token value is not based on speculation but
rather the product benefits and net asset value of the 20
underlying cryptocurrencies. There are no broker fees, advice
fees or exit fees. CRYPTO20’s utility token is called C20. It
can be traded at any time, holdings are fully transparent and
there are no legacy banking fees or expensive fund managers.

No trust is required in the ability of human fund
administrators/traders – an index fund strategy does not
require any discretion or judgment, just adherence to a
method determined via data science. The number of tokens,
rebalancing frequency and asset weightings were carefully
determined and our approach is detailed in this white paper.

C20 tokens are directly tied to the underlying assets with
a novel liquidation option that can be exercised via the
smart contract. This function ensures a greatest lower bound
(infimum) on the market value of all tokens.

The ICO funds will be used to buy the underlying assets.
Tokens can be liquidated through the C20 smart contract
for their share of the porfolio’s net asset value (NAV). This
is key: it protects the token price as it would not be rational
to sell at a lower value on exchange when tokens can be
directly liquidated for a higher value.

CRYPTO20 allows for access to a diverse cryptocurrency
portfolio by holding a single token. The tokens will be tradable
on exchange post-ICO and no further tokens will be issued.
The top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization change,
and so will CRYPTO20’s holdings. This rebalancing process
allows for tracking of the cryptocurrency market index and is
an effective risk mitigation strategy.

Funds with stellar performance attract substantial amounts
of new money. A manager will most likely have to use that
new money to ”chase” a relatively small group of coins.
This buying pressure can drive up coin prices, forcing the
fund manager to pay higher prices than would otherwise be
the case – affecting all tokenholders by reducing the fund’s
future gains. This is the motivation for issuing no further
tokens post-ICO.

A cryptocurrency portfolio based on a hybrid index system
consisting of the top 20 coins by market cap, with weekly
rebalancing and a component cap of 10% produces a combination that has broad market exposure and acceptable turnover
without allowing a single asset, and thus single source of risk,
to dominate. This paper seeks to structure and justify our
hypotheses and conclusions.

The total market cap of the S&P 500 (June 30th, 2017)
was 21.83 trillion USD [1] while the entire combined
cryptocurrency market cap is only a fraction (approximately
0.7%) of this [2]. The S&P 500 is only a small part of
the global investment market. There is thus still significant
potential to introduce retail investors into the crypto market.
Exposure to crypto returns with a broad, limited risk
profile offers a compelling case to both crypto and fiat
investors. CRYPTO20’s value proposition (diversification
by holding a single token) will be heavily promoted via
marketing and investor outreach. The only opportunity to
purchase these tokens post-ICO will be on exchange from
ICO participants – highlighting the real demand for reduced
risk crypto investments whilst simultaneously creating value
for participants.
CRYPTO20 will be of benefit to the community as a whole
– market transparency and liquidity will increase as a result
of our trading activity. We will bring fresh support, funding,
and understanding to the community. Conventional Investors
who were uncertain about investing in a single technology
or system will now have an option to support the emerging
cryptocurrency market through CRYPTO20.

III. RATIONALE BEHIND A CRYPTO INDEX
STRATEGY
Index investing has seen exponential growth among
investors since the first index mutual fund was launched
in 1976. This has proven to be a successful form of
investment as the low-cost involved has allowed index funds
to outperform the majority of active managers across market
and asset styles.

Fig. 1.

Over a 10-year investment horizon more than 80%
of large-cap fund managers failed to outperform their
benchmark index. The odds of picking a winning fund
manager are also low: studies show that regardless of past
performance, future performance is virtually random [4].

Comparison of managed vs. index funds [3]

Simply, an index fund allows investors to track the index
– the underlying trend behind the selection of assets without
being reliant on a particular one. There is no active trading
apart from the rebalancing of assets at fixed time intervals.
This allows the fund to consistently track the mean market
performance even if some of the original assets fall out of
favor.

Definitions:
Open-end mutual fund:
An open-end fund is a mutual fund issuing unlimited
shares of investments in stocks and/or bonds. Investing
creates more shares, whereas selling shares takes them out
of circulation. Shares are bought and sold on demand at
their net asset value, which is based on the value of the
fund’s underlying securities and is calculated at the end of
the trading day. When a large number of shares are redeemed,
the fund may sell some of its investments to pay the investor.
Shares are bought directly from the fund administrators.

The CRYPTO20 tokenized portfolio would be the first
of its kind – it is bought with crypto and holds only
cryptocurrencies. It will bring stability and old-economy
money into the ecosystem, which will boost liquidity and
provide a stable instrument for those who previously thought
it was too risky to invest in a single technology.

Exchange-traded fund (ETF):
An exchange-traded fund is like an open-end mutual fund
but instead trades as a common stock on a stock exchange.
It is not purchased directly from fund administrators. An
ETF may trade at a premium or discount to the NAV but
this is often very short-lived due to arbitrage by institutional
investors.

It is hypothesized that one is not able to attribute the
lack of cryptocurrency take-up by retail investors seeking
to allocate ’high-risk’ portfolio funds solely to the difficulty
of purchasing cryptocurrencies. The number of exchanges,
services and payment methods available to purchase
cryptocurrencies is increasing exponentially. In many cases
it is easier and less burdensome to purchase bitcoin than to
invest in a USD denominated mutual fund.

Closed-end fund (CEF):
A closed-end fund is seeded once-off via an IPO and
then traded on exchange thereafter. No further shares are
issued and CEFs may trade above net asset value as buying
and selling the shares on exchange has no effect on the
underlying assets.

The authors believe this lack of investment may be due to
the fact that no such product has previously been available,
communicated effectively in plain non-technical language
and actively marketed to this sector. There is a distinction
between ’high risk’ and ’unacceptable risk’ in the minds of
many investors – cryptocurrencies have traditionally been
seen as the latter [5]. CRYPTO20 aims to bring the risk to an
acceptable level for allocation to a retail investor’s portfolio.

The structure of CRYPTO20 is analogous to a new hybridtype; a closed-hybrid fund (CHF):
- A CHF is a closed-end fund that trades with an index
strategy whereas traditionally all closed-end funds have
been actively managed.
- Post-ICO, investors will only be able to purchase the
C20 tokens on exchange. No further tokens will be sold
directly. Buying and selling tokens on an exchange does
not affect the underlying NAV and CHFs are able to
trade at a premium depending on market forces.

Zero Sum Game
The central concept underlying the case for indexfund investing is that of the zero-sum game. This theory
states that, at any given time, the market consists of the
cumulative holdings of all investors, and that the aggregate
market return is equal to the asset-weighted return of all
market participants. Since the market return represents
the average return of all investors, for each position that
outperforms the market, there must be a position that

- A price floor is created via the liquidation option in
the smart contract, effectively ensuring that the token
is not able to trade at a discount.

5

underperforms the market by the same amount, such that, in
aggregate, the excess return of all invested assets equals zero.

- Ethereum smart contracts enable a very transparent way
of offering a liquidation option.
The smart contract complies with the ERC20 token
standard [8] and can be used from any compatible Ethereum
wallet. The contract code facilitates an ICO crowdsale by
specifying a start and end block number so as to restrict
certain functions during the ICO period. The token to ether
price ratio is adjusted dynamically throughout the presale
such that token price tracks $1 (the bonus structure is then
applied on top of this).

This zero sum around the market weighted mean return
means that for every profitable trade an investor makes,
another investor must make the opposite side of that trade
and incur a loss relative to the market. This holds true
regardless of whether the coin or token in question is
mispriced or not, and for the same reason, the zero-sum
game theory must apply regardless of market direction.
The distribution of market returns will thus be centered
around a mean - the index CRYPTO20 aims to track. By
holding a basket of coins we hope to capture this mean return
– we expect to see a few coins that underperform and a few
that overperform, the sum of the returns should provide the
mean or market/index return.

Participants can send ether to the contract directly or via
the buy or buyTo functions. The ether purchase amount is
used to calculate the tokens bought which are then added
to the balance of the participant account. The participant
account (the account that is debited with tokens) is the
sender account when using the buy and fallback function
or the specified address when using the buyTo function and
passing an address as an argument.

Low-fee Fund Benefits
Active traders and fund managers generally have a far
higher fund expense ratio than that of an index fund –
around 6 times higher than an index fund (3% p/a compared
to 0.5% p/a). The effect of this is that the aggregate return of
investors is less than zero sum which makes outperformance
compared to an index strategy and to the market much less
likely.

The smart contract has a two-tier control functionality
which gives two controlling wallets different levels of
authority. This allows future blockchain development and
full on-chain automation without sacrificing the control of
fund managers.
The withdraw function automatically calculates the ether
amount to send to the participant account based on a forward
pricing policy [9] which uses the asset-backed price of the
tokens less a 1% trading fee. This trading fee is not a fee
that CRYPTO20 imposes - it is levied by the exchanges
necessary to execute the liquidation procedure. The price
will be updated regularly to accurately reflect the value of
the underlying crypto assets.

Data from the Financial Research Corporation has been
used to evaluate the predictive value of different fund
metrics such as a fund’s past performance, Morningstar
rating, alpha, and beta [6]. In the study, a funds expense ratio
was the most reliable predictor of its future performance,
with low-cost funds delivering above-average performance
relative to the funds in their peer group in all of the
periods examined. Likewise, Morningstar performed a
similar analysis across its universe of funds and found that,
regardless of fund type, low expense ratios were the best
predictors of future relative outperformance [7].

// simplified contract withdrawal function for
illustrative purposes
function withdraw(uint withdrawAmount) {
address participant = msg.sender;
require(block.number > fundingEndBlock);
require(balanceOf(participant) >=
withdrawAmount);
uint withdrawValue = withdrawAmount /
currentPrice;

A position as a large player in the crypto markets will
afford CRYPTO20 access to lower exchange fees and none
of the legacy banking costs. Fiat investors looking for crypto
returns with a broad exposure and limited risk profile will
be drawn to CRYPTO20.

require(this.balance >= withdrawValue);
balances[participant] =
safeSub(balances[participant],withdrawAmount);
balances[fundWallet] =
safeAdd(balances[fundWallet],withdrawAmount);
participant.transfer(withdrawValue);

IV. SMART CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS
Reasons for Choosing the Ethereum Blockchain:

}

- Security and predictability (as opposed to, for example,
having to run a separate blockchain),
- Use of robust and well-supported clients (Ethereumbased tokens can be managed with official Ethereum
clients),
- High liquidity (transferable for ether),
- Easier listing on exchanges with infrastructure already
in place,

This withdrawal function ensures a greatest lower bound
(infimum) of the pseudo-continuous time market value of
all tokens. Formally:
inf imum{Σ(µi Fi )} ≥ H

(1)

Where µi is the speculative market coefficient of any single
participant’s total initial contribution (Fi ) and H represents
the total asset value of the portfolio. Seeing that Fi per tokens
6

bought is fixed during the ICO and that no further tokens
are minted; participants are assured a maximum minimum
withdrawal amount that is independent of all market forces
µi . The implications of this are explained below.

Summary:
-

V. LIQUIDATION OPTION
High-volume traders may seek to exploit pricing to the
detriment of the community by initiating sell-offs that
cascade and result in flash crashes so that they can purchase
the cheap tokens. The liquidation option offers a price floor
protection – this ensures the price never drops below that
of the underlying assets because of market manipulation.
Prices are, however, free to increase as speculative value is
created by the high demand for a low-cost, diversified and
automated cryptocurrency portfolio that can be held as a
single token.

The CRYPTO20 team tokens will vest over two years to
ensure that team incentives are aligned with ICO participants.
This is enabled via a public smart contract ’vault’.
VII. PORTFOLIO HYPERPARAMETERS
Future-proofing: Eventually crypto returns will likely
settle and resemble real-world investment returns as the
market becomes more efficient, and as altcoins reduce
bitcoin market cap dominance. Exchange fees will then
be more relevant as they become larger with respect to
profits. Predicting the rise and fall of cryptocurrencies is
near impossible [10] – and remarkably difficult even in
established markets with decades of data.

A small, dynamically allocated percentage of
CRYPTO20’s assets will be held by the smart contract
(in ether) to facilitate the liquidation option. This amount
will be controlled automatically as usage demands. The
vast majority of other cryptocurrency assets will be held in
various cold storage wallets.

The rationale behind an index strategy was previously established – we will now focus on increasing market exposure
and decreasing the costs of running such a system.

During a withdrawal, the C20 tokens are transferred
back to CRYPTO20’s managers. These tokens are then
resold on exchange at the current NAV per token or market
price, whichever is higher. This ensures that the underlying
assets can be rebought in the event that an investor uses
the liquidation option – which would be unlikely due to the
market price floor explained above.

Test Assumptions and Conditions:
Back-tests for portfolio value as well as expenses were
carried out for 105 175-day rolling windows, each separated
by 4 days, over the period 1 January 2016 - 16 August
2017. The rolling windows are implemented to ensure the
results are relatively time-invariant. The value and expense
graphs are for disjoint windows, line graphs are used for
clarity.

VI. TOKEN DISTRIBUTION AND STRUCTURE
There will be no token creation, minting or mining after
the ICO period. Tokens will be transferable and tradable
once the ICO is successfully completed and the underlying
assets have been acquired. Investment can be made in ETH,
BTC or LTC. The USD equivalent amount of any ETH,
BTC or LTC invested will be locked in at the time of
investment according to market rates and considered the
participant’s contribution.

Expenses are calculated as 0.2% of every trade required
to rebalance the portfolio and are accumulated within each
window. This includes both the selling off and purchasing of
entire coin holdings that enter or exit the top N number of
coins, as well as trades required to maintain the appropriate
cap-ceiling.

Blockchain forks were treated as anomalies and any new
coins created were seen as disparate from any other coin
holdings for the purpose of these tests. This was done to
ensure that test results do not incorrectly value a smaller
number of coins or a higher cap-ceiling due to this particular
anomaly being present in the data set.

Section A: Rebalancing Frequency
Rebalancing is the act of periodically adjusting a portfolio
such that its asset composition reflects the index it aims
to track. Rebalancing an index fund not only reduces risk
but also increases the median return. Daily, weekly and
monthly rebalancing periods were investigated as well as no
rebalancing.

Fig. 3.

Portfolio Performance for Different Rebalancing Frequencies

Hypotheses:
A1: It is hypothesized that a rebalanced portfolio is
likely to provide a greater median return. This means that a
rebalanced portfolio is likely to outperform a non-rebalanced
porfolio over multiple periods. The test conducted will
therefore be over multiple windows with each point on the
line graph representing the portfolio value at the end of the
window.
A2: The rebalancing frequency needs to achieve a balance
between accurately tracking the index and keeping turnover,
and thus expenses, low. It is hypothesized that a weekly
rebalancing frequency will achieve this goal.

Fig. 4.

Expenses for Different Rebalancing Frequencies

Analysis and Conclusion:
A1: In Figure 2 it can be noted that rebalancing
outperforms no-rebalancing across the majority of
observations in terms of value. A rebalancing strategy
is thus selected.

Tests:
A back-test of portfolio value for varying rebalancing
frequencies for tracking an index of the top 20 coins by
market cap was performed.

A2: As can be seen in Figure 4 above the expense ratio
increases dramatically with daily rebalancing. As crypto
returns in the long-term begin to normalize the much
greater expenses incurred by daily rebalancing will have a
more significant effect on the total value of CRYPTO20’s
holdings. A Weekly rebalancing frequency tracks the index
more accurately than monthly and has a more acceptable
cost ratio than daily.
Fig. 2. Portfolio Performance for Market-weighted Portfolios with Different
Rebalancing Frequencies

Section B: Number of Tracked Coins

As can be seen in Figure 2 above, a portfolio without
rebalancing does not track the index effectively. In Figure
3 below, weekly rebalancing seems to achieve the greatest
portfolio value most often out of the four rebalancing frequencies.
As the rebalancing frequency increases from weekly to
daily there is a dramatic increase in expenses. This is undesirable. Figure 4 provides an illustration of this difference.

B1: Is it hypothesized that portfolio expenses and returns
are correlated with the number of coins held in the portfolio.

Hypotheses:

Tests:
A back-test of portfolio value with number of coins E
∈ {10, 20, 30, 40} with a weekly rebalancing frequency and
a 10% cap-ceiling was performed.
Figure 6 below illustrates the frequency at which each coin
selection has the greatest value at the end of each testing
window.
Figure 7 illustrates how expenses as percentage of portfolio value varies by the number of coins the portfolio tracks.
Each point represents total expenses per rolling window
period.

1 Note that the test results shown for each of the hypotheses presented
below do not constitute the entirety of the data analyzed to reach their
respective conclusions. A large test space was simultaneously analyzed and
only the most relevant graphs are presented here.

C2: It is hypothesized that decreasing the cap correlates to
an increased total expense ratio as coins with lower marketcap (and thus lower index ranking) will have a higher than
normal weighting and thus incur greater expenses when they
churn in and out of the index.
Tests:

Fig. 5.

Fig. 6.

A back-test of portfolio value for top 20 coins at market
cap ceiling ∈ {10%, 20%, 30%, 40%} with weekly rebalancing was performed. A pure market-share weighted (no cap)
portfolio was also back-tested for comparison.

Fig. 9.

Expenses for Different Market Caps

Analysis and Conclusions:
B1: The number of coins in the tracked index does seem
to be correlated to the portfilo’s return and expense ratio. The
number of outperforming windows is substantially higher
for 20 coins when compared to the alternatives in Figure
6 above. The portfolio value incorporates turnover and thus
expenses. 20 coins are therefore selected to represent the
CRYPTO20 index.

Analysis and Conclusions:
C1: Figure 8 confirms that a capped portfolio performs
substantially better over the most recent 30 windows
(spanning the past 275 days).
It is also seen that a 10% cap ceiling performs most
consistently over all observed windows. A 10% cap is more
profitable more often and it offers a decreased risk profile
when compared to a portfolio without a cap where a single
coin may entirely dominate.

Section C: Cap-Ceiling
A hybrid-market cap index strategy protects against a
single coin dominating portfolio composition whether it
be bitcoin now or another coin in future. The higher the
market cap ceiling the closer the hybrid model emulates a
pure market-share model, with a 50% cap being roughly
functionally identical to the market-share model.

C2: A decreasing cap does correlate with an increasing
expense ratio as hypothesized (Figure 9). This is due to
the increased churn caused by a more evenly spread asset
distribution and is a consequence of the greater weighting
of the lower market-cap coins. A lower cap does, however,
allow the portfolio to achieve greater and more consistent
returns.

Hypotheses
C1: It is hypothesized that a hybrid-market capped
portfolio will increase returns and give broader market
exposure in comparison to a pure market-cap weighted
portfolio due to the greater weighting altcoins will receive.

Hyperparameter Summary

CRYPTO20 will at any stage hold varying amounts of
the 20 coins that form the index it tracks. The majority
of each of these cryptocurrencies will be stored in cold
wallets with a small percentage of each currency stored
in a wallet on our servers so as to facilitate automatic
rebalancing. If rebalancing necessitates moving more
of the cryptocurrency to these hot wallets this will be
done manually via interfacing with various cold wallets –
CRYPTO20’s portfolio managers will be notified ahead of
time so as to accommodate this. The weekly rebalancing
period affords more than sufficient time for this purpose.

A portfolio utilising a hybrid-market cap weighted index
strategy that tracks 20 coins with a 10% cap weighting
provides broad market exposure with acceptable turnover
and mitigates risk by more evenly weighting the tracked
assets. The cap also assists in future-proofing the porfolio
because a single asset, and thus single source of risk, is
not allowed to dominate. A weekly rebalancing frequency
offers an acceptable balance between portfolio turnover and
the ability to accurately track the underlying index.
VIII. REBALANCING METHODOLOGY

Trades will be executed over multiple exchanges at
varying times within our weekly rebalancing window to
mitigate the risk of front-running. The following section,
TRADING STRATEGY, contains a quantitative analysis on
liquidity and front-running.

CRYPTO20’s portfolio will be rebalanced in accordance
with FTSE Russel’s capping methodology [11]. The Constituent Capping Factor ci is given by:
ci =

X
Z
(pj × sj )
I × (pi × si )

(2)
Ledger Nano Ss [12] will be used for the storage of all
cryptocurrencies it supports. For all cryptocurrencies not
supported, encrypted USB drives will be utilized. These
storage devices will be held in secure safe deposit boxes with
back-up paper-wallets stored at separate secure locations.
Locations are undisclosed for security consideration. A
public audit post-ICO will confirm the presence and
safe storage of the USB drives and paper-wallets to ICO
participants.

j∈J

Where,
• i denotes the crypto to be
capped
• j denotes an uncapped
crypto
• J is the subset of cryptos
that are uncapped
• pk is the official closing
price of the k th crypto

•
•

•

sk is the circulating supply of the k th crypto
I is the percentage of the
index represented by all
uncapped constituents
Z is the percentage capping level (i.e. 10%)

Wallet interactions with CRYPTO20 will be facilitated
through light clients running within their own containerized
services. See the AUTOMATION section for additional
detail.

The constituent capping factor is calculated and applied
to all constituents whose uncapped weighting is above
10%. The weights of the uncapped constituents are then
calculated and if any previously uncapped crypto now has a
weighting greater than 10%, the constituent capping factor is
recalculated including this crypto in the subset that requires
capping. This process is repeated until all cryptocurrencies
are capped correctly.

X. TRADING STRATEGY
The S&P 500 is rebalanced quarterly and additions or
deletions are announced several days prior to the actual
change [13]. In most years 25 to 30 stocks in the S&P 500
are replaced [14]. Any funds tracking this index need to
rebalance their portfolios in accordance with these changes.
Some index funds trade the added or removed stocks in the
days in the run-up to the change and some trade on the day
of the change.

IX. SECURITY & TRANSPARENCY
CRYPTO20 has implemented security industry best
practices for defense against Sybil attacks and bad actors
in co-operation with our team of expert advisors. Strong
identity verification and authentication procedures are in
place to ensure secure operations.

As of 07/31/2017, the bottom 10 stocks of the Vanguard
S&P 500 ETF are only approximately 0.063% of the
index value [15]. The market cap of the Vanguard fund is
$338.3 billion [16] and the bottom 10 stocks are $213.8m
by market cap of the total fund. These stocks have a
combined average daily trading volume of $40.25m [17]
[18]. Front-running and purchasing of stocks is seemingly
a much greater problem for fiat index funds – of which
Vanguard is only one – and these funds only lose 20-28
basis points p/a (0.2 – 0.28 % per year) to front-runners [19].

The smart contract code has been thoroughly audited
by the Hosho Group (https://hosho.io/) for vulnerabilities,
confirmation of operation as described in this White Paper,
static and manual analysis of the smart contract, gas analysis
and verification of the deployment procedure.
Transparency in CRYPTO20’s trading activities and
current holdings will be ensured through the use of viewonly exchange APIs as well as through proof of reserve
for non-exchange wallets (this includes both hot and cold
wallets).

The CRYPTO20 portfolio’s lowest weighted constituents
would be approximately 1% of AUM on average [20]. This

XI. AUTOMATION
CRYPTO20 will be automated via API integration with
multiple exchanges, possibly including but not limited to:
Bitstamp, Bitfinex, BTer, Bittrex and Poloniex. The full list
of exchanges utilized will be available on our website when
trading begins. Additional exchanges will be added when
vetted and APIs with the minimum sufficient functionality
are made available.

TABLE I
Amount immediately purchasable for four low-volume coins in the
CRYPTO20 index as of 28 August 2017

The liquidation price of the C20 tokens will be determined
through the use of an exchange service developed by
CRYPTO20. Automation of liquidation price updates are
an essential part of smooth business operation, however,
automation can also expose security risks due to the
necessity of online private key storage. We circumvent this
risk by implementing a two-tier permissions system, with
multiple addresses allocated only the necessary permissions
to fulfill a particular task, such as updating the liquidation
price. This strategy enables risk-mitigating automation
without having to store crucial private keys online.

equates to $750,000 with $75m-worth of AUM. The lowest
market-cap coins in the index have average daily trading
volumes of approximately $5-20m, as evident in Table
1. The amount immediately purchasable was calculated
automatically by the CRYPTO20 exchange service via the
ingestion of order book data from the utilized exchanges.
Adding a coin thus generally necessitates the purchase of
only 3% to 15% of average daily trading volume, while
the Vanguard S&P500 index fund has to contend with the
purchase of 200-500% of the average daily trading volume.

The CRYPTO20 backend runs as a cluster of containerized
services using a thoroughly scalable and redundant
architecture running on Kubernetes. Security and reliability
is central to our system design – we rely on public-key
cryptography, multiple factor authentication and system
isolation of private keys. The vast majority of CRYPTO20’s
holdings will be stored offline in cold wallets.

The coin with the lowest trading volume, Waves, is able
to comfortably support the purchase of more than 5% of
AUM in the rebalancing period at a slippage of only 3%
from the best price. Only 1.38% would need to be acquired
for the 28th of August 2017 example. This effectively
justifies the decision for a maximum portfolio value of
$75,000,000.

Backend calls to exchange API services will be used
to find optimum routes for different trading pairs so as
to obtain best possible prices on trades. This method will
ensure underlying assets are always bought at the most
competitive rates and exchange fees.

Any front runners would need to anticipate coins entering
the top 20 and have enough liquid capital on exchange to
move market rates. CRYPTO20’s index strategy trading rules
will be known – however, several strategies will be employed
to mitigate this risk:
1) Cryptocurrencies will be sent to the exchange 1-48hrs
in advance of the trade so that traders cannot follow
the hot-wallet to know exactly when a purchase or sale
will be made. A weekly rebalancing window affords
sufficient time to do this.
2) Trades will be executed over multiple exchanges.
3) Trades will be executed at varying times within the
rebalancing window to prevent predictability.

CRYPTO20’s system architecture makes use of a
microservice design pattern, incorporating messaging and
task queues with full event logging. Isolating services that
can act as potential attack vectors from the rest of our
systems will enable us to enforce tight security preventing
the kind of breaches some other Ethereum-based ventures
have seen.
XII. MARKETING AND INVESTOR RELATIONS

Anomalies and Responses

The CRYPTO20 team will invest significant time and
effort into post-ICO marketing targeted towards investors
in the traditional financial sector via the production
of information sheets, explainer videos and planning
documents that are easily understandable. Token holders
will be able to view detailed information on their holdings
and portfolio composition on the CRYPTO20 website.
CRYPTO20 will focus marketing efforts solely on nonregulated markets. No promotion or solicitation will be
performed where participation is forbidden or likely to be
forbidden in the near future in order to remain compliant

Forking: If a cryptocurrency were to fork, the forked
currency would be added as a regular portfolio asset.
Rebalancing would be performed as per usual at the next
interval.
Crypto base BTC-ETH swap: A BTC-ETH swap does not
affect CRYPTO20’s trading strategy. During rebalancing,
the most supported single-base exchange pairs are used
agnostic to the specific crypto.

with local legislation.

XV. PROJECT TIMELINE
Initial Research and Development
- January - April 2017 – Developed the team and concept;
conducted thorough backtests to determine portfolio
hyperparameters; set wheels in motion to create a compliant legal structure.

XIII. ICO FUNDS UTILIZATION
The CRYPTO20 team has completed the development
of the trading system. The ICO funds (98%) will go
towards purchasing the underlying assets. A small allocation
(0.5%) is made for legal fees to ensure that CRYPTO20
is compliant with regulation upon commencement of
exchange trading and a complete audit of received funds by
a major auditing firm. CRYPTO20 and its cryptocurrency
diversification value proposition will be heavily promoted
to retail investors and a 1.5% allocation is made to facilitate
this. Any unused funds from the 2% operating expense
allocation will be utilized in a discretionary capacity once
CRYPTO20 has commenced on-going trading.

Develop Smart Contract and Autonomous Trading System
- April - June 2017 – Developed innovative CRYPTO20
smart contract to best practice specifications; developed
back-end for multi-exchange trading.
Finalize Smart Contract and Trading Protocol
- June - July 2017 – Complete smart contract to auditready state. Optimized autonomous index trading algorithm to mitigate front-running and slippage. Consultation with industry expert advisors.

- 1.5% Continued Marketing Pre-Exchange Listing
- 0.5% Legal Fees and Post-ICO Audit
- 98% Underlying assets

Test Trading System; Security Audit
- July - September 2017 – Security audit and code review
process. Trading system tested and completed.

XIV. REPORTING

C20 Token Pre-Sale

Accounting standards for cryptocurrencies remain unclear.
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) will
either create a new standard or change existing standards
to address accounting for investments in intangible assets,
including digital currencies. They are known to set standards
based on successful businesses leading the way in how
to account for their investments, for example in the case
of commodity broker-traders. The IASB might take years
to develop and implement a new standard – considering
all possibilities early might enable CRYPTO20 to pioneer
a standard and give tokens credibility as an alternative
investment vehicle.

- 7th October - 14th October 2017 – Token pre-sale.
C20 Token ICO
- 16th October - 30th November 2017 – Token ICO.
Public Audit of ICO Funds
- December 2017 – Public auditing firm to audit
CRYPTO20 ICO and release statement verifying holdings.
Initial Top 20 Coin Acquisition; On-going Marketing and
Investor Relations; First Rebalancing Procedure
- December 2017 - January 2018 – Initial coin holdings acquired; final information sheets and reporting
structures released to retail investors. First portfolio
rebalance is performed and monitored.

CRYPTO20 has conducted an analysis into the audit and
accounts requirements in order to provide best effort in complying with existing legislation. CRYPTO20 will operate on a
quarterly reporting basis with annual accounts. The quarterly
reports will include information on governmental risk and
legislation, risk/return analysis, portfolio performance and
end of year predictive market analysis.

Public Launch on Exchange
- January 2018 – C20 Token is listed for trade on exchange.
Data Collection; Regular Operation

Financial reports will include the following:

- January 2018 - Future – The data pulled from multiple exchanges - order books, volumes etc. will be
stored. After approximately 6 months of operation, this
valuable deep dataset will be used to inform future
development; incl. development of AI fund products
by partner DataProphet. CRYPTO20 ICO participants
will have priority acceptance into these very limited cap
funds and C20 tokens will be transferable into these
funds.

- A balance sheet and a statement of the portfolio’s total
investment value
- An income statement for the period covered
- A list of the porfolio’s amounts and values on the date
the balance sheet was issued
- A statement of salaries or any other monies paid to the
directors, advisory board and officers
- Total amounts of crypto purchases and sales
The information will be made available on the investor
portal of the CRYPTO20 website and CRYPTO20’s assets
will be viewable at any time with a blockchain explorer.

XVI. CONCLUSION

R EFERENCES

A hybrid market-cap weighted (10%) index strategy
portfolio consisting of the top 20 coins by market cap, with
rebalancing weekly produces a combination that has broad
market exposure and acceptable turnover without allowing a
single asset (and thus a single source of risk) to dominate.
