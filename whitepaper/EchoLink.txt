Abstract
We introduce a blockchain based system of verified education, skill, and career information for
individuals. The EchoLink System stores professional and other related information in an unalterable
format on blockchains. The EchoLink System supports and provides access to multiple public,
alliance, and private blockchains. All information is provided by trusted information authorities. The
system saves businesses and other entities time and financial resources in recruiting, admission,
vetting efforts while providing easy access to a pool of vetted candidates. The EchoLink System can
be further extended to provide verified information in addition situations and industries, such as
banking, finance, and insurance.

INFORMATION
In an information society, education, skills, and work experience lead to better career
opportunities for individuals. Businesses increasingly seek out candidates with the right level
of education and real world job skills. The need for high quality employees creates
tremendous opportunities for people with the right education background, skills, and job
experiences.

1.1.

Global Education in the Age of Internet
The education industry is being disrupted by the Internet. The global e-education market has
been growing at a [compound annual growth rate] of around 7.2% over the next decade to
reach approximately $325 billion by 2025.
The size of the e-Learning market in the United States of America (the “​U.S.​”) was over USD
1
27 billion by 2016, owing to rising significance of these services across the region . There are
numerous other encouraging facts about the continuing growth and adoption in this sector.
Easy accessibility along with improvised effectiveness due to animated learning is likely to
positively impact the size of the e-learning market. In addition, an increasing number of
internet users coupled with an escalating number of internet enabled mobile phones are
anticipated to propel industry demand [for e-learning] over the several upcoming years.
On top of academic education, the online corporate training market [in the U.S.] is expected to
grow by 13% per year, with 77% of U.S. companies offering online training to improve the
development of their ​employees​1​. ​The era of e-education is truly upon us. In addition to
academic training, skill training related to specific job requirements is also in demand.

1.2.

Demand For Talent
The economy of today is based on knowledge. As such, employers are increasingly looking
for job candidates with a high level of skill. Be it language skills, IT skills, financial skills, or
other service skills, skilled labour is highly sought after by employers.
Employers pay high amounts of referral bonuses or head hunting fees to acquire candidates
with good skills. The recruiting industry generated USD 428 billion in revenue worldwide in
2016 (approximately equivalent to EUR 386 billion), with the U.S., Japan and the United
2
Kingdom making up a majority of the ​revenue . ​Online job sites, such as TaskRabbit, that
cater to employers seeking certain skill sets for specific jobs are experiencing explosive
growth. Employers are increasingly looking for and paying for employees with specific skill
sets.
In today’s competitive global market, employers are willing to spend a high percentage of their
revenue to find the right employee with the appropriate skill set(s).
In the case of LinkedIn​: Q3 2016 revenue was USD 960 million with 17% generated (USD
162 million) generated from premium account subscriptions, 18% (USD 175 million) from
3
marketing solutions, and a staggering 65% (USD 623 million) from talent ​solutions .

According to LinkedIn, its talent solutions help corporate recruiters share, find, and engage
the best talent. Corporate recruiter services provided by LinkedIn costs $9,000 per year per
seat (user login).

CURRENT ISSUES
While demand for education and training has become global, academic and training
institutions have nevertheless remained fragmented and isolated. Academic record
verification and skill verification are cumbersome processes. In the U.S. and many other
countries, there is no nationwide unified academic record system.
When it comes to job skill certification, such as IT skill certification, the process is even more
fragmented. Degree certifications and grade reports can be altered, difficult to verify, or
non-verifiable in many situations. Employers spend a significant amount of resources
searching for candidates with the right skill set, and even more resources to check their
references and verify their academic records and skill certifications.
All these problems can be solved with an immutable and verifiable blockchain based system.
In particular, the following areas are most affected by inaccuracies in education, skill, and
employment history:
(a)

Degree Inflation
Inaccurate or false education and degree information being listed on resumes in order
to gain employment or attain a high position in an industry. In a high profile case in
2012, Scott Thompson left the employment of Yahoo! as its chief executive officer
after it was uncovered that he had embellished his academic credentials, ending his
term at the company after just 4 months.

(b)

Skill Inflation
Certain specialised industries value and seek candidates with the right skill set. As a
result, many applicants who apply for jobs in such industries will claim to have the
requisite skills in their resumes. For example, as certain information technology skills
become increasingly in demand, claims of applications possessing certain information
technology certification in areas such as big data or artificial intelligence have
become more common. It is entirely up to the employer to verify such claims. In
situations where certification is provided by private organisations / academic
institutions, verification of such academic credentials can be difficult.

(c)

Job Experience Inflation
Inaccuracies in job experience stated in resumes are not limited to certain sectors,
but are pervasive across industries. The following are some of the more well-known
4
cases that took place in recent years :
(i)

Cross Border Verification
The global number of students who study abroad continues to rise with an annual
increase of 10%. There were almost 5 million international students in 2014. The
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has projected
that, with demographic changes, the international student population is likely to reach
6
8 million by 2025 .
It is often difficult to ascertain information regarding degree or skill level certification
across borders. It is also difficult to judge the quality of education for degree holders
from abroad, with the exception of well-known universities.

of job applicants lie on their resumes. Cover letters are notorious for embellishment
8
and exaggeration .
Though many employers are performing background checks, 75 percent of such
employers have indicated that they had nevertheless hired the wrong person for the
job. These employers say a bad hire has resulted in:
(a)

less productivity: 36 percent;

(b)

compromised quality of work: 33 percent;

(c)

lower employee morale: 31 percent;

(d)

lost time to recruit and train another worker: 30 percent;

(e)

cost to recruit and train another worker: 30 percent; and

(f)

employee’s managers or co-workers had to spend excessive time assisting
bad hire: 29 ​percent​8​.

Most importantly, the majority of employment related verification is done after the initial
resume screening process or in-person interviews. Most pre-employment verification
9
processes cost between $5 to 65 per process . Considerable time and effort are invested in
the initial resume screening and interview processes, and would be wasted should the
verification process discover any negative indicators. A resume screening system that offers
verified education, skill, and job history would be invaluable to recruiters and save businesses
time and financial resources. It would allow recruiters to precisely find candidates with the
desired education, skill, and job history / background before spending valuable time and effort
to engage the candidates.

OUR SOLUTION - ECHOLINK
EchoLink is a blockchain network that connects students, education, and training institutions
and industry participants. EchoLink is a blockchain based system of verified education, skill,
and career information for individuals. The system, EchoLink, stores professional career
related information in a hashed and unalterable format on public blockchains. All information
is provided by trusted information authorities.
For students​, EchoLink stores student grades, degrees, and certificates in a protected and
verifiable blockchain system. It provides student records to potential employers and higher
learning institutions in a trusted manner.
For academic and training institutions​, EchoLink provides them with the resources
required to handle (provide and receive) degree and certificate verification.
For businesses​, EchoLink provides a trusted source of candidate information that is not
alterable. Academic records and skill certificates are associated with job candidates in a
trusted way as they are supplied by the academic and training institutions directly, and are
immutable.

Advantages of Blockchain
Traditionally, any kind of credential verification has depended on the issuing institution or
other trusted authority to confirm the authenticity of a credential. This is a time consuming and
costly process. If the issuing organisation has ceased to exist, records are lost and
unverifiable. The blockchain provides a more robust solution in the form of a distributed
network of recorded ledger. A blockchain cannot be easily altered or taken down, removes
single points of failure, and ensures that records can be verified without any organisational
dependency.
The blockchain logs transactions between parties, and can be used to verify:
(a)

existence of a record;

(b)

that a record has not been altered since its issuance;

(c)

the identity of the issuing institution;

(d)

ownership of the record; and

(e)

that the record has not expired or been revoked.

This is all done on a distributed and public system. All amendments and alterations of the
record are also recorded in the distributed ledger, which provides a chain of evidence on the
record as well.
Once a record, in the form of a smart contract on the blockchain, has been cryptographically
created and recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or spoofed. Any person
attempting to impersonate an issuing institution will not be able to execute the smart contract.
Decentralized key registries map keys and institutions across different industries.
3.2.

Economic Incentives
The EchoLink System operates on public blockchains, which greatly reduces the cost of
operating a similar system in a traditional web environment.
In the case of the Ethereum platform, with a properly written smart contract, the cost of
execution is fixed at 21,000 gas. Given that the speed of transaction confirmation is not the
most critical factor in the context hereto, the smart contract may be confirmed at a slower
pace. When confirmation of transaction is done at around 60 seconds, the cost is at around
USD 0.003 per record creation. For a sizable university, such as University of California,
Berkeley, with a graduating class of approximately 10,000 students, the cost of creating digital
proofs of graduation for the entire class year is approximately USD 30 per year.
In the case of the NEO public blockchain, with an allocation of 10 free gas per smart contract,
the EchoLink System essentially runs free of charge in most situations. This greatly reduces
the cost of maintaining the system. The economic benefits are shared with all the participants
of the system.
For businesses in particular, our system reduces the cost of verification, which directly
translates into a reduction in cost of hiring.
For academic and training institutions​, our system removes the burden of maintaining a
verification system, which in most cases requires personnel and IT equipment. This amounts
to savings to operational costs. In addition, our system passes a portion of the fees paid by
16

EchoLink - Blockchain Based Professional Networking and Recruiting Platform

Chen

businesses to issuing organisations. This creates a positive economic incentive for issuing
organisations.
For students​, our system makes their credentials credible. Potential employers put greater
trusted in verified education, skill, and work experience. Our system injects a higher degree of
seriousness in employer queries, and provides students greater exposure in the job market.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Overview​: ​The EchoLink System consists of four major components, and offers
heterogeneous and multiple blockchain support:
(a)

Digital Identity and Mapping System – translates digital identity to real world names
and well known institutions;

(b)

On-chain Credential Creation System – supports batch creation and storage of
credentials;

(c)

Off-chain Data I/O System – external data input and output from web, database,
feeds, etc.; and

(d)

Multi-chain Data Browser for End User – intuitive interface to credential created and
stored on a number of heterogeneous blockchains, such as Ethereum, AntShares,
Metaverse, etc.

Identities of students and organisations in the EchoLink System are recorded on the
blockchain in the form of public encryption keys. Certificate / degree info are created and
stored onto the blockchain by issuing organisations directly. Certificate / degree information
includes the digital identity of the corresponding student.
All information is stored on blockchain in an encrypted format. Through the EchoLink browser,
users may find candidates matching certain attributes based on recorded certificate / degree
information. Query results will be resolved by the naming service into a user-friendly readable
format. Results are presented to the end user by the EchoLink browser.

Figure 2: Echo System Overview
17

EchoLink - Blockchain Based Professional Networking and Recruiting Platform

It is envisaged that all certificate / degree information will be entered into the system by the
relevant issuing organisations, which lends to the credibility and integrity of the certificate /
degree information.
Note​: [Reference implementation] on Ethereum. The Echo system supports NEO, Dash,
IOTA, and other blockchains.
4.1.

Digital Identity and Credential Creation
The EchoLink System utilises publics key (for example, Ethereum addresses) to identify
entities in the EchoLink System. Each student is intended to hold a public key in the system.
Each issuing organisation will also have a public key (in other words, account) in the
EchoLink System.
Credentials creation involves the issuing organisation executing a smart contract that binds
the issuer (for example, the academic institution) to the recipient (for example, the student)
along with the corresponding credentials information. The smart contract acts as a proof of
existence of the credentials on blockchain. Since the smart contract is executed by the issuer,
we can be certain of the authority of such a credential.

4.1.1.

Digital Identity
Digital identities of the participants of the system are stored in the blockchain in the form of
public keys. Students and known issuers will have a set of public keys that are recognised by
the community. The public keys are used in the creation of credentials in the EchoLink
System.
The EchoLink System provides a convenient way of mapping public keys to students, known
issuers, and their accreditation. Business organisations pay a fee in the form of EchoLink
token to access the mapping information of real world identities and public keys in the
EchoLink System.

4.1.2.

Credential Creation
Issuing entities create credentials by executing smart contracts that set the status of the state
of the smart contract. In the case of Ethereum, smart contracts with state information are
time-stamped and stored in the blockchain. This mechanism creates an immutable proof of
existence.
Issuing entities may include the recipient’s public key address, degree information, or even
hashed value of photographs and paper degree files into the blockchain. Even though the
blockchain can be downloaded into a node and scanned, the information contained in the
EchoLink System smart contract are only utilisable after resolution from the identity mapping
service of the EchoLink System. The state information (in other words, credential details) is
presented in user-friendly readable format through the EchoLink browser.
P2P encrypted document storage is utilised to store image and binary information
associated with a certain credential. Once called upon, images and other binary files can be
accessed by the EchoLink browser, thus providing the end user with a rich media experience
accustomed to business users.

18

EchoLink - Blockchain Based Professional Networking and Recruiting Platform

Chen

Figure 3: P2P Encrypted Document Storage
One method of implementing such off chain data feed is through InterPlanetary File System
(“​IPFS​”) Images or files in portable document format (PDF) associated with the recipient are
stored on IPFS. Hashed addresses of such documents are used in the smart contract that
generates the credentials, thus linking additional documents to the credential.
4.1.3.

Digital Identity Mapping System
As stated above, digital identities of the participants of the EchoLink System are stored in the
blockchain in the form of public keys. Since the EchoLink System is a system that is intended
to provide trustworthy credentials, anonymity is not a requirement for the users of the
EchoLink System. On the contrary, participants of the EchoLink System should make their
identities known in order to respond to system queries.
The EchoLink System provides a mapping service to map public keys to identities of students
and organisations. This mapping service is related to the EchoLink browser to the end users,
and is transparent to the end user. Only during the presentation of query results submitted by
the end user, would the mapping service resolve the identities of the public keys and present
human-readable information to the end user.

Figure 4: Digital Identity Mapping
4.2.

Off Chain Data Sources
In the EchoLink System, only digital identities of the issuing entity and the recipient are
required to constitute a verified credential on the blockchain. In reality, more information may
be provided in order for the credential to be useful the user, providing more insight.

19

EchoLink - Blockchain Based Professional Networking and Recruiting Platform

Chen

Besides digital identities, other important information regarding a person’s credentials include
academic records, course work transcripts, detailed degree information, and skill certification
information. This information will be accessible to queries through “oracles” (in other words,
off chain data sources).

Figure 5: Off Chain Data Inputs Present More Information to End Users

Furthermore, through dedicated oracle services, more information sources, such as web
services, may be linked to the smart contract.
4.3.

Dynamic Blockchain Browser
The primary end users of the EchoLink System are primarily intended to be business
organisations and recruiters. A user friendly blockchain browser would be essential to
business users.

Figure 6: Echo Browser: Search and Get Vetted Candidates

Ideally, the EchoLink browser would combine functionality of both a blockchain explorer and
an EchoLink wallet. Business users search candidates through the blockchain functionality
and pay fees through the wallet functionality, all in the same browser application.
4.4.

Multi-Blockchain Support
It is envisaged that EchoLink System users will span the globe. The EchoLink System is
intended to serve students from various countries studying abroad. Businesses recruiting
internally may also use our system to find the best talent worldwide. The EchoLink System
will eventually need to provide support for data stored on different blockchains operating on
different technology platform and countries.

20

EchoLink - Blockchain Based Professional Networking and Recruiting Platform

Chen

The EchoLink System operates through smart contracts for credential creation on various
blockchains. Blockchain platforms that offer support for smart contracts with Turin-complete
virtual machines can be used as the underlying blockchain layer for the EchoLink System. (for
example, Ethereum, NEO, and Dash). Although not necessary, blockchains that offer oracle
access to off chain data would be more compatible with EchoLink premium features, such as
graphical credential certificates.
The mechanism to establish multi-blockchain support is through the EchoLink browser. It is
the end user interface for smart contracts to multiple back-end blockchains. The nature of the
supported blockchain can be a public ledger, alliance ledger, or even private ledgers. The
EchoLink browser provides a readable and user friendly interface to multiple blockchains.
5.

ECONOMIC MODEL
As indicated earlier in the paper, large amounts of financial resources and personnel are
spent on acquiring talent by businesses around the world. On average, each user of
LinkedIn’s corporate recruiter service pays $9,000 per year. LinkedIn generated a staggering
$623 million from such solutions in Q3 of 2016 alone. The need to find the right job candidate
is the fundamental economic driver of the EchoLink System.
The fees paid by business users contribute to the health of the EchoLink System. A portion of
the fees are distributed to education and training organisations as incentives to provide
verified information. A portion of the fees also contribute to the actual upkeep of the EchoLink
System.

5.1.

Token on EchoLink System – EchoLinkToken
The EchoLink System provides an exchange medium to pay fees between users and other
participants of the system in the form of the EchoLinkToken (symbol: EKO). With support for
heterogeneous back-end blockchain data sources in the EchoLink System, a common
exchange medium is needed. The EchoLink smart contract and multi-blockchain browser
have built-in support for the EchoLinkToken across different blockchain systems. Therefore,
data providers from public blockchains, alliance blockchains, and even private blockchain
would be easily rewarded with EchoLinkTokens.
An even more important use of the EchoLinkToken is to establish an international education
reputation and skill level market place. With the EchoLinkToken as the common method of
value exchange in the EchoLink System, quality of education in different countries,
institutions, and disciplines can be measured by a common and consistent token.

6.

CONCLUSION
The EchoLink System is a user focused blockchain application system, and is designed from
a user perspective. The EchoLink System supports multiple blockchain platforms across
countries. It addresses an acute business need, namely identifying great talent with verified
credentials at a reduced cost. The EchoLink System is driven by real-world economic needs
and is built on top of a sound economic model.
Furthermore, The EchoLink System breaks down barriers between education systems,
credential verification systems, and value systems to bring out a truly trusted and worldwide
talent market.

6.1.

Future Work
We plan to further strengthen the EchoLink System by focusing on the following areas:
21

EchoLink - Blockchain Based Professional Networking and Recruiting Platform
(a)

next generation of end user access and interaction: both mobile and desktop;

(b)

more industries support in addition to talent and education; and

(c)

education credential valuation market based on EchoLink System users voting.

Chen

In addition to improvements to the EchoLink System, the same design principle can be
utilised to create blockchain based notary, transaction, and proof of existence system for
other industries.
