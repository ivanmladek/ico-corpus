Introduction
FOLM coin was designed as a masternode-based payment system. Our team, has been
reviewing developments in Blockchain technology over time and has also studied
many blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and identified a number of deficiencies related to them. We wanted to create a new innovative and cutting-edge cryptocurrency
that will make several improvements in Blockchain technology and address some of
these deficiencies. We decided to create FOLM coin.

The FOLM infrastructure uses the codes that make up

For example, the FOLM team has developed a special

Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core). We have also combined some

algorithm for detecting and adjusting mining difficul-

These and so many small but important developments
have made it possible for FOLM coin to be one of the
most seamless cryptocurrencies for both circulation and
mass adoption.

Philosophy
We needed to define FOLM coin briefly and have therefore defined it as a cryptocurrency that is at the intersection of performance and security. For example, the block length of Bitcoin is 1 MB, which causes delays in payment transfers. Where much
longer blockchains have been proposed, the presence of larger sized blocks and the creation of orphan blocks threaten the
reliability of the system. We have chosen a reasonable but not overly long block length (4MB) that would meet both transfer
speed and system security.

FOLM is a cryptocurrency that is at the
intersection of performance and security.
With the features of FOLM, we are aiming to become a safe

What’s Next
Folm aims to be your future payment system. For that firstly, we have analyzed the problems that have been happening with existing blockchain-based coins and have decided
to architect FOLM with good block time, block size and other great features for a seamless and sustainable blockchain infrastructure.

We have developed a payment system that will work on

About FolmBank
The FOLM Bank is a SaaS (Solution as a Service) running on the FOLM network. Owners of FOLMs can make smart payment contracts
on the FOLM Bank. Once the conditions of the contracts have prepared appropriately, they provide the required folm circulation on
the blockchain.

Folm
Network

FolmBank

Users

FolmBank will provide great convenience with features you have never seen before. It has superiorities than former possibilities of
the blockchain technology.
Users can ensure that a payment procedure is expendable with the approval of the paying party. Otherwise, even if the payment
went to the opposite side, it will not be expendable (transferable to another party).
Users can create payment templates based on agreements between the parties involved. For example, User might create a
payment template that divides jobs on a service contract and ensures that payment is released only if the relevant milestones are
completed and the sender has granted the approval to release the funds.
The transfer of digital assets to legitimate heirs in case of death has always been a problem. With the Folm bank, users can automatically transfer all of their assets if user's legal heirs die. This will be made seamless and automated.
Users can send an expendable payment to a later date. For instance, User 1 paid User 2 now. However, User 2 can start spending 6
months later. Among these, the FOLM Bank will be the payment key for the future with many more features.

Why
Phi1612
Released by 216k155 with Luxcoin, The PHI1612 algorithm
is one of the most secure encryption algorithms; combination of Skein, Jh, Cubehash, Fugue, Gost and Echo
crypto algorithms. It does a GPU-based calculation
during encryption. Unlike the outer encryption algorithms, GPU resources are not always used at the highest

Phi1612
Algorihm
The six hashing algorithms that make up Phi1612 are:
Cubehash (Daniel J. Bernstein 2009), Echo (Petri Nets 2012),
Fugue (Shai Halevi, William E. Hall, and Charanjit S. Jutla
2019), Gost (RF. 2012), Jh (Wu 2012), and Skein (Ferguson et
al. 2010)

level during mixed encryption calculations. This means
there will be less electricity consumption and less heat
generation. Thus, it has a resource-friendly approach and
does not compromise security. Phi1612 can be mined on
a wide array of consumer-grade hardware including
CPUs, as well as AMD and NVidia GPUs. Phi1612 is ASIC
and Nicehash resistant.

Block Rewards
Today most cryptocurrencies yield a very high ROI in the first year. However, in the following years, this gain is reduced, while the
bonus rewards per block is reduced. Instead of this, FOLM increases the number of block masternode prizes in the second year,
thus making masternodes win more.

Masternodes
Masternodes are, in fact, a decentralized web of computers that serve FOLM.
Masternodes perform important network functions and distribute block prizes. They
help fix the coin demand, process it and serve the FOLM ecosystem.
Masternode activation requires 5000 FLM and some technical knowledge for
operations. Any wallet that controls 5000 FLM can create a Masternode.

Obfuscation
Coin Mixing
Folm is based on Coin join but is designed in a centralized manner through various enhancements and improvements discussed through the original coin channel. It
provides a superior level of privacy during this process.
Although not incredibly anonymous, obfuscation keeps
the standard bit processing threshold stable through
node blending. As an example, all Bitcoin operations are
transparent. For Folm, a malicious actor would need to
control more than 50% of the Masternodes. It is quite
high and significant enough that a single process anonymization ratio of less than 0.5% is mixed.
The 8-Round Obfuscation (Kiraly 2017b) feature is an

SwiftTX
SwiftTX provides Masternodes with the ability to negotiate and lock transactions. When any process is sent to the
network, a group of Masternodes will work to verify the
operation. All Masternodes in the group are locked to join
the Blockchain, if they agree on the correctness of the
operation. Compared to the more common system on
this side (faster by confirming more than one bitcoin
during the 10 minute block timing). SwitftTX allows
multiple operations to be performed at the same time,
with the same location in front of a block on the top of
the network. This system is based on Dash's InstantSend
(Kiraly 2017a).

important feature for complicating anonymous operations for FLM users.

Sporks
The Folm network uses a multi-stage fork mechanism
known as “Sporking”. This feature will allow the FLM
network to implement new features and open the
desired network. Spork changes are deployable via the
node software can be turned on and off as required by
the network. For security reasons, the updates (Strophy
2017) feature is extremely useful and allows the network
to react.

TOR & IPV6
Masternodes
Folm allows the user to run the full node (or Masternode)
from an onion address or an IPV6 address. FOLM will work
to add full TOR nodes to both options. The unique
experience of Folm users working in the TOR network
itself and in the mode has been arranged for you.
The unique feature of TOR Masternode support is as a
secret service to run your Masternode.
Tor nodes also provide users with stable internet connectivity.
Masternodes solve the aggression and reconciliation
problems by removing the confidentialities from their
home networks without affecting them, thereby removing the threats posed by location or home networking
exploits.
