BitCash Whitepaper v 2
1

What is BitCash?
BitCash is a cryptocurrency that helps consumers and businesses
trade. By combining the benefits of decentralization with those of
internet

banking,

BitCash

makes

spending

and

accepting

cryptocurrencies as easy as other currencies, like dollars or yen.
BitCash aims to be the world’s most useable cryptocurrency, helping
everyone enjoy faster, cheaper, and secure trading.
BitCash also powers our innovative PeerQ platform that aims to help
facilitate adoption amongst the masses.

What is PeerQ?
PeerQ is a Quora-like platform that rewards users in cryptocurrency
for answering questions and completing tasks.

What is BitCash’s mission?
To become the world’s most useable cryptocurrency so everyone can
share in the rewards of decentralization.

2

How will BitCash deliver on its
mission?
BitCash will help overcome the barriers that deter businesses and the
general public from entering the cryptocurrency space. Specifically,
BitCash will focus on the following key areas:
a) Usability
b) Stability
c) Simplicity
d) Mass adoption
PeerQ combines these four areas to create a familiar, easy-to-use
platform that allows anyone to gain access to cryptocurrency.

Why does the world need BitCash?
The benefits of decentralized cryptocurrencies are well known: they
include speed, privacy, security, efficiency, and lower fees. But so far,
few people have enjoyed them.
While the market cap of cryptocurrencies has grown rapidly over the
last few years, attracting widespread media attention, they have yet
to seriously impact the way we exchange value today.
This is partly because consumers prefer the familiarity of credit cards
and traditional currencies (fiat), bribed into maintaining the status
3

quo by incentives like reward points, insurance, and tap to pay. Just
buying and storing cryptocurrency can be a technical challenge, and
there are still too few places to spend it.
The challenge for businesses is a lack of tools. Cryptocurrencies offer
huge advantages like zero chargebacks, faster settlement, and lower
fees, but have yet to allow basic tasks like printing transaction
statements, recurring payments, importing ledgers into accounting
software, and so on – the very tools a business needs to run.
BitCash overcomes these challenges by helping consumers use
BitCash as currency, while providing businesses with the tools they
need to transact on a day-to-day basis. We aim to “borrow” the
features of today’s fiat banking and combine them with the power of
cryptocurrency. This will encourage mass adoption, and in turn, help
more

individuals

and

businesses

enjoy

the

benefits

of

decentralization.
The PeerQ platform creates a peer-to-peer knowledge economy. It
incentivizes participation, rewards the best answers, and provides
real-world utility for the BitCash cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrencies face an adoption
challenge
Global adoption
Only a handful of businesses currently accept cryptocurrencies as a
form of payment. Just over 13,000 venues in the world accept
Bitcoin, for example (according to Coinmap’s August 2018 figures).
That’s a drop in the ocean compared to the millions accepting credit
cards.
Venues accepting cryptocurrencies grew by just 38% over the last
year. At this rate, people could wait decades before being able to
spend their cryptocurrencies as easily as using their credit cards.

Ease of Use
Buying cryptocurrencies is hard. You must download a wallet,
navigate complex software, and keep track of passwords,
transactions, and other data. At the moment, it’s easier to buy a
$1,000 couch online than it is to buy $1,000 worth of Bitcoin.
Unless we make buying and using cryptocurrency as easy as fiat, we’ll
never reach mass adoption and the rewards of decentralization will
remain out of reach.

Tax reporting issues
5

Many Western Governments consider cryptocurrencies “intangible
property”, subjecting them to capital gains or other similar taxes,
depending on the jurisdiction.
So if you buy and then sell a cryptocurrency at a profit, you could be
subject to taxation. Even if you make a loss, you might still have to
report it to taxation authorities.
By this rule, every time you buy something with cryptocurrency –
whether it’s a product or service – the transaction might be taxable.
And at the moment, tracking cryptocurrency transactions is an
absolute nightmare: you can’t print statements, there’s no
accounting software support – you can’t even see what you spent
your money on.
Can’t easily be integrated by online businesses
Once

the

general

public

starts

filling

their

wallets

with

cryptocurrency, they’ll be looking for somewhere to spend it.
Businesses that can’t accept cryptocurrency could lose out to others
that can. The challenge is therefore ensuring cryptocurrencies adopt
the tools of current banking systems, so every business can
participate.

6

How will BitCash tackle the
adoption challenge?
BitCash solves the crypto adoption problem in three ways:
1. By making it simple to buy, mine, manage, and use
cryptocurrency.
2. By giving businesses the banking tools, they need to accept
cryptocurrency payments.
3. Through PeerQ, which is a Quora like platform that rewards
users with BitCash for answers and completing bounties
We don’t believe cryptocurrencies will replace traditional currency
(fiat). There’s enough room for both as each offers its own unique
advantages. Instead, BitCash is designed to work alongside fiat to
make everyday transactions faster, easier, and more secure.
Change takes effort. We often put off until tomorrow what we can do
today, regardless of how persuasive the arguments. But as we all
know, tomorrow never comes. BitCash is therefore designed to help
the world move to a crypto-inclusive economy by making
cryptocurrencies as easy to use as fiat.

What makes BitCash different to
other cryptocurrencies?
7

To use most (if not all) cryptocurrencies today, you need a good
amount of technical expertise. This complexity hinders mass
adoption, as many people don’t have the time, energy, or desire to
learn how to use them.
Exchanges like Robinhood and Coinbase made it easy to buy and sell
cryptocurrencies, but despite their popularity in the cryptocurrency
community, they’ve have had little impact on mainstream adoption.
BitCash, on the other hand, is designed for mainstream adoption.
BitCash is as easy to use, manage, and access as fiat money. That
makes BitCash the only cryptocurrency working to deliver the
benefits of decentralization on a global scale.
The PeerQ platform is easy-to-use and requires no technical
experience. In order to achieve mainstream adoption it is vital that
simplicity is always at the forefront.

8

What features does BitCash offer?
BitCash combines the convenience of the world’s internet banking
systems with the security, speed, and efficiency of decentralization.
BitCash will be the world’s first decentralized internet bank, and
includes the following features and usecases:
 PeerQ
PeerQ is a social platform that rewards users for sharing knowledge.
Users ask questions, offer bounties, provide answers, and complete
tasks to earn BitCash.
 Named accounts
With named accounts, there is no more fiddling with messy
blockchain addresses designed for geeks and crypto enthusiasts.
 Stable currency feature
BitCash Stable addresses the problem of price volatility when sending
money to a third party, paying retailers, or storing value. BitCash
Stable secures the value of BitCash for the short, medium, and long
term, making it easier to integrate into the financial system.
 Transaction references
Buyers using BitCash can enter in a private record which is only
visible to the buyer and seller - this creates stored transaction

9

records making it easy to see where your money went, manage your
cashflow and plan for taxes.
 Send coins via Twitter, Twitch and Instagram
Tip anyone on Twitter, Twitch or Instagram.
 Recurring payments
Paying employees with crypto just became easier. Set and forget, you
can now pay your staff with cryptocurrency just like you can with
traditional banking software. Consumers can also now pay for their
favourite subscription products using crypto.
 Multiple accounts within one wallet
Just like your normal online bank account, the BitCash wallet will
allow users to create and label various accounts within the one wallet
to help consumers and merchants organise their transactions.
 Printable e-statements
Your internet banking allows for easy statements, why shouldn’t your
Crypto? With statements, both consumers and merchants can keep
healthy records of their transactions.
 BitCash payments to anyone
Just like PayPal - you can send BitCash to anyone in the world, even if
they don't have a BitCash address, nickname or wallet.
 Pre-sending verification
10

The BitCash wallet verifies that a BitCash address or Nickname exists
before you can send to that address.
 Stealth addresses Security
Added security to ensure that your wallet is safe and secure.
 One Click Mining
Simply open your wallet and click "Start Mining" to earn BitCash. It
doesn't get any easier than that.

What privacy features does BitCash
have?
Stealth addresses
BitCash introduces a new kind of stealth address. Every time you
send coins to a BitCash address, the coins will end up on another
random stealth address. Also, every time you use the same
nickname, the coins will end up on a new random receiver address.
BitCash uses the same stealth address concept as Monero. For more
information, please read pages 7 and 8 of the Monero White paper.
Monero computes the destination key from the sender as follows:
P=Hs(rA)G+B
The receiver can compute the one-time public key as follows:
11

P’=Hs(aR)G+bG
The receiver can compute the one-time private key as follows:
X=Hs(aR)+b
In BitCash we additionally had a Master Public Key M and a Master
Private Key m. We removed the Master Private Key with the hard
fork on 23 July 2019. Since that time BitCash uses the public key from
the transaction of block 1 of the Bitcoin blockchain as Dummy public
key to replace the Master Public key. The assumtion is that nobody
knows the private key for this public key.Also we only use one Public
and Private Key for the addresses. So only A and a is used. B and b is
not used.
The Master Public Key is known to the public, but m is not known by
the public.
The sender calculates a shared secret through a Diffie Hellman
exchange with the receiver as follows:
S=rA
The receiver can calculate the same shared secret as follows:
S=aR
This shared secret is used by the sender to encrypt the random data r
with AES encryption. This encrypted version of r can later be
decrypted by the receiver with the shared secret as password.

12

The sender computes the destination key as follows:P=Hs(rM)G+A
The receiver can compute the one-time public key as follows:
P’=Hs(rM)G+aG
The receiver can compute the one-time private key as follows:
X=Hs(rM)+a
The owner of the Master Private Key can compute the one-time
public key as follows:
P’=Hs(mR)G+A
BitCash also stores 2 bytes of the real public key of the receiver in
without any encryption. This enables BitCash to find potential
matching transactions much faster. Before we introduced this, the
stealth addresses were very slow.
The sender of a transaction can reveal r to prove that he sent the
transaction and to enable any person to check decrypt the stealth
address and the description line.

Addresses with viewkey
BitCash uses addresses with a viewkey for the web wallet and the
mobile wallets. The web server can store the view key to recognize
incoming transaction. The web server is however not able to spend
any coins with only the view key.

13

These addresses are longer and contain two full public keys, like the
Monero addresses.
V is the public viewkey and v is the private view key.
If the addresses with viewkey are used the shared secret S is
calculated with the viewkey as follows:
The sender calculates a shared secret through a Diffie Hellman
exchange with the receiver as follows:
S=vA
The receiver can calculate the same shared secret as follows:
S=aV
This enables the receiver who knows the viewkey private key V to
decrypt the encrypted random private key r.
Then the real address can be decrypted:
P=Hs(rM)G+A

Non privacy addresses
BitCash also provides a special address format for non privacy
transactions. These addresses are mainly intended for the exchanges.
These addresses are faster to compute than the stealth addresses. If
a wallet contains thousands of addresses it is preferable to use non
privacy addresses.
14

For the non privacy address the shared secret S is calculated as usual.
But it is then only used to encrypt the description line, but not to
encrypt the real address.

Description line
BitCash introduces an AES-encrypted description line field for all
transaction outputs.
A shared secret T is calculated and is used to encrypt and decrypt the
description line with AES encryption.
The sender and receiver can calculate the shared secret as follows:
T=rM
The owner of the private master key can calculate the shared secret
as follows:
T=mR
This way the description line can be decrypted by the receiver and
the owner of the Private Master Key.

15

Stable currency feature
The BitCash Stable feature, like other stable coins, was created to
address the problem of price volatility when sending cryptocurrency
to a third party, paying retailers, or storing value. BitCash Dollar
secures the value of BitCash for the short, medium, and long term,
making it easier to integrate into the financial system. With the new
BitCash stable feature, there are now two currencies stored on the
blockchain, BitCash and the BitCash Dollar. One account is the
BitCash account and the other is the BitCash Dollar account.
The BitCash Dollar account has its own address with “dollar@” in
front of the nickname or address. So for e.g. dollar@JohnDoe would
send to the BitCash Dollar account and @JohnDoe to the BitCash
account. Also, there will be two send functions, one function to send
from your BitCash account and one to send from your BitCash Dollar
account.
BitCash → BitCash
BitCash → BitCash Dollar
BitCash Dollar → BitCash
BitCash Dollar → BitCash Dollar
BitCash Dollar = $1 USD.

16

when you hold your money in a BitCash Dollar account, the value will
always remain the same. Keep in mind, you can send the money from
one BitCash Dollar account to another BitCash Dollar account. You
can also make payments in BitCash Dollars directly and there will be
no price risk for the merchant.
The benefits of BitCash Stable are groundbreaking. With this feature,
you can send US$1,000 to someone across the globe and they would
receive it in less than a minute with minimal fees, no conversion fees
on each end, no middle man, no hefty transaction fees for both
parties, and no having to wait days for funds to clear.
The BitCash Stable feature makes it feasible for an online merchant
who may be interested in accepting cryptocurrency as a payment
because they can now accept BitCash Dollar without having to sell
instantly. Instead, hold the coins in their BitCash Dollar account until
they’re ready to sell. This will help entice more online merchants to
accept BitCash and/or BitCash Dollars.

17

How the stable feature works
BitCash stores 3 price pairs at the end of the block header. Each price
pair needs to signed by one of 14 private keys. BitCash checks if all 3
price pairs are signed by a different of the private keys. Each of the 3
price pairs consists of one price which will be used to convert BitCash
into BitCash Dollars and another price which will be used to convert
BitCash Dollars into BitCash.
BitCash will then take the average of the two prices which are closed
together to calculate the effective price for the block. It will calculate
one effective price for the exchange from BitCash into BitCash Dollars
and one for the exchange from BitCash Dollars into BitCash.
BitCash stores one additional byte with the target currency for every
transaction output. At the moment two currencies are supported.
0 = BitCash and 1 = BitCash Dollar.
BitCash checks if the price is converted correctly (using the effective
block price), if the transaction inputs are in another currency than the
transaction output.
All transaction inputs need to have the same currency. The
transaction outputs can have different currencies.
BitCash uses two fields to store the value of the transaction output.
One stores the value in the currency of the transaction inputs
(nValueBitCash). And one stores the value in the currency of the
transaction output (nValue). nValue can change until the transaction
18

has been mined into a block. Therefore nValue is not included into
the transaction hash.

How is BitCash mined?
Mining BitCash is simple. It’s a CPU-mineable cryptocurrency, so
anyone with a computer can start mining BitCash in as little as four
steps:
1. Download the BitCash wallet for your operating system.
2. Install the BitCash wallet.
3. Open the BitCash wallet.
4. Click “Start Mining”
As the project develops, BitCash will release a GPU miner to allow
miners to direct their GPUs to BitCash, which will strengthen and
grow the BitCash network.
We’ll embed the GPU miner into the BitCash wallet so that nontechnical users can mine with the click of a button, without needing
any batch files or code.

19

What Proof-of-Work algorithm does
BitCash use?
Initially, BitCash utilized the Cuckoo Cycle algorithm. However, as the
network grew, some individuals were able to manipulate this
algorithm and gain an unfair advantage over others in the network.
As a result, on 23 February 2019 12:00 UTC, BitCash forked over to
the well known and proven X16R algorithm.
X16R is a hashing algorithm, which is based on the classic X11. It uses
sixteen chained hashing algorithms in an effort to thwart the move to
ASIC mining
For more information on the X16R algorithm, please the x16R
bitcoinwiki page.
Because there now is an ASIC miner available for X16R, we will be
moving from X16R to X16RV2 soon.
We are adding the algorithm Tiger into three seperate parts of the
current X16R algo. The Tiger hash is performed before the algorithms
Luffa512, Keccak512, and SHA512.

20

How does BitCash handle difficulty
retargeting?
BitCash uses a new algorithm for difficulty retargeting called Virtual
Timespan Retargeting (VTR).
For Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, difficulty retargeting happens
after a fixed number of blocks (2,016 for Bitcoin). To set the new
difficulty, Bitcoin compares the time it took to mine these blocks with
the target time (2,016 blocks x 10 minutes). Since the difficulty stays
the same for all 2,016 blocks, the time between these blocks can be
compared easily.
However, the BitCash VTR algorithm examines the time it took to
mine the last 24 blocks and changes the difficulty after every block.
The problem with retargeting after every block is that the difficulty
constantly changes, so it’s not enough to simply compare the time it
took the mine these 24 blocks with the target time (24 blocks x 1
minute).
Other

cryptocurrencies

have

invented

algorithms

like

DarkGravityWave (Dash) and Kimoto Gravity Well to try to solve this
problem, but they still don’t calculate the correct difficulty. If a single
miner mines 20 blocks, the difficulty is too low, but the algorithm will
then try to compensate by making the difficulty too high, delaying
discovery of the next block. The difficulty can fluctuate for some
time.
21

BitCash’s VTR algorithm offers a simple solution to this problem.
First, we take the time it took to find the next block for every of the
24 previous blocks, and then adjust that time to the difficulty of the
latest block. This means multiplying the timespan between two
blocks by the latest difficulty, and then dividing it by the difficulty of
the block in question.
Then we add the times of all 24 blocks together to create a “virtual
timespan”. This is an estimate of how long it would have taken to
mine these 24 blocks if all had the same difficulty as the last block.
Now we can compare these virtual timespans with the target
timespan (24 x 1 minute) to calculate the new difficulty.
This algorithm will adjust the difficulty within a short number of
blocks to the right difficulty without overcompensating in either
direction. We could even adjust it for large changes in mining power
(by a factor of 10) within 5 to 10 blocks.

How is the BitCash team funded to
grow and promote BitCash?
The BitCash project has no physical offices or any employees. The
network is coded, designed, and run by volunteers from all around
the globe, and anyone is welcome to contribute. No ICO or fundraiser
of any kind ever took place. All code is given away and published as
open source.
22

BitCash was launched with a 9.7% premine and has an ongoing 10%
block reward.
PeerQ is a very strong asset for the BitCash project, as it is a seamless
entry point into BitCash and can help facilitate mass adoption. With
that being said, the block reward is used to redistribute BitCash into
PeerQ bounties to allow for those who do not mine or trade a fair
way to gain access to BitCash.
The remaining BitCash from the block rewards is used to fund our
discord bots. This allows for us to reward our community members
for being active on our community platforms.

Why are the premine and ongoing
block reward important?
The premine and block reward recognize the BitCash team’s hard
work and incentivize them to keep making BitCash the best it can be.
The team worked tirelessly on developing BitCash for over a year
before the official release date, and they plan to continue developing
BitCash long into the future.
It is also vital that the block reward remains so we can create unique
entry points into crypto and BitCash (PeerQ).

23
