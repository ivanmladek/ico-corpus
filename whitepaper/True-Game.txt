is nothing better than real industry behind the blockchain. Successful
projects in the industry will benefit people . And today I am happy to

feedback and improved the platform.

INTRODUCTION
Throughout history, people have been attracted to games of chance. Every day millions of people around the
world play lottery games, take part in prize draws, spend time in poker rooms or play slot machines. Many
of these games are now played online.

The market of igaming is growing rapidly every year. If in 2016 the volume of gaming industry in global market
was about USD 44.16 billion, and by the year 2022 it is forecasted by analytics to become USD 81.71 billion.
The annual growth of the market for the years 2017-2021 is expected to grow by 18% [1].

However, there has always been a serious issue of trust in the iGaming industry. It not only concerns the
trust of players in each other, but also the trust they have in casino managers. The issue of trust is very
important in online gaming industry. Players can’t verify the integrity of a game or a lottery, and they can’t
be sure of the honesty of the organizers [2].

With the development of blockchain technology, the world of iGaming can undergo strong changes.
Blockchain enables to transfer winnings, generate random numbers, isolate draws from any manipulation,
therefore it brings full transparency and reliability to the gaming process. iGaming is perhaps one of the few
areas where all the advantages of blockchain solutions can be fully disclosed - decentralization, transparency,
low transaction costs and high data quality.

The idea of combining blockchain and iGaming lies at the heart of our platform. Truegame solves the above
issues of trust through its innovative use of blockchain technology and smart contracts. We developed the
infrastructure on the basis of Blockchain Ethereum and in 2017 we launched a fully working platform, which
already has more than 10 games and users are actively playing them. Prizes, lotteries and several types of
scratchcards are available on the platform. All games are completely transparent and are based on proven
RNG algorithm.

The overall online iGaming and betting market is normally segmented on the basis of types, platform, device used or
geographic regions. On the basis of types, the market is segmented into online casino games (bingo, slots, roulette,
keno etc.), card games (poker, blackjack, baccarat etc.), online sports betting, fantasy sports, lotteries and social
gaming. In 2015, sports betting held the largest portion of the global online iGaming industry with a market share
of 48 percent [7]. Online lotteries held around 10% of the global online iGaming revenues [8].

iGAMING MARKET

Based on the type of platform, the market is segmented into web-based online iGaming/betting and
downloadable online iGaming/betting. Based on the type of the device used by player, the market is divided
into desktop and mobile segments. The desktop segment includes PCs and laptops. This segment accounted
for the majority market share during 2016 and will continue to be the largest segment in terms of shares. [9]

Online iGaming is legalized in more than 80 countries across the world. On the basis of geographic regions,
the market is classified into Europe, Asia and Middle East, USA and the rest of the world.

Let us put some interesting facts about online gaming. Online lotteries are encouraged in China [10]. The
Singapore government exempted two online iGaming service providers called Turf Club and Singapore Pools
from Remote IGaming Act in September 2016 [11]. Asian and Middle Eastern market size is estimated 11.67
billion U.S. dollars [12].

Europe has the largest online iGaming market in the world [13] with a market size of 18.11 billion U.S. dollars
(2015) [14], and this is just going to increase as Netherlands adopts new online iGaming regulations. The
region is home to the highest number of online iGaming operators with minimal regulations as compared
to other regions. Subsequently, Europe is set to remain the dominant market for online iGaming and betting
throughout 2025 [15]. The UK plays a key role in the European market, followed by Malta.

PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

3

PROBLEMS
AND SOLUTIONS
Problem: Player’s mistrust to the casino manager. In most cases with online casino, the player does not have
a chance to check the randomness of determining the winner [20].
Generating random numbers is not transparent, and even in case of certified algorithms, a player can not be
100% sure of trustworthiness of a party that monitors the game.
Solution: Truegame solves this problem using blockchain and smart contracts technologies. Our algorithms
for generating random numbers are available on GitHub [4] and can be checked by anyone. Generation of
random numbers and distribution of winnings happens not on our servers, but in an autonomous environment
of blockchain Therefore, neither side can intervene in this process.

Problem: Most of the websites of iGaming industry can not provide suﬃcient transparency to the user to
ensure the player’s complete confidence in the integrity of site managers. The player can not see how many
people actually took part in particular game, which of them won and what is the amount of the winning [21].
Solution: Our platform presents a completely transparent system - all transactions are stored in blockchain.
They can not be changed or deleted. Anyone can check and see the progress of all our drawings on an
independent platform (for example Etherscan) [22] or on his computer on which the corresponding
environment of blockchain is deployed.

Problem: The player can not check the paying capacity of casino operator. The user can not be sure whether
the casino management has funds for payments, and whether the promised Jackpot can be actually provided.
Solution: Truegame provides full transparency - all the accumulated tokens are consolidated on a smart
contract. Anyone can look at the size of Jackpot on an independent platform, ensuring our ability to pay the
winnings.

TRUE GAME

PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

Problem: Security. An overwhelming number of online resources is subject to attacks by hackers [23].
Whatever protection measures are taken by the owner’s site - the risk of hacking always remains. In case
of traditional online casinos when their site is compromised, the attacker is able to fully manage the draws
and access the Jackpot.
Solution: Truegame is a decentralized application (DAPP). If our website is compromised, the attacker will
not be able to influence the process of the draws or gain access to the Jackpot. Our site is only an interface
of the infrastructure that we created in the environment of blockchain. Drawings, storage and distribution
of the Jackpot are managed by a smart contract that is executed in a decentralized environment.

PLATFORM

Note: All bets on the platform are carried out with TGAME tokens, indicating the rates in dollars
is made for convenience.

Unlike most of the projects that were before us, we developed and launched a
platform based on our infrastructure. Our architecture allows us to develop and
run games. Some of them have already been launched and are available for playing.
Other games will be launched as we implement our Roadmap [3].
Truegame is now a working iGaming platform. We have diﬀerent games, as well
as a shopping cart, due to which the player can participate in several drawings at
once, buy online tickets as goods in the online store

PLATFORM

THE FOLLOWING GAMES
ARE ALREADY RUNNING ON THE PLATFORM:
PRIZE DRAWS

Note: All bets on the platform are carried out with TGAME tokens,
indicating the rates in dollars is made for convenience.

Drawings of prizes are realized similarly to a iGaming auction. The player chooses a valuable prize for himself
and makes one small bet. All bets on the platform are carried out with TGAME tokens only. For convenience
of users it is possible to display the size of the bet in a preferred currency. After the number of bets required
for the lottery (product cost + house edge) is collected, the random number algorithm selects one winning
bet and determines the winner. The winner receives an amount in TGAME tokens equivalent to the prize value
on his balance, and if he wishes, he can order a prize delivery to his address - in this case the amount will be
debited from his balance. This type of game is truly unique and contributes to the high involvement of players
who are willing to make a large number of bets to win a prize.

SCRATCHCARDS
This version of instant lottery is unique among iGaming games based
on blockchain. This is an analogue of well-known scratchcards available
online. This game helps bringing revenue to the platform due to its
dynamic nature and low ticket price. On the average, one participant
plays 10-20 games per game session. We have already implemented
the following scratchcards: 1st Crypto Scratch-oﬀ, Crypto Space
Battle, Good Luck Meme, Old School Scratch-oﬀ, Code me Scratchoﬀ, Crypto Legends, and we are constantly updating our collection.

PLATFORM

BLOCKCHAIN LOTTERIES
We realized and launched an analog
of traditional and widely known in
European iGaming market Lottery
6/49. We also developed two of
our own lotteries called Crypto
Millions and Blockchain Ball with a
large Jackpot - they will be launched
immediately after the end of the
token sale and replenishment of
Jackpot fund.

Note: All bets on the platform are carried out with TGAME tokens,
indicating the rates in dollars is made for convenience.

We also analyzed popular games, thoroughly studied the feedback and comments left by our users. Based on
this analysis, we have drawn up a plan for launching games for 2018. The constant launch of new games will
allow us to keep the player’s attention longer, and thereby to increase LTV index.

IN 2018 WE ARE PLANNING TO LAUNCH THE FOLLOWING GAMES:
Card Lottery, Gift Box, Dices, Smart Roulette, Slot Games, Craps, Keno, Bingo, Lotto mechanical draw
machine based on smart contracts and many others. For more details, see our Roadmap. House edge is
between 5-15% and can not only vary from game to game, but can also depend on transaction costs which
can vary, too.

HOW THE PLATFORM WORKS

For all the draws, our utility token TGAME is used, through which all the interaction with the player’s
personal balance is conducted. Each game is based on a separate smart contract, and the code for each of
them is available on Github [4].
The winning is accumulated in TGAME tokens and stored on a separate Ethereum account managed by
smart contracts. In the case of a winning, its equivalent in TGAME tokens is automatically transferred to the
player’s balance and becomes available for the withdrawal (in TGAME tokens only).

WE OFFER TWO WAYS OF PLAYER’S INTERACTION
WITH OUR SMART CONTRACTS:
Work through personal account. With this method, TGAME tokens on the player’s balance are controlled
by our Ethereum node, and the player does not need to use special software and have any skills in working
with blockchain;
The second way is direct interaction with smart contracts through the Ethereum wallet, for example, using
the Metamask wallet. The player himself sends bets (in TGAME tokens only) to the wallet and interacts with
the methods of smart contracts. This option is still in Beta mode;

Regardless of the chosen method, the player is a full participant of our games, and also participates in the
common pool of draws, claiming the Jackpot.

All the drawings are conducted based on the algorithm for generating random numbers. A random number
means taking a hash from a join by concatenating the last four hashes of the Ethereum blocks with the
hash of the previous iteration of the given algorithm. All games, except instant, occur in two stages the accumulation of bets and start of the draw itself. This makes impossible any manipulations with the
algorithm, because the hacker has no way of predicting at what particular moment a random number
generation will occur.

At the moment, the core of our system is Ethereum based DAPP developed by us. Ethereum meets our
requirements and allows us to provide both a successful user experience for the player and an income for
the platform. At the same time, the Ethereum network is not suﬃciently optimal, so our specialists are
constantly studying new technologies that would improve the game process and reduce transaction costs.

KEY BENEFITS OF THE PLATFORM. WHY US?

6

KEY BENEFITS OF THE
PLATFORM. WHY US?
Key benefit: Unlike many other areas, blockchain technology is ideal for using in the field of iGaming and
solves most of the existing problems of the iGaming industry.
There are active users playing on our website already.
Now several hundreds of playing users are registered on our platform;
Truegame is the only blockchain based iGaming project that firstly developed a working product, collected
feedback [5] from professional community, improved the product, and prepared a marketing strategy to
attract players. And only now the project is ready to reach a wide audience;
Our product is completely ready, and we are focused on improving and developing the project, not on initial
development and solutions finding;
Unique content is one of the key factors for the success of online casinos, since most of them look the same
and diﬀer only in color. We have done a lot of work to develop our own architecture, unique content and
design, make it adaptive for most of mobile devices. We do not use White Label solutions of others, instead
we created a strong solutions development department of our own;
Our platform is fully integrated - we have developed a unique architecture that allows us to quickly implement
any game based on smart contracts, to add a payment system, to integrate third-party services and provide
White Label iGaming solutions to other market participants;
Truegame is the project that went beyond the players of the crypto industry and is oriented on a huge
audience of classical iGaming and lottery players;
We have a strong development department;
We are the only ones who have ever implemented scratchcards based on smart contracts:
1st Crypto Scratch-oﬀ
Crypto Space Battle
Good Luck Meme
Old School Scratch-oﬀ
Code me Scratch-oﬀ
Crypto Legends
Only we realized smart contract prize draws;
We are launched an analog of a classical German 6/49 Lottery based on smart contract;

16

TRUE GAME

www.truegame.io

KEY BENEFITS OF THE PLATFORM. WHY US?

MORE SMART CONTRACT BASED GAMES ARE SOON TO COME:
The analogues of the popular lotteries - Blockchain Ball Lotto and Euromillions
Crypro Millions Lotto with a Jackpot up to $1,000,000 (the equivalent of this amount in the TGAME
tokens). The final amount of the Jackpot depends on many factors, and can be significantly less.
GiftBox game - guess which box has the prize
Smart Roulette - the roulette fully implemented on a smart contract

According to our Roadmap, by the end of 2018 Truegame plans to release more than 30 new games [3];
We already have a working mobile application available on Google Play (alpha version).

KEY INDICATORS:
high level of project implementation
small amount of funds to be raised under the token crowdsale
unique games
unique flexible architecture
great thoughtful Roadmap
specialists on traﬃc attraction in the team of the project
a strong development department
top e-mail marketing specialist in the team of the project

The most complex stage of the project (product development) has been already implemented, and we are
ready to market expansion;

All our games are completely transparent (open code is available on Github [4]), the results almost can
not be manipulated, and the winning is instantly sent to the player balance in the TGAME tokens by the
smart contract itself;

17

KEY BENEFITS OF THE PLATFORM. WHY US?

The project is registered in a jurisdiction of Costa Rica with a registration number #3-102-747491 in the
National Registry of Costa Rica;

BENEFITS FOR THE PLAYERS:
Equal chances for each player. The game is based on random combinations obtained from blockchain system.
They are safe and can not be changed. The player’s winning depends solely on luck and mathematical
probability;

One hundred percent safety. Blockchain technology uses a new approach to confidentiality. A public registry
does not contain any personal information, however, it stores all available data about the game;

The product is very attractive for players, because it has many advantages, such as:
Low transaction cost
The absence of a minimum deposit amount for depositing via TGAME tokens
Instant winnings payments
Clear chances of winning
Low house edge percentage
The house edge of Truegame is lower than in the most of classic online casinos - it is included in smart
contracts of the games and can be checked by the players, and the probability of a winning is indicated in the
game conditions and can also be checked, since the smart contract code is publicly available on Github [4];
The results of the games, as well as the process of the games can be fully monitored where it is technically
possible (for example, in case of lotteries) and one can see the fairness of the games.

We are very attentive to the security of our platform. Our infrastructure in its core is focused on the
security of all interacting parties. Smart contracts and billing management in the environment of blockchain
provide security to both the player and our platform.

Nevertheless, we find it extremely important to have external security audit done by independent specialists
and we contribute to this in every way.

Security audit: at the moment we are choosing a company with good expertise in the field of Internet
security and high competence in the field of smart contracts security. This company will conduct an
independent audit of our solutions.

Hackathon: we plan to run a Hackathon, which will be awarded with a valuable prize to everyone who
finds vulnerabilities in our system or points to potential weaknesses in the security of our smart contracts.

Safety of Jackpot: the TGAME tokens of the platform required for Jackpot payments will be stored on
smart contracts that provide direct payment of winnings. During the audits and hackathon, special attention
will be paid to protecting these TGAME tokens from unauthorized access through a smart contract. At
the physical level, security is enabled through the use of a number of hardware wallets and multi signature
wallets (we do not disclose in detail for security reasons).

TOKEN FUNCTION AND FUNDS DISTRIBUTION

10

TOKEN FUNCTION AND FUNDS
DISTRIBUTION
TGAME utility token is the main component in the architecture and economy of Truegame. A token is
required to make bets in games, to play games, to deposit the gaming balance.

A total of 300,000,000 TGAME tokens will be issued and they will be distributed as follows:

TOKEN SALE
Advisors 4.0%
Team 15.0%
Bounty 1.0%
Reserve 10.0%
Crowdsale 70.0%
The reserve volume of tokens is frozen and will be used to raise additional funds for the development of
the project.

The funds raised in the process of token sale will be distributed as follows:

FUNDS DISTRIBUTION
Development 12.0%
Legal 10.0%
Jackpot 33.0%
Marketing 45.0%
Since the initial stage of product development is completed, most of the funds raised will be distributed to
the Jackpots for games and active multi-channel attraction of players. Also a significant part is allocated for
legal support of the project.

FINANCIAL MODEL AND BUSINESS PLAN

FINANCIAL MODEL
AND BUSINESS PLAN
We have made 3 basic financial forecasts depending on the various budgets. Therefore
3 scenarios can be described with the following assumptions:
- As fiscal charges are not exactly determined at the moment, they aren’t considered for the Net Cash
Flow calculation;
- Discount rate is agreed as 15% per annum;
- The 33% of the total collected funds are transferred directly to the Jackpot;
- The House edge is 14%.

These forecasts are made on the basis of ticket sales. We assume in these forecasts that the total sales
may vary from 7 000 tickets per day to 110 000 tickets per day depending on the total budget. For the 1st
Scenario the Marketing budget is estimated to be relatively moderate, from
60 to 80 thousand USD, for the 2nd Scenario Marketing and Advertising costs estimated from 100 to 120
thousand USD. For the 3rd and the most optimistic scenario we forecast to spend up to 150 thousand
USD.

Possible financial scenarios are described in the Table 1.

RISKS

16

RISKS
Regulatory risks of iGaming industry
The sphere of iGaming is under the close attention of the regulatory bodies, which constantly make changes
and clarifications in the existing regulatory documents. We warn you that there is a risk that the project may
not meet the new regulatory environment at a certain period of time.

Risks of external fraud
Scammers are extremely inventive in online iGaming, especially in poker. Hackers are constantly looking for
weaknesses on online iGaming platforms. The open source algorithms of smart contracts are also attacked,
so we can not exclude the risk that our platform will also be tried to get hacked.

Risks of the industry
We warn you that we do not guarantee that the project will receive a profit suﬃcient for successful
operations. The competition in online iGaming is very high.

Regulatory risks of blockchain industry
The blockchain industry is in the initial stage of it regulation. Governments of countries are in the process
of studying blockchain technology, and some countries impose restrictions (for example, the United States,
China, South Korea). There are no legal documents regulating the crypto industry yet - the laws will appear
later and can significantly aﬀect the activities of blockchain projects, including our project. We warn you that
such laws can significantly limit and even stop the project activity, we are not responsible for the negative
consequences associated with the possible regulation of the industry in the future.

Financial risks
Contributions in cryptocurrency projects is a big risk, and you can lose all your money. Truegame tokens,
like any other cryptocurrency, are subject to strong fluctuations and may fall in value signif cantly. We are
not responsible for any f uctuations in the value of the token on exchanges. We do not guarantee that there
will be an opportunity to exchange Truegame tokens for fiat. Governments can invent laws that will obligate
paying taxes from Truegame tokens. Truegame tokens can be used only to play on the truegame.io platform,
they do not grant you the right of voting or ownership in Truegame. Truegame project does not guarantee
any income, you can incur significant losses.

is unique, design and code is developed by the company itself or exclusively by Truegame contractors.

Low house edge percentage.

Truegame is the fully implemented smart contract based iGaming project ever coming on token crowdsale,
which collected positive feedback from Crypto and professional community.
