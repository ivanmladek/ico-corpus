Introduction

>>

The empowerment of individuals through automated systems and social networks is
disrupting the traditional retail brokerage and investment management models. The
industry has suffered from the loss of customer trust and low levels of retail participation
given two key fundamental issues: (i) information asymmetry was driven by the fact that
the institutional investor has superior information and analytical tools at their disposal
vis-a-vis the average retail investor; therefore the retail investor is typically on the
“losing” side of the trade and (ii) inherent conflicts of interest in the traditional financial
services model. At its core, The TrakInvest Project is about “Crowdsourcing of Financial
Wisdom” and rewarding the participants in its decentralized economy based on
performance and insights.
Trakinvest, a virtual social trading platform, currently offers (i) users the ability to share
their portfolio data with other members of the network for a monthly subscription (ii)
provides “crowdsourced” sentiment, forecasting and prediction tools using innovations in
smart contracts, machine learning, NLP and artificial intelligence, and (iii) and digital
certification programs in online trading. Users can access and explore the existing
platform at www.trakinvest.com.
TrakInvest is best set up to implement this project and already has a strong three-year
track record having built up a 100,000+ user base in Asia through its partnerships with
corporates, universities, and governments in the region. The Platform will also be
introducing (i) a virtual trading platform for cryptocurrencies and (ii) next generation
“crowdsourced” sentiment tools for equities and cryptocurrencies. These proprietary tools
have been developed using the social trading data and behaviour collected for the last
three years. TrakInvest aims to empower the retail investor with all these tools to create a
level playing field removing the information asymmetry that has plagued them for so many
years.
TrakInvest is poised for strong growth as we look to introduce TRAK Tokens by Q1 2018 to
our existing user base, thus providing them with the ability to earn service fees in ETH in
exchange for providing their real-time trading data and sentiments through TrakInvest’s
web and mobile platforms. Currently, the community continues to provide invaluable
trading data, insights, and sentiments through the platform by maintaining a virtual
trading portfolio: www.trakinvest.com. At the application level, the token utilities will
include: (i) Tokenized data ownership, (ii) Tokenized reputation system, and (iii) Tokenized
certifications.
The shift from a centralized technical infrastructure to distributed, ecosystem-enabling
platforms is laying the foundations for new business models in investment insights and
financial transaction technologies. Identifying the industry shifts, TrakInvest platform is
utilizing blockchain technology to create a decentralized peer to peer ecosystem that
incentivizes members of the community on performing value added services. The rewards,
incentives, and insight tools encourage the full establishment and continuity of the virtual
socio-trading environment that rewards for performance and sharing of trading data in a
risk free manner.
By leveraging the blockchain technology, TrakInvest aims to increase the scalability of the
current platform while enhancing its security and transparency levels. Backed by a
powerful tech stack and the strength of Ethereum’s Open community network the
ecosystem has a strong technical foot holding.

Executive Summary

>>

The current global equity investment system does not favour retail participation given
information asymmetry and inherent conflicts of interest. Our core intent is to level the
playing field and shift the model from arbitraging opacity to arbitraging intelligence.
Trakinvest’s mission is to crowdsource financial wisdom and using big data anlaytics, AI
and Machine learning share the trading behaviour of the masses with the retail investor,
thus giving them an edge.
The incentive to provide investment education, tools and financial benefits to people
without ready access to capital has been absent for some time. Trakinvest platform seeks
to empower millennials by (I) providing AI tools to make better informed decisions and (ii)
creating a reward based economy to incentivize people for their data and insights,
regardless of income, or location. TrakInvest utilizes the concepts of Social Trading, RoboAdvisory and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver this value proposition to it's growing
community of 100,000+ users.
TrakInvest revolutionizes the traditional investment education format by allowing users,
regardless of their experience, exposure or ability to participate by providing them with
transparency and “TRAKing” features such as “Copy Trade” to maximize their learning
potential.
TrakInvest provides white-labelled solutions for access to its key features for marketing
and new customer acquisition to companies in the Financial Services Sector. Companies
train new users or engage existing users to invest in stock markets. With a simulated
environment across 10 international stock exchanges and over 18,000 stocks, customers
practice stock investing without losing real money and once confident can invest with real
money leading to brokerage revenue for our Corporate partners. We provide “whitelabelled” solutions to our Corporate customers that includes our various components and
tools offered on our web, mobile and messenger applications. TrakInvest’s approach to
innovation revolves around a learn-share-earn core. The portal is designed to incentivise
new users and seasoned investors alike through meaningful financial incentives, insights
and career opportunities. The idea ultimately, is to be the bridge between those with alpha
generating ability and talent, but limited to no capital, and those with capital but not
necessarily the time, alpha generation ability or inclination.
The portal allows users to create groups to share information and insight on equities and
sectors. It allows users to showcase their level of knowledge on specific sectors and
stocks, and to learn from others on sectors they want to get better at. The actual trading
happens in real time during market hours in the markets covered including Singapore,
Hong Kong, and China, India, Australia, and the US, and that forms the basis of their
investment track record. In Q1 2018 TrakInvest will be introducing a similar product to also
trade crypto-currencies.
As new users gain confidence and showcase their track record, they can gain users who
“TRAK” them. For all users, seasoned investors and others, the portal provides a
substantial financial incentive to “TRAK” and to be “TRAKed”. That incentive is four-fold:
i.

Users are provided with a recommendation engine suggesting Top Traders and
Ideas. Using the TRAK Tokens the participants will seamlessly be able to make
payments to Top Performers for advice and real time trading data.

6

ii. A proprietary TI Score – combining a user’s investment track record with how
active they are on the social hub — in effect estimating a proxy for their positive

influence on the portal. Your TI Score will determine your “influence” at the
stock, sector, and market level and will determine the number of Tokens your
“followers” will contribute to you for sharing your real-time trading activity on
the Platform.
iii. Existing Partnerships & Sponsorships with global financial institutions in Asia,
e.g. Edelweiss Securities, Karvy Securities, HDFC Securities, Siam Commercial
Bank Securities, Andhra Pradesh Government, Indian Institute of Sciences, and
other Universities in the region provide the education and career incentives to
the users and ensure continued engagement with the Platform
iv. The higher your TI score, the more you will show up in TRAK suggestions, the
greater the probability of gaining users who TRAK you (remember TI is a
combination of social activity / impact and investment track record), the greater
the chances of a high payout on TRAK fees. Similarly, the better your
performance, the more chances you have of garnering one of the many planned
internships on offer — which are usually awarded through performance contests
on the portal, and of actually leveraging participation and showcasing your
record, into a meaningful career opportunity.
The first markets TrakInvest has built its operations are India, Singapore and Thailand and
intends to continue its expansion into Southeast Asia, North Asia and the Middle East in
2018. TrakInvest is focused on targeting on the Asian market, where the demographic
dividend will be the key growth factor. With a population of 4.5 bn and 52% online, Asia’s
middle class population is set to explode, reaching 2 bn by 2025; during the same period
the disposable income is set to grow 3 times.
The population of millennials also known as generation Y, has been growing over the past
years and this year it will be the largest generation ever. Until 2020, the aggregated net
worth of the global millennials is predicted to more than double compared to 2015, with
estimates ranging from $19 — $24 trillion. The millennial customer in wealth management
can broadly be placed in the following 3 categories:

TrakInvest is addressing the needs of millennial wealth management by providing online
financial certification courses, financial data, sentiment analysis and AI powered insights to
enable its users to make better informed trading decisions.

TrakInvest is building its market by aligning the financial and career incentives of the
demand and supply sides of the social trading market equation.

Tokenomics
TrakInvest Token (‘TRAK’ token) is a utility token that can be used to perform a variety of
activities on the Platform. The demand for the TRAK token is driven by the strong
pipeline of existing contracts with leading corporates and universities, TrakInvest’s
continued marketing initiatives including the “The TrakInvest Show," and overall market
dynamics. In this section we describe the use cases for the TRAK tokens and provide
with details of the contracted and projected demand and their key drivers.
There will be primarily 3 types of utility tokens to engage with TrakInvest for the services
mentioned above. At the application level, the token utilities include: (I) Tokenized data
ownership, (ii) Tokenized reputation system, and (iii) Tokenized certifications.

Token Demand Drivers
The Token drivers that presents compelling reasons to augment the growth of TRAK token
economy in the next 12 months and have outlined our key assumptions based on our
existing contracts and conservative forecasts.
The current contracted demand for TrakInvest’s Certification Program is 20,000 students
receive certification at USD 150 / student. Our current pipeline of students represents less
than 1% of the annual relevant student population in India looking for job-ready short-term
certifications. Given our expansion plans for both India and other countries in South East
Asia and Middle east, the projected demand for Certifications in 2018 is 4x the current
demand.
The Platform currently has 100,000 “Traks” being performed by the current user base for
no monetary incentive. The price per “Trak” will be the equivalent of USD 1 - 100 per
“Trak” per month. Given the introduction of the TRAK Tokens we conservatively expect
this activity to grow 5x from current levels in 2018.
The projected growth in the total user base is projected to 3x our current levels driven by
our launch of the TrakInvest Show Season 2 (India), launch of Siam Commercial Bank
Investment Centre and investment labs at Universities in Thailand and India. We expect
the projected growth multiples to increase as we roll-out in other countries in the region.
Introduction of the AI Sentiment Tool for equities and cryptocurrencies available to retail
and institutional investors and the introduction of the marketplace will represent “upside”
case of demand for the Trak Tokens. Given the strength of token drivers and their potential
impact on the TRAK token economy, we have constructed 3 scenarios for depicting the
growth trajectories of the token demand in the graph below-

Use of Proceeds

>>

TrakInvest ICO is looking to distribute 66 million TRAK tokens denominated in ETH. The
proceeds from the ICO will be utilised for product extension and geographical expansion.
Use of Proceeds

Product and R&D
Forty percent of the funds raised during the ICO will be allocated to the development of
product to strengthen the machine learning and robo-advisory features. Algorithms will be
developed that will automate advisory to build a recommendation engine for customised
portfolio management for the retail millennial consumer.
Marketing
Thirty-five percent of the funds raised will be used for awareness and reach-out to the
millennials across Asia, which boasts the biggest millennial population in the world. Focus
will be to build key partnerships with large universities and state governments to access a
large number of consumers
Operations
Teams of trainers, sales, customer support and recruiters will be required to train and
place the certified candidates. This kind of team will be in place at all the countries where
TrakInvest is operational and will be there in the next 18 months.
Legal & Admin
Although AI, blockchain-based services are growing at an exponential rate, there is still
ignorance about them and their potential. This can lead to legal requirements failing to
keep up with the progress of blockchain, even becoming a hindrance in the process. As
such, to make the TrakInvest Ecosystem available on a global scale, there are some license
and legal requirements that will need to be met, for which 5% of the funds will be
allocated.

>>

management team has conducted workshops, seminars across various universities in
Singapore, Australia, India and Thailand. Furthermore, in Q1 2017, the company launched
The TrakInvest Show on its YouTube channel. The TrakInvest Show was Asia’s first
interactive reality TV show based around the TrakInvest application. With 600 minutes of
original content, the show had a digital reach of over 10 million people with daily active
user base of 35,000. The customer engagement was further driven by the support of
India’s leading investment gurus, who share their strategies and insights on our platform.
You can access all the videos of The TrakInvest Show - Season 1 here.
Given the enormous success of Season 1, India’s number one business news channel ET NOW
has partnered to telecast the Season 2 of TrakInvest Show in prime time slots. We have been
approached by and are in active discussion with TV channels in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia
and Taiwan to re-create The TrakInvest Show in native languages in the respective countries.

The Disruption

>>

The fourth industrial revolution is bringing about the convergence of the physical and
cybernetic worlds, and the digital technologies that come with it is creating disruptions in
a previously traditional industry — the financial services industry.
Innovations led by technology-enabled platforms are disrupting the existing industry
structures and complex eco-systems. Deep-Diving into the investment management
landscape, key trends such as robo-advisory, social trading and AI are shaping business
models, consumer behavior and the entire ecosystem.
Traditional investment management involves providing personalized advisory solutions to
the high net-worth individuals. Personal wealth managers with access to sophisticated
tools and specific information manage the investment portfolios in exchange for charging
high fees.
In recent decades, however, such high value advisory services have been automated to
create cost-effective advisory solutions. These automated advisory solutions known as
robo-advisory, provide algorithm-based advice at nominal cost. As a result, the services of
traditional wealth managers have been commoditized and businesses have been forced to
shift online and move beyond the high-end customer to target the mass affluent
customers. Refer the WEF report on future of financial services published by Deloitte,
given in the reference section of this document.

Customer expectations are also shifting, as there is a rising demand for low cost,
personalized solutions that are hassle free and convenient to access on demand. Further,
post the financial crisis of 2005-2008, there is an increased sense of distrust for financial
advisors. In a recent Bloomberg study, over 90% of the millennial population chose nontraditional methods for managing their personal investments.
Such an environment is further fuelling the rise of robo-advisors and social trading tools.
Robo-advisors build trust, transparency and consistency in performance by eliminating
15

human intervention. Social Trading tools empower individual customers to share
investment advice and to gain from market insights of the crowd. An overall environment
of “prosumers” is created where the customers participate in production, competing with
traditional wealth advisors on generation of better returns on investments.
Emerging technologies in big data analytics and infrastructure are producing smarter,
faster machines that are capable of processing large amounts of unstructured data that
include real-time market events and social media news feeds. Traders can now gain deeper
insights into specific stocks to correlate market movements rather than just studying price
movements of a single stock.
Complex algorithms and trading strategies that incorporate machine learning can be
developed to churn the vast amounts of data for stock market predictions. Machine
learning capabilities improve the accuracy of the predictions over time.

TrakInvest sits at the cusp of these emerging trends in social trading, robo-advisory and AI.
TrakInvest provides a marketplace for individual investors to share their data and earn fees
for doing so. Individual investors learn and gain market insights from their peers based on
their performance without any other agenda.
TrakInvest has access to the trading data and behavioral insights of 100,000+ customers as
a result of their activity on the TrakInvest platform. TrakInvest proprietary algorithms churn
this data to provide market insights and customized portfolio recommendations to
individual investors. These recommendations improve over time as algorithms continuously
incorporate and learn by accessing more and more data. TrakInvest users access all these
features on demand through easy-to-use, interactive interfaces over web, mobile and social
media chat-bots.

Technical Architecture

>>

Trakinvest is built using micro-services architecture. Services in Trakinvest are grouped by
their functionality and the nature of logic needed. There are 3 types of services in the
system: Gateways Stateless Services, Batching Services, and Gateways Services that
enable the web to access our applications. These services include the portal and the chatbot. Stateless services are built in such a way that they support horizontal scalability.
These services have access to the database and are able to perform some business logics
before returning the values to gateway services. Some of these stateful services are
storing stateful AKKA actors to make calculation even faster and stateful services have
direct access to their intended databases.
Due to the nature of micro-services, we are not bound to specific language/technology.
However, there's a limitation imposed on the language that we are adopting. At the point
of writing, we are focusing only on JVM based languages to ensure the performance,
robustness and stability of the system. Services currently are written in 3 languages: (I)
Scala, utilizing the PLAY and AKKA frameworks, (ii) Java, utilizing the Spring Boot &
Ecosystem, (iii) Javascript using the Node and Express. For the front end development we
have utilized React, Redux, and Saas/Scss frameworks.
Services in TrakInvest are deployed in containerised docker images. With dockerized
application, the platform can easily achieve horizontal scaling without configurations.

Trakinvest AI

>>

TrakInvest has brought the concept of “track records” from the institutional level down to
the retail level.
Given advances in natural language processing (NLP) and the explosive growth of online
prediction communities, rich social investing data sets are making it possible to evaluate
investors not just by their popularity but also by their historic performance. Two trends
heighten the importance of accurate measures of investor trust for the always-connected
modern investor looking for credible trade ideas and information: more retail investors are
directly managing their own investments in part because of declining trust in traditional
advisors.
The three key initiatives in the TrakInvest AI recommendation engine include: (I) Sentiment
Analysis, (ii) Network Analysis, (iii) Ti Reputation Score. The sections provide a brief
overview of the various segments and more detailed technical methodology is available on
request.
Sentiment Analysis
This section discusses the framework behind the sentiment analysis engine that will derive
crowd sentiment from a corpus of documents. The results of this sentiment analysis will
work in both a push and pull mode. In push mode, news and announcements will trigger a
push notification to end users based on their interest profile while pull actions will
empower the end user to query the engine on the current status of a current stock.
The corpus of information for the sentiment analysis will be retrieved from a blend of time
sensitive and query-able websites, for which web crawlers are written to derive share
specific news, mandatory corporate disclosures, public discussion boards and twitter
feeds. This will be further supplemented by information mined internally from TI’s
discussion boards to provide an asymmetric advantage in the development of the public
sentiment.
Once the textual information has been retrieved, it is then pre-processed for vectorisation.
A multi-pronged approach is then taken to determine sentiment based on consensus
readability measure (e.g., Fog Score), lexicon based approaches (bag-of-words using
Harvard General Inquirer / Loghran and McDonald dictionaries) and machine learning
methods including Support Vector machines, Random Forests and Deep Neural Networks,
trained over historical price data of each share of interest.

Network Analysis
The recommendations from the sentiment analysis engine will then be supplemented with
a TI-STOCK score and a TI-TRADER score, which each provide a time sensitive quantitative
metric by which the traders and stocks can be ranked, specifically based on their
performance within the TI platform.
TI Score
The Ti Score is a combination of the individual’s performance combined with the social
“relevance” of that performance within the network. As an isolated individual, the TI score
18

could be defined as a weighted sum of the multiple attributes of a Trader’s behaviour. The
attributes to consider are for example (i) Total Gain/Loss and current position for Sell
Orders for a Stock and (ii) Current Position (Profit/Loss) of the Holdings.
However, when the individual is a part of a network where there are followers and
followings then it becomes a Graph problem. In this scenario, the TI score may be
compared to a Page Rank that the Google’s search engine builds behind the scene. In a
Graph, the attributes of the followers and the followings also get included, for example (i)
Total Gain/Loss and current position for the Sell Orders of the followers and followings for
Copied orders for that Stock, (ii) Current Position (Profit/Loss) of the Holdings of the
Copied Buy Orders that his/her followers and followings executed.
Additionally, for each person that a Trader follows, there is a degree of influence that he/
she has on the Trader. This influence percolates to other Traders who follow this Trader.
The TI score thus obtained is a Holistic score, i.e., the Graph’s Overall Influence calculations
have to converge to a specific set of values.

Notes:
1.

All Amounts are measured as a % of Initial Constant Balance (e.g., $100,000), making the
profit calculations comparable

2. For a non-zero rate of interest ‘ ’, the value for money would be diﬀerent depending on
when the Trader registered on the Platform
o

The rate of interest ‘ ’ may be considered to be zero for simplicity

3. The Moments of the Distribution need to be considered to account for the variation in a
Trader’s performance, i.e., Median (v, as unbiased Estimate of Mean) and Standard
Deviation (sigma)
o

An easy approach there could be to include only those Traders in the Graph
that have a min # of Orders executed for a particular Scrip, e.g., 30 - "magic"
number sometimes used by Statisticians
