Introduction
VR is growing in exposure globally and, what was initially available to a small
group, serviced by an even smaller group of products by innovators, technocrats and
entrepreneurs, is growing rapidly.
For many, this is now a commercial reality. VR is expected to be the next revolutionary
tech boom, projected to grow from US$3.7b in 2016 to US$30B+ by 2020 – making it
one of the fastest growing industries in the world.

Spectiv offers, or will offer:
Community-Driven VR Content
Spectiv enables ordinary users to stream any personal experiences with their own
VR equipment. This content can range from professionally produced to casually
recorded uploads.
Commercial VR Events
VR live streams will address sporting events, concerts, and more from premium seat
proximities for a truly engaging perspective. This enables viewers to not only watch
popular events, but to be fully immersed in the atmosphere remotely.
Spectiv OriginalsTM
Original VR content produced by Spectiv, voted on by the community. Spectiv users
have a say in what they want to experience.
While the Spectiv Company is the issuer of SIGs, for technical security purposes,
each user will have complete control over the SIGs they purchase. Hence, a repeat
of the possibility of an Equifax-style1 hack, due to the centralization of information
management, would not be possible as each user’s account (“Wallet”) must be
compromised individually2.
SIGs will be available for purchase on 8 December 2017.

The Problem with Advertising
Online attention is becoming one of the most valuable and sought-after assets in the
world. As a result, entire economies have formed around the exchange of attention. At
the most fundamental level, there are four actors in these attention markets:
Advertisers:
Advertisers are the driving force in this market vertical; that is, they are the
purchasers of attention.
Publishers:
Publishers are the producers of attention. By publishing quality contributions, they
drive audiences to view their media content.
Viewers:
The viewers are the “commodity”, providing the raw attention that advertisers value.
Curators:
Curators are the influencers of attention and share content with their unique
audience of engaged viewers.
It follows that advertisers should buy or reward attention by interacting directly with
publishers, viewers and curators. However, this is not the case today.
Advertisers pay for campaigns through centralized entities that act as attention brokers
between advertisers and publishers (Google, Facebook etc.). This creates a barrier that
advertisers and media publishers must funnel through to reach viewers. As such, these
intermediary entities control access to, and the management of, attention data related
to an advertising campaign. This leads to the charge of substantial matchmaking fees.

SOLUTION: SIGNAL
TOKEN PROTOCOL
Spectiv is the creator and initial adopter of the Signal Token
protocol. This protocol decentralizes the interaction between
advertisers, content publishers, viewers, and curators. It is opensource and intended for other media platforms to build upon. This
section details the token’s utility and crowdsale conditions.

Decentralizing Attention Markets
The Signal Token Protocol (“Protocol”) is designed to decentralize the buying, selling and
rewarding of attention by removing the middleman from the equation. This is achieved
through Ad Campaign Smart Contracts.
Ad Campaign Smart Contract
Using the Protocol, an advertiser can use SIGs via a smart contract associated with
target content. This content is now active, or “hot”, which means publishers, viewers,
and curators can engage with that advertiser through the smart contract and be
rewarded with SIGs for driving attention to that content.
Every ad view, click, and reward that occurs is communicated to the Ad Campaign
Smart Contract through a third-party oracle. The Ad Campaign Smart Contract will then
autonomously distribute SIGs to the users participating in that engagement.
By utilizing smart contracts, a publicly verifiable blockchain, and trusted oracles, this
protocol can directly disintermediate the “trade” of attention.
The Protocol enables advertisers to execute ad campaigns by directly rewarding the
producers, providers, and influencers of attention – rather than going through a broker.
Advertisers can target their smart contract to a wide portfolio of content or even one
specific media item. Advertisers choose the budget of their campaign by committing the
exact number of SIGs that they want to be dispersed.
Advertisers also set custom conditions for the smart contract; e.g. .01 Sigs rewarded
per ad click or .05 Sigs rewarded per ad click. This supports a transparent, competitive
marketplace, where participants compete for the highest-rewarding smart contract.
Advertisers can then visibly aim for low-cost, or appropriate and effective cost
campaigns. This provides a reward opportunity for all participants.
An Open-Source Protocol
The Spectiv Company developed the Signal Token Protocol specifically for use within
Spectiv, but we understand that accurate attention data analytics is difficult to perfect.
Additionally, we understand that for real-world advertisers to engage with SIGs, the
protocol must accommodate more than just Spectiv content.
We have developed SIGs for any ad-driven media platform to use and build upon;
video-based, audio-based, written-based, or mixed. In other words, the SIG’s utility is
not fixed to Spectiv. Rather, it is built to be its own decentralized, autonomous protocol
that can support multiple attention economies. Each media platform can integrate its
own unique mechanisms for monitoring genuine attention data, contributing to the longterm effectiveness of the protocol.

Initial Use Case: Spectiv VR
Decentralized protocols make great sense in theory, but are often faced with a fatal
challenge when applied to the real world: early adoption. Without a dedicated early
adopter to champion a new product, it can be extremely difficult to generate traction
and compete with established players.
Spectiv serves as the pioneer and first use case for the Signal Token Protocol.
Through trial ad campaigns, SIGs can be used to experiment with protocol economics
and develop early abuse-mitigation logic using real attention data. This can provide
a strong, welcoming foundation for other media platforms to use and build upon its
architecture, thereby providing a protocol for the reward of attention.
The Spectiv Company’s ultimate goal is to become the foundational layer for
connecting and transacting rewards between advertisers, publishers, curators and
viewers across a variety of platforms, the first of which is Spectiv.
Below we have listed the fundamental, open-source uses for Signal Tokens that will be
implemented into the Spectiv platform:
Publishers
When a publisher contributes VR content, they will have the option to be included in
all Ad Campaign Smart Contracts for that particular content. To do this, a publisher
can simply tie their SIG wallet to the content they contributed. If an advertiser runs a
campaign on that content, the publisher will be rewarded with a percentage of SIGs for
every view and conversion that was incurred while hosting the ad.
Viewers
Viewers are able to get SIG rewards by directly engaging with advertisements. If a
media platform adopts the Protocol, it can offer registered users the option to obtain SIG
rewards. This simply ties the user’s Sig wallet to their account on the platform. When this
viewer watches a full ad, visits a link, or makes a purchase, that information is sent to the
relevant Ad Campaign Smart Contract. If engagement conditions are met, the contract
distributes a fraction of SIGs to the viewer’s wallet.
Curators
Curators can be rewarded with SIGs for sharing content with their friends and followers.
To do this, a curator must generate a personalized Signal link URL to the content they
wish to share. This unique URL connects the curator with the content. If the curator shares
this link with their followers, all attention driven through the link will be tracked and
communicated to the Ad Campaign Smart Contract. If reward conditions are met, the
contract will distribute a portion of SIGs to the curator’s wallet.
Tips
The community-driven user-to-user tipping system within Spectiv is one of the most
unique features of the platform. It works on a “rapid-tap” basis, wherein viewers can
tap a small token button on their viewing interface while engaging in a VR experience.

Tapping this button expresses a “like” for the content while also sending a miniscule tip
to the creator. These small denomination SIG tips create a powerful interactive user
dynamic between viewers and content creators. This is because viewers from around the
world may be more inclined to contribute to streamers when the contribution is gamified
and immaterial. It also means the average publisher can be rewarded based on the
breadth of contributing viewers.
Note that this can also reduce “like” spam or act as a control for “like” farming, the intent
of which is solely to appear as if a specific content is popular.
Premium Content
Spectiv users will be able to use SIGs to redeem for pay-to-play VR content such as
live event passes, VR movies, Spectiv Originals, and more. During the beta Platform,
these sales will be executed at a discount against the USD rate if paid for in SIGs.
This encourages publishers, viewers, curators to earn SIGs by engaging with ads,
generating crucial early data and feedback that we will use to optimize Spectiv’s ad
campaign economics.
Indicating Preference
Spectiv users who hold SIGs will have the ability to show their support for particular
content that they would like to see on the platform. These act as a feedback from
viewers to Spectiv in relation to major content contributions (for example, which country
might be featured for an exclusive VR walkthrough). This aspect is important to Spectiv
as it engages the audience by giving them what they’d like to see and experience.

60% Sigs Crowdsale:
SIGs will be sold through a public crowdsale at a discount to a maximum value of
US$40MM. Purchasers will be able to purchase SIGs through the use of a smart contract
using the Ethereum protocol. Once the sale is over, there will be no further opportunity to
buy SIGs at a discount from the Spectiv Company. SIGs will be distributed following the
sale and an accounting audit process.
20% Platform Reserve:
This will be held in reserve to primarily be used as a stimulus to run trials on the token
protocol and establish an active ecosystem within Spectiv. These reserve tokens will be
released slowly over the course of an extended pilot-testing period. In addition, the
tokens will be available from direct purchases from the platform at a price to be set by
the Spectiv Company, which shall not be less than the discounted price obtained in the
token sale. Further guidance on this process will be elucidated in subsequent
documentation prior to the sale of SIGs. Finally, these tokens may also be used for
partnerships or deals that are for the betterment of the Spectiv VR platform. Examples of
this could be using Platform Reserve tokens to acquire licenses for content, bringing on
advisors specific to Spectiv VR, acquiring VR related technologies, etc...
13% Management Team:
These SIGs will be reserved for the company and divided among the management team.
The management team will pay a consideration of US$10 per % point for a total of US$130.
4% Escrow and Advisors:
Escrow partners and consultants will also be able to purchase SIGs at the equivalent of
US$10 per % point for a total of US$40. 2% of the SIGs supply will be evenly split
amongst two escrow partners for the work in using and supporting Spectiv. The
remaining 2% of the total SIGs will be evenly split and offered to consultants. SIGs will be

Signal Tokens Crowdsale
SIGs will be publicly sold through a token issuance event. The issuance will open via a
Pre-ICO which will run from December 8th, 2017 at 2:00PM (GMT -5) through December
21st, 2017 2:00PM (GMT -5). Starting December 21st, the Pre-ICO will end and then
the ICO will run from December 21st-29th 2:00PM (GMT -5). The number of SIGs sold
will determine the total number of SIGs created. The public token sale will be capped
at US$40MM. The sale will end immediately if the max cap is reached. The Spectiv
Company will host the SIG sale at www.spectivvr.com.
Pricing
SIGs will be valued at a fixed price of 650 Sigs/Eth each. Early crowdsale participants
will have the opportunity to buy SIGs at a discount to this price, based on the timing
of their purchase. SIGs will be sold through 4 levels, with each level representing an
early bird bonus opportunity. The earlier the purchase, the greater bonus that can be
expected. This system essentially rewards buyers in extra SIGs for showing early support
and engagement.
Early Bird Bonuses
The different bonus opportunities are spread across 4 levels:

Early Bird Bonuses:
Level 1: 40% Bonus (buy 1, 0.4 free) | December 8th-11th
Level 2: 25% Bonus (buy 1, 0.25 free) | December 11th - 18th
Level 3: 10% Bonus (buy 1, 0.1 free) | December 18th - 21st
Level 4: 0% Bonus (buy 1, 0 free) | December 21st - 28th
Examples
To illustrate how this bonus schedule works, let’s say four different buyers participate in
the crowdsale. Each buyer contributes $25 at a different level in the bonus schedule:
Level 1: Adam sends 1 ETH
He gets 650 Sigs by default, plus an additional 40%.
(650 x 1.40) = 910 Sigs
Level 2: Paul sends 1 ETH
He gets 650 Sigs by default, plus an additional 25%.
(650 x 1.25) = 812.5 Sigs

Level 4: Bill sends 1 ETH
He gets 650 Sigs by default, with no bonus added.
(650 x 1.00) = 650 Sigs
This means purchasers get significantly more SIGs for engaging with the crowdsale proactively.
How to Participate
Purchasers will need an ETH wallet.
Any non-exchange ETH wallet will be required to receive SIGs. This ETH wallet will
generate a personalized ETH address. When the crowdsale launches, users will be able
to specify how much ETH they would like to pay in return for SIGs.
Users will then be prompted to input the unique ETH address tied to their ETH wallet –
this is where their SIGs will be sent. After a user inputs their ETH address, they will be
provided with the purchasing address that they can send payment to.
Once payment has been made, users will see a receipt detailing the number of SIGs
they purchased and bonus SIGs redeemed. SIGs will be distributed to user-provided ETH
addresses through the smart contract 30 days following the end of the sale to account
for the audit process.

Content Strategy
Community First
The biggest difference between Spectiv and other VR streaming platforms is the
community-driven focus. Spectiv is a user-integrated market of virtual reality
experiences. In other words, Spectiv is not just a portal for viewers to watch popular VR
events – it is an environment where users from across the world can share their real-life
experiences with others.
This means a viewer living in the United States can put on a VR headset and see
through the perspective of a streamer in Italy or Japan. That streamer could be visiting a
significant landmark that is local to them, but unique and novel to viewers thousands of
miles away. Community-driven content could be as simple as travels and regular dayto-day living, or as deviceful as guerilla journalism, wherein users could share real-time
local perspectives of politically charged regions, creating an immersive news outlet.
These are just a few examples of what is possible with community-driven content on the
Spectiv platform.
Spectiv creates an environment for users to not only consume VR content, but to
contribute their own and share it with others. This community- driven, user-based
content promotes organic social growth among users. This model has proven successful
for streaming platforms outside of the VR space and will be equally integral in building
an active user base for VR streaming.
Initially, we plan to work with independent VR enthusiasts around the world who have
already adopted VR recording systems. They will be the first general users to publish
content on Spectiv, generating an immediate selection of community provided VR
content. This content will include pre-recorded productions and live streams – essentially
any VR experiences users want to share. Building this selection of content will be a
primary focus for the Spectiv alpha V1 release.
Spectiv also provides an ecosystem for rewards between users, wherein viewers can
tip streamers for content they enjoy as well as subscribe to be updated on new content
releases. This is a core element of the person-to-person Spectiv environment because it
enables users to be rewarded for sharing their VR experiences with the world.
Commercial Events
Sports, music, and other such performances were historically and naturally designed to
be experienced in person. The thrill of these events lies in the atmosphere that surrounds
them: the people, the energy, and the details. These real-life elements cannot be
replicated in a modern, at-home TV viewing experience. And, unfortunately, while many
consumers would love to experience these events in all their real-life glory, most do not
want to spend the time or money on tickets/travel and often prefer not to leave home.
With VR technology, Spectiv makes it possible for these viewers to experience that reallife glory from the comfort of their living room. With the use of cutting-edge, HD 360°
broadcasting technology, we will be able to live stream an event from the view of a
premium seat, on site. This means that when viewing these events from home with a VR
headset, viewers will virtually be in that seat.

As live event viewership grows, we will offer different perspectives from within each
event depending on user feedback. For example, while watching a concert, users might
have the choice to enjoy it from front row for a more intimate experience, deep in the
crowd for a more atmospheric experience, or even moving around for a more wellrounded, complete perspective.
User Feedback Driven Content
Once the commercial and community-driven content channels are established and
standardized, Spectiv will start contributing its own original VR content. We will pursue
original projects based on user feedback.
Our mission for this content is to give VR participants a voice for what they want to see.
This content could include live VR journalism, documentaries, real-time tours, or even
movies wherein users can watch from the perspective of a character in the story. Most
of these Spectiv OriginalsTM will involve partnership with an organization mutually
interested in creating a VR project.
For example, if the state of Hawaii wanted to produce a VR tour of the islands to attract
tourism, we could work together to create a truly immersive perspective for the world to
see. Or if a director wanted to create a VR documentary on the deep-sea creatures of
the Pacific Ocean, we could accommodate the tools and expertise necessary to make
a quality production. Most importantly, we want to present all options to the community
and give viewers what they want. Original content will not be introduced until Spectiv
has a self-sustaining user base, robust user-to-user streaming environment, and live
commercial broadcasting channels.

Users & Participants
Advertisers: those who wish to advertise on Publisher’s contents or by creating new
advertising content of their own.
Publishers: all users who upload VR content, live or pre-produced. This content can
range from experiences as novel as skydiving to activities as simple as grocery shopping.
One of our initial objectives is to build an immediate selection of global VR experiences
for viewers to choose from. As such, we will implement incentives for users to upload
content from their uniquely local regions to quickly build a global portfolio of VR content
on the platform. And with the rapid commercialization of consumer-level VR recording
technology, Spectiv’s VR content selection should grow organically alongside that of
the industry.
Viewers: consuming the VR content on Spectiv. They are the most important element
of Spectiv. There are two main objectives that must be achieved to offer viewers the
best experience possible. First and foremost, the Spectiv Company is to make it a priority
to offer a very wide range of VR experiences to choose from. This includes officially
licensed live events, global user-driven contributions, and eventually Spectiv Original VR
productions. Second, we will make the viewer interface simple, intuitive,
and unintimidating.

Curators: users who share VR content with their friends and followers. They play a
critical role as attention influencers for online media and will play an especially big role
in driving users to Spectiv content. As a streaming platform, it is important that users are
compelled to share their experiences.
More on Curators
There is an overwhelming surplus of quality content on the Internet. In the attention
market, curators provide value to attention payers by filtering through and
consolidating content uniquely catered to their following. This is done by generating
signals through likes, retweets, shares, etc. Today, followers are paying most of their
attention to these signals rather than to the actual content creators. This creates
an intermediary layer between content creators and their viewers, where a content
creator’s ability to connect to viewers is no longer just based on the quality of their
content, but also on how effectively their content is shared over the Internet. Thus,
curators play a critical role in influencing the content’s overall viewership.
This new intermediary role does not present a problem in mainstream content
mediums like music, video, news, etc. This is because these mediums have already
been critically adopted on a large scale, such that there are more than enough
curators to spread the content. In other words, this layer acts fluidly as a channel to
ensure quality content gets the exposure it deserves.
However, this layer creates a degree of friction for an emerging content format; if
curators have not adopted the new content medium, they will not send out signals to
their followers. And since viewers are rewarded for their attention almost exclusively
on these signals, they most likely will not be exposed to the content.
To accelerate mainstream VR adoption, we must deliberately penetrate this dynamic.
We plan to do this by capitalizing on the influence of existing content curators to
reach a critical mass of attention payers. Using Sigs, we are creating a decentralized
economic incentive for curators to generate signals to VR content and ultimately
promote mainstream VR adoption.
Licensed Partners: partners from which we aim to license rights to broadcast mainstream
events like sports and concerts. The Spectiv Company has spoken to broadcasting
representatives from popular commercial organizations and they have all confirmed that
viewership is the most critical element to reaching an agreement. As such, our strategy
is to build our initial user base through community-driven content and then present this
user base to relevant organizations. Once our viewership satisfies an organization’s
requirements, we can begin the licensing process. Certain broadcasting partnerships will
be non-exclusive.

VR Market Outlook

predicted to reach US$12.1b. However, this estimate involves the sales of hardware as
well. By contrast, the VR software market in 2016 was US$0.6b.
Nonetheless, the advertising industry still needs to adapt to the delivery of content via
VR. We estimate that this should be directly proportional to the growth of VR software
(and content). The addressable market size for Spectiv is therefore hard to estimate,
especially considering the rapid growth of that industry vertical. The creation of VR
advertising or embedded advertising in VR content also depends on the effectiveness of
this delivery to users, which the Spectiv Company is optimistic about, although that still
has yet to be properly quantified.
Further, adding the element of the blockchain and cryptocurrency community in the mix
may also accelerate adoption of VR due to users from the digital currency (or token)
ecosystem pre-purchasing SIGs for use or redemption on Spectiv.
Market Growth
The growth of the VR market is undeniable. With companies like Intel, Samsung, Google
and Facebook working on providing medium of interaction for VR and Youtube amongst
others providing VR content, these efforts may add significantly to the growth profile of
this industry.
Moreover, Bloomberg reports that there are at least 200 startups working in China’s VR
industry5. In relation to hardware, “the best-selling unit seems to be the Ritech headset…
selling just over 100,000 units per month.”6 The growth of headsets should drive the
demand for more VR content.

Competitive Landscape
Competitors
Today, several large organizations have, or are creating, VR platforms to experience VR
content from home, such as NBA VR, Netflix VR, Google’s Daydream, HBO GO VR and
YouTube VR to name a few. This is an extension of their current media delivery platforms,
governed by the same traditional structure. However, they can source from their existing
user base to provide these experiences much faster and easier than new entrants. The
latter need to generate traction, race against time, offer a different value proposition by
competing with these platforms or onboard a new demographic before they do.
Differentiation
Spectiv has several points of differentiation with the traditional models.
Traction sales and support:
Spectiv can deviate from the use traditional channels of organic growth or sales.
By pre-selling SIGs7, which are used as a platform credit, the strategy is to achieve

7. Note that “pre-selling” in this context refers to the act of selling product and services prior to offering for sale directly from the Spectiv
site. This should not be confused with the “pre-sale” terminology used in Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), which generally relate to the period
prior to a public sale of tokens or coins.

traction quickly from supporters globally. They may turn into advocates of Spectiv
choosing to support the growth of content, advertising, and viewership and act as
a mouth-piece for Spectiv. Hence, the commercialization aspect of the business is
achieved at the end of the SIG sale. This can then quickly make Spectiv a viable
competitor to other platforms that are achieving VR traction organically or from a
current user base.
Security and overheads:
By adopting a user-controlled wallet, the ability to introduce a systemic security
risk is greatly reduced. Any reward transactions (transfers) for activities on the
platform amongst users can be done from one user controlled wallet to another. This
reduces the computation intensity from Spectiv as this is handled by smart contract
transactions on the [Ethereum] blockchain.
Smart Contracts:
By integrating the front-end Spectiv platform with a smart contracts backbone,
all transactions are still available to users independently of whether or not Spectiv
experiences technical issues.
New Possibilities:
The results of points 1 through 3 above, is that new possibilities are created by
streamlining the process of connecting advertisers, publishers, curators and viewers
in a frictionless manner. This means that they have more control over their activities
without an intermediary broker in between.

Preface
Additional Documentations
This General Business Document (“GBD”) is one of two documents that make up the full
sale documentation to prospective purchasers. The other document is the token product
disclosure statement (“TPDS”) containing the relevant detailed particulars of importance
for the prospective purchasers.
This GBD contains some elements overlapping with the content of the TPDS. The TPDS
is a more focused document specifically detailing token mechanism and risk analysis for
those wanting to know more about the token sale process.
Presales
Spectiv conducted its first presale during the end of August. The purchase amount
received was performed pursuant to a Know Your Customer (“KYC”) process and audited
by the global accounting affiliate firm Baker Tilly (Mauritius). The summary audit letter is
attached in the Notes section to this document. During this process the amount of ETH,
BTC, and USD received were as follows:
Eth - 3547.66
BTC - 31.58
USD - $57,922.50
Governance of Token Sales Revenue
Participants should be confident that payments made for SIGs are directly attributed to
benefits on the platform and the provision of better and more exciting experiences. With
that said, we have established assurances and transparency policies that will directly
govern the revenues received through the token sale.
Spectiv LTD (Mauritius)
Spectiv LTD acts as the issuing entity for tokens for purchasers, except residents of
the USA. Spectiv LTD shall be an entity focused and responsible for the community
management and the administration efforts to ensure supporters’ voices are heard.
Spectiv LLC (USA)
Spectiv LLC acts as the issuing entity for tokens for purchasers from the USA that meet
the classification of “accredited Investors” under the Securities Act of 1933. Spectiv
LLC shall be the operational headquarters for the Spectiv Company.
Spectiv LLC will be responsible to produce the relevant software component of the
platform (and under an understanding between Spectiv LTD (Mauritius) it will also be
responsible to produce the smart contract component that addresses issuance for
the Mauritian entity). It will also manage the operational components of the global
business of the Spectiv Company.

Escrow
Participants should be confident that payments made for SIGs are directly attributed to
benefits on the platform and the provision of better and more exciting experiences. With
that said, the Spectiv Company has established assurances and transparent policies that
will directly govern the revenues received through the token sale.
Spectiv’s first level of token sale security will come from the smart contract itself. The
second level of security is via multi-signature for the release of revenues. At the most
fundamental level, we are implementing an escrow that will oversee the release of
revenues – all revenues will be controlled by 3 independent actors, as follows:

CONCLUSION

1. CoinVault ATM CEO, Sheldon Weisfeld

LEGAL

2. Sutton Stone LTD
3. Spectiv LLC
Revenues received through sale will be locked in an escrow wallet until the Spectiv
Company’s audit process has been successfully completed and distributed to all purchasers.
Once SIGs have been distributed, escrow actors will be able to approve the release of
token revenues to USD where they will be held in either Spectiv LTD or Spectiv LLC.
The receipt of moneys in Spectiv LTD shall be used to account for Spectiv’s Mauritian
team and the rest transferred to Spectiv’s LLC account evenly over two separate
disbursements, contingent on the achievement of predetermined milestones tied to the
benefit of the community.
The disbursement schedule is outlined here:
1. 1⁄3 of revenues will be transferred immediately following the distribution of SIGs
purchased through sale for payment of the smart contract build for the token sale
process. This will be used to cover long-term development and updates for the Signal
Token protocol. These revenues will also support development for the Spectiv platform
– specifically in driving exciting, high-quality VR content to the site. A minor allocation
will be used to support general business operations and infrastructure setup for the
company.
2. 1⁄3 of revenues will be transferred upon launch of the beta platform. These revenues
will be used to fuel the next stage of token development and expansion. This will
include bringing in other media platforms to build attention economies on the Signal
Token protocol using Spectiv’s use-case data. Additionally, these revenues will
be used to optimize the Spectiv platform, build a user base, and reach licensing
agreements with mainstream organizations to broadcast popular events. These
revenues, amongst other things, shall be used to support the long-term business
operations for Spectiv, including development and platform maintenance expenses.
3. 1/3 of revenues shall be retained in the Mauritian entity to be used for content
production, administration of the community, global events and the like.

The above may change depending on operational demands and taxes.

40% Token/Platform:
These revenues will be used to develop the Signal Token protocol and Spectiv. This
includes hiring additional full-time developers, collaborating with other media platforms
to build on the Signal Token protocol, and supporting operations for Spectiv. Generally,
these revenues are earmarked to compensate all personnel and partners involved in
technical development.
15% Marketing & Sales:
These revenues will be used to raise brand awareness and drive new users to the
platform. We plan to begin with a very targeted online marketing campaign aimed at
reaching users who have had some exposure to VR. Our objective in marketing is not to
educate people on the possibilities of VR – the industry is going to do that on its own.
Our objective is to take these people who are slowly being exposed to it, and present
them with a simple, welcoming destination for VR experiences. This gives novice VR users
a dedicated but unintimidating platform to get started with. Revenues allocated for
marketing and sales will specifically go toward customer acquisition/referral campaigns
that help us reach this segment of users.
15% Content Licenses:
This percentage of revenues will be set aside for broadcast licensing deals with major
organizations. The prices of these licenses vary significantly depending on the
organizations and events. These licenses will help attract organic viewership from
outside the VR space in a major way.
10% Payouts for Contributors:
A percentage of revenues will be used to promote immediate content contributions. We
will directly pay existing VR enthusiasts from around the world to upload unique VR content
to the platform. We will also sponsor existing influencers from other streaming platforms to
contribute their content to Spectiv in VR. It is important that we allocate revenue to these
efforts because this initial content directly effects early platform engagement.

8% Equipment:
These revenues will be used to acquire VR assets. This will include the setups used
to broadcast live commercial events and camera rigs used to record original and
partnered content.
7% General & Administrative:
For day-to-day overhead expenses; rent, utilities, travel, etc.
5% Legal Fees:
5% of revenue or at least $200,000 will be set-aside in reserve for legal contingencies.

Platform Rewarded
Content creators:
They will be able to receive tips and access subscriptions through Spectiv. Moreover,
these users will be able to earn SIGs through ad campaign smart contracts. Verified
content creators holding SIGs will be able to deal with SIGs at their absolute discretion
since they are the custodians of those tokens. These users will have a smooth and robust
dashboard to account for collections. Content Creators will have a seamless experience
whether or not they are familiar with blockchain or cryptocurrencies. We may offer
content creators the ability to go through a basic verification process in order to qualify
for conversion to USD.
Appcoin:
They will be allowed to redeem SIGs for premium VR content, monthly memberships,
or to tip/subscribe to their favorite content contributors. The Spectiv Company aims
to implement a new user sign-up campaign that will credit $3 in SIGs and send a
complimentary phone-compatible cardboard VR headset to a limited number of new
users who sign up to Spectiv. Our objective is to give viewers an immediate experience
with the gamified tipping process as well as a basic means to begin enjoying VR
content instantly.
Curators:
To engage with an ad campaign, curators must deploy Sigs through a specific video
they would like to share. This action generates a unique URL for that video which is
directly associated to the curator. All attention driven through this link is monitored and
analyzed to track ad engagement levels (views/clicks/sales/etc.). This attention data
communicates with the smart contract, which then releases SIGs to the curator through
if-then triggers; if “x” traffic is driven through the link, then the curator receives “y” SIGs
Curators will be incentivized to share the best quality VR content that they consider most
relevant to their specific followership, so as to maintain follower interest (just like with any
other content they signal). This means that attention seekers will be exposed to tailored
VR content, more likely to pique their interest.

Broadcasting:
Revenue models for these licensed partners will vary depending on the nature of the
broadcasting agreement. Oftentimes organizations will have a network that users must
subscribe to for content access, and sometimes they will operate on a pay-per-view
basis. Spectiv will facilitate both revenue models and also adapt to other more
nuanced arrangements.
Spectiv may also implement and oversee on-site VR broadcasting systems to ensure
viewers the greatest possible streaming quality and experience. Spectiv will uphold
the highest standard of service for viewers and as such openly welcomes all quality

Features
Community Driven VR
Spectiv enables ordinary users to stream any personal experiences with their own
VR equipment. This content can range from professionally produced to casually
recorded uploads.
Commercial VR Events
VR live streams will address sporting events, concerts, and more from premium seat
proximities for a truly engaging perspective. This enables viewers to not only watch
popular events, but to be fully immersed in the atmosphere remotely.
Spectiv OriginalsTM
Original VR content produced by Spectiv, voted on by the community. Spectiv users have
a say in what they want to experience.

The Players
Advertisers
Advertisers are the driving force in this market vertical; that is, they are the purchasers
of attention.
Publishers
Publishers are the producers of attention. By publishing quality contributions, they drive
audiences to view their media content.
Viewers
The viewers are the “commodity”, providing the raw attention that advertisers value.
Curators
Curators are the influencers of attention and share content with their unique audience of
engaged viewers.

The Spectiv Approach
The VR industry is in a period of significant growth. With its token sale, Spectiv aims to
commercialize the business of VR content dissemination. Spectiv uses a smart contract
architecture that allows users to be the custodian of their tokens. This reduces the impact
of security breaches of the Spectiv platform. It also allows Spectiv users to engage with
the relevant persons via the Spectiv platform.
The Spectiv Company’s ultimate goal is to become the foundational layer for
connecting and transacting rewards between advertisers, publishers, curators and
viewers across a variety of platforms, the first of which is Spectiv.

Additional Notes: Tokenization Issuance Model
As the cryptocurrency field is new and often abused, we appreciate the fact that
transparency is important and that there is a need to protect our users. For this reason,
we have done the utmost to self-regulate in the absence of regulatory clarity; and
distinguish ourselves from the significant amounts of noise and misleading actors in the
space.
Some may consider this overkill, but the Spectiv Company believes in going beyond
what is generally seen in the industry and setting a standard for transparency and
accountability. Further, the Spectiv Company believes in the cryptocurrency and
blockchain industry and is there to help it along in a manner that strengthens it while
weeding out those that are only interested in abusing it.
Corporate SIG Issuance Structure
The Spectiv Company aims to have two teams at opposite sides of the world, one in
the Republic of Mauritius and the other in the USA. This will allow Spectiv Company
the ability to work on a 24-hour rotation cycle as we are conscious of the fact that the
blockchain and cryptocurrency world never sleeps and is a global phenomenon.
In addition, a Regulatory Sandbox License is being sought under the Mauritian Sandbox
Regulatory Scheme for the issuance of SIGs to all purchasers, except residents of the
United States of America. The structure of the sale is as follows:
To citizens, residents of the United States of America
For persons living in the United States, Spectiv LLC will only sell to purchasers that
have met the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC’s) accredited investor status
pursuant to Rule 501of Regulation D of the Securities Act 1933.
Although Spectiv LLC is not issuing securities (SIGs are utilitarian and to be used
within Spectiv and other similar platforms), it seeks to ensure that those purchasing
SIGs are deemed to have a level of comfort in making token purchases using
the test that the US authorities prescribed for the identification of what it deems
“sophisticated” persons.
For this, the Spectiv Company chose the SEC’s definition of “accredited investors”.
The Spectiv Company is respectful of this classification although it has some
ideological differences with the foundational basis for the same.
Further, Spectiv LLC does not wish to introduce non-sophisticated persons to this
young industry, if there is a risk that it leads them to purchase other tokens because
of the hype of significant returns surrounding the Initial Coin Offerings (“ICO”)
movement.
Spectiv LLC understands that this may be a temporary situation before clarity and
guidance is obtained from the US authorities, but for now with the current state of
affairs with ICOs, it prefers to accept a “classification” of US persons, which seems
acceptable to US authorities, and therefore its residents.
To everyone else, except the United States of America
