Boolberry’s feature:
Improved transaction identiﬁcation

In this presentation you’ll ﬁnd out how
Boolberry reduces block chain bloat
compared to *Ordinary CryptoNote coins.

*Ordinary CryptoNote - Coins based on the original CryptoNote core, such as ByteCoin, DuckNote, Monero, etc.

Block chain
What is a block chain and how does it work?
The block chain is a database shared by all network users that stores the
transaction history. A transaction is not recognized until it is added to the
block chain, which is referred to as conﬁrmation.

Block 101

Header - Contains service information (version info, nonce, previous block id and timestamp).
Merkle - A summary built from the block's transaction identiﬁers.
Transaction’s id list - list of transaction’s identiﬁcation hashes, that was included into the block’s merkle tree

A transaction gets included into block’s transactions list by an identiﬁer calculated
from both the transaction preﬁx and suﬃx (ring signatures).

The Problem - Bloated Blockchains

Examination of the Boolberry block chain (28-Jul-2014) shows the
average transaction size is 4065 bytes. Calculations show ring signatures
take up an average of 55% of that size.
And these calculations are for a block chain where mixins are not widely
used yet. When mixins are used ring signatures take up 60-90% of the
transaction size.
Ordinary CryptoNote coins have to keep all the ring signatures, since it is
not possible to prove that a transaction belongs to a block without
them.

solution:
Cut Oﬀ the Ring Signatures

Once a transaction gets a lot of conﬁrmations (say one year old
transaction with hundreds of thousands conﬁrmations) the ring signature
is no longer needed… even if transaction’s output is not spent yet.

So why not just cut it oﬀ?

Boolberry calculates transaction id

Ring signatures are excluded from

This allows Boolberry to cut-oﬀ ring signatures from old transactions but still able to prove that transactions
belong to given block and protected by Proof-of-Work of this block.

Guess what?
Boolberry is designed to use resources more eﬃciently!

Boolberry will to drop the ballast of ring signatures for old
transactions, even if transaction outputs is not spent yet. We’ll start to cut
oﬀ ring signatures after ﬁrst year of currency live (we gonna do that at
least with checkpoints, but also we gonna start public discussion to talk
about other more interesting/smart ways to do that).
This feature will make Boolberry Block Chain at least 55% and up to
90% smaller than Ordinary CryptoNote coins.
Compact block chain produce faster synchronization for better user
experience and convenience!
