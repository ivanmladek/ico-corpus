Introduction
Not only the Internet has made
global information and data
exchange possible, but also
put file synchronization and
storage in the spotlight.
A typical user has at least a few devices

connected to the Internet and utilizes the most
convenient one. Therefore, providing the ability
to quickly access the updated data from any
device is of an utmost importance.

Shared access services grow in popularity, as
they allow many people to work on the same

data at one time. Shared access is provided by

the majority of traditional centralized cloud data
storage and file synchronization systems, but all
they have security and availability issues.

A centralized system is not able to ensure the

appropriate level of security, reliability, and the
possibility of a continuous operation. On the

other hand, all of these criteria could be met

by well-thought and structured decentralized

blockchain-based data cloud storage granting
confidentiality, decentralization, security,

and other components necessary for an
uninterrupted and safe operation.

1. Vulnerabilities in Modern
Centralized Cloud Data Storage
In recent years, cloud services
have become widespread due
to the flexibility and availability
of computing resources.

Not all encryption algorithms provide sufficient

Encryption is reliable enough to ensure

There are two main threats to data availability:

set of characters added to the message. When

choosing cloud storage, you need to make sure

that the provider uses this method of protection
against falsification of transferred information.

data, the provider needs to download it from the

2. Why Blockchain?
A decentralized blockchainbased data cloud storage
model is obviously the best
solution to the problems of
confidentiality, accessibility,
and integrity.

Another advantage is that transactions carried

out in a blockchain cannot be changed or faked.
A cryptocurrency-based blockchain allows

creating a decentralized Internet while providing
freedom and security. It ensures:

Low storage cost
Decentralized cloud storage is much cheaper
than any centralized one.

3. SmartFox: Taking Decentralized
Cloud Storage to the Next Level
SmartFox is a pioneer in the world of blockchain-based
decentralized cloud data storage solutions.
It provides reliable storage of text information, media files, and even websites, as well as rewards users
in exchange for sharing their disk space!

The main advantage of using Smartfox is that it’s trustless, which means data is stored without relying
on a third party. Decentralization perfectly solves the problem of easily identifiable central points of
attack of traditional cloud storage.

Stage One
The development of the masternode network

up to 1000 mastenodes, which are a solid basis
for the future development of SmartFox. The

rapid development of the masternode network
is ensured by the high profitability at the initial

stage and aggressive promotion in social media,
including bounty campaigns.

Stage Two
1000 masternodes provide sufficient redundancy
necessary for the network stable operation.
In other words, renters are insured against

unreliable disk space providers. Stage II goes
along with the release of the beta version of

wallets with an inbuilt sharing (renting) option,

which in fact allows all FOX holders use the cloud
data storage technologies. At the same time,

masternode owners receive some privileges and
bonuses.

Stage Three
Steady development and expansion of the
SmartFox platform functionality, including

the ability to store media files and use the

decentralized cloud hosting for websites with
own DNS.

5. Data Security
Based on the analysis of the
existing technical solutions
in decentralized cloud data
storage, the operations
necessary to ensure the
desired level of data security
on the SmartFox decentralized
cloud data storage were
established:
File encryption

Sharding is the most reliable mechanism

to grant data confidentiality, integrity, and

availability. The data is encrypted on the client’s
side before sharding starts. No one but the user

controls his private key and access to data. The
client can also confirm the authenticity and

integrity of the file using its hash. The hash along
with the location of X copies of a file is written
to the file system immediately after the file is
uploaded to the network.

As the number of shards increases, it becomes

more difficult to find any given set of parts of files
without knowing their location. The data security
is proportional to the square of the network size.

After the file is encrypted, its hash is its unique

changes its hash, so it’s possible to check the file
without accessing it directly.

Sharding
Encrypted files are divided into parts (shards), or
several files are combined to create one shard.

Distribution of files
X copies of each file are randomly distributed

over the network. X is a dynamically calculated

number of file copies. Depending on the number
of copies, additional copies (shards) can be

sent to support the required redundancy level if
necessary.

6. Data Sharing
Smartfox allows not only safely storing data but also conveniently
working with it.
File encryption
Any SmartFox user will be able to share this or
that information with colleagues or relatives
so that the group would be able to change
documents collectively the same way that
Google Drive and similar services work.
SmarftFox Sharing works as follows:

At the same time, every data change leaves a

trace: any file or document changed retains its

entire history – from the beginning to the latest
version.

SmarftFox Data Sharing provides increased

security when dealing with corporate and secret
documentation and is more reliable than the
widely available centralized options.

The data that the user wants to share with a
group is encrypted with a separate random
key, which in turn is encrypted with the keys

of all the group members and then placed in

the blockchain. This allows any user to access
the data by decrypting the public key with his
private key.

Maintaining redundancy ensures fault tolerance

An encrypted file A is divided into B parts, which

it is necessary to have several backup copies

to nodes. Accordingly, the A file can be restored

of the system. For reliable storage of information,
of each shard. This guarantees the safety of
information even if one or a few disk space
providers leave the network, lose data or
somehow violate the storing conditions.

Sharding occurs according to the following
algorithm:

in turn create C fragments that are distributed

from C encrypted fragments. Due to the ability
to determine the level of tolerance to the loss
of a certain number of shards, redundancy

significantly reduces the likelihood of losing
access to the file.

1000 masternodes will be sufficient to achieve

the level of redundancy required to protect users

against data loss by dividing files into more parts.

8. Staking & Masternodes
Owning a masternode grants
not only a part of the block
reward but also by 10% more
profits from providing free
disk space, which is a bonus in
exchange for the contribution
to the development of
SmartFox.

However, running a masternode is not a

prerequisite for using SmartFox advantages. The
ability to store information on SmartFox will be

available to all users having at least 1 FOX coin in

their wallets. 1 FOX coin will give the opportunity to
share 1 MB of free disk space. The more coins you

have, the more you can earn on renting your free
disk space.

Proof-of-Stake is an excellent way to access the
SmartFox storage at no cost. With staking, the

chance of getting the block reward increases

At the same time, even a 1-coin wallet can mint
coins if lucky enough.

*The maximum allowable amount of free disk
space that the SmartFox wallet owner can

share – whether he runs masternodes or stake

coins – is 100 GB. This amount is sufficient for high
profitability and ensures fault tolerance and
decentralization.

9. The Interaction
between Storage
Providers and Renters
In a decentralized SmartFox
network, the interaction takes
place between a storage
provider that shares his free
disk space and a storage renter
that borrows this place for
storing files.

The interaction happens via the UI that will be
available in the 2.0 wallet. In the 2.0 wallet:

1. Storage providers will be able to regulate
the amount of free disk space and the
price for 1MB, which will allow them to
remain competitive and receive the
desired profit.

2. Storage renters will get a wide range of
options and the ability to rent the disk
space at the lowest price.
