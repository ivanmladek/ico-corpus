THE PURPOSE WHITE PAPER

INTRODUCTION

SAFECOIN

WAS

BORN

ON

THE

PREMISE

THAT

A

CRYPTOCURRENCY AND ASSOCIATED COIN NEEDS TO SERVE
A PURPOSE.

THE CRYPTO MARKET IS AWASH WITH DOZENS

ON COINS WISHING TO COMMERCIALISE AND CAPITALISE ON
THE EMERGING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND LEVERAGE
OFF

THE

PROMISE

OF

THE

TECHNOLOGY

STACK’S

DISRUPTIVE CAPABILITIES, YET; WE BELIEVE THEY FAIL IN
PROVIDING

REAL-WORLD

APPLICABILITY,

RESOLVING

CURRENT PROBLEMS OR SERVE ANY POTENTIAL PURPOSE.

IN DESCRIBING THE PURPOSE OF SAFECOIN, IT IS WORTH
REVISITING THE HISTORY OF COINAGE AND MONEY AND AS
TO WHY THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO BEING, AND FINALLY
REVISITING THEIR PURPOSE.

COINAGE
PRECIOUS METALS HAD BEEN WIDELY USED FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES AND
USED AS A MEANS OF PAYMENT, FACILITATING BARTERS AND TRADE.

TYPICALLY

WEIGHED AND CUT, THE INTRINSIC VALUE REST IN THE RELATIVE RARITY OF THE
METAL OR MATERIAL.
TRADE

PRACTICALLY, THIS SOLVED THE IMMEDIATE NEED FOR

/ BARTER FACILITATION BY ADDRESSING AN AGREED-UPON INTERMEDIARY

STORE OF VALUE AND A MEANS OF PAYMENT IN A PEER-TO-PEER EXCHANGE OF
GOODS OR SERVICES.

HOWEVER, DEPENDENT ON THE LOCALISED GEOGRAPHIES, THE RARITY WOULD
DIFFER VASTLY WITH DIFFERENT MATERIALS REPRESENTING DIFFERING VALUES
DUE TO SCARCITY AND DESIRABILITY.
AROUND THE

AS TRADE EXPANDED IN CIVILISATIONS

MEDITERRANEAN AND TRADE ROUTES EXPANDED THEIR REACH,

THIS FURTHER EXACERBATED THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM FACING A NETWORK OF
MARKETS, THEIR PERCEIVED VALUE FOR THE MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE AND BROAD

ACCEPTANCE AS A MEANS OF PAYMENT.

THIS LED TO THE EVOLUTION OF

COINAGE.

THE USE OF THESE PAYMENT METHODS AND STORE OF VALUE IS WIDELY KNOWN
TO HAVE EXISTED IN MANY CIVILIZATIONS GLOBALLY THROUGHOUT HISTORY, BUT
THE USE OF COINAGE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT TODAY, CAN BE TRACED BACK TO

LYDIA, CIRCA THE SEVENTH CENTURY. AS A CONCEPT, COINAGE IS ISSUED BY AN
ISSUING AUTHORITY THROUGH A MINTING PROCESS AND IS RECOGNIZED AS A
STANDARD ACROSS AN AREA BY THAT AUTHORITY.

COINAGE
IN SARDIS, THE FIRST STAMPED COINS WERE STRUCK MADE OF A NATURAL
OCCURRING ALLOY CALLED ELECTRUM

(ELEKTRON IN GREEK) COMPRISED OF

BOTH SILVER AND GOLD AND A FEW LESSER PRECIOUS METALS.

IMPORTANTLY,

THE COIN WEIGHT AS WELL AS THE RATIO OF THE COIN’S METALLURGICAL
COMPOSITION WAS CONSISTENCY APPLIED IN ENSURING STANDARDIZATION OF
VALUE.

COINAGE WAS INTRODUCED TO SOLVE A DIFFICULTY WITHIN LYDIA, ITS

SUBJECT TERRITORIES AS WELL AS NEIGHBORS, IN PROVIDING A CONSISTENT
VALUE FOR TRANSACTIONS.

QUICKLY, LYDIA EVOLVED AND WAS RECOGNIZED AS

BEING AT THE FOREFRONT ON RETAIL AND TRADE IN THE REGION, IN PART, DUE
TO THE FACILITATION OF TRADE THROUGH COINAGE.

SURROUNDING TERRITORIES MINTED AND STAMPED THEIR OWN IMAGERY ON
THEIR COINS AS A REFLECTION OF THEIR AREA OF INFLUENCE BUT THE RELATIVE
RARITY OF ELECTRUM AND ITS NATURAL OCCURRENCE IN
THE PHENOMENON WAS LIMITED TO
ONLY IN THE

LYDIA MEANT THAT

LYDIA AND SUBJECT TERRITORIES. IT WAS

6TH CENTURY THAT THE CONCEPT OF MINTING COINS IN SILVER

AND GOLD RESPECTIVELY, SAW THE MONETARY INNOVATION INTRODUCED AND
WIDESPREAD ADOPTION TAKE PLACE.
HISTORIAN (C.

QUOTING FROM HERODOTUS A GREEK

484–C. 425 BC), “SO FAR AS WE HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE, THEY

(THE LYDIANS) WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO INTRODUCE THE USE OF GOLD AND
SILVER COINS, AND THE FIRST WHO SOLD GOODS BY RETAIL”.

COINAGE
THE

IMPORTANCE OF THIS HISTORIC EVENT IS THAT IT INTRODUCED THE

FIRST KNOWN EXAMPLE OF BIMETALLISM; A MONETARY SYSTEM WHEREIN
THE ISSUING STATE FIXES THE RELATIVE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE
GOLD AND SILVER COINS.
MONETARY SYSTEMS

FROM

THESE EVENTS, ANCIENT CIVILIZATION

DARIC, SHEKEL

AND OTHERS WERE BORN.

WHILST

DIFFERING CURRENCIES WERE BORN REFLECTIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
ISSUING STATE, THE RESULTANT PREMISE OF THEIR PURPOSE IS DESCRIBED
BELOW:

MEDIUM FOR TRADE

STORE

MEANS

OF PAYMENT FOR GOODS OR SERVICES

MEANS

OF PAYMENT FOR TAXES AND TRIBUTES

- * (DEPENDENT

ON

GOVERNING AUTHORITIES, SPECIFIC COINS WERE ACCEPTED ONLY)

COINAGE
THE STAKEHOLDERS OF THIS BYGONE ERA ENJOYED FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE
AS THEY COULD SELECTIVELY CHOOSE THE TRADE OF THEIR CHOICE AS THEY
ENTERED INTO A BARTER.

THE TRADES WERE PRIVATE IN THAT THERE WAS NO

MEDIATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN THE PEER-TO-PEER TRANSACTION AND
EACH INDIVIDUAL STORED THEIR OWN HOARD PROVIDING THEM THE PRIVACY
THEY WISHED FOR AS WELL AS THE COINS IN ITSELF COULD NOT BE TRACED TO
A HISTORY OF TRANSACTIONS OR OTHER INDIVIDUALS AS THERE WAS NO
IDENTITIES OR RECORDS OF THE TRANSACTIONS HAVING TAKEN
PROVIDING ANONYMITY.

PLACE,

ANONYMITY, PRIVACY AND INDEPENDENCE ARE ALL

ATTRIBUTES DIRECTLY ENJOYED THROUGH THE USE OF COINS, A CASH-BASED
SYSTEM OF TRADE.

CASH DOES NOT REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
BETWEEN BOTH PARTIES INVOLVED IN A TRANSACTION.

GOVERNMENTS AND

FINANCIAL SYSTEMS OFTEN CITE THE LACK OF TRACKING AND AUDITING AS A
MEANS

OF

FACILITATING

ILLEGAL

ACTIVITIES.

IN THIS REGARD, THE

VILLAINIZATION OF THE USE OF CASH RELENTLESSLY IS PURSUED AS AN
INCREASING

NUMBER

TRANSACTIONS.

OF

COUNTRIES

HAVE

IMPOSED

CAPS

ON

CASH

CONVERSELY, THE LIMITING OF COIN OR CASH BASED

TRANSACTIONS, REMOVES THE RIGHTS OF TRADING PARTICIPANTS OR HOLDERS
OF VALUE TO THE RIGHTS OF THEIR FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE, PRIVACY AND
ANONYMITY.

SIGNIFICANTLY.

UP HIS RIGHT TO BOTH PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY.

AS

LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN ANONYMITY BETWEEN USING
A BANK TO TRANSACT.

A RESULT, THERE IS

COINBASE

AND USING

WHY BITCOIN AND MANY CRYPTOS FAIL

BITCOIN

IS THE FIRST DIGITAL CURRENCY TO ACHIEVE WIDESPREAD

ADOPTION.

IT

ROSE TO PROMINENCE DUE TO THE FACT THAT UNLIKE

TRADITIONAL E-CASH SCHEMES IT REQUIRES NO TRUSTED PARTIES.

IN

MODERN TIMES, FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE “AGREED TO” THROUGH A
MEDIATOR BANK THAT DECIDES ON THE FATE OF THE TRANSACTION.
CONTRAST,

BITCOIN

IN

LEVERAGES A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER KNOWN AS THE

BLOCK CHAIN TO STORE TRANSACTIONS MADE BETWEEN USERS.

BECAUSE

THE BLOCKCHAIN IS MASSIVELY REPLICATED BY MUTUALLY-DISTRUSTFUL
PEERS, THE INFORMATION IT CONTAINS IS PUBLIC.
NECESSITY

FOR

A

CENTRAL

AUTHORIZING

BITCOIN

FINANCIAL

REMOVES THE
AGENCY

AND

REPLACES IT WITH A TAMPER-PROOF DISTRIBUTED PEER-ACCEPTED MODEL.

HOWEVER,

IT FAILS TO OFFER EVEN A MODICUM OF THE PRIVACY

PROVIDED BY TRADITIONAL PAYMENT SYSTEMS, LET ALONE THE ROBUST
PRIVACY OF ANONYMOUS E-CASH SCHEMES.

WHY BITCOIN AND MANY CRYPTOS FAIL
INCREASINGLY

IT IS ACCEPTED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO SURFACE THE

IDENTITY OF CRYPTO CURRENCY OWNERS BY USING INFORMATION IN THE
BLOCK CHAIN ITSELF, SUCH AS THE STRUCTURE OF THE TRANSACTION
GRAPH AS WELL AS THE VALUE AND DATES OF TRANSACTIONS.
UNDERSTANDING THAT

BITCOIN

WITH

THIS

IS NOT ANONYMOUS IN ITSELF, DIFFERENT

METHODS AND TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN UTILIZED FOR THOSE WITH
SUFFICIENT MOTIVATION TO OBFUSCATE THEIR TRANSACTION HISTORY
WITH THE HELP OF MIXES OR TUMBLERS.

A

MIXER ALLOWS USERS TO ENTRUST A SET OF COINS TO A POOL

OPERATED BY A CENTRAL PARTY AND THEN, AFTER SOME INTERVAL,
RETRIEVE DIFFERENT COINS
POOL.

MIXERS

(WITH

THE SAME TOTAL VALUE) FROM THE

SUFFER FROM THE FOLLOWING LIMITATIONS:

THE MIX CAN TRACE COINS

THE MIX MAY STEAL COINS

THE DELAY TO RECLAIM COINS
MUST BE LARGE TO ALLOW
ENOUGH COINS TO BE MIXED IN

GIVEN THE LIMITED UTILITY OF SOME CRYPTO COINS, THESE RISKS MAY BE
ACCEPTABLE TO SOME USERS.

WHY BITCOIN AND MANY CRYPTOS FAIL
WE BELIEVE THAT LEGITIMATE USERS WISHING TO KEEP THEIR
SPENDING HABITS PRIVATE FROM OTHERS, DO NOT WISH TO
SPEND ADDITIONAL EFFORT ENSURING THEIR OWN PRIVACY.

FURTHER, MANY OTHERS MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT THEIR
PRIVACY IS TYPICALLY COMPROMISED.

THE CRYPTO COMMUNITY SHOULD BE OFFERED A DIFFERENT
OPTION AND REMAIN
