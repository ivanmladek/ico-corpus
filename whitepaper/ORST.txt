EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Connecting Artiﬁcial Intelligence and and Blockchain for value chain optimisation
(opening up over 1,000 A.I. algorithms to the Crypto Community)
Business value chains are witnessing an inescapable shift towards fully digital transactions. The
multitude of data available in real-time (Big Data) will increasingly be used to optimize these value
chains by harnessing artificial intelligence and robotics.
Any value chain (B2B, B2C, etc.) is basically composed of three major “flows”: (i) the flow of goods
and services; (ii) the flow of information; (iii) the flow of payments. Efficiency is the name of the
game, i.e. optimizing all three flows means reaching maximum efficiency (“efficiency singularity”) in
terms of optimal (faster, cheaper, better) distribution of goods/services within the value chain –
from suppliers to customers, which in turn requires efficient sharing and transfer of information and
payments among the participants of a given value chain.
Value chains with centralized organizations can theoretically reach such efficiency singularity, while
value chains with (partially) decentralized, independent organizations are very often not able to optimally work together (in sharing goods/services, information and payments), mainly because of lack
of trust. As a consequence, trillions in value get lost every year due to inefficiencies in the mentioned
flows.
While A.I. algorithms can already optimize the flow of goods and services within value chains which
include decentralized organizations (“Mixed Value Chains”), so far no groundbreaking technology
was available to solve the issue of trustless participants not sharing information and payments in
the most efficient way. Blockchain is such a technology and connecting it with Artificial Intelligence
is the key to enabling the achievement of (quasi) maximum efficiency in such Mixed Value Chains.
ORS Group has developed the concept of Hypersmart Contracts, i.e. intelligent connectors (smart
daemons with an associated Ethereum account) which (i) activate A.I. algorithms (off-chain) to
solve complex efficiency/optimization problems utilizing data stored on-chain by independent,
decentralized organizations; and (ii) can release instant crypto payments. Thanks to Hypersmart
Contracts (“HSC”), the power of A.I. can be applied to reach the highest possible level of efficiency
(and, therefore, of profitability) in the flows of goods/services, information and payments within any
value chain.
ORS GROUP is a pioneer in this area: for more than twenty years our AI-based software solutions
have helped Fortune 2000 customers from various fields to automatically optimize trillions of digital
transactions daily. What makes such achievements possible are so-called Hypersmart Algorithms,
i.e. combinable modules of sophisticated algorithms. They are the building blocks for more than a
hundred proprietary software solutions (the “ORS Hypersmart Solutions”) sold to global organizations (see www.ORS.ai).

Following our aforementioned business and technology trajectory, and harnessing our long experience providing innovative software solutions, more than a hundred leading algo-scientists and IT
developers at ORS are currently working on connecting Hypersmart Algorithms with the decentralized information logic of distributed ledgers (aka blockchain) and the use of cryptocurrencies for
instant payments.
The development of the ORS Platform & Marketplace (open to third parties) for buying and selling
Algorithms and Hypersmart Contracts will enable both established businesses and new blockchain
projects from the Crypto Community to dramatically enhance their own business models and gain
higher profitability and competitive advantage.
Hypersmart Contracts, Algorithms and other digital assets developed by both ORS SA as well as by
third parties shall be freely tradeable on the Platform & Marketplace through ORS’ own utility token,
the “ORST”.

The premise leading to the merging of A.I. with Blockchain
and the Hypersmart Contracts

The following global trends in business & technology lead to our vision of merging Artificial Intelligence ("A.I.") and Blockchain ("BC"):
(a) More and more transactions occur digitally;
(b) Blockchain based smart contracts can automatically handle and transfer assets between
buyers and sellers, without the need of an external trusted authority;
(c) A.I., Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics algorithms, altogether here defined as
Hypersmart Algorithms or simply A.I. Algorithms, are increasingly being applied to make
transactions very smart and able to deal with complex sets of conditions and constraints, of
stochastic nature.
We therefore foresee an imminent future in which most business transactions in any value chain are
decided and executed by Hypersmart Contracts, a new concept for connecting A.I. Algorithms with
the decentralized information logic of Blockchain and the release of cryptocurrency payments. At
ORS SA we are developing a unique Platform & Marketplace (together, the “Platform”), which shall
allow the selling and purchasing of both proprietary and third parties’ A.I. Algorithms and Hypersmart Contracts through the newly issued ORS Token. In addition, business users of Hypersmart Contracts will be enabled to adopt cryptocurrencies within their own value chains to improve overall
efficiency and to reduce time-to-market.
Our established international customer base, already using hundreds of AI-based software solutions, will facilitate early adoption, fast growth and cash flow positive use of the Hypersmart Contract sold by ORS SA over its Platform.

ment with a triggering event or an escrow agreement) and without the need
for intermediaries.
Although several business opportunities arise from the use of the smart contracts, important limitations ought to be carefully taken into consideration.

Firstly, the current implementation of smart contracts on the Ethereum platform is not fully secured.
The consequences of unsafe and short-sighted design choices on the programming languages can
be fatal for many businesses. We have witnessed this in the unfortunate epilogue of the DAO. Since
then, many other vulnerabilities of smart contracts have been reported (N. Atzei, 2017).
Secondly, in contrast with contracts concluded in form of action, speech or writing, a smart contract
is ‘just’ a computer program built on code: it is still unclear whether it can be considered a contract
from the legal point of view, whether it has parties or it is merely a matter of decentralized computer
programming (Lauslahti, Mattila, & Seppälä, 2017). In addition, smart contracts are very “‘rigid’
because terms & conditions are coded immutably and not subject to real-life variability and construability – demanding adjustments that only humans can decide upon.

Yet another major issue is that like any other piece of code, a smart contract can be prone to defects.
However, unlike any other piece of code, a smart contract is not patchable: hence, once it is
deployed, if it contains a serious defect, the smart contract could be very harmful to any dependent
system .
Additional limitation is related to the impossibility, by design, of changing the behavior of a smart
contract in response to some external event (every change of state on a blockchain must be completely deterministic): this is in contrast with the fact that modern value chains are highly complex
(think of the iPhone suppliers network worldwide) and require more and more A.I., Machine Learning
and Big Data Analytics algorithms (here defined as ‘Hypersmart Algorithms’ or simply A.I. Algorithms) for stochastic and dynamic automatic optimization and execution of trillions of process-related transactions.
Indeed, ‘transactions’ instead of ‘contracts’ would be a more appropriate term for describing smart
contracts. Smart contracts are supposed to automate not only decentralized organizations but also
existing centralized or distributed business models. However, although value chains can already be
optimally and automatically run by algorithms in terms of flow of goods (“which product should be
delivered from where, to whom and by what route”), the exchange of information (including documents) and money (payments) within such value chains is still suboptimal due to the lack of trust
among independent participants and due to procedural constrains. As a result, the flow of goods is
slower than what would be possible with A.I. Algorithms, which are so to speak ‘constrained’ by the
cumbersomeness of the administrative and payments cycles.
The solution to this issue, which is unnecessary costly is the connection of A.I. Algorithms with
Blockchain technology, creating the new concept of Hypersmart Contracts. Hypersmart Contracts
optimize and automate complex business transactions, including the decentralized management of
information and documents, and the instant release of cryptocurrency payments by successful
execution.

As matter of fact, on November, 06 2017 an unidentified person deleted a smart contract upon which Parity multi-signature wallets’ functionality
relied, causing more than $300 million worth of ether being locked. See: http://read.bi/2hHcDiK (last visited 18 Dec 2017). Pertinent to mention,
Parity fixed a previous bug in July, which allowed $32 million in Ether to be stolen.

The concept of Hypersmart Contracts

Hypersmart Contracts (‘HSC’) are ORS SA’s innovative concept of integrating A.I. Algorithms with the
decentralized storage and the computing power of blockchain contracts (e.g., Ethereum smart contracts or Hyperledger Chain codes) for optimizing business processes (the flow of goods and of
information/documents) and automatically releasing payments for executing complex transactions
– for example in supply chains.
Hypersmart Contracts are smart daemons with an associated Ethereum account and can be considered a design concept connecting AI-based software (both on cloud hosting and on dedicated servers) with some key functionalities of Blockchain (smart contracts releasing crypto payments; decentralized document management). In simple terms, by connecting on-chain and off-chain ‘worlds’,
developers and entrepreneurs – especially from the Crypto Community - can create compelling business models and software solutions. HSCs help to optimally decide and automatically steer business transactions across value chains and industries (including very innovative B2C business
models). Hypersmart Contracts can be used to overcome current limitations of smart contracts, as
explained above in previous section.
The reasons behind such integration of A.I.-based software and Blockchain are as follows:
A.l. Algorithms are increasingly being adopted for automatic steering and optimizing of complex business processes in real time under stochastic conditions (‘digitalization’; ‘Industry 4.0’; etc.)
As per the PWC report, A.I. could contribute up to $15.7 trillion USD to the global economy in 2030,
more than the current output of China and India combined. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from
increased productivity and $9.1 trillion is likely to come from consumption side effects.
Blockchain technologies permit the avoidance of useless (and costly) intermediaries, performance of operations in untrusted environments and obtaining certified transactions of data and more generally – of digital assets.
The use of cryptocurrencies can dramatically shorten payments cycles, allowing immediate
transfer of money (upon fulfillment of conditions written in smart contracts).
In an accelerating digital economy, global value chains - which often involve untrusted parties
– require faster and more optimized flows of goods, of information/data and of payments.
Existing smart contracts are unsuitable for automatically executing and optimizing complex
business transactions, as the language only features some basic arithmetic, logical, and crypto operations (M. Bartoletti, 2017).

Figure 2. ORS Hypersmart contracts in a nutshell

From the technological point of view, the ORS Hypersmart Contract is a software program hosted on
the ORS Platform and with an associated Ethereum account. Upon receipt of a specified amount of
ORS tokens, the HSC can activate an A.I. algorithms-based software solution to solve complex optimization problems, which are parameterized with information previously stored by third parties on a
blockchain (different HSC can interact with different blockchain types). The UML sequence diagram
in Figure 3 shows more in details the general working mechanism of the Hypersmart Contracts. On
the left, two different actors are represented: Master and Participants. The Master is an entity (an
organization, a person, a software system), that needs to solve a complex optimization problem
(both B2B and B2C); the problem can be solved by a specific ORS’ or certified third party’s AI-based
software solution (the ‘Hypersmart Solution(s)’) available on the Platform.
To get the problem solved, the first thing the Master ought to do is to describe it following the given
specification syntax and to write such information on the blockchain (the Hypersmart Contracts are
blockchain-agnostic, i.e., depending on the business case, different HSC can use different blockchains). Subsequently, and depending on the business case, other entities – the Participants - (an
organization, a person, a software system) can in the problem-solving framework by declaring their
contribution (typically, information such as quantity of goods, effort, etc.) on the same blockchain. It
is important to notice that both Master and Participants rely on the mining process of the underlying
blockchain, that guarantees integrity of the data.
Public key cryptography can ensure secrecy and authenticity of communications. After a certain
amount of time, the Master will activate a specific HSC by transferring a well-defined amount of ORS
tokens (again, each HSC will make its terms of use publicly available). When the transfer of cryptocurrency occurs, the HSC reads from the blockchain all the data related to that problem-solving
request and ‘calls’ the relevant Hypersmart Solution available on the Platform. After the computation, the resulting information is written back on the blockchain and is available to both the Master
and the Participants. Further steps may involve the same HSC with a different parameterization and
problem request or may rely on an additional HSC.

By acting as a liaison between the on-chain and the off-chain worlds, Hypersmart Contracts are set
to deliver major improvements against current limitations of smart contracts and will help to achieve
the following major benefits for users (both established businesses and innovative blockchain projects from the Crypto Community):
The flexible architecture of the ORS Platform will allow dynamic usage of Big Data (both from
businesses ERP systems and from external/public databases).
Managing properly the stochastic conditions under which almost all B2B and B2C transac
tions occur.
Allowing the fast and powerful computation required by the modern complexity of value
chains and by the use of A.I. algorithms.
Open source and API-based coding shall enable third parties’ certified offering of innovative
Hypersmart Contracts and solutions.
Near-instant value chains (‘productivity/efficiency singularity’).
De facto elimination of ‘last mile’ inefficiencies in business transactions, due to cumbersome
management of information and documents, and slow traditional processing of bookkeeping
and payment procedures.

The starting point: ORS GROUP solutions based on Hypersmart Algorithms and
the RAMS 4.0 Platform architecture

ORS SA has its registered office in Lugano, Switzerland and is one of the sister entities of the ORS
GROUP software companies (the ‘ORS GROUP’). With over 20 years of software development experience, ORS GROUP is a pioneer in A.I Algorithms and provides optimization software solutions (a.k.a.
Hypersmart Solutions), which model the underlying business processes and take decisions in an
automated manner for Fortune 2000 companies. The solutions cover all the relevant business
processes of value chains (from production and supply chain, to sales & marketing) across a host of
industries. While it is not the object of this document to delve into the details of the ORS GROUP
Hypersmart Solutions, the reader can see them in Figure 4 and obtain additional information from
the website (https://www.ors.ai/index.php/en/).
With Hypersmart Contracts, over 1,000 proprietary A.I. Algorithms and related software solutions,
all easily pluggable, are made available to developers and entrepreneurs worldwide, especially from
the Blockchain/Crypto Community. Such a modular software ecosystem, which is the core of the
ORS GROUP platform (the ‘RAMS 4.0’ Platform) , will constitute the base of the ORS SA Platform for
Hypersmart Contracts, A.I. Algorithms and solutions and other digital assets. Figure 5 shows a
high-level view of the current RAMS 4.0 architecture.
Starting from the bottom, we observe that several data acquisition modules have been developed,
which allow the extraction of petabytes of data from heterogeneous sources: ERP systems, legacy
frameworks, open data portals and streams, social networks; currently, more than 50 different
API-plugins have been developed to connect with several data sources and feed a data lake based
on Hadoop technology. Following the figure towards the top, the data are extracted – dynamically
and on demand - from the data lake and organized on multi-dimensional structures, called cubes.
The cubes are the data structures from which the ORS Hypersmart Contracts and Solutions will
retrieve data (in the figure are represented only a few of them, which are all web-based applications).

Figure 6 contains a logical view of the same architecture: it shows how the RAMS 4.0 Platform
‘looks’ at businesses/value chains like a set of assets (logistics, production, customers, etc.) with
associated performances and risks. Increasing performance and reducing risks require optimization, which the RAMS 4.0 platform achieves through cutting-edge scientific libraries of algorithms.

The Platform and the Utility Token

The ORS Utility Token (the ‘ORST’) is an Ethereum based token compliant with the ERC 20 standard
(see Section 6.5 for token details). The ORST is used for buying and selling Hypersmart Contracts,
A.I. Algorithms and Solutions and other digital assets (together, the ‘Platform Services’) on the ORS
SA Platform & Marketplace (the ‘Platform’) and to activate such Platform Services (both ORS’ ones
and certified third parties’ ones).

5.1 The Marketplace
The marketplace is the part of the Platform for buying and selling the Platform Services (Hypersmart
Contracts, A.I. Algorithms and Solutions and other digital assets), while the platform component is
the ORS SA’s open (to third parties) and HSC-based version of the RAMS 4.0 architecture created by
ORS GROUP. The first Hypersmart Contracts will be created and published by ORS SA, thanks to the
vast library of A.I. Algorithms existing at ORS GROUP, so that established businesses and new
blockchain projects can immediately take advantage of all the already existing algorithms and related software solutions. At operating speed, the Platform will also host third-parties’ certified HSC and
A.I. Algorithms: the certification process by ORS SA will ensure that the minimum level of quality is
matched, predominantly - but not solely - on security and reliability. The Platform is designed to host
not merely Hypersmart Contracts, but in addition a wider range of digital assets, such as:

Algorithms & related Software Solutions will be hosted on special virtual machines, created
on demand, and scalable, to solve specific optimization problems. Since data is ‘raw’ and
algorithms work on conventional exposed data, tools for declaring the shape of the original
data source and transform them as needed by the algorithms are needed and tradable too.
Data: ORS GROUP already handles a huge amount of proprietary and public business data in
‘raw’ form. Portions of such data can be exposed to the market, so that customers can buy
and import such portions in their own data lake (with provided ETL functions). It will also be
possible to register external data sources and the streams to collect such data: streams
move and convert data to the data lakes of customers, who could use or even trade the data
on the market place.
In addition to algorithms and access to data, the Platform shall offer a variety of data services, start,
ing from:
ISO-compliant data quality and cleansing: in the Big Data world, quality of data is of extreme
importance. The ISO/IEC standards on software data quality modelling (ISO/IEC 25012) and
measurement (ISO/IEC 25024) define 15 quality characteristics and 63 metrics to measure
them. The ORS GROUP, contributor to the technical commission that steered the work on the
ISO standards on data quality, will offer through the Platform a service to check datasets
against those ISO quality dimensions that are sensitive to the customers business cases.
Business Intelligence (‘BI’) Dashboards and Reporting: all existing Hypersmart Solutions
include a BI dashboard designed with state of the art User Experience methodologies, which
allow easy access to and provide a quick, holistic view of all Key Performance Indicators
(‘KPI’) (see some examples in Figure 7). The panel is dynamic: pivot graphs, counters, grids,
alerts, can be added on the fly to the visualization panel. Furthermore, KPIs can be custom
ized by composition of basic metrics, and multidimensional data structures are created with
zero latency. Dashboards permit the analysis of the demand (know what you are required to
do), resources (know what your capabilities are), to model and decide (drive your decision
model for taking optimal options) and be alerted to anomalies in the data.

Hypersmart Contracts: first use cases

This section hosts a collection of first use cases of Hypersmart Contracts in decentralized and trustless parts of value chains.

6.1 Use Case 1- Reverse auction in supply chains
A reverse auction (also known as a procurement auction) is a process where a producer (the Master)
seeks new suppliers (the Participants) through a dynamic bidding process. The general procedure is
the following one:
A request for proposal (RFP) is issued (usually via a market maker or on the buyer’s website)
on the reverse auction site, for a group of products or services. The RFP is open for a specific time,
depending on the buyer’s needs and on the type of products/services.
Interested suppliers contact the market maker (or visit the buyer’s website) and place their
offers (quantities, prices, delivery times, etc.).
The buyer then awards the supply contract(s) to the winning bidder(s).
A reverse auction mechanism is useful because it normally reduces the price of the goods/services
to be purchased. There is an on-going competition among suppliers for securing tenders which
pushes the suppliers to submit compelling offers and maximize their winning probability. However,
from the perspective of the offeror issuing the tender request, choosing the cheapest bid is not
equivalent to making the best possible choice as a whole. Multi-facet parameters ought to be considered: for example, the quality of the bidder services (declared, inferred or measured), all other relevant terms and conditions of the offer, the capacity constraints of the suppliers, the risk of non-fulfillment or of delayed delivery, etc.

These criteria need to be considered to avoid or at least reduce ‘hidden costs’: wrong planning decisions, inefficiencies in production and in other processes of the buyer’s value chain, sale losses,
lower customer retention and many others. Including all such complex criteria for making an optimal
choice in a reverse auction process is not an easy task: given the tremendously high complexity of
modern business, it is common to have to compute thousands of variables as well as several conflicting goals and constraints.
To solve such a problem, it is necessary to use big data optimization techniques and algorithms that
leverage on the latest findings in artificial intelligence and related fields. For example, a current ORS
GROUP Hypersmart Solution optimally generates the distribution plans throughout a complex
supply chain network by solving hundreds of thousands of optimization problems (each entailing up
to 100 million variables) in seconds. The availability of Blockchain technologies adds now the possibility of automatic execution of such Hypersmart Solution in a decentralized and untrusted environment, both in domestic and cross-border trades, eliminating the related paperwork and bureaucracy.

ORS SA Whitepaper

The UML sequence diagram in Figure 9 depicts how Hypersmart Contracts can be used in the supply
chain reverse auction. The process represented in the figure is a specialization of the general use
case illustrated in Figure 3: the Master is the buyer that sends to the distributed ledger the request
for bids, thus initiating the reverse auction process (in the diagram we imagined a retail company,
however it can be applied to many other sectors). The request is uniquely identifiable through a label.
Potential suppliers (the Participants) monitor the ledger, and when a new request appears, if interested, they can respond by sending their offer to the same distributed ledger: the format of the request
and the necessary parameters are specified upfront, while public key encryption offers a solid mechanism for ensuring confidentiality. The blockchain mining process guarantees integrity of the information provided by both Master and Participants. As in the traditional auction process, after a specified amount of time, the Master needs to check the offers and to opt for the best (i.e. optimized)
solution: here is where the Hypersmart Contracts play a role.
When the set time expires, all the Master has to do is to execute a payment transaction of n ORST
to the specific Hypersmart Contract handling the reverse auction process. Upon the reception of
the payment in ORST (that occurs real time also in case of trans-continental payments, differently
from traditional payment systems), the HSC will retrieve the information related to that specific
request from the Blockchain and pass them to the off-chain Hypersmart Solution containing the
dedicated algorithms for solving the optimization problem; the result of the complex bidding optimization problem is then written back on the ledger: as for the general HSC behavior, sensitive information on the blockchain is encrypted and accessible only for the HSC and Master via the standard
public-key infrastructure. The following steps can involve again the same HSC (differently parameterized) and/or other ones.
The use of Hypersmart Contracts in reverse auctions provides several benefits, both for buyers and
sellers. Firstly, using the Blockchain as an information layer permits a much broader set of suppliers
to participate in the proposal (no pre-selection of vendors is needed): the expected result is a more
dynamic competition and lower prices. Secondly, the HSC permits a fully automated auction, saving
a relevant amount of time in the final selection process. Lastly, the format of the proposals sent to
the Blockchain and gathered by the HSC allows not only an easier and instantaneous direct comparison, but also to specify through parameters a large set of business constraints and to select the
bidder(s) through optimization: as a matter of fact, the current ORS Hypersmart Solutions named
RAISE automatically solves in less than 30 minutes over 80,000 network flow problems, some of
which have >100M variables (achieving for a large international manufacturing and retail company
the following results: -50% in inventories, -25% back orders, -50% goods movements, near to zero out
of stock; all together accounting for € 150M in yearly savings).

6.2 Use Case 2- Demand planning
Demand planning is affected by a notorious problem: forecast inaccuracies cost billions every year
to almost all complex value chains, mostly due to information asymmetries among the participants
(see Figure 10). At ORS GROUP, we are already solving this problem with Hypersmart Solutions that
produce and harmonize independent forecasts at different hierarchies. The demand planning HSC
shall link the Blockchain-based collaborative information sharing possibility to the off-chain artificial intelligence of Hypersmart Solutions, creating a fast collaborative, consensus-based forecast
process aiming at improving forecast accuracy for all participants throughout the chain. Participation is fostered by the issuance of crypto-rewards to participants sharing both valuable and accurate
information (the verification is automatically performed by specific HSC). Public key cryptography
ensures that information is visible only to the HSC. Figure 11 shows how the process works:
Information sharing for collaborative
demand and supply planning is
obtained through the Blockchain
Cryptocurrency payments are to be
released as a reward for information
(including estimates) sharing, accu
racy and utility
A.I. Algorithms compute the fore
casts, automatically exchange data
with ERP systems, discover informa
tion incongruencies and inconsisten
cies and in general reduce forecast
errors and therefore save money to
all participants of the value chain
The Hypersmart Contract ‘buys’ the
computational services of the algo
rithms and delivers both the results
as well as it releases crypto reward
payments to some participants

Figure 10. The consequences of information asymmetries
along complex value chains

The first reward (participation reward) is given to all the participants willing to share proprietary
information, since their data is valuable for improving demand and supply forecast accuracy. The
second reward is given if certain (computed) information quality and utility criteria are met.

6.3 Use Case 3- The Buy Anything Get Anywhere (BAGA™) use case with
permissioned blockchain

Optimal store inventory sizing is a well-known issue in the retail & fashion business: the dilemma of
stocking the right mix and quantity of products, including customized Stock Keeping Units (SKU, a
product and service identification code for a store or product), is non-trivial. When customers visit
either the online sale channel or the brick-and-mortar stores and they don’t find the goods they
would like to buy, two major problems occur: (i) Loss of revenues (ii) Customer retention and customer satisfaction are likely lowered. Excess inventories would be the easiest countermeasure, however this dramatically reduces profitability.
The BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution solves this problem by optimally balancing out multiple variables
and constraints to ensure fulfilment while maximizing margins. Whenever a customer wishes to
buy an item not immediately available at her channel of choice (store or online shop), BAGA™ finds
that item at nearby stores or distribution centers and automatically initiates order fulfilment to
reduce ‘lost sales’. Using BAGA™, retailers are able to rapidly serve customer requests while ensuring
all the operational and financial constraints are met and thus optimize profitability. BAGA™ uses a
complex non-linear optimization function which is unique for every single item requested by customers. The A.I. Algorithms solving the problem are executed in a scalable software environment,
ensuring real-time response.
Figure 14 shows how the BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution is activated by a corresponding Hypersmart
Contract, which uses a permissioned blockchain as a shared (and decentralized) information layer.
The first step in the UML sequence diagram is the setting of constraints: using a very intuitive user
interface, managers can easily set up various business constraints. A few examples of constraints
that can be set up through the User Interface are:
Distribution center (DC) vs store priority: if for a certain requesting store “A” this constraint is
set to “DC”, then the most convenient Distribution Center (DC) will be chosen even if picking
from another store in the network would be better. This might be necessary, for example, to
accelerate DC clearing before the new collections are stocked.
Quarantine of new products: Excluding new products - for a certain amount of time - might be
useful to observe the new products sales trends.
Stores to be excluded: Top sales stores with high product volatility may justify the need to
exclude a store from the fulfilment network.
The constraints are specified via graphical interface and then sent to the blockchain as pairs of
keys-values. Please notice that the information stored in the blockchain includes also inventory
quantities for each item and location: such a task is easily automatized and permits the riddance of
centralized inventory systems. For the sake of simplicity, in Figure 14 inventory setting is not represented, while the setting of business constraints is placed at the beginning of the use case: however,
the reader should keep in mind that they are modifiable at any moment by the users (Figure 12
shows that no technical knowledge is involved for defining business constraints through the dashboard commands).

ORS SA Whitepaper

Figure 12. Setting up business constraints in BAGA

The second step in the diagram is the item request made by a shop clerk when a customer needs a product
with specific characteristics (e.g., a certain combination of size and color) that is not available at the shop.
The request is raised via graphical interface, and initiates the BAGA™-Hypersmart Contract, after the automatic payment of a specified amount of ORST. Once activated, the BAGA™-HSC will notify all the participants of the network (i.e., distribution centers and shops) about the item requested: this is done by putting
such information on the blockchain, while a program on the DCs/shops frontend monitors that blockchain.
The request usually must be satisfied in real time, however there are also cases in which such requirement
is not necessary: the diagram encompasses both cases.
In the first option (real time answer), when an item request is received by the BAGA™-HSC, the BAGA™
Hypersmart Solution on the Platform is immediately activated: the constraints (regardless of their number)
are retrieved by the BAGA™-HSC from the blockchain, passed to the BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution and
checked to determine whether the request is satisfiable; in positive case, a first list of eligible locations is
created. Then the list is further reduced by excluding the locations not having enough stock (also considering the minimum stock threshold, if applicable). Once the new list of eligible source locations is defined,
the most convenient location is selected from an expected net profitability perspective.

It is worthwhile mentioning that the optimization made by the BAGA™ A.I. Algorithms takes also into
account the expected daily sales, inferred by analyzing the log (on the blockchain) of historical operations, with very high granularity: daily expected sales are calculated for each store, class and type,
for each month. The forecast engine is programmed with Smart Strategies to adapt to the different
contexts; for example, adjustment towards previous seasons is automatically made: if new predictions are significantly higher (or lower) than previous season results, all the predictions are reduced
(or respectively increased).

The inclusion of the expected daily sales does not prevent BAGA™ finding the optimal solution in
real-time.
The second option represents situations in which a real-time answer is not necessary. Imagine, for
example, a business customer who wants to change in the next three months all the uniforms in her
company: she chooses items in several combinations, and not all of them are available in that
moment at the shop. In such a situation, the BAGA™-HSC can work in a slightly different way. The
steps in the optional boxes of Figure 14 of the diagram refer to this case: after the request is received
by the BAGA™-HSC and all the participants are notified by monitoring the blockchain, there is a time
window in which the participants can proactively offer to provide the items requested by specifying
delivery time and additional parameters.
This is done by sending the offer to the distributed ledger. At the elapse of the time window, the
BAGA™-HSC retrieves the offers from the blockchain. The offers collected will be included (and,
potentially, prioritized) by the BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution. If one (or more) offer is selected as an
acceptable solution, the participant will be rewarded with a certain amount of ORST. In both urgent
and not-urgent requests, the selected participant receives the order to ship the item, while all notifications (including inventory updates) are sent to the blockchain.
The use of the ORS HSC in conjunction with the blockchain fosters higher participation between
shops/distribution centers, with respect to the current BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution; it also provides
additional data to improve the precision of the BAGA™ A.I. Algorithms with more detailed and updated information on the demand curve, retrievable from the blockchain. An additional and remarkable
advantage of using the BAGA™-HSC in combination with the distribution ledger, is the possibility for
independent third parties -such as franchise companies- to participate in the SKU provision call
with their offer: in fact, the blockchain guarantees data certification even in an untrusted environment, while the off-chain intelligence of HSC ensures optimal profitability and service level.
We conclude remarking that the BAGA™ Hypersmart Solution includes a BI dashboard, designed with
state of the art User Experience methodologies, which allows to get a quick, holistic view of all KPIs
(see Figure 13). The panel is dynamic: pivot graphs, counters, grids, alerts, can be added on the fly to
the visualization panel. Furthermore, KPIs can be customized by composing basic metrics, and multidimensional data structures are created with zero latency.

6.4 Blockchain types
Hypersmart Contracts are blockchain agnostic: each business case requires a careful analysis of
which blockchain infrastructure and typology (e.g., permissions, consensus mechanism) should be
used as an information layer. The reason lies in the fact that Hypersmart Solutions cover a very wide
range of application fields (energy, finance, retail, industry 4.0, logistics, etc. ) and domain requirements are so disparate that no unique silver bullet works for all of them. Initial reference points are
Ethereum (Buterin, 2014) for the permission-less blockchains and Hyperledger Fabric (Cachin, 2016)
for permissioned ones. Further blockchain solutions might be considered on a case by case logic,
including experimental developments - such as the Lightning Network (Poon & Dryja, 2016) that
proposes off-chain transactions to overcome the blockchain scalability issues (Conoscenti, Vetrò, &
De Martin, 2017).

6.5 The ORS Token
The ORS Utility Token (the ‘ORST’) is an Ethereum based token compliant with the ERC20 standard.
It is the means of transacting within the ORS Platform. ORS decided to use its own native token
instead of using an already existing cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Ether, etc.) to
create a specific marketplace for HSC and for all other Platform Services to be offered to established
businesses and to the Crypto Community. The use of Ethereum as the coin backbone allows a scalable transaction infrastructure with international access: the Platform is designed to foster smooth
micro transactions for buying modular, computationally complex services (the HSC and the related
A.I. Algorithms and Solutions, etc. ). The use of a native token will incentivize companies and the
Crypto Community to join the Platform for both buying and selling the Services and will also help
developers and scientists worldwide to monetize their talent and knowledge. In addition, the ORS
Utility Token will be used as a reward and complement to remuneration for developers and affiliates,
in order to engage them and improve their commitment towards the project. With such characteristics, the ORST can attract several typologies of buyers:
Established Businesses: Buying A.I.-based HSC for optimizing all flows (goods/services;
information; payments) of key processes of their value chains
Developers and scientists: buying and using HSC, A.I. Algorithms and Solutions, etc. to devel
op high competitive business models; selling and monetizing own HSC and algorithms
Innovators in Blockchain/Ethereum projects: Buying the Platform Services for differentiating
own blockchain / Ethereum projects; selling innovative projects to Fortune 2000 already
served by the ORS GROUP
The ORST does not have the legal qualification as a security, since it does not give any rights on
dividends or interest. The ORST is final and non-refundable. The ORST is not a share and does not
give any right to participate in the general meetings of the Company. The ORST cannot have a performance or a particular value outside the ORS Platform.
After the ORST are used the first time to buy products and services offered on the ORS Platform, part
of the ORST will be gradually reintroduced to the market, in order to sustain the liquidity of the
tokens.
See http://www.ors.it/index.php/en/solutions
Off chain transactions represent one of the main solutions proposed to the well-known blockchain scalability problem, especially relevant in
data-intensive applications (Conoscenti, Vetrò, & De Martin, 2017)

Development and business roadmap

The development of the ORS Hypersmart Contracts, which include the corresponding A.I. Algorithms
and/or Solutions, and the development of the Platform will follow an iterative-incremental process,
with the significant advantage that the starting point is the existing and running ORS GROUP RAMS
4.0 platform as well as over 1,000 A.I. Algorithms and over 100 software solutions for optimizing
value chains. The planned roadmap is represented in Figure 15 . The initial development (Phase 1)
step will produce the first Hypersmart Contracts and base functionalities of the marketplace and of
the Platform. From the Phase 2, third-parties’ HSC, algorithms and solutions will be allowed to be
hosted (upon successful certification process by ORS ), while the development of the Platform will
proceed until its final release in Q1 of 2019 at the latest.
The long experience at ORS GROUP in developing sophisticated software solutions, including platforms, and delivering them on time to demanding international customers is the best guarantee that
the development and business roadmap of the ORS SA Platform for Hypersmart Contracts will be
duly and professionally executed, achieving all set goals.

11. The ORST, Legal, and Token Sale (Crowdsale)
Legal & Regulatory Opinion
General Information
The ORST does not have the legal qualification of a security, since it does not give any rights to
dividends or interests. The sale of ORST is final and non-refundable. ORST are not shares and do not
give any right to participate to the general meeting of ORS SA. ORST cannot have a performance or
a value outside the ORS Marketplace and Platform. ORST shall therefore not be used or purchased
for speculative or investment purposes. The purchaser of ORST is aware that national securities
laws, which ensure that investors are sold investments that include all the proper disclosures and are
subject to regulatory scrutiny for the investors' protection, are not applicable.
Anyone purchasing ORST expressly acknowledges and represents that she/he has carefully
reviewed this white paper and fully understands the risks, costs and benefits associated with the
purchase of ORST.
Knowledge required
The purchaser of ORST undertakes that she/he understands and has significant experience of cryptocurrencies, blockchain systems and services, and that she/he fully understands the risks associated with crowdsales as well as the mechanism related to the use of cryptocurrencies (incl. storage).
ORS SA shall not be responsible for any loss of ORST or situations making it impossible to access
the Tokens, which may result from any actions or omissions of the user or any person undertaking
to acquire ORST, as well as in case of hacker attacks.
Risks
Acquiring ORST and storing them involves various risks, in particular the risk that ORS SA may not be
able to launch its operations and develop its blockchain and provide the services promised. Therefore, and prior to acquiring ORST, any user should carefully consider the risks, costs and benefits of
acquiring ORST in the context of the crowdsale and, if necessary, obtain any independent advice in
this regard. Any interested person who is not in the position to accept or to understand the risks
associated with the activity (incl. the risks related to the non-development of the ORS Platform) or
any other risks as indicated in the Terms & Conditions of the crowdsale should not acquire any ORST.
Important disclaimer

ORS SA Whitepaper

The offering of ORST on a trading platform is done in order to allow the use of the ORS Marketplace
and Platform and not for speculative purposes. The offering of ORST on a trading platform is not
changing the legal qualification of the Token, which remains a simple means for the use of the ORS
Marketplace and Platform and is not a security.
ORS SA is not to be considered as advisor in any legal, tax or financial matters. Any information in
the white paper is given for general information purpose only and ORS SA does not provide with any
warranty as to the accuracy and completeness of this information. Given the lack of crypto-token
qualifications in most countries, each buyer is strongly advised to carry out a legal and tax analysis
concerning the purchase and ownership of ORST according to their nationality and place of residence.
ORS SA today is not a financial intermediary according to Swiss Law and is not required to obtain any
authorization for Anti-Money Laundering purpose. This qualification may change in case ORS SA will
offers services which are to be considered as qualified financial intermediation activity. In this case,
the use of the ORS services may require the positive conclusion of a AML/KYC identification
process.
ORST confer no direct or indirect right to ORS SA’s capital or income, nor does it confer any governance right within ORS SA; an ORST is not proof of ownership or a right of control over ORS SA and
does not grant the controlling individual any asset or share in ORS SA, or in the ORS Marketplace and
Platform. An ORST does not grant any right to participate in control over ORS SA’s management or
decision-making set-up, or over the ORS Marketplace and Platform and governance to the purchasers of the Tokens.
Regulatory authorities are carefully scrutinizing businesses and operations associated to cryptocurrencies in the world. In that respect, regulatory measures, investigations or actions may impact ORS
SA’s business and even limit or prevent it from developing its operations in the future. Any person
undertaking to acquire ORST must be aware of the ORS SA business model, the white paper or terms
and conditions may change or need to be modified because of new regulatory and compliance
requirements from any applicable laws in any jurisdictions. In such a case, purchasers and anyone
undertaking to acquire ORST acknowledge and understand that neither ORS SA nor any of its affiliates shall be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or damage caused by such changes.
ORS SA will do its utmost to launch its operations and develop the HSCs and the ORS Marketplace
and Platform. Anyone undertaking to acquire ORST acknowledges and understands that ORS SA
does not provide any guarantee that it will manage to achieve it. At the conclusion of the token sale,
the ORST shall be issued and delivered to the Contributors by means of a technical process as a
Ethereum Smart Contract. This is an open source IT protocol over which ORS SA has no rights or
liability in terms of its development and operations. The Token distribution mechanism will be controlled by a smart contract; this involves a computer program that can be executed on the Ethereum
network or on a blockchain network that is compatible with smart contract programming language.
Purchasers of ORST therefore acknowledge and understand that ORS SA (incl. its government
bodies and employees) assumes no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage that would
result from or relate to the incapacity to use ORST, except in case of intentional misconduct or gross
negligence.

ORS SA Whitepaper

ORST is based on the Ethereum protocol. Therefore, any malfunction, unplanned function or unexpected operation of the Ethereum protocol may cause the ORS Marketplace and Platform, and/or the
ORST, and/or any other operation at ORS SA to malfunction or operate in a way that is not expected.
Ether, the native Ethereum Protocol account unit may itself lose value in a similar way to ORST, and
also in other ways.

Governing law – Arbitration
The Purchasers acknowledge and accept that the ORS SA’s Token Sale is taking place within a Swiss

will not be filed with, and the Token Sale of ORST will not be supervised by the Swiss Financial Market
Supervisory Authority FINMA (FINMA). Furthermore, the sale of ORST has not been and will not be
authorized under the CISA. Thus, the protection which is given to purchasers of interests or units in
collective investment schemes under the CISA does not extend to purchasers of ORST.
