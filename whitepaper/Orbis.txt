1.1 Digital monetary
system and block chain
technology
Wireless money transfer and
cashless payment systems
have exploded all around the
world over the last decade and
a half. Global transactions of
this type grew 11.3% from
2013 to 2017, reaching nearly
$450 billion today. Most
recently, this growth has seen
the introduction of even
newer and more mobile forms
of payment through solutions
like Apple Pay, Google Pay,
and others. These combine
mobile payment technology
with cryptocurrency software
to deliver their product. In the
near future, payments made
through
near-field
communication such as QR
codes are expected to rise
above $6 trillion dollars
annually.

To adapt to these changes,
decentralized
investment
markets are setting the stage.
These have a peer-to-peer
market structure, and in such a
structure, investors interact
directly with one another
without the need for complex
intermediary hierarchies. Their
devices act as the points of
contact, and all transactional
information is distributed
through
algorithms
programmed into the devices
and their software. There is no
need for centralized hubs or a
trusted authority structure.
This enables investors to make
decisions
by
and
for
themselves, letting them use
their own market information
and make real-time payments
accordingly,
with
lower
overhead and fewer costs.

Universal
transaction
processing
for
cryptocurrencies
against
fiat-based goods and services
is practically nonexistent, and
represents
a
significantly
untapped demand in a market
which has exceeded $200
billion and counting.

1.2 ORBIS, the future
of descentralized
money transfer,
payments and
investment

Being able to trade cryptocurrencies between
ordinary, everyday users will require a significant
rethinking of what services a cryptocurrency
provides.
The ORBIS system can provide this on a 24-hour
basis, either online or in-person at an ORBIS
branch. This will allow everyone to access the
benefits that cryptocurrencies provide them,
including low transaction costs, no-limit
transactions, fast payment, and the removal of
geopolitical barriers to payment.
Approximately 4 million people are using
cryptocurrencies on a daily basis, with that
number growing every day and expected to
exceed 300 million by the year 2030. Satisfying
this market is quite possibly the largest financial
opportunity in the last several decades.
The ORBIS system aims to be the best to do just
this.

1.4 Problems and
solutions

The current financial system is heavily centralized
and mainly serves the interests of only a few major
players. These are the banks and financial
companies that we see internationally today, which
have a vested interest in maintaining their status
quo. The rent-seeking behavior of these enormously
inefficient and largely stagnant corporate structures
have become toxic to the success and opportunity
of nearly everyone else in the world.
Examples of their failure include the global financial
crisis of 2008 and the European sovereign debt
crisis of 2010. These were both clear
demonstrations that change was necessary.
The related issues that ORBIS intends to address are
as follows:
•
The elimination of high fees and costly
barriers to entry through the removal of 3rd-party
intermediary services
•
A significant reduction in wait times –
transactions should be near-instant, not beholden
to the business days and business hours of
traditional brick-and-mortar banks
•
Self-service and no imposed limits
•
Removal of complicated paperwork and
bureaucracy
All of these and more will be tackled by the ORBIS
desktop, ATM, and mobile platforms, which will be
usable by people of all ages and will utilize a
simplistic, easy-to-use design.

1.5 Market size,
projections and
potencial

remittance, however, is relatively new, and has
tripled since the year 2000. In 2004, at the G8
summit, it was determined that money
remittances should be made as affordable as
possible, and by 2008 the World Bank had
initiated the Remittance Prices Worldwide
Database. This allows for a comparison between
remittance prices around the world, and makes it
possible to set benchmarks to ensure the quality
and availability of such remittances.

Taking action to improve one’s job standing is an
implicit assumption in today’s workforce.
Nowadays, people are far more inclined to move
for work than ever before. This has allowed the
international money remittance industry to grow
at unprecedented levels. A remittance is a
transfer of funds made from a foreign worker to
his or her home country.

Most remittances are handled by banks, but
there are only three other institutions that
dominate the entire Western non-banking
market for remittances. These are: Western
Union, Moneygram, and RiaMoney. Between
the three of them, they possess over 1.1 million
retail locations around the world in 200
countries.
Although this may seem like a large monopoly,
they are actually now finally being challenged –
by companies like Orbis Money Transfer and
Investment. As an online service using P2P
(peer-to-peer) technology, we can operate with
significantly lower overhead and have lower
fees than any other bank or money transfer
institution. We also provide a self-service system
that no competitor does.

The amount of money sent in remittance each
year is roughly equal to the amount of money
that is donated in international financial aid. In
2014, for instance, these remittances totaled
$596 billion worldwide, with an enormous
chunk of that ($436 billion) taking the form of a
remittance to a developing country.
It’s no wonder that people are doing this,
however, when opportunities abroad are so
much greater than in one’s home country. It’s
not a new phenomenon, either – money

2.ORBIS VISION

$
2.1 Orbis
crypto-economy vision
and business plan
The current rate of bank account ownership
around the world is only 60%. The remaining 40,
mainly in developing countries, do not have any
bank account whatsoever. This is a shocking
figure, considering what an integral part of daily
life a bank account is for the 60% who do have
one. In the past 5 years, however, the volume of
cash circulation in the world has barely gone up,
while non-cash transactions have grown by
more than 10%.
To address this, global financial institutions have
invested significant resources. Mastercard and
Visa, for instance, among others, developed a
coalition in 2016 with a goal of worldwide
financial access by 2020. Their efforts will focus
primarily on 25 countries, with most being in
Africa. These 25 countries comprise 73% of the
total population who is currently excluded from
accessing a bank account.

12

ORBIS seeks to bridge the gap, too. We currently
aim to provide financial access to 3 million
unbanked persons across Latin America, Africa,
and Asia by 2020 through partnerships with
banks. Our self-service platform will provide an
accessible solution to these people and allow
them their first opportunity to unlock the
opportunities that finance grants them. These
opportunities will include debit card ownership,
smartphones with ORBIS payment apps, and QR
and barcode scanning.
We see this as a better opportunity for the
unbanked than what will be offered to them by
existing financial institutions, which are prone to
human error and can be both time-consuming
and burdensome. ORBIS offers solutions which
are cutting-edge by today’s standards, so these
newly banked people won’t be playing catch-up.
Safe and limitless transfers, fraud prevention, fast
transactions, and much more will all be built into
the system, from ORBIS branches to VR chat
robots.
Our team works hard to ensure this
development is done right and done well. We
want to ensure that once our platform is
released, it lives up to our vision, changing the
lives of those who use it. We are also actively
helping develop businesses in these places to
encourage and faster economic growth.

2.1.1 Competitive
advantage

We are actively working to promote this
technology through our ORBIS branch system,
including access to mobile payments and
no-fee money transfers between 3 billion+
people,
unfettered
by
high
costs,
time-consuming methods, human errors, or
service downtime. We would be providing an
unprecedented system that offers faster,
cheaper, safer, and more reliable service than
any of our competitors.

ORBIS Worldwide Money Transfer and
Investment will bring a brand new innovation
to this market through its use of
cryptocurrency. We will also develop a physical
meaning for this sometimes obscure term,
providing more than just a digital token with
virtual services that could disappear overnight.

2.1.2 Marketing
strategy

MISSION

Orbis is aiming to provide financial access to 3 million previously unbanked people in Latin America ,
Asia and Africa by 2020 with the partnership of a third party (bank) which can provide self-service
accessible banking solutions.
The Orbis project will offer the chance to previously unbanked people to own a debit card, a
smartphone with the Orbis Payment Mobile app, barcode and QR codes checks, through the
philanthropic project financed by the companies’ profits.
The banks and the current payment transfer methods being conducted by individuals has shown
many human errors that can be irritating and time consuming for clients.
The amount which a person can transfer will be limitless done in a quick one way or two way
direction, preventing fraud and scams.
Orbis has designed a safe system that will be established in Orbis Branches around the world with
Self-service cash machines, and virtual reality chat robots that can overtake time and human error
problems.
Our team is constantly working in developing new features before the release that could ease many
people's lives and making a new sense also developing other new businesses, helping people run
their own start-up more easily.

2.1.2 Marketing
strategy

MARKETING RESEARCH
During the initial phases of the marketing plan
development, several focus groups were held to
gain insight into a variety of likely customers.
These focus groups provided useful insight into
the decision making process of these consumers.

TARGET MARKETS
As shocking as it may seem to the developed
world, 40% of the world's population, mostly
comprised of population in developing
countries, does not have a bank account
Despite the increased adoption of non-cash
forms of transactions (cards) with the volume
having grown by more than 10% to reach 500
billion in 2017, the circulation of cash has
increased only slightly across multiple markets
during the past five years.

Global financial institutions invest significant
resources into closing tremendous gap in access
to banking. Mastercard and Visa, along with other
financial institutions, shaped a coalition of
partners last year to reach universal financial
access by 2020.
The coalition will focus efforts on 25 countries
(mostly African), where 73% of all financially
excluded people live.
Expats: person living and working outside
their native country.
Age 18-75: the largest group of people
having appropriate incomes.
Banked people: bank customers that use
daily financial services.
Unbanked people: people that are
unbanked in undeveloped countries

2.1.2 Marketing
strategy

POSITIONING
What is our Unique Selling Point?
When positioning our services, we will have to
take into consideration the seven attributes that
the clients seek while looking for financial,
money transfer services. These characteristics
are the following (based on a research
conducted by CGAP)

1.

Accessibility

Many migrants, especially undocumented workers, prefer few or no identity requirements, but
most formal money transfer operators must comply with some type of identity stipulation.
Financial institutions can also set other requirements (e.g., opening a bank account or maintaining
a minimum balance) that impede the access of poor people to transfer services.
2.

Confidentiality

Some clients prefer to keep their receipt of money transfers confidential (either to reduce claims
within the family, or to minimize the risk of theft) and may favor using providers like specialized
money transfer companies, that may have less stringent identity documentation requirements
than multi-service financial institutions.
3.

Cost and transparency

Most people seek transfer services that offer
• No fees;
• Attractive exchange rates;
• Transparency on fees and exchange rates at both the sending and receiving ends.
4.

Ease of use

People prefer limited paperwork to send or collect funds, especially if they are not literate. Some
people prefer interacting with a sales agent for reasons of ease and personal service. Others prefer
the convenience and anonymity of ATMs or POS devices.

15

© 2017 Orbis Solutions OÜ

$

5.

Safety

$

Transfer operators must earn the trust of migrants and their families.
• Clients may be reluctant to seek services from banks or formal financial institutions, due to
mistrust or past experiences in their home or adopted country.
• Many people prefer to send money transfers through institutions that have a track record in
handling transfers and other financial services, and/or belong to a larger, well-known international
network.
6.

Speed

Many people prefer “real-time” transfers, regardless of the cost or urgency of the transfer
7.

Transaction convenience

Both senders and recipients want to transfer funds at nearby locations and reduce other
transaction costs, such as travel time, travel expenses, and bribes paid for better service.

2.1.2 Marketing
strategy

STRATEGIES

Orbis strategy will be based on communicating
our value to the targeted segments. This will be
done through a variety of online and offline
methods. The first method will be the use of
internet marketing tools. Being able to engage
with customers clearly and quickly can be a
struggle when there are multiple time zones,
countries and languages involved. Our website
will be the main source of information of our
services. We will create a strong content
strategy, where not only explain the benefits of
our services, but we will also educate the
customers how to use our services.
The other form of advertising will be
announcements in popular ICO calendars
(Coinschedule.com, CoinGecko.com, Cyber.
Fund, ICOcrowd.com, ICOcountdown.com,
ICO-list.com,
Tokenmarket.net,
and
TokenSaleCalendar.com) and using social

16

networks: Youtube, Facebook, Twitter and
LinkedIn provide us with valuable information
of their customer’s demographics, interests and
buying habits.
Facebook is the biggest social media platform
with over two billion users. Its advertising
medium allows businesses to easily target
specific audiences based on data that Facebook
has already collected from its users over the
years. It is able to track users’ individual
preferences for ads by using algorithms to
target the best audiences for your ads. Pretty
smart, indeed.
For every Facebook page that you own, you are
able to “boost” posts to a selected target
audience. We can select your target audience
based on the following parameters:

© 2017 Orbis Solutions OÜ

$

$

Location: Country, Zip code, City, Region, Address Radius or a Designated Market Area (DMA)
Demographics: Age, Gender, Language, Generation, Life Events, Political affiliation,
Relationships, and more.
Interests: Here we can target people based on their personal interests such as interests in
entertainment, shopping, fashion, food, fitness, family, business, and many more. These
enable us to very specifically target certain people, for example, a soccer loving mother of a
large family that travels abroad every second month.
Behaviors: Here you can target certain behaviors of your audience such as if they’re having an
anniversary soon, if they’re using a mobile or computer device, if they are living abroad, and
what kind of digital activities they partake in.
Using these data we will be able to analyze our potential target groups and to create personalized
messages.

Another source of marketing will be done
with strategic relationships with companies
that have similar customer demographics.
Alliances with banks, credit unions, postal
networks and retail outlets allow us to
leverage their strengths (proximity to clients
and established quality services) and
overcome their weaknesses (limited transfer
expertise, restrictions on foreign exchange
dealings, access to a payment system). The
strategic relationship with be mutually
beneficial where both organizations will
develop visibility for each other.

MARKETING OBJECTIVES

Develop brand awareness through a steady, month to month increase of new visitors on
our platforms.
Develop an increase in sales while achieving a status quo state or decrease in marketing
expenses.
Develop awareness of the structured conversation system measured by customers using our
services.

The ORBIS team’s sales strategy will be a successful one. It has already lead us to being one of the
leading companies working in the cryptocurrency space to include money transfer, banking,
marketing, and development in our platform.
We partner with chain markets, stores, and big business to provide them with all of their market
needs while also establishing our payment method as an accepted and trusted brand. They
introduce their clients to our platform and our POS terminals. This is a win-win situation, and gives
customers a number of benefits also.
Since we offer the cheapest and most competitive service through our simple, easy-to-use platform,
customers will intuitively prefer our platform. By using it, they will also be earning loyalty points to
be used at their own discretion for gifts or, in some cases, cash back. In all of our marketing efforts,
we aim to create an urgently necessary product for our customers.

SALES FORECAST
The money remittances industry sees $600 billion
flow through it annually. As a result, we predict
that within our company, we should be seeing a
cash flow of roughly $2 million per month within 2
months of launch. By the 12th month, we expect
this number to have risen to $10 million. Including
the entire platform, such as our POS and card
payment system and our funding and
management services, we will see a 2 billion-dollar
evaluation within 2 years.

2.2 Functionality

In the world of cryptocurrency, markets are decided
by peer-to-peer exchanges of digital tokens. Buyers
and sellers determine the prices through their own
buy and sell orders, allowing for a trul decentralized
exchange of value.
For a money transfer project like ORBIS to operate
in this space, the following functions will be our
main priority:

•

Customers can use their own debit/credit cards on our platform, performing real-time buy and
sell transactions, or have an ORBIS debit card issued to them.

•

International no-limit transfer functionality for the settlement of payments. This will include
currency conversion – for example, between US dollars and Japanese Yen.

•

ORBIS will provide short-term credit loans in the form of credit applications to its users, issuing a
bill of exchange between any parties who wish to use this application.

•

Fiat currency transactions will also be possible, not just cryptocurrency ones.

•

Interest will be earned in our ORBIS savings accounts by having tokens stored in them.

•

Buying ORBSi tokens allows for hands-off investment, with their tokens appreciating in value on
their own through the cryptocurrency market.

•

ORBIS POS will allow wireless payment to be a reality for all small businesses and entrepreneurs
who requires such services, including self-employed people in developing countries, such as
freelancers.

3 ORBIS PLATFORM
3.1 Orbis decentralized
desktop/mobile
platform

Our unique, decentralized platform is unlike any
other banking system available today, and it can be
used easily by anyone of any age. Although the
underlying technology may not be
well-understood, we see this opacity as a benefit –
after all, there is no need to understand the inner
workings of a mobile phone to use it!
Orbis customers will be able to save their money,
transfer their funds, invest, and receive credit or
funding for their businesses all with a simple click of
a button or tap of a screen.
In some cases, there may be customers who could
misunderstand or have questions about the
platform. They will have the option at all times to
speak with a AI VR customer service chat robot. This
software will be available on desktops, laptops, and
mobile devices of all kind. There will be step-by-step
usage instructions for each platform.

3.1.1 Orbis Wallet
Like other cryptocurrencies, ORBS will be stored in an digital wallet. Our wallets will be built-in

3.2 Orbis mobile NFC
payment system

for sending credit card information and pin
numbers, typically contactless.
Payments are faster because the PIN number or
a signature is not needed. It also however, can
cause the customer to spend more since paying
is so quick and easy.

Near Field Communication is a form of mobile
contactless payment, evolved from mobile and
contactless payment systems of the past. Both
types of technology have gone through many
changes and have merged together into
technologies such as NFC.

Smart-phones let a customer store multiple credit
cards and other payment methods all in one
device that the customer is likely to carry
everywhere with them already. It cuts out the
unnecessary hassle of texting or swiping
through menus to make payments and yet still
offers the security of a credit card.

Mobile payments aren't necessarily contactless
payments. Originally mobile payments and
other mobile services, like mobile banking,
relied on text messaging to complete
transactions. Many startup companies start
out with text message services for customers
and later move to mobile apps and contactless
payment systems that do not require the user
to send or receive a text message.

Orbis is offering a one of a kind mobile app that
embraces all the features of digital Wallets and
NFC payments that will make life easier for
millions of customers that would like to integrate
their physical wallet safely in their smart-phone.

Any device capable of making payments using
radio-frequency
identification
(RFID)
technology is using contactless payment
technology. The device does not have to be a
smart-phone through this is the most
commonly used device for contactless
payments. An antenna and chip embedded
into the device lets the customer wave their
smart-phone over a card reader to make a
purchase.
Security for contactless payments is the same
for a credit card. Fraud protection laws apply,
and secure channels and encryption are used

4. ORBIS WORLDWIDE
BRANCHES AND
FRANCHISING

The least but not last function in our branches
will be the Virtual Reality information and
customer service stands, where our customers
will receive information from a artificial
intelligence human chat robot, using Virtual
Reality technology, this consist in a stand with VR
Glasses that will transmute the customer into a
virtual chamber where he will have the
opportunity to make virtual conversations with
one of our AI VR customer service chat robots.

Franchising in a method for expanding a
business and distributing goods and services
through a licensing relationship. In
franchising, franchisors not only specify the
products and services that will be offered by
the franchisees but also provide them with an
operating system, brand and support.

Being a self-service business the monthly costs of
owning such a franchise would be insignificant
comparing to the profits.

In our vision, Orbis will exist also physically in
well-developed self-service futuristic branches
designed by our designers. These will consist
in self-service Atm machines which will have
all the functions that our customers will have
on their smart-phones and desktop platforms
and also cash dispersing function.

Owning Orbis branches all over the world
would be almost impossible for a single
company so the best chance to bring the Orbis
concept worldwide would be to franchise the
company so we can also share our profits with
the community.

6. ORBIS INVEST AND
FUND RAISING FOR
START-UPS AND
OTHER ICOs

Cryptocurrencies being the considered virtual
gold or the money of the future, have been a
surge in interest in recent years. The total market
value of cryptocurrency has increased from $ 18
billion at the start of the year to over $300 billion
today. Sometimes it seems like everyone is talking
about Bitcoin and other Currencies, yet less than
1% of the world owns any. Capital is flooding into
cryptocurrencies and like all influxes of money,
some will find unproductive uses like the weaker
ICOs with poor business cases and governance,
but other new cryptocurrencies might provide a
good service to certain customers that have the
need for such blockchain protocols.
Orbis team is enthusiastic in knowing and
helping other cryptocurrency projects that show
big potential merge on the cryptocurrency
market, providing a service for funding and also
being part in other big scale projects.

major overhaul to their estimates of global
poverty, incorporating what they describe as

changed to $1.25 a day.
While the poverty in the world is getting better,
Orbis would like to help the community making
people lives all around the world better with our
philanthropic vision.
Our team has set up a plan in which our
company will giveaway automatic produced
QRcodes from our future self-service machines to
people in need in undeveloped countries that
can be used to buy food and hygiene products
from certain affiliated companies.
More than 2.5 Billion people don't own a bank
account, fact that Orbis will want to help change
and provide digital banking services for more
than 1 billion unbanked people until the year
2025 giving the opportunity to these people to at
least own a debit card or a smart-phone that uses
our technology.
