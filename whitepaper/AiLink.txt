1. A decentralized social platform?
The greatest social networking platform in the internet era is Facebook,
WeChat and so on. Initially these products gained massive users by meeting
their needs of communication and socialization, and then succeeded in
creating great commercial value. However, the drawbacks of traditional
social platforms are getting more and more obvious:
• Giant's products acquired a monopoly, users have no choice and no
discourse right.
• User privacy can not be guaranteed. User’s data is analyzed and
commercialized by the platform, user experience is getting worse, users
are forced to receive mandatory advertisements and commercial push,
and the cost of trust between users is also getting higher and higher.
• Because of the centralized flow of platform, developer has no bargaining
power, and most of the proceeds are obtained by the platform, many
good products are hard to reveal.
• Advertisers in the traditional platform of advertising, can not get real and
transparent advertising effectiveness.
• Insufficient incentives. The value of the platform is essentially created by
users with every piece of content and interaction a little bit cumulatively,
but without any direct relationship with users.
• The traditional social networking platform is essentially a commercial
company that continuously intrudes the interests of users for the KPIs of
business goals and financial statements.
AiLink's purpose is to encourage users to engage in value-social interaction
on the value network they trust and build a new social network of the ideal
! /!

A trusted open social platform based on blockchain－AiLink White Paper

ecological value system based on artificial intelligence technology, P2P
technology and blockchain, which has decentralization, high security,
privacy protection and other features, instead of the traditional profit
model of commercial companies which use information and resources
asymmetric.
In addition, as blockchain industry has developed to the present stage,
user-friendly blockchain products are strongly needed which allow more
users to accept and recognize the concept and value of the blockchain,
which is also AiLink's mission. AiLink will start with social games, allowing
users to begin to understand the value of the blockchain to bring their own
value, to attract friends around the world to join the game, and quickly
establish connections and interact with other users on the platform.

2. Social scenes in the blockchain era
Winter vacation was coming, Li Lei planned to travel to New York, He opened
AiLink and released a real-time travel topic, and soon attracted a dozen people
with the same plan to join the group, everyone discussed the ticket, visa, travel
and other topics actively, finally Li Lei decided to travel together with several
guys who had the same destination and good credit on AiLink. Then he sent a
broadcast

message in AiLink using token looking for local guides in New York,

and soon received Joanna's reply, users who had helped spread the message
received token rewards. Li Lei found Joanna's opening message very
appropriate, she was available and helped to design the entire journey, a smart
contract was established. When arrived in New York City, Joanna took the group
on a guided tour. When resting Joanna opened the interactive game in AiLink to
play with everyone and soon began to get familiar with each other and found
common topics. Li Lei launched third-party local services on AiLink to discover

A trusted open social platform based on blockchain－AiLink White Paper

restaurants and hotels that support token payments and took everyone there.
After the trip, Li Lei confirmed the trip was completed and gave praise, token is
paid to Joanna automatically based on smart contracts.

The previous story tells a typical social scene of AiLink in the era of
blockchain. The whole social ecosystem will be more open, altruism will be
more evident among ecological roles, trust cost between users will get
lower and lower, information will be transferred more efficient, and users
will have more and more control over personal information and privacy.

3. Gamification Social Incentive Autonomous
Ecosystem
The most important concept that blockchain brings to users is the value of
personal assets. Mining will also become the most basic behavior in the
blockchain era. Happy Miner, the first blockchain game based on AiLink,
combines these concepts and maps each user to the platform as an asset
that can be traded and appreciated, and give the user a blockchain social
price and computing power attribute. Users can purchase their own friends
! /!
5
24

A trusted open social platform based on blockchain－AiLink White Paper

or other users to become their own miners mine for themselves. Each time
they are traded, they will increase their social price by 10%. The higher the
transaction number, the higher the social price and the computing power
will be. The mining output mechanism is similar to the POS mechanism, the
higher the calculation power, the higher the output.
After the basic gameplay was confirmed, mining pool system was
introduced. The mining pool system is an autonomous ecosystem, any
organization or individual can set up a mine pool by investing a certain
amount of Tokens, and setting the mining requirements and output rates.
All users can independently assign miners to choose different mining pool
to obtain higher profits. With reference to Ethereum's mining methods, the
mine pool will automatically adjust the mining difficulty as the number of
users changes, ensuring that users can get enough benefits while too less
users, and increasing the difficulty of mining while too many users to avoid
overcrowding.
At the same time, the happy miner has set up a six degrees of separation
invitation mechanism. The user can see the six degrees of separation list he
has invited, which greatly reduces the threshold for user interaction and
minimizes the cost for users to establish connections.

4. AiLink break through six degrees of separation
AiLink is a trusted user-friendly open social platform based on blockchain.
In AiLink Ecology, the user's behavior data will be recorded on the node of
blockchain, which can not be tampered with, and the transaction behaviors
! /!

A trusted open social platform based on blockchain－AiLink White Paper

of participants in all social networks are realized and constrained by smart
contract technology. Under the premise of ensuring the privacy of users,
anyone can depict the user's digital portraits through the data on the
blockchain, and determine whether the person is credible by the blockchain
score, thereby greatly reduce the trust cost between people and build a
highly trusted ecosystem.
On the basis of trust, AiLink will directly break through six degrees of
separation. Users can directly connect to or conclude transactions with any
node on the network at a low cost, so that information and value can be
effectively spread throughout the blockchain network. Then, publishers will
achieve their goals, communicators will get token rewards, benefiting all
nodes spread throughout the network.
In addition, AiLink capture and process massive users open data on
blockchain networks with AI operations, design unique formulas, match
users with high affinity, to achieve the desired results, such as in the same
crowd of music lovers, the probability of the person matching the music
preferences matches is higher depending on the user's preference for the
genre of music. The frequency of interaction between users will also be
used to calculate friends degree, so as to continuously improve the
relationship between friends.
At the same time, AiLink will provide more user-friendly applications, AiLink
will start with social games, let users get the concept and value of
blockchain more simply and directly, then improve the entire social
ecosystem gradually.

5. AiLink ecosystem composition
The basic value concept of AiLink ecology is to attribute value to the
contributors to the ecology, so that each role in the ecosystem can truly
receive benefits.
The factors in AiLink's ecosystem are: users, developers, advertisers,
merchants and PGC, the main behavior of each factor is as follows:

Users

Developer

Advertiser

Merchants

PGC

• Users
Users are at the forefront of the AiLink platform and enjoy absolute control
over personal information and assets.
Users can send messages which break through network boundaries on
blockchain network, others can help to transfer messages and receive
token rewards.
Users can communicate and interact with friends online and receive token
rewards.
Users can play games online or offline with other users and receive token
rewards.
Users can discover nearby business campaigns and sign up using tokens.
Users create interactive content within the community. Popular content
gets more exposure, and high-quality content gets more token rewards as
well.
! /!

A trusted open social platform based on blockchain－AiLink White Paper

Users can use tokens to propose new ideas for games. Other user can
contribute their tokens to support the ideas. Developers can develop the
proposed games and get the token rewards.
Users can choose whether to be shown push information like ads and game
notifications. To ensure privacy, the users' data can only be viewed by
themselves or users with their authorizations.

• Developers
AiLink reshapes the collaboration between the platform and the
developers, and the platform is very developer friendly.
Developers provide social network users with games, live streaming, ecommerce and other content and services and charge the users directly or
get the tokens as a service fee. For example, the reward in the live
broadcast application can be realized through the smart contract, and the
token paid by the regular taker is divided into a certain percentage by the
live broadcast developer and the anchor. All other profit sharing
agreements are based on smart contracts and are guaranteed not to be
tampered with.
The more users use the app, the more token rewards the app developers
get. The developers can get most of the revenue from in-app purchases.
Developers can also use tokens to promote their applications within the
platform. The platform, based on blockchain technology, ensures that
advertisers get real and effective delivery results.

AiLink will provide developers tools and interfaces of developing games
and applications to ensure that developers can quickly and efficiently
generate smart contract and develop third-party applications and services.

• Advertisers
Advertisers can use tokens to publish business tasks on the platform, gain
visibility through social networks, and fulfill specific business purposes, and
token will be rewarded to users who have finished business tasks based on
smart contracts.

• Merchants
Merchants can initiate campaigns on the platform, or run ads to attract
users to shop. They pay tokens and receive token rewards.

• PGC
PGC can publish content that attracts users on AiLink's open platform, and
receive corresponding token rewards based on user browsing and sharing.
App-specific token rewards, such as Tip, are available through the apps.
PGC can pay tokens to promote their content.

AiLink uses 30% of the tokens for ecosystem construction and incentives.
Users or developers' contributions to the platform will be rewarded
according to the PoC mechanism.
The usage scenarios of the tokens are very diverse. The main ways to use
them are:
- In-App Purchase.
- Make payments in the third-party applications provided by the
developers, in forms of live streaming rewards, paid content and ecommerce purchases, among many others.
! /!24

- Use AiLink’s wallet for offline payments at merchants.
- Other types of token transfer between users, including the interactive
AiLink ‘red envelope’ function.

7. Proof of Contribution mechanism
In consideration of the features of social network, AiLink applied proof of
contribution mechanism with smart contract technology to solve incentive
issues in the community and to ensure that the entire community's
ecosystem is open and transparent.
Token Generation Rules: The platform performs calculations every 24 hours
to reward contributors and participants on the platform. Each time, the
pool of rewards is fixed. The pool of rewards becomes one-half of last year
every 365 days.

Calculation demonstration:
- Participant Contribution Measure M1 = (Interaction Factor * Interaction
Quantity + Sharing Factor * Share Quantity + UGC Factor * UGC Quantity *
UGC Quality + Game Factor * Game Usage + Application Factor *
Application Usage ...)* Online Duration / 24 hours)
- Circulation quantity of the day
- Participant's gain of the day = M1/(M1+M2+…+Mn) * Qt
