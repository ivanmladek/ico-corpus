The world associates blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies with decentralization. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized because the technology on which it is based‚Äîthe
blockchain‚Äîis powered by blockchain validators which validate transactions on the distributed
ledgers around the world and keep it secure. Over the years, these blockchain validators have
come to be known as ‚Äúblockchain miners‚Äù and ‚Äúcrypto miners‚Äù.
While it is true that miners are making the blockchain network decentralized, there are still big barriers

BUSINESS BRIEF
Cryptocurrency Mining Industry
Back in 2008, the Bitcoin whitepaper was published. Bitcoin promises mankind a future where everyone
can rely upon a trust-worthy system based on the blockchain. Months later, the Bitcoin network went
live and the world learned about its ingenuity. Innovations then sprouted, and now there are hundreds
of crypto coins as well as tokens inspired by Bitcoin that are built for different purposes.
All these coins are based upon blockchain technology with ‚Äòtheir own unique flavors‚Äô. Transaction
Validation is fundamental to any blockchain technology. On a trust-less blockchain, validators are
essential, thus they mostly get rewarded with the internal currency. The world calls these people
‚Äúminers‚Äù, and the industry is called ‚Äúcryptocurrency mining‚Äù.
According to a research published by Coherent Market Insight , the cryptocurrency mining industry

In turn, the winning miner receives cryptocurrency coins as a reward for the amount of time and energy
spent for generating the solution.
This reward system incentivizes miners to generate the right solution and ensures that the network
remains secure while newly minted cryptocurrency is added to the overall circulating supply of coins on
the network. In the event that a fugitive party wants to attack the network, they have to take control of more
than 50% of the network‚Äôs mining hashrate or computing power.

Mining Economics
In order to mine on a PoW network, miners will need to acquire capable hardware & infrastructure.
They also need to run the latest software version in order to support the network.

Another problem is due to the fact that increasingly, highly specialized hardware required to viably
mine PoW cryptocurrencies lead to centralization. With the advent of ASICs, it becomes apparent that
only those with tremendous capital can take part in this mining industry. Despite this, in Q2 of 2018,

Proof of Stake
On Proof of Stake, a validator may validate block transactions if they hold a stake on the blockchain network.
PoS decentralizes the consensus power by ensuring rewards are distributed based on the number of coins
staked by the miner.
As such, the selection is strongly influenced by those that have the most coins ‚Äì the more stake they have
in the network, the more they have to lose in the event of a mishap. The other determining factor is the
length of time for which the coins have been owned, as it indicates whether the coins are in a long-term position ‚Äì
which is considered a more trustworthy position in comparison to coins that have been acquired recently.
In other words, those who own more coins and have been holding the coins longer are deemed to be more
trustworthy and are considered less likely to attack the network.
Mining Economics
As PoS miners need to stake their cryptocurrency in order to mine, they need to believe in the cryptocurrency

Market Capitalization
PoS is still in its infancy. Amongst the PoS cryptocurrencies, DASH is leading based on market capitalization.

because it provides cheap static IP addresses. A professional would run masternodes on a world-class
data center provider such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform that guarantees not
only static IP addresses but also high availability and enterprise-level SLA. That is important because down

All a user needs to know is how to transfer coins of their desired cryptocurrency to HONEST MINING‚Äôs
designated secure wallet, and HONEST MINING will on the user‚Äôs behalf stake these coins on the
cryptocurrency‚Äôs network.

2. Instant Masternode

HonestMining platform
allows Masternode
holder to request for exit
on any given time.
This exits opens up new
opportunity for other
users to enter the
masternode stack.

All masternodes have a maturity time - a waiting time from when the masternode is generated to the time
they start generating rewards. Instant Masternode, on the other hand, is an innovation by HONEST MINING

The successful operation of the HONEST MINING platform is contingent upon the successful operation of the various cryptocurrency networks of the Tokens staked or rewarded. Any malfunction, forking, breakdown or abandonment of the applicable cryptocurrency protocol or network

A third party or member of HONEST MINING‚Äôs team may also intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the code base or core infrastructure of the HONEST MINING platform,
which could negatively affect the HONEST MINING platform and the Tokens (including, but not
limited to, the use thereof) or result in the loss of the Tokens or the loss of the ability to access or
control the Tokens.
In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and users of the
HONEST MINING platform as well as the holders of the HNST TOKENS are not guaranteed any
remedy, refund or compensation.

Theft, Misuse or Loss of Private Keys
HNST TOKENS acquired may be held in digital wallets or vaults, which requires a private key (or
a combination of private keys) to access and use. Accordingly, loss of the requisite private key(s)
associated with such digital wallets or vaults storing such tokens will result in the loss of

parties. If the private keys are stolen, misused or lost, the wallets or vaults associated therewith,
and any tokens stored therein, may be lost.
Any third party that gains access to such private key(s) (including by gaining access to login
credentials of a third party hosted wallet or vault service) may be able to misappropriate the
tokens stored therein or transfer the tokens stored therein to themselves or to another person.
The tokens may not be recoverable and HONEST MINING will not be responsible for any such
losses.

Although HONEST MINING aims to be decentralized, there are parts of the HONEST MINING
platform that are yet to be decentralized or which are inherently unable to be decentralized. For
