Introduction
First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to read the documentation on Light
Pay Coin (LPC). Our international team has given lots of effort in building this open-source,
cryptocurrency project. We are pleased to provide this overview. Because of the everchanging landscape of the cryptocurrency industry, this paper is a living document that will be
updated from time to time as needed. However, in doing so, we will attempt to maintain the
original objectives of this project. LPC is a next-generation, hybrid cryptocurrency based on
proof-of-stake (POS) mining and masternodes. This project is a fork of the open-source
project of PIVX (which is ultimately a fork of the open-source project, Bitcoin) and leverages
the innovations of previous generations of cryptocurrencies.
LPC is distributed within a two-tier, hybrid network for securing the blockchain by (a)
confirming transactions, (b) ensuring the privacy of transactions, and (c) facilitating instant
transactions. As in other masternode networks, owners of LPC are compensated by the
network through a dynamic allocation of rewards based upon LPC owner contributions to the
network as confirmation nodes and masternodes. This incentive structure encourages LPC
owners to utilize the digital currency for securing the LPC payment network; this is
conceivably more profitable than selling the cryptocurrency on the open market. In addition
to securing the network, the primary mission of the LPC project is to create an easy-to-use
contactless payment system for peer-to-peer, retail, and government transactions worldwide.
By creating the next generation of user-friendly wallets, point of sale devices, and automatic
teller machines (ATMs), the LPC network will facilitate mass adoption of this innovative
financial technology. A long-term goal of this project is to position the digital currency of LPC
as a medium of exchange, store of value, and a unit of account, ultimately satisfying the
defining characteristics of money in this digital age. This process is a natural evolution in
Internet technology in which cryptocurrencies will disrupt the financial industry (based on

Page 3 of 21

paper fiat currency) in a similar way as the digital transformation of the early 1990s Internet
disrupted the traditional paper publishing industry.

Usage of Light Pay Coin
By creating Light Pay Coin (LPC), we made a cryptocurrency that would allow for the
safe and secure storage of LPC in a cryptographic, digital wallet. Moreover, we have
developed a financial model that would generate income for LPC owners while utilizing LPC
itself for the security of the LPC blockchain. We have also inherited, through a selected fork
of PIVX, the ability to provide for near instant payments through SwiftTX. This allows LPC
owners the ability to transfer LPC within seconds across a global network of masternodes.
This makes LPC ideal for worldwide cashless payments through contactless, point of sale
devices. To address the issue of previous first-generation cryptocurrencies, the network
provides the owner the option to ensure fungibility of LPC through the inherited functionality
of PIVX’s Zerocoin Protocol.
One of our main goals is to design, develop, and supply user-friendly point of sale
devices, ATMs that utilize mobile phone near field communication (NFC) technology, and easy
to use wallets. We will build the next generations of automatic teller machines (ATMs) for
exchanging from one cryptocurrency to any other cryptocurrency and from one
cryptocurrency to any government fiat currency. LPC will be the first cryptocurrency in the
point of sale and ATM payment network. This will allow for mass adoption of LPC worldwide
for both regular consumers and businesses to pay for goods and services. Thus, LPC will make
it easier and safer than traditional payment solutions, which are susceptible to billions of
dollars in fraud each year.

Blockchain Technology Overview
For those who are new to the cryptocurrency industry, a blockchain is a way of storing
data or a digital record of transactions. This record is immutable and cannot be changed.
Digital records are combined into blocks and then these blocks are cryptographically and
chronologically linked together in a “chain” using complex mathematical algorithms. Each
block is linked with the previous block and contains a complete set of all records that came
before it. New blocks are always added to the end of the chain. Computers running on the
same network perform the encryption process known as hashing. When all computers in the
network complete their calculations and receive the same result, a confirmation is made.
Then the block is given a unique digital signature. This block is then added to the digital
register, which is updated across all computers in the network. Once this is complete, the
block cannot be altered, and it is virtually impossible to fake or change once added to the
blockchain. Only new entries or data can be added to subsequent blocks. This makes it
impossible to hack the network - as each computer in the network would need to be hacked
simultaneously.
With traditional relational database systems, data can be Created, Read, Updated, and
Deleted (i.e., CRUD). With respect to a blockchain database, data can only be Created,
Read, Appended, and Burned (CRAB). This is what distinguishes traditional databases from
blockchain-based databases. Moreover, traditional databases are usually centralized.
However, blockchain databases are decentralized and can be distributed on a global scale,
which ensures that the network is always available. This technology also allows the potential
to store personal data securely as the hashing process is irreversible. If a malicious actor
attempts to change the registry, it will not match the registries held by other computers.
This builds consensus within the network as the longest chain in the network is the one that is
used and results in any altered registries or any other shorter chains in the network being
disregarded.

Proof-of-Stake
At the heart of the proof-of-stake algorithm is the storage of all the operations in the
LPC wallet with the distributed database. Synchronization of the wallet nodes of LPC running
on proof-of-stake is carried out through the peer-to-peer network, P2P. Thanks to proof-ofstake, it is possible to implement cryptocurrency with high security conditions to avoid hacker
attacks and fraudulent actions. Moreover, it is more efficient and environmentally friendlier
than proof-of-work, which utilizes lots of energy with application specific integrated circuit
(ASIC) machines.
The system using the proof-of-stake method is based on the principles of decentralized
management in the absence of a single controlling authority, which does not allow a malicious
actor to know exactly which version of the block is valid. In simple terms, the definition of
the principle of the proof-of-stake algorithm can be given as follows: The more LPC
possessed in a wallet, the more credibility that wallet node will be given in the permissionless network. Thus, the wallet will likely receive a block reward because of the relative
weight that wallet contributes to the protection of the network. The amount of time a wallet
participates in protecting the network is also a factor. From a security standpoint, proof-ofstake is not only mining, but the wallet also stakes the LPC amount to ensure against the
validity of the transactions placed in blocks. By having a wallet with a large amount of LPC
and staking that amount, this decreases the probability that the owner of the wallet is acting
in a malicious manner to harm the network. Thus, wallets with high LPC amounts are given a
greater preference in confirming transactions than wallets with smaller LPC amounts. An LPC
wallet node serves in the first layer of the hybrid cryptocurrency network by confirming
transactions on the blockchain, selecting a network masternode for instant transactions, and
creating the next block for storing future transactions. A discussion of the second layer LPC
network is described next.

Page 6 of 21

Masternodes
Masternodes play an important part of the LPC network. A masternode network is the
second layer of the LPC network that donates processing power to confirm transactions
instantly utilizing the SwiftTx technology inherited from PIVX. A masternode then receives a
reward for the work performed – one reward per block every 60 seconds. These rewards are
directly paid to an LPC wallet that is linked to the masternode. Using masternodes also
ensures the stability and security of the entire network. These nodes serve a special purpose
within the network to mix various transaction amounts to increase fungibility and anonymity
of transactions. This is done by the process of obfuscation, which is also inherited through
the open source PIVX codebase.

Page 7 of 21

Obfuscation
The LPC network has a focus on the anonymity of payments through the
implementation of PIVX’s Zerocoin Protocol. This provides a level of privacy by mixing various
amounts of LPC within the masternode network. This protocol consumes sent funds through a
special algorithm and goes through several iterations, thus providing a high level of
anonymity. The implementation of the preliminary algorithm makes the transactions
completely unknown to everyone except the sender and the receiver of funds. This makes
attacks on the network increasingly difficult. Here is a brief description of how the
technology works: A user determines through the wallet the depth of anonymization and the
amount of funds s/he wishes to send. The wallet then “shreds” the transaction into
predetermined smaller amounts. These smaller amounts are then sent across the masternode
network and intermixed with other users’ coin transactions also being anonymized, using the
master registry for coordination. These coins are not processed but will be mixed in again
with another round of transactions, depending on how many mixes the LPC user has selected.
The maximum amount of mixes the wallet can generate is eight; however, LPC can be mixed
again by following the same procedure. These mixed coins will show up on a separate
balance sheet for the anonymous payment to be made.

Page 8 of 21

SwiftTX
LPC uses SwiftTX technology, which allows users to conduct a transaction without
waiting for traditional confirmations on the blockchain. The technology uses a network of
second-level master logs, which detects transactions marked as “SwiftTX”. These master logs
then lock the transaction input and sends a confirmed transaction message to the network.
As a result, the transaction takes about 2-5 seconds, while ensuring that no double spending
can occur. After sending a confirmation message, the transaction is recorded in the network,
as usual. This means that LPC can compete with the ease, convenience, and speed of
traditional debit or credit card payments today.

Conclusion
The LPC Team prepared this document to provide a brief overview about
cryptocurrencies in general and LPC in particular. We discussed our primary goal of creating
the next generation of user-friendly wallets, point of sale devices, and contactless ATM
machines for worldwide use. From a technology perspective, evidence supports the view that
proof-of-stake/masternode technology is not only secure, but also environmentally friendly
and more efficient that proof-of-work consensus models. LPC is based on next-generation
technology such as SwiftTX, Zerocoin Protocol, proof-of-stake and second-layer masternodes
inherited from proven, open-source technologies. The contribution of LPC to the
cryptocurrency revolution is to usher in user-friendly devices to facilitate mass adoption. We
will do this through a combination of first-of-a-kind partnerships and unique business models.
A long-term goal of this project to position the digital currency of LPC as a medium of
exchange, store of value, and a unit of account, ultimately satisfying the defining
characteristics of money in this digital age. This process is a natural evolution in Internet
technology in which cryptocurrencies will disrupt the financial industry (based on paper fiat
currency) in a similar way as the digital transformation of the early 1990s Internet disrupted
the traditional paper publishing industry.

Appendix A: R&D Partnership Overview with the University of
Central Florida
Light Pay Coin: Research, Development, & Commercialization Project
Background
Light Pay Coin (LPC) is a next-generation, hybrid cryptocurrency utilizing a twotier, open network involving proof-of-stake (POS) consensus and masternodes for
specialized network functions (instant and/or private transactions). LPC is designed to
be a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account within an emerging
digital economy. LPC will use near field communication (NFC) payment technology to
transfer funds via mobile devices to point of sale terminals, other phones, and ATMs.
LPC’s goal is to become one of the fastest and most convenient modes of digital
payment in the world, revolutionizing the financial services industry. A person’s
smartphone can replace one or more bank cards and perform the functions of both a
general communication device and payment platform for personal, business, or
government use.
LPC in partnership with the University of Central Florida will assist in conducting
research and development activities to support the commercialization of the blockchainbased payment platform. This project will include several phases involving Industrial &
Organizational Psychology, Human Factors Psychology, Computer Science, and
Engineering. Both students and professors will be involved in the development of this
next generation platform for digital assets. Digital currency is the first use case,
followed by other assets and credentials (e.g., transcripts, micro-credentials,
certificates, and degrees).

Page 15 of 21

Goal
The ultimate goal is to build and commercialize user friendly (a) cryptocurrency
wallets, (b) point of sale devices, and (c) contactless ATM machines. This will allow for
buying and selling LPC and other cryptographically secure digital assets using mobile
devices with near field communication (NFC) technology.
General Approach
There are several phases of research, development, and commercialization activities
that will be implemented through a series of task orders. Time allocation and human
resource needs are determined on a project by project basis, commencing in the Fall of
2018. Separate task orders will be created involving the design, development, and
integration of user interfaces (UI). Task orders will be associated with the following:
(a) Software UI design of (1) wallets, (2) point of sale devices, and (3) contactless
ATMs
(b) Software UI development of (1) wallets (2) point of sale devices, and (3)
contactless ATMs
(c) Acceptance testing of the UI and penetration testing of entire software
application.
(d) Hardware UI design of point of sale devices and contactless ATMs
(e) Hardware UI development of point of sale devices and contactless ATM
(f) Hardware and software integration and prototyping
(g) Acceptance testing of prototype
(h) Pilot testing on Florida Lambda Rail network
(i) Pilot test (beta) with customers for personal, business, and government use

Appendix B: Legal Opinion on Status of Light Pay Coin as a
Security
Light Pay Coin Legal Opinion

August 8, 2018

______________________________________________________________
The issue is whether or not Light Pay Coin as a hybrid cryptocurrency can be regulated or
considered as a security under federal and state laws.
Overview on Cryptocurrencies
Before reaching the point to legally analyze Light Pay Coin and its standing from a legal
perspective, it is essential to provide the necessary information about cryptocurrencies to
establish a road map for the analysis and explanation.
Cryptocurrency is the digital phenomenon that has grown vastly over a short period of
time in our technological advanced society. One popular type of cryptocurrency that is well
known is Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency in essence is having currency, meaning items equivalent to
dollar bills, change or something of value, in a digital form rather than a tangible form.
Cryptocurrency differentiates from dollar bills and change because not only is it not in physical
form, it also eliminates the middle man, which would be the financial institutions. Instead of
having money held in financial institutions, the transactions are more so prioritized and between
just the parties involved.
Although society today is far advanced regarding technology, there has still been some
concerns or drawbacks when it comes to using cryptocurrency. In addition to the success of
cryptocurrency having instability, there are a significant amount of people that are skeptical in
utilizing cryptocurrency due to the fact that the money is digital rather than in the hands of the
consumers. However, people use a form of cryptocurrency without realizing it. People use their
credit cards and debit cards when they are engaging in various transactions without touching the
physical form of their currency. The major difference, as previously stated, is that cryptocurrency
is operated through the form of securely engaging in technological transactions amongst just
people and businesses rather than including the government and financial institutions.
Light Pay Coin
Light Pay Coin is a type of cryptocurrency that has a focus on acting as cryptocurrency
does, in addition to eliminating the skepticism and concerns of consumers regarding
cryptocurrency. Light Pay Coin has the intention of acting as a hybrid, with the hopes of
providing proof of sale and privatizing transactions within a network. Light Pay Coin has two
main goals: heightening the speed pertaining to verifying a transaction and maintaining the
confidentiality of the transactions that are made. Instead of using or involving financial

Page 17 of 21

institutions, Light Pay Coin will play the role of the medium and allow consumers and business
entities to conduct transactions amongst each other using technology such as mobile and smart
devices. Light Pay Coin intends to serve as another option when it comes to sending or receiving
payment for goods, services, or business relations.
Light Pay Coin uses Master nodes, or technological wallets, to ensure that those within
the network are provided with a daily return to the holders of the Master nodes. Light Pay Coin
differentiates from the typical cryptocurrency surfacing in society because it has more of a real
world utility rather than just being a cryptocurrency that one may invest in. Since its recent
inception, Light Pay Coin has a mobile wallet application available in Google Play and is
working on developing an application for the IOS devices. Further, there are already businesses
that have expressed interest in Light Pay Coin to use within their entities. Light Pay Coin is
partnered with The University of Central Florida, where several students are engaged in
substantial research needed to ensure that the complexity and concerns of cryptocurrency is
explored so that Light Pay Coin can be successful and satisfy the needs of everyday consumers
worldwide.
Laws Governing Cryptocurrency
While the use of cryptocurrency currently seems to be an unregulated form of
transactional occurrences, lawmakers are gradually working towards enacting laws that those
utilizing cryptocurrency will have to adhere to. Last year, it was decided and recorded in an
investigative report by the Securities and Exchange Commission that the Decentralized
Autonomous Organization’s tokens were securities. According to the Securities Act of 1933, a
security can be defined as:
any note, stock, treasury stock, bond, debenture, evidence of
indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profitsharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, pre-organization
certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract,
voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security,
fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any
put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of
deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest
therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle,
option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange
relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or
instrument commonly known as a “security,” or any certificate of
interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for,

Page 18 of 21

receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or
purchase, any of the foregoing.1
If any cryptocurrency is deemed as a security, it shall be monitored and subjected to
governmental regulation or involvement. The leading test to this determination is the Howey test
cited initially in the landmark case Securities and Exchange Commission v. W.J. Howey Co. In
the case, the Court determined whether the instrument was an investment contract under the
Securities Act of 1933. The test established in the case states the following: “a contract,
transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to
expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party[.]”2 Pertaining to
cryptocurrency, the focus would be on the transaction itself rather than the item or “instrument”
used to execute the transaction. In addition to this rule, while it has not been defined by the
Court, different circuits have established various ways to define a common enterprise for the
purposes of satisfying this element of the Howey Test. The three approaches are the horizontal
approach, the broad vertical approach, and the narrow vertical approach.3 The horizontal
approach reasons that a common enterprise exists when several investors pool funds together as
an investment and establishes a correlation of profits for said investors.4 The broad vertical
approach finds that a common enterprise exists where the promoter’s expertise determines the
success of the investor.5 Lastly, the narrow vertical approach states that a common enterprise
exists if a correlation is established between the success or failure of the promoter and the
investor.6
On state level, there are laws that have been adopted by some states to decide whether
there is a security or not. The name for these laws are the blue-sky laws. The test used to
determine whether there is a security on the state level is called the Risk Capital Test. The test
was first mentioned in the Silver Hills Country Club v. Sobieski case in California. Although the
states have different requirements pertaining to the details of the test, the overarching

requirements are somewhat the same. Essentially, the courts look at “(1) the placing of capital at
risk (2) in order to receive a benefit, and (3) the absence of control over management.” 7
Is Light Pay Coin a Security?
When applying the rule from the case to Light Pay Coin, it can be reasoned that Light
Pay Coin as a cryptocurrency is not considered as a security. The interactions involving Light
Pay Coin have the option to be more than an investment. Light Pay Coin can be used for instant
exchanges rather than putting money into the cryptocurrency in hopes of reaping benefits from
said financial input. Differentiating from the Howey test, an investment is not necessary when
obtaining Light Pay Coin and its purpose exceeds beyond mere investing similar to that of
stocks. Light Pay Coin can be used in a transaction or in fact sent from one person to another
without any consideration from both parties. In addition, Light Pay Coin is not necessarily used
solely to invest money into a common enterprise. When applying all three approaches in
reference to the common enterprise, Light Pay Coin’s purpose and function exceeds beyond a
pool funds consolidated together by investors. Two individuals or business entities may be in a
transaction together; this does not involve investments pooled together or demonstrate a
correlation or equal consideration between the profits bargained for on each side. The promoter’s
expertise does not matter in a transaction involving Light Pay Coin. Communication and conduct
can occur without the inclusion of outside parties. Thus, the success of one party involved in a
transaction does not have to rely on anyone else. The success or failure of the promoter and
investor is not the sole focus when dealing with Light Pay Coin. The cryptocurrency has one
main purpose and use, which is to be another option available to persons and business entities
looking to use digital currency for transactional purposes. The result of the transaction is not
dependent upon other factors, as the transaction as a whole is decentralized in nature. Further,
Light Pay Coin is independent and self-serving; the investment or exchange of one party does
not lead to, determine or dictate the profits of the other party.
When analyzing the Risk Capital Test, Light Pay Coin is still not considered as a security.
When Light Pay Coin is used, a risk does not always come into play for the capital in order to
receive a benefit or profit. One could argue that this is possible as an investor, but as someone
using Light Pay Coin for day to day transactions and financial activities, the categorization is not
the same. A previously stated, Light Pay Coin’s purpose is to be used for more than investment
purposes; it has the intentions to be used in everyday exchange practices just as dollar bills,
change, or anything else of value. One may use Light Pay Coin for an exchange, ending the
transaction there. The capital is not at risk, as both parties receive the bargain for exchange. One
may use Light Pay Coin just to transfer cryptocurrency from one person to another. In these
circumstances, a risk or gamble is not apparent. In addition, the parties are in control when using

Light Pay Coin. The parties have the power to use the cryptocurrency however they desire, and it
is not up to someone else how it is utilized. Light Pay Coin is decentralized and controlled by the
person obtaining it and not another outside source or form of management. Thus, it would be
difficult to find that Light Pay Coin is a security when applying the Risk Capital Test.
Conclusion
Based upon the purpose of Light Pay Coin and the test provided to determine if it is or is
not a security, Light Pay Coin is not a security. There would be difficulty establishing all the
necessary requirements for such finding. Therefore, it can be reasoned that the Howey Test is not
satisfied, and Light Pay Coin is not a security on the federal level. On the state level, the
determination of Light Pay Coin would depend on the specifications of the rules in each state
that has adopted the Risk Capital Test. At a general standpoint, however, it would be reasoned
that Light Pay Coin is still not considered as a security.
