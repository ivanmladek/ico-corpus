Raiden Network (RDN)
SPEC BUY
High volume, instant and secure token transfer
without the need for global consensus
Overview

Raiden is a highly anticipated open-source project which started
in 2015, shortly after the market adoption of Ethereum. The goal
of the startup is to solve the scaling issues of Ethereum by
creating a solution that allows two agreeing participants to
perform unlimited, bidirectional transfers without going through
the blockchain for every transaction.
An overview of the functionality can be summarized by the
following:
1) Creation of binding agreements called balance proofs by
using hash-locked transfers.
2) Establishment of payment channel technology which is an
off-chain contract between two parties. The two parties can
perform almost unlimited and low cost transactions between
each other instantly. The only time in which the blockchain is
involved is through the initial on-chain creation of the contract
and the final closing of the channel.

Token Sale

Under the code RDN, Raiden will be issuing a fixed supply of
100,000,000 tokens.
The company notes that exactly 50% of the tokens will be
available for crowd sale as a ‘Dutch Auction’ which is a method
that leads to the continued value variability of the contribution
price based on the length of the token sale.
A total of 34% of the tokens will be held by the developers of
Raider, Brainbot Labs, for the development and maintenance of
the protocol. The balance (16%) is allocated towards an
external development fund to grow the ecosystem.

Tokens for Investors

Tokens issued by Raiden (RDN) play a central role in the
ecosystem for the following reasons:
1) RDN is an incentive focused and ‘fee-based’ token which
aims to promote innovation, competition and the creation of
auxiliary services
2) The intention of RDN is the be the platform based currency,
although the company acknowledges that there is nothing
stopping developers from accepting any other type of Altcoin
as remuneration.
There is an expectation that RDN will be exchange listed in the
short term, however we cannot as yet confirm a date.
Commercial Strategy

The commercial strategy of Raiden is heavily focused on
development, deployment and market penetration.
As the initiative has been in development for some time, it is
highly anticipated amongst the community, hence, initial user
adoption should not be an issue.
The company is holding back 50% of tokens which they claim
are for continued development of the protocol as well as a way
to incentivise community collaboration from an innovation point
of view.
There is a strong focus on retention and growth for
commercialization.
We note that Raiden has delayed the release of their protocol
since March 2017 but have produced a sister version with
limited functionality.
Management

Raiden has been developed by BrainBot Technologies. The
personnel involved have a track record of technical
development success.

Strengths

•

As more large organizations including financial institutions seek
to incorporate Ethereum transactions in their business, the
issue of scalability, cost and time are increasingly becoming
more of a concern (particularly for those that are seeking high
volume numbers). Raiden’s solution is a leap in the right
direction, solving some of these limitations for a certain type of
user.

•

The application of Raiden’s Network to fintech related
organizations that are focused on constant interbank or
‘related-party’ transactions is significant. The network could
effectively reduce costs, settlement periods and open up the
possibility of instant remittance within various business models.

•

The project has been open source since 2015 with
approximately eight contributors to the GitHub repository.

•

Within the contents of their FAQ’s, the team have spent some
time comparing other solutions in the market and noting the
major differences in technology.

•

The project already has a significant following.

Weaknesses

•

There is no official white paper for the project, however there is
a ‘101 summary’ which provides a good overview of the project.
We believe the team decided to do this due to the amount of
information already present on github.

•

The company had communicated that there would be a release
earlier in 2017, however this has not yet occurred. Such delays
pre-ICO dampen confidence in the market that the solution will
be delivered within an appropriate time frame.

•

The allocation to the the team of 35% is quite large. They note
that this amount is also to be indirectly contributed to
development and payment of advisors/legal, however, by any
standard this is still significant. A more granular breakdown
would have been appropriate.

•

With respect to the above, we would then question where the
proceeds of the 50% crowd sale would be going. In light of there
being no official ‘use of proceeds,’ it can be assumed that it will
be for development, which would indicate a ‘doubling up’ on
R&D allocation.

•

At this point in time, the ‘Dutch Auction’ process makes valuation
and analysis extremely difficult based on deal structure.

Conclusion

Raiden Network presents a speculative opportunity for
investors seeking to take exposure in an innovative concept
that can change the landscape of Ethereum and its future
adoption.
The solution they are seeking to deploy has merit, particularly
when looking at specific use-cases in high volume businesses
that have ongoing transactional relationships with the same
parties.
It should be noted however that such a solution will not be
applicable to every use case. For business models which
operate with new channels of customers or ‘high volume’ and
infrequent transactions, Raiden may not be the appropriate
solution.
In general, we are attracted to Raiden and its aspirations in
the Ethereum ecosystem, however we do acknowledge
several concerns that result in Picolo Research taking a more
speculative view:
•
•
•

There have been previous delays with the solution
A significant amount of tokens are being held with the
founding team
No ‘use of proceeds’ or budget has been produced to show
where the money is going (that we can find)

In addition to the above, the risk component of the opportunity
is heavily correlated to the deal structure, end market
capitalization and liquidity. At this moment in time, these points
are extremely hard to anticipate due to the nature of the ‘dutch
auction.’
With respect to the preceding points, Picolo Research
acknowledges that while there is a significant chance of
upside in the long term, however, this is paired with a large
degree of risk and uncertainty.
Picolo Research believes Raiden to be a speculative buying
opportunity for those investors that have a high tolerance to
risk and are seeking exposure for the long term only.
