BIRAKE - White Label Exchange

Our Vision

Cryptocurrency is the future, people need tools to exchange and use these
cryptos. We want to build the largest exchange network. Moreover, we want to
allow ICO communities, cryptocoins communities and people from this industry to
create their own trading platform with a few clicks.

We strongly believe in the future of cryptocurrency and its main strength: the
decentralization! We believe that allowing the market to be controlled by a single
(or very few) privately owned exchanges goes against this strength. This is why we
believe that everyone should be able to create their own exchange with just a few
clicks and that the orders should be openly shared across all exchanges in the
market.

Market
The Cryptocurrency market today comprises a multi-billion-dollar
industry. Though, it is yet to be accepted by the masses as a tool
for everyday exchanges, comparable to your standard ﬁat currency
such as the dollar or euro.While currently holding a market share of more or less
than 1.2% in current exchange currencies, it is expected to see rapid growth
during upcoming years.
By our opinion the cryptocurrency market now is in the stage of "volatile
growth", which began in late 2016 and most likely will continue in medium
perspective. Sharp price ﬂuctuations and correction are the natural state for this
stage of development.
We believe that cryptocurrency market is not an accidental phenomenon
and it is based on fundamental factors, which is conﬁrmed by the eight-year history
of development which began in 2009 when Bitcoin - the cryptocurrency which
change the usual means of payment and digital transactions – has appeared.
Over the last 8 years Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies only by the fact of
their existence and growing distribution refuted many negative forecasts, opinions
and assessments. They debunked some of the myths about their insolvency, the
lack of prospects and the impossibility of changing global ﬁnancial relations.
Over the mentioned period of time many alternative cryptocurrencies
appeared. Many of them are embodying completely different ideas and
fundamentally new concepts of economic ties. There is a gradual ofﬁcial
legitimization of the legal status for cryptocurrencies and the integration of digital
transaction elements into the traditional economic systems.
In 2017 the total capitalization of all cryptocurrencies (according to
coinmarketcap.com) increased by more than 4000% from $18 billion to over $800
billion. The daily trading volume for this period increased from $130 million to over
$46 billion (almost 300 times!).

BIRAKE - White Label Exchange

Figure 1. Cryptocurrencies capitalization growth for 2017. (by
https://coinmarketcap.com)

Based on these and many other factors and assessments, it is possible to
come to a very concrete conclusion - staying away from this market means to
standing still without seeing the prospect and to lose the proﬁt which now is on its
maximum level by the point of view of the market in the initial stage of growth.
Cryptocurrency market is developing rapidly in many different directions, so it
is very difﬁcult to predict the proﬁtability of a project in advance. However, we see
the most proﬁtable strategy in organizing and creating our own white label
platform, which will unite different cryptocurrency exchanges and will become the
biggest cryptocurrency exchange network with sharing orders between platforms.
It is suitable for a variety of tasks and will be able to solve many tasks regardless of
the speciﬁc user's activities and needs.

System Functioning Model

Step 1. Domain owner buys one of Birake’s packages with BIR , for example 10 000
Birake Coins (0.3 BTC) / month for a fully functional platform
Step 2. Website owner set his own fees and start personalizing he’s platform
Step 3. Website owner brings new users to his platform.
Step 4. Those users start trading within BIRAKE network with all the users
registered in BIRAKE network
Step 5. BIRAKE platform calculates all the fees individually from one platform to
another
Step 6. Considering the package acquired the total fee accumulated will be splitted
between website owner and birake company (example 60% to website owner and
40% to birake)
Schematically, system functioning algorithm may be displayed as the following
sequence:

Technological features
To optimize the work of the Birake project, the system has a number of
technological features. Some of them are listed below:
­
­

easy integration: Birake platform can be easily personalized with few clicks
into any Company’s Cryptocurrency exchange business
built-in tracking fees: Birake will track all the orders in real time mode, will
calculate fees diferentially between user from platform A (which has a fee for
example of 0.05%) and another user from platform B (which has a fee for
example of 1%)

BIRAKE - White Label Exchange

­
­

­

real time updates: users using the trading platform will experience the real
time update of the active, history orders and current price.
protection from fraud: to avoid abuse, the system has a mechanism to
protect against bots, unauthorized withdrawals, 2 factor authentication, ip
detection and email conﬁrmations
referral program mechanism: each website owner can set the percentage of
referral program if they want to activate it. The tracking of the referrals will be
made individually per exchange owners

The principle of operation
To successfully integrate and use the Birake
White Label Platform, website owner need a
domain name and a personal logo.
After that with just a few clicks away to have
the platform ready for trading.
Owner of the platform must invite as many
users he can to use the platform.
The number of transactions of his users are
directly proportional with the income at the
end of the month.

BIRAKE - White Label Exchange

Economic model
An important element of the whole system is the number of users who
comes to trade on BIRAKE platform. Considering that, we as a platform provider
we will offer a big variety of cryptocurrencies, user friendly platform and a huge
amount of orders and transactions in Birake network. On the other side the website
owner (which can be a owner of a comunity, someone capable to bring thousands
of users, ICO owner or a cryptocurrency owner) must promote their platform in
order to increase their income. A simpliﬁed economic model is that website owner
receive a part (depend of the package acquired) from transactions fee made by its
users and BIRAKE company gets the rest.

Birake business model
The basis of the economic model of Birake is the following:
­

Transaction Volume - is the volume in USD transactioned during one year

­

Number of website exchanges is the number of websites which are running
on our white label platform. Each website will have separate domain name
and custom personalizations

­

Cryptocurrencies - average of cryptocurrencies available for trading in each
month

­

New cryptocurrency price - an average cost for adding a new
cryptocurrency to the network (one time fee)

­

Customer percentage - average website owner income percent from
transactions fee

­

User transaction fee - average of transaction fee percentage applied by
website owner to each transaction

­

Birake percentage - is the average percentage from transactions fee from
website owners

BIRAKE - White Label Exchange

­

Exchange platform price - is the average cost of the exchange platform for
one year

­

Hardware units - number of servers needed for running the BIRAKE network

Financial plan
The source of Birake monetization is from the fees from users transactions, from
monthly fee for website owners and from fee for adding a new cryptocurrency to

transactions fee

-

Birake percentage - is the average percentage from transactions fee from
website owners
Customer income - total income during one year for website owners.
Customer income is calculated using the following formula

-

Customer income = Customer percentage * User transaction fee *
Transaction Volume per year
-

Birake transactions fee income - total income durring one year for BIRAKE
from transactions fee which is calculated as:
Birake transactions fee income = Birake percentage * User
transaction fee * Transaction Volume per year

Strategic Plans
Over the next 3 years, Birake plans to:
● atract companies / business developers / comunity owners/ entrepreneurs
and expanding the Birake network all over the internet
● along with our customers Birake plans to contribute and promote the trading
platforms from Birake network to comunity traders from all over the world
● Birake plans to grow the comunity around Birake network and to offer
periodically Bounty and Reward programs in order to keep them close
● The uptime of the platform is always important for us as a company, for our
customers and for traders from our network and we will work continuously to
keep it close to 100%
● We plan to build the safest way of trading, to aquire third party security audits
for our platform
● Birake support will grow directly proportional with the infrastructure and
number of users
● As in our Business Model our plan is to reduce the fees for the users but also
for our customers as website owners
● We have one of the lowest fees for listing cryptocurrencies and we are ﬂexible
to negociate different partnerships
● For website owners, if they are able to bring an average number of new users
they can make an income of 10 times bigger than the costs of the platform

Risks and opportunities
Considering our Business Model and taking a look at Total Volume traded for
24h from top 10 Exchanges our necessary trading volume for one year is lower than
one month trading volume from one of the top 10 competitors or even few days for
Binance. We consider that our Model is the most pessimistic model and the
opportunities are unlimited.
Birake is one of the ﬁrst White Label Cryptocurrency Exchange from the
internet which will support about 100 currencies and providing live trading
platform for traders.
The most innovative key of our project is sharing orders from our Central
Database within all platforms from our network. Considering this will be a win, win
and win situation. Birake will develop faster than a normal exchange platform,
owner of the website will have a fully functional website with plenty of orders from

BIRAKE - White Label Exchange

day one and trader will complete its trades much faster and maybe for a better
price.
Considering also risks we are aware that Birake will be the main target of
attacks from all over the internet, we plan to take all the necessary measures
including ddos protection, cold wallets, 2 factor authentication, ip tracking and
monitoring.

Marketing and sales
The successful market penetration of birake platform depends on the
efﬁcient development of the birake exchanges using our White Label Platform.
Birake along with our website owners will promote using the following channels:
● Search engines, platform owners and contextual advertising operators:
Google, Yandex, Mail, Rambler, Begun and others - the largest market players
of all categories of digital marketing services.
● Social media. We are already present on telegram, twitter, facebook, reddit,
medium, bitcointalk and many more
● Online media. Wider coverage in the distribution of news and content.
● ICO and Cryptocurrency related communities
● Owners of online services and widgets
● Mobile applications and services. One of the key and fast-growing
development areas of the entire digital economy. They are most interested in
all the services driving successful communication.
● Referral operators

With a correct marketing strategy, according to our Business Model we can
achieve easly a proﬁt of over $20 millions after 3 years of development and up to $1
billion if we achieve one of top 10 positions considering the Trading Volume from
Cryptocurrency market.

Coin considerations
Strongly consider the following prior to purchasing BIR coins; BIRAKE
exchange will be one of the biggest exchange software from crypto area.
BIRAKE targeting different type of clients like end users or companies. We
already implemented two main wallets (ETH and BTC) in the current platform, we
are about to ﬁnish the ﬁrst exchange between two cryptocurrencies.
Consumers will see a day-to-day development of BIRAKE exchange until the
ﬁnal stage when BIRAKE will offer a White Label solution for them, We are
considering providing back end support to B2C solutions and B2B solutions.
We hope to minimize speculative value of the coin and maximize utility value
of it when ﬁrst White Label exchange will be released.
This will be a huge product with billions of customers and billions of buying /
selling orders. coin sale hard cap, dates and milestones may change in accordance
with unforeseen BIRAKE expenditures and/or client/talent opportunities.

BIRAKE - White Label Exchange

Users should consider the utility of the BIR coin prior to purchasing. Our team
will work to expand the utility of BIR coin as our software portfolio continues to
grow.

BIRAKE - White Label Exchange

BIRAKE is built by a software company that has been operating since 2010 in
the web software industry. We have been more active in the media industry and
especially in South America. We have portfolio and software solutions that have
supported over 20 million users per day.
Starting with 2010 we have developed / implemented a global content
management system for different industries. So far, the main activity of our
business was the ﬁnancial and media industry.
We are experienced trading in the forex industry and ending with the
cryptographic industry for over 5 years.
We have deployed automated trading systems, exchange platforms, and
lately we've been focusing more on the encryption area.
As traders and investors, we have overcome the situation of overloading
trading platforms in the cryptographic area. Especially in 2017, there have been
times when more than 50% of large cryptographic trading platforms have been
overloaded / closed / inoperable for long periods of time.

BIRAKE - White Label Exchange

For this reason, we believe that the BIRAKE platform will come with a solution
for the end user, but also for companies that target a business / exchange of
information in this ﬁeld.
Also, the BIRAKE platform can be used successfully in new emerging
communities and coins, eager to join a exchange platform.

Conclusion
We will exercise our expertise in web development and data management to
build out the biggest White Label Exchange Platform.
Our BIR coin represents a vehicle to enable spend management in a
distributed ledger environment. Funds raised from our coin sale will be used to
develop the utility of the platform and to maximize the value of our products.
