THE BCDIPLOMA PROJECT
The ultimate goal of BCDiploma is to certify
diplomas in the simplest, most secure, and
sustainable way possible, by associating
Ethereum technology with a high level
of cryptography. As EdTech experts and
higher education specialists, we know the
expectations of schools in this domain.
Facing the falsification of their diplomas and
an increased competition, they are ready to
offer their graduates an innovative digital
service to protect their image.
BCDiploma develops a DApp for institutions
of higher education to enable them to issue
their degrees on Ethereum. BCDiploma allows
the graduate, throughout his life, to prove
the authenticity of his diploma by providing a
simple URL. It is a competitive solution, durable,
unfalsifiable, compatible with social networks,
simple to use, perfectly adapted to the uses of
higher education. Schools have not yet adapted
a certification standard? We offer it to them.
Once put in production for schools, what
future for BCDiploma, solution developed by
Blockchain Certified Data (BCD)?

BCDiploma | The BCDiploma project

BCD will have an inexpensive, fast-running
open source ecosystem created, in order to
deploy on-chain registries while respecting
the right of personal data on Ethereum.
These on-chain registers are usable by all on a
daily basis: they read a smart-contract certified
data. It’s a general application of Ethereum:
each and everyone of us can prove in a single
click that he is well qualified, doctor, holder of
a driving license...
The fields of application are numerous:
professional competences or certifications,
registers of regulated professions, internal
business registers, administrative registers…
Ethereum, by its scalability, is technically ready
to store registers on a large scale: we want
to develop the framework of it and make the
use of DApps a daily action for everyone. To
accompany us in this project is to make a step
towards a world in which we will all trust in the
data issued by the institutions.

STATE OF PLAY
Number of degrees issued worldwide
More than 4 million students graduate every year from higher education throughout the European
Union[1].
Almost 4 million college students (Colleges and Universities) graduate in the United States each
year[2].
Nearly 7 million university degrees were awarded in China in 2012[3].
The OECD calculated that its member countries, as well as those of the G20, will bring in total nearly
204 million graduates aged 25 to 34 in tertiary education in 2020, compared with 129 million in
2010[4]:
•
•
•
•

China: 29% (about 60 million graduates);
India: 12% (about 25 million graduates);
United States: 11%;
Russian Federation: 7%.

The LinkedIn social network exceeded the 500 million registered in 2017: a very large majority of
them have several diplomas on their profiles.

The fake diploma market
Have you ever searched “fake diploma” on Google? Just give it a try before you read the following
paragraph!
It’s a well-established matter of fact, constantly relayed by the media: the fraudulent use of
fake diploma, or made-up qualifications on resumes and social media is a hard fact impacting
schools, graduates and employers. This problem has been addressed in the news many times.

BCDiploma | State of play

5

Yahoo!’s former CEO[5] Scott Thomson, or Melania Trump[6] in the US: scandals are constantly
emerging.
“In France, 33% of applicants use fake diploma. This number is similar in the United Kingdom.
According to the official organism in charge of diploma authentication, (...) 30% of the applicants lie
about their qualifications.” [7]
Two markets, the first one being on the edge of the law, the second one being clearly illegal, are
taking advantage of this trend:
• Diploma mills / degree mills selling real diploma from schools that don’t exist, or having a more
than thin physical reality[8];
•

Professional websites selling high quality replica diploma.

In order to counter the phenomenon, societies have popped up to “verify” degrees afterwards and
check their authenticity: Verifdiploma or RiskAdvisory are some examples of this.

Job boards
Two main trends can be identified in the education and recruiting market nowadays:
•

The job market’s needs and recent amendments show that the tendency yields towards more
flexibility. As a result, short-term contracts are increasing, volatility in the workforce is rising
and the recruiting process needs to adapt. Companies need to recruit more, faster and in a
decentralized and automated way;

•

New actors are emerging from this tendency: job boards (LinkedIn, Monster, Indeed) are
platforms operating on a global market, which strive to answer the need of speed, automation
and specialization.

A major risk is also emerging from these tendencies: the falsification of data sent by applicants. This
is a major issue for companies who rely on the veracity of data provided by their employees. This
is a major issue for the actors of the educational and training system, which have to defend their
integrity. BCD is here to offer them the perfect solution.

Degree certification: the current offering
Despite a very active EdTech sector these last years, no standard was ever adopted at a large scale
to answer to the question of diploma certification.
Historical competitors
The historical competitors, like CertainSafe, relying on digital safes, have been proven inefficient in
curbing the prevalence of forged degrees. They have failed to conquer the market of degree certification. Their weaknesses are structural: they are too centralized and proprietary, easy to hack
and their code is closed-source. Their sustainability depends on the survival of the competitors
themselves. In addition to that, their fee schedule is complex and it is challenging to calculate how
much storage will cost over the years.

BCDiploma | State of play

Blockchain competitors
Some promising blockchain experimentations emerged: a first one of the Holberton School, and a second initiative by the ESILV in France. Blockchain competitors have also tackled this issue: Ledgys,
Keeex or Attores for example.
Their approach is identical: store an imprint of the documents on the blockchain. If the method can
guarantee the authenticity of the document initially “hashed”, it doesn’t answer several problems:
•

The identity of the sender is not proven, and the authenticity of data is not certified: how to be
sure that the hashed diploma is the original one, and that it was really issued by the school?

•

The regulation on the right to be forgotten might also be violated. Indeed, if the document is
shared, the hash is indelible, and the document stays forever recognizable.

Sony recently revealed its will to commercialize a blockchain application to secure and share
school’s credentials. They chose a private blockchain (partnering with IBM) and proprietary software, which is the opposite of the BCD’s vision.
We want an open source system based on a transparent public blockchain, but a secured one
so search engines will not be able to find or use any data.

How does BCDiploma meet the school’s expectations?
First of all, BCDiploma brings a solution to a concrete and relevant problem that schools’ IT
departments struggle with. The number of higher education institutions keeps increasing
and competition is fierce amongst them. Each one of these schools is yearning for a stronger
reputation and for better quality services for their students. The diploma’s certification issue is in
every Director of IT System’s mind.
An easy implementation
Within schools, IT and administrative services in charge of issuing diplomas are looking for easy
and practical solutions to use.
BCDiploma offers a “turnkey” DApp, which will allow schools to issue diplomas by a simple data
upload. By doing so, schools:
•

Avoid a complex document management, which is necessary today to implement the current
blockchain solutions (issuance of a digital “original” document, storage, hash);

•

Don’t have to handle digital safes and their access anymore. With BCDiploma, the only element
the graduate needs to access his diploma is a matching URL.

Safety, reliability and trust
Schools have to deal with the issue of their data’s safety, especially with long-term storage.
•

BCDiploma’s encryption algorithm, associated with data storage on Ethereum, ensures a level
of reliability and safety that doesn’t exist on the current market;

•

The Blockchain technology creates trust between the various players: protocols are clearly
defined and the existing rules are always respected and checked.

Sustainability
Choosing a long-term, reliable service without depending on a provider is a major challenge for schools.
•

While using BCDiploma, schools cannot lose their diplomas’ data any longer, as they are stored
on Ethereum;

•

BCDiploma uses open source systems called DApps: data’s access and DApps’ use are guaranteed
to the schools without any time limit.

No recurring costs
Long-term cost management is paramount for schools.
•

Compared to the other market players, BCDiploma is highly competitive. There is no monthly
plan or maintenance cost but only one payment per diploma;

•

If deemed more convenient by the schools, BCDiploma offers an “all-included” service, called
SaaS, billed after the fact in USD or EUR.

Economies of scale
Alumni or employees constantly solicit schools regarding copies’ issuance or diplomas’ certificates.
Thanks to BCDiploma these issuances can be automated and externalized. Schools will save so
much time and energy.
Personal data’s protection
Schools must respect the regulations on privacy and personal data.
BCDiploma complies with the essential principles set by the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) and was created so:
•

It won’t be possible for the BCDiploma Solution operators to use or collect data;

•

The right to be forgotten regulation could be implemented.

Digital innovation
To be attractive and competitive, schools are looking for digital innovations to serve their graduates in a practical way and improve their reputation.
•

Thanks to BCDiploma, alumni can use their diploma’s URL on LinkedIn and other social media,
without any time limit;

•

BCDiploma gives schools a “technological pioneer” dimension.

BCDIPLOMA CONCEPT
BCDiploma’s solution has an innovative approach: in our opinion, the diploma’s value is based on
the data’s authenticity rather than on the document itself. This is why BCDiploma will store the
specific data directly on the Ethereum blockchain.

EvidenZ ecosystem
The EvidenZ Framework
To implement BCDiploma, BCD is going to develop and operate an open source framework[9] called
EvidenZ.
EvidenZ allows deploying on-chain registers for diplomas in the first place, as well as for any kind of
data. It has been conceived to respect the regulation on data privacy (GDPR[10], as well as the right to
be forgotten). The Legal Opinion written by Alain Bensoussan Avocats - Lexing law firm (BCDiplomaLegal Opinion - September 19th, 2017 - Ms Nathalie Plouviet) underlines how BCDiploma’s tools
and methods constitue an approach which is respectful of the GDPR. Evidenz has been conceived
to store small, important and/or permanent data, such as a diploma, a civil status certificate or a
nomination to the National Medical Council, etc.
EvidenZ certifies data using an innovative approach:
•

The data’s issuer is systematically identified and verifiable;

•

The data itself is stored on Ethereum and thus cannot be modified any longer;

•

Sharing the data is the responsibility of the graduate, employee or citizen it belongs to;

•

The data can be made indecipherable by deleting the associated persistence key.

BCDiploma | BCDiploma concept

To run EvidenZ, the Ethereum blockchain is the obvious choice. It allows:
•

An optimal safety level due to its large deployment and its irreversibility.

•

The transparency of a public blockchain, necessary for users to trust it, particularly with the
open source smart contracts.

•

A vast ecosystem and many improvements to come, particularly regarding scalability.

Architecture
EvidenZ blocks have three levels of classification:
•

On-Chain: smart contracts - SmartValidation, SmartIdentification, SmartPublication;

•

On Web: DApps - Crypto App and Reader App, with secured web access;

•

Off-Chain: keystore[11].

Smart Publication

Encrypt diploma’s data issued by school
and push them to seed contract

Reader App

“Off Chain”

The DApps interact with the Ethereum blockchain and are working exclusively with the smart
contracts to guarantee a verified data. DApps are open source systems, so that the clients of the
solution can deploy it themselves. The persistence keys are stored in the keystore, which belongs to
organizations sharing data with EvidenZ. This keystore guarantees the implementation of the right to
be forgotten regulation, which, according to the GDPR, is mandatory, worldwide.

BCDiploma | BCDiploma concept

Decentralized deployment or SaaS
Our goal is to develop an open ecosystem, which will technically be independent from BCD. This
will allow to:
•

Encourage big institutions to adopt it and thus create the on-chain register standard;

•

Guarantee a permanent access to the encrypted data stored on Ethereum even if BCD no longer
exists.

The EvidenZ framework has been designed for a decentralized deployment. Schools which
choose to run it themselves, will operate independently and will benefit from DApps’ support and
improvements.
If this is the institution’s preference, BCD will offer an “all-inclusive” service, called SaaS. Our firm
will manage their keystore, by proxy, within a totally secured environment. By doing so, BCD
takes up a major challenge: making schools use the Ethereum blockchain, by allowing them to
buy a service in commercial conditions which fit their standards.
Focus on the data’s size
The data’s size sent by BCDiploma is a key factor. The cost of the Ethereum transaction when
diplomas are sent varies mostly because of that. Indeed, sending data via an Ethereum’s
transaction burns off gas[12] and the miners’ wage has to be considered. The amount of gas
spent to execute the transaction is proportional to the volume of data sent. Choosing data
storage directly on Ethereum over a regular approach (on-chain hash[13] / off-chain document
storage) is BCD’s DNA. This type of storage guarantees unchangeable data that can’t be hacked
and is not limited in time. We believe this is the least you can ask of a secured register.
The EvidenZ’s architecture was conceived to take advantage of this particularity. The amount of
significant text data on a diploma is limited and often redundant from one diploma to another.
Using optimized algorithms to reduce the amount of data per transaction, Evidenz pools,
structures and zips data. Thanks to the excellent ETHgasAPI, this architecture is combined with
an efficient use of gas price, to maintain a low cost when diplomas are sent from Crypto App.
In a near future, we believe in Ethereum upscaling capacities: Metropolis[14], PoS[15], sharding[16].
EvidenZ will take advantage of all of them and costs will be constantly optimized.

SMART CONTRACT CERTIFIED

DIPLOMA
Higher Education Institution
Smart contract certified identity

1. The school has to create an ID on Ethereum
1.1 A validator guarantees the school’s identity
Upon the school’s request, a third party, which we call “validator”, vouches for their identity on
Ethereum, so there can’t be no doubt about the Ethereum address used to share the diplomas.
The validator is an Ethereum actor deploying the smart contract SmartValidation.
The matter of legal entities’ proof of identification on Ethereum is a subject that will encourage
the emergence of benchmark players. In order to build a trustworthy open ecosystem, we need
these players to act as validators. When BCDiploma is launched, BCD will be the first validator
of the ecosystem and will do the necessary verifications to ensure the reliability of everyone
involved and the actual existence of the school: banking information and physical address,
e-reputation, trade and company register number (RCS), DUNS number, intra-community
VAT number, and authorization to issue diplomas. Come 2018, we plan on introducing more
Ehereum’s players to act as “validators”.

BCDiploma | BCDiploma concept

12

To get an “ID Certificate” the school must proceed with the implementation of a smart contract
SmartIdentification. The latter allows to:
•

Check via a smart contract SmartValidation that the validator has checked the school ID;

•

Publish the school’s “ID Certificate” in the transaction data without encryption.

1.2 The school’s ID certificate is proof of the diplomas’ authenticity
The ID certificate includes the following information: the school’s name, the characteristic
features of the diplomas that are issued, the URL of the corporate website page on which the
Ethereum address will be published and the URL of the web server hosting Reader App.
This certificate serves two purposes:
•

A diploma will be shared if and only if the certificate is valid. School will be able to use an
expiration date if necessary, using a smart contract SmartIdentification option;

•

When a diploma is being checked, the certificate will prove in “clear text” (i.e., directly
readable via etherscan[17]) the school’s ID, a proof that can be cross-checked by the
publication on the school’s corporate website of its Ethereum address.

2. The school will put the encrypted diplomas on Ethereum via Crypto App
The steps the schools have to follow are simple: send the diplomas’ data via Crypto App (uploading
the file or the API[18]) and confirm the encryption and sending request on Ethereum. These two
actions are performed by Cypto App, first, and then by the smart contract SmartPublication.

For each diploma issued, the smart contract SmartPublication will:
•

•

BCDiploma | BCDiploma concept

13

At the end of the process, Crypto App will:
•

Generate and store the persistence keys in a safe location: the school is the owner of these keys;

•

Send, in a secured way, the URL to read the issued diplomas;

•

Send a completion report to the school;

•

Erase the entirety of the processed data (process in memory).

3. The graduate receives the URL to access the diploma
Each graduate will receive, in a secured way, the URL to access his or her diploma. This URL cannot
be retraced from the Ethereum’s transaction. However, you cannot access the diploma without it.
The graduate is the only custodian of the URL and sharing it is his responsibility. He decides if he
wants to share it on social media or send it to a third party upon request. If the graduate wants to
assert his right to be forgotten, the school will have to destroy the persistence key after verification
of the graduate’s ID. Reader App, or any other BCD’ app, won’t be able to decrypt the diploma any
longer.
4. A third party can access the diploma via Reader App
The graduate gives his diploma’s URL to a company or university recruiting manager… This URL,
redirecting the user towards the Reader App’s server, allows him to:
•

See the diploma, which will have been designed based on a pattern set on the ID certificate and
decrypted by Reader App;

•

Access the ID certificate (directly via etherscan for example) in order to check the sender’s and
web server’s authenticity, more specifically the matching Ethereum’s address of the school and
the exact URL of the web server hosting the diploma he is seeing.

The ID certificate will also be searchable on the corporate website of the validator.

BCDiploma | BCDiploma concept

Crypto Algo
Centerpiece of the product, the cryptographic protocol has been conceived by BCD and meets the
highest standards required. Thanks to a tailor-made architecture, it executes the project’s core
principles: compliance to the right to be forgotten, control of the data access, and the guarantee
that the data won’t be stolen. You can check the technical specificities of the Crypto Algo protocol in
the White Paper’s appendix.

•

Even if you have access to the “persistence keys” table, you cannot decrypt the data without the
HSM’s access, which holds the MasterKey. And even if you have access to these two keys, you
still need the “diploma’s key”, which is in the diploma’s URL;

•

The only persistent AES key is the MasterKey, however it isn’t enough to decrypt the data. When
necessary, the AES keys of every diploma can be generated by derivation (during the encryption
or when the diploma is seen) and deleted immediately after usage;

•

The URL to read the diploma doesn’t allow to find the matching Ethereum’s transaction or to
build an oracle to obtain information. In order to do so, if a wrong URL is used, the server will
send back an error to the client without revealing any information. Locally, a detailed log will be
generated on the server for analysis purposes;

•

The deletion of a diploma’s persistence key in the “persistence keys” table will permanently
prevent the decryption of the data associated with that key, without impacting any other data.

BUSINESS MODEL
BCDiploma’s solution will be deployed in an ecosystem composed of three types of players: the
diplomas’ issuers (universities, business schools, engineering schools, etc., professional training
companies), the international jobboards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster & Co) and their users
(graduates from around the world and employers).

The business model
Our first clients will be the diplomas’ issuers: universities, schools, professional education
institutions, and institutions delivering attestations such as TOEIC, SAT or graduating MOOCs.
Our main partners will be the jobboards and the players of the recruiting field.
•

Seeing the diploma will be free for all;

•

Our service will be free for the graduate, the employee or the citizen, without any time-limit;

•

For our clients, the unit cost for issuing a degree will be competitive compared to the actual
players, who use “digital safes”;

•

The payment for issuing diplomas will be in tokens BCDT at a constant FIAT price (USD) through
the Smart contract SmartIdentification. BCDiploma develops an “all-included” SaaS service,
allowing the clients to be directly billed in USD or EUR: then, BCD handles the acquisition of the
tokens on behalf of its client;

•

There will be no recurring cost, nor subscribing or conservation costs. In the long run, the
total cost (issuing and conservation) of a degree will be significantly less than that of the actual
players using “digital safes”.

BCDiploma | Business model

17

Strategy
In 2018, we will launch our application and offer it to the education and recruiting market’s leaders,
primarily in Europe. Our goal for the first year is to gain a worldwide legitimacy publishing the
diplomas’ history of the top schools on every continent. An incentive budget that meets all the
above-mentioned issues will support this goal (15% of the tokens’ sale amount).
2019 will see the launch of a massive marketing campaign to conquer the diplomas’ certification
market in Europe, in North America and in the BRICS members. In the meantime, in Europe, we
will take hold of the skills certification, professional certification and professional registers’ market.
In 2020, being a global market player, we will have reached the necessary scale to enter the massive
market of administrative registers.

THE INITIAL TOKEN SALE
An Initial Token Sale (ITS) is an event in which a project related to cryptocurrency sells a part of
its tokens to early adopters and enthusiasts in exchange of financial supports. This process of
crowdfunding is now an acknowledged and standardized mean to obtain funds destined to the
large-scale development of a product or a service, be it an existing service or a in construction
service. The necessary funds to launch our BCDiploma application will be raised through a
Ethereum-based crowdfunding.

The ecosystem of BCDT’s token
BCDiploma’s goal is to become the point of reference for diplomas’ certification. Our challenge
today is to gain schools’ confidence and patronage worldwide, and to expand our services and offer
them to companies and administrations in the near future. These institutions, public or private,
might not have “blockchain” knowledge. In the first place, to convince them, we have to offer a
product fitting their needs perfectly. We also have to be ready to offer a billing system, which is
easy to use and understand and meets their standards. The right way to encourage schools to use
Ethereum on a daily basis is to bill them in USD.
What added value do we propose? The value created by BCD will be measured proportionally to
the volume of on-chain data issued by the institutions.
The key-words of the BCDT tokens ecosystem are: trustless and automation.
The unit cost of issuing a diploma will be measured in BCDT tokens at constant FIAT (USD) prices.
The BCDT / ETH / USD rate will be updated at regular intervals on the smart contract Smart
Identification by a decentralized exchange bot to guarantee the issuer this fixed unit price in Fiat
(USD). To protect the issuer from the variability of the BCDT token, the issuer will “buy”, if he wants
to, a “Number of diplomas to be issued”, thus limiting transactions in BCDT tokens for users of the
eco-system. More precisely:

BCDiploma | The initial token sale

19

•

For each ID Certificate, the smart contract Smart Identification stores a variable “Number of
diplomas to be issued”;

•

At the creation of the certificate by Smart Identification smart contract, this variable is initialized
to 20 (i.e. “20 offered diplomas”), in order to facilitate the adoption of the product;

•

Subsequently, the issuer values ​​the “Number of certificates to be issued” variable of his ID
Certificate by sending BCDT tokens to the smart contract Smart Identification. At the time of
this transaction, the issuer knows the unit price in BCDT tokens of a diploma yet to be issued;

•

In the same operation, the smart contract Smart Identification burns the equivalent of 5% of
BCDT tokens paid for “diplomas to issue”, as a manufacturing fee.
This rate is increased during the first three years of activity to support the token price:
• 25% as long as the set of tokens burnt does not exceed 10% of tokens minted;
• Then 20% as long as the set of tokens burnt does not exceed 20% of tokens minted;
• Then 15% as long as the set of burned tokens does not exceed 50% of tokens minted.
BCD reserves the right to change this rate at a later date if more than 66.6% of tokens minted
have been burned;

•

When issuing a diploma via the smart contract Smart Publication, the “Number of diplomas to
be issued” variable is decreased by one.

The BCDT token is therefore an application token to “reload” the “Number of diplomas to be
issued” of a school. As such, it has every chance of being placed on a large number of exchanges
and not being constrained by the securities legislation.

The Initial Token Sale
During this ITS, the token we offer will be called “BCDT token”. It is compliant with the ERC-20
standard.
Presale will start December 2017. Detailled timing will be available on www.bcdiploma.com.
During the ITS, the Ethereum (ETH) will be the only accepted currency to buy BCDT tokens.
The contribution’s address will be unveiled on www.bcdiploma.com.
BCDT tokens will be available in the investors’ wallet immediately and will be transferable 12 days
after the end of the ITS. The tokens’ distribution will happen exclusively through BCDT token’s
smart contract. Its source will be provided.
If the total amount raised during BCD’s ITS is below the softcap, the investors will get the totality of
their contribution back. These rules will be fully followed by BCDT’s token smart contract.

Application’s development: 35% of the revenues generated by the tokens’ sale ;

•

Marketing and Business development: 30% of the revenues generated by the tokens’ sale ;

•

Incentive campaign: 15% of the revenues generated by the token’s sale.
In 2018, BCD’s goal is to publish, on every continent, the diplomas of the most important schools,
offering them an incentive program up to the task. This program will be the object of a massive
marketing campaign toward:
•

The education field players;

Recruiting field players (LinkedIn, head-hunters, job search tools);

•

Reserve: 10% of the revenues generated by the tokens’ sale will be kept as long-term savings;

•

ITS expense: 5% of the revenues generated by the tokens’ sale will be reserved for ITS advisors
bounties, workers bounties, legal and IT charges refund;

•

General expense: 5% of the revenues generated by the tokens’ sale. BCD is a lean,
cost-effective start-up and will continue to be so in the future.

BCDiploma | Terms and conditions

The sale of tokens under this Commercial
Operation is reserved for experienced
professionals who have an in-depth
understanding of the nature of the
products and services they are purchasing,
a firm grasp of the technologies on which
they are based (in particular blockchain),
and who are fully aware of all the
associated risks as described hereinafter.
The Purchaser is solely liable for determining
which legal, accounting, financial and fiscal
conditions of any nature it is required to
comply with in order to participate in the
Commercial Operation, in accordance with
the laws and regulations applicable in his
country of residence. BCD may not be held
liable for the Purchaser’s filing obligations in

random nature of this ITS and BCD project as
presented in this document and that this project
may not come to fruition or may have to be
abandoned due to technical, legal or regulatory
constraints, without the BCDT tokens being
used.

25

Article 4 – KYC Procedure
and contribution process
4.1 The “Know Your Customer” (KYC) procedure
is instrumental in the prevention against money
laundering and terrorist financing. By obtaining
information on the identity and source of the
funds of Purchasers, BCD would like to protect
itself and protect BCD Platform from being used
to conceal illegally-obtained funds.
This is the reason why Purchasers and their
Ethereum address (“Contribution address”) will
be white-listed through a KYC procedure. This KYC
procedure will be performed through the form
provided on the website www.bcdiploma.com.
Any contribution in this ITS will be accepted
by the ITS Smart Contract if and only the
Purchaser’s Contribution address has been
white- listed.
4.2 For contributions strictly greater than 10
ETH, as part of the KYC procedure (hereinafter
“KYC 1”), the following information and
documents shall be provided by any Purchaser
willing to access to the ITS:
(i) Where the Purchaser is a natural person
(acting within the scope of his professional
activities): Family name, first name, country
and residential address, email address,
nationality, ID card/Passport scan, photo
“selfie” on which appear simultaneously the
face of the contributor and the registered ID
card, address from which the funds will be
disbursed;
(ii) Where the Purchaser is a legal person:
Organization/Company name, headquarters
registered address, scan of business licence,
tax identification number, address from
which the funds will be disbursed and for its
legal representative: Family name, first name,
ID card/Passport scan, photo «selfie» on
which appear simultaneously the face of the
contributor and the registered ID card.

BCDiploma | Terms and conditions

Purchaser shall then:
•

Declare that he is not a Canadian, Singapore
or Chinese citizen, nor a “U.S. person”;

•

Tick the box “I HEREBY CERTIFY THAT I HAVE
READ, UNDERSTOOD AND EXPRESSLY
ACCEPT BCD WHITE PAPER AND ITS TERMS
AND CONDITIONS”;

•

Provide his Contribution address;

•

Provide the indicative amount of his
contribution in ETH.

Each step needs to be followed and complied
with by the Purchaser.
BCD will then proceed with the KYC 1 verification.
Once the Purchaser’s identity has been verified,
his Contribution address will be added to the ITS
White List 1 and BCD will send him a message
for the Purchaser to confirm and finalize his
contribution in the ITS.
4.3 For contributions lower than or equal to 10
ETH, as part of the KYC procedure (hereinafter
“KYC 2”), the following information shall be
provided by any Purchaser willing to access to
the ITS: Family name, first name, email address,
address from which the funds will be disbursed.
Purchaser shall then:
•

Declare that he is not a Canadian, Singapore
or Chinese citizen, nor a «U.S. person»;

•

Tick the box “I HEREBY CERTIFY THAT I HAVE
READ, UNDERSTOOD AND EXPRESSLY
ACCEPT BCD WHITE PAPER AND ITS TERMS
AND CONDITIONS”;

•

Provide his Contribution address;

•

Provide the indicative amount of his
contribution in ETH.

Each step needs to be followed and complied
with by the Purchaser.
BCD will then proceed with the KYC 2
verification. Once the Purchaser’s identity has
been verified, his Contribution address will be
added to the ITS White List 2 and BCD will send
him a message for the Purchaser to confirm
and finalize his contribution in the ITS.

26

4.4 In any case, BCD will NOT accept
“anonymous purchasers” or those using
aliases, fictitious names or false identity in
general.
BCD may request from the Purchaser
additional information and/or documents to
evidence his identity and/or source of funds or
to ensure the accuracy of the details they have
supplied. If the Purchaser refuses to provide
such additional information or documents,
BCD may, at its sole discretion, refuse the
purchaser’s contribution and may not be held
liable for such refusal.
BCD may, at its sole discretion, refuse
purchasers who are (or may be) suspects
of being involved in money laundering, or
any sort of criminal activities, related to drug
trafficking, terrorism and organized crime.
The same applies to potential purchasers
holding businesses that due to the nature
of the business make it impossible to verify
its legitimacy or that of the funds being
inconsistent with their financial status.
4.5 ITS address will be made available to the
public on www.bcdiploma.com. Only Purchasers that passed the KYC procedure as described hereinabove will be technically allowed to
make their contribution.
4.6 Once the Purchaser’s Contribution address
has been white-listed, the Purchaser shall then
provide the final amount of his contribution in
ETH according to the threshold indicated during the KYC procedure (i.e lower than or equal
to 10 ETH or strictly greater than 10 ETH).
•

If the Purchaser is part of the White List 1,
he may make as many contributions as he
wants.

•

If the Purchaser is part of the White List
2, he may make several contributions but
in any case, the cumulated amount of his
contributions will be capped at 10 ETH.

4.7 Failure for the Purchaser to provide the final amount of his contribution in ETH at the
address specified on www.bcdiploma.com,
the Purchaser will not be able to receive BCDT
tokens.

BCDiploma | Terms and conditions

4.8 Purchaser’s contribution in ETH is deemed
to be irrevocably binding upon validation of
the final contribution by the Smart Contract.
As from this date, a contribution may no longer be cancelled or amended. Purchasers will
then receive BCDT tokens.
4.9 BCDT tokens will be made available in
the Purchaser’s wallet immediately after the
contribution and will be transferable twelve
(12) days after the end of the ITS.
4.10 BCDT period of validity, during which they
can be used, is not time-dependent. Tokens cannot be deleted due both to their strictly decentralized nature and to the fact that, once issued,
they are no longer under BCDiploma’s control.
They would, in any case, remain the property of
their owner.
4.11 In any event during the KYC procedure and
contribution process, the Purchaser shall notify
in writing BCD concerning any information likely
to impact on its contribution directly or indirectly
(contactus@blockchaincertifieddata.com). Failure
to do this, BCD may not be held liable in any way
in this regard.

Article 5 – BCDT Tokens
The Commercial Operation involves the sale of
virtual tokens, referred to as “BCDT Tokens”
or “BCDT”).
5.1 Tokens Role and Attributes
BCDT tokens will provide their owners with
access rights to use the BCD Platform (and its
service), once it has been designed, developed
and deployed and provided that BCD Platform
operates on a permanent basis.
The Purchasers’ attention is therefore drawn
to the fact that purchasing tokens during the
Commercial Operation does not confer automatic rights to access to BCD Platform and
service in the future. BCDT tokens may not be
used before the effective implementation of
BCD Platform.

27

UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED HEREIN,
BCDT TOKENS WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED
IN THE EVENT THAT THE BCD PLATFORM
IS NOT ULTIMATELY DEVELOPED, OR DOES
NOT OPERATE ON A PERMANENT BASIS.
BCDT OWNERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS
A SIGNIFICANT RISK THAT THEY ACCEPT.
The Purchaser acknowledges that he is fully
aware that:
•

a BCDT does not represent an investment
or a financial instrument within the
meaning of EU Directive 2014/65/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council of
15 May 2014 relating to markets in financial
instruments: a BCDT token confer no direct
or indirect right to BCD’s capital or income,
nor does it confer any governance right
within BCD;

•

a BCDT is not proof of ownership or a
right of control: Control over a BCDT does
not grant the individuals any asset or share
in BCD, or in the BCD Platform. A BCDT does
not grant any right to participate in control
over BCD’s management or decisionmaking set-up, or over the BCD Platform;

•

•

•

a BCDT is not an electronic currency within
the meaning of EU Directive 2009/110/EC of
the European Parliament and of the Council of
16 September 2009 on the taking up, pursuit
and prudential supervision of the business of
electronic money institutions: BCDT tokens
are not accepted (and have no use) outside
the BCD Platform and a BCDT does not have
a fixed exchange value equal to the amount
delivered at the time of its issue;
a BCDT is not a payment service within
the meaning of EU Directive (2007/64/EC)
of 13 November 2007 relating to payment
services in the internal market, nor within
the meaning of the (EU) Directive relating
to payment services 2 (DSP 2) n° 2015/2366
of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 25 November 2015: the ITS
does not involve the purchase/sale of
cryptocurrencies and BCD’s business does
not consist in receiving currencies against
the delivery of cryptocurrencies;
a BCDT is a cryptographic token used by
the BCD Platform to issue diplomas.
BCDiploma | Terms and conditions

5.2 BCDT token issuance and distribution
ITS timeline and instructions are posted
on the Commercial Operation website at
www.bcdiploma.com.
BCDT tokens will be issued by a technical
process referred to as “blockchain”. This is an
open source IT protocol over which BCD has
no proprietary rights or liability in terms of
development and operation.
The token distribution mechanism will be
controlled by a Smart Contract. This involves
a computer program that can be executed
on the Ethereum network or on a blockchain
network that is compatible with Smart Contract
programming language. The tokens will meet
the ‘ERC20’ standard (https://theethereum.
wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard),
and will be subject, inter alia, to the operating
conditions of the Internet computer network
and the Ethereum blockchain protocol.
BCD has no control, right or liability over the
operation of the Internet computer network
and the Ethereum network and protocol.
The ITS will end if and when all the BCDT tokens
are sold or after the second round is over. If, at
the end of the ITS, the minimum sale revenues
as indicated in the White Paper has not been
reached, the totality of the funds raised will be
refunded to the Purchasers (provided that the
contributions process has been completed as
per the procedure explained hereinafter).
If, at the end of the ITS, the minimum sales
revenues has been reached, then the tokens
will be issued by the Smart Contract pursuant
to Article 4 and distributed according to the
proportions described in the White Paper.
BCD may not be held liable in any way for any
feature that might affect the token distribution
or ownership of the tokens sold, or that might
hamper the Purchaser’s ability to use the
tokens, including display of the tokens in an
electronic wallet compatible with the ERC20
token standard, or the assignment of these
tokens to a third party.
The acquisition of tokens by transferring tokens
or crypto-currencies to the Smart Contract
comes under the Purchaser’s sole liability and
will be subject to the terms and conditions
of the protocol and the Ethereum network.
28

As BCDT tokens are issued under a Smart
Contract, BCD is not obliged to reimburse or
compensate in any way any Purchaser whose
BCDT tokens have not been issued by the
Smart Contract for any reason.

In particular, the Purchaser agrees not to
modify, interfere with, deactivate or saturate,
nor to breach the security of or impair data
integrity and confidentiality in relation to any
service offered by BCD.

Once issued, the tokens may be assigned or
transferred to third parties by the Purchaser,
in whole or in part, at their sole discretion, in
return for payment or free of charge. However,
the Purchaser shall be solely and fully liable for
the conditions and consequences of such an
assignment or transfer of the tokens in their
possession. In particular, given that BCD will
have no control over such transactions, the
Purchaser may not claim against BCD for any
loss of their tokens due to any error of any
kind that may occur during the transfer.

Purchaser shall not obtain or use BCDT for
any illegal purposes wherever in the world,
in particular for money laundering and/or
terrorism.

The BCD cofounders warrant that they will not
purchase BCDT in their own ITS or from any
third party, or acquire BCDT in any manner,
during the period of the ITS.

Article 6 – Limitations of Use
Prior to any contribution, the Purchaser
acknowledges and accepts that BCDT tokens
do not, under any circumstance, represent
any form of investment or financial
investment and agrees not to attempt to
divert the tokens function for speculative
purposes.
The Purchaser acquires BCDT tokens primarily to
support the development, testing, deployment
and operation of BCD project, being aware of
all the risks associated with this project and
Commercial operation as set forth hereinafter.
The Purchaser also agrees not to use the
Commercial Operation website, BCD Platform,
the issued tokens and, more generally, any
content or service provided to the Purchaser by
BCD that does not comply with the objectives
and methods set out in the White Paper and/
or in these Terms. Under no circumstances may
BCDT token be used for other services than
those offered by BCD Platform. BCD is solely
responsible for deciding whether to provide the
service to token owners, within the technical,
legal, economic or other constraints imposed by
third parties or by BCD itself on its operations.

BCDiploma | Terms and conditions

Article 7 – Cancellation - Refund policy
ALL PURCHASES OF BCDT TOKEN COMPLETED
PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 4 OF THESE TERMS ARE
FINAL. PURCHASES OF BCDT TOKEN ARE NONREFUNDABLE. BY PURCHASING BCDT TOKEN,
THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
NEITHER BCD PLATFORM NOR ANY OTHER OF
THE BCD TEAM & PARTIES ARE REQUIRED TO
PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND
THAT THE PURCHASER WILL NOT RECEIVE
MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR ANY
BCD THAT IS NOT USED OR REMAINS UNUSED.
Besides, as the tokens offered for
deemed intangible property, having
or functionality other than the BCD
service, no guarantee is attached
following issuance.

No final contribution confirmed on the BCD
website may be subsequently canceled or
refunded.
The Purchasers acknowledge that they are fully
aware that they will not be entitled to claim
any full or partial reimbursement under any
circumstances whatsoever.

Article 8 – Risks inherent to bcd ITS
The Purchaser understands that BCDT tokens,
blockchain technology, Ethereum protocol,
Ether and other associated and related
technologies are new and untested and outside
of BCD‘s exclusive control and adverse changes
in the technology, broadly construed, will
excuse BCD‘s performance under these Terms.
Risks inherent to BCD Project and Commercial
Operation may be various. As mentioned

29

hereinabove, the Purchaser acknowledges that
he has been warned of the following risks, that
he understands and accepts purchasing BCDT
in consideration of these risks (which are not
exhaustive).
7.1 Legal risk or risk of adverse regulatory
intervention in one or more jurisdictions
around the world
Blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and
projects financing through cryptocurrencies
have been the subject of close scrutiny by
various regulatory bodies around the world,
including within the European Union and
France. The Commercial Operation has been
structured to comply with EU law applicable at
the time of the ITS.
Operation of BCD Platform and BCDT tokens
may be impacted by the promulgation of
restrictive laws, the publication of restrictive or
negative opinions, the issuing of injunctions by
national regulators, the initiation of regulatory
actions or investigations, including but not
limited to restrictions on the use or ownership
of digital/cryptographic tokens such as BCDT,
which may prevent or limit the development
of BCD and its activities. This uncertainty
significantly adds up to risks connected with the
acquisition and use of BCDTs.
Given
the
lack
of
crypto-currency
qualifications in most countries, each
Purchaser is strongly advised to carry out
a legal and tax analysis concerning the
purchase and ownership of BCDT tokens
according to their nationality and place of
residence.
7.2 Risks associated with the ITS
documentation
The White Paper is the only documentation
that introduces BCD Commercial Operation
and exposes BCD project. Such documentation
does not comply with any legal requirement
as there is no regulation at the time of the
ITS. The Purchaser acknowledges and accepts
that the White Paper may potentially contain
inaccuracies, errors or omissions and express
BCD’s opinions and forecasts.

BCDiploma | Terms and conditions

The ITS documentation has not been subject
to prior approval from any regulatory bodies
such as L’Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF) in
France.
7.3 Risks associated with the Ethereum
protocol
Both BCDT tokens and the BCD Platform are
based on the Ethereum protocol. Therefore, any
malfunction, unplanned function or unexpected
operation of the Ethereum protocol may cause
the BCD Platform or BCDT to malfunction
or operate in an unexpected or unintended
manner.
Besides, the Purchaser understands and
accepts that an upgrade or split of the Ethereum
protocol may occur in the future (hard-fork) and
that BCD has no control over it. The Purchaser
may no longer be able to use his BCDT and/
or his BCDT may lose their functionality in full.
Ether, the native Ethereum Protocol account
unit may itself lose value in a similar way to
BCDT.
For more information on the Ethereum
protocol, please visit the Ethereum website:
www.ethereum.org.
7.4 Risk of a lack of interest in the BCD
Platform or distributed applications
There is a possibility that the BCD Platform may
not be used by a large number of companies,
individuals and other organizations, and
that there may be limited public interest in
the creation and development of distributed
applications. Such a lack of interest could
have an impact on the development of the
BCD Platform and, therefore, on the uses or
potential value of BCDT tokens.
7.5 Risk of loss of BCDT due to loss of
credentials
The Purchaser can only access the BCD account
using the credentials selected by the Purchaser.
The Purchaser understands that if his
credentials (and in particular his private key) are
lost or stolen, BCDT associated with his account
will be unrecoverable and permanently lost. It is
thus recommended to Purchasers to store their

30

credentials securely in one or more backup
locations that are geographically separated
from the work location and not to share his
credentials with anybody. There is no recovery
mechanism for lost keys, so BCD will not be able
to help the Purchaser retrieve or reconstruct a
private key and/or provide the Purchaser with
access to any lost BCDT.

7.10 Risk of an uninsured loss
Unlike bank accounts or accounts in other
regulated financial institutions, funds held
through BCD Platform or Ethereum network
are generally uninsured. At present, there are
no public or private insurance agents providing
Purchasers with coverage against a loss of BCDT
or a loss of value.

7.6 Non-release, software and technical risks
Some BCD platform features are currently
under development. As a consequence, the
Purchaser accepts that the development may
not succeed, that BCD Platform may never be
released and operational, even though BCD
makes reasonable efforts to complete such
platform, that the Platform may be subject to
software and/or technical risks, or that features
may never be installed on the Platform.

7.11 Internet transmission risks
The Purchaser acknowledges that there are
risks associated with using BCD Platform or
BCDT tokens including, but not limited to, the
failure of hardware, software, and Internet
connections. The Purchaser acknowledges
and accepts that BCD shall not be responsible
for any communication failures, disruptions,
errors, distortions or delays the Purchaser may
experience when using the BCD website or ITS
website and tokens, howsoever caused.

7.7 Risk that the BCD Platform, as developed,
does not meet Purchaser expectations
The BCD Platform is currently under
development and may undergo significant
changes prior to its launch (for technical,
financial, commercial, marketing, legal or
regulatory reasons). As such, Purchaser
expectations concerning the BCD Platform or
BCDT token may be met on the launch date.
7.8 Risks of theft and hacking
Hackers or criminal groups or organizations
may attempt to interfere with the BCD Platform
or the availability of BCDT tokens in several
ways including, but not limited to, denial of
service attacks, smurfing, Sybil attacks, malware
attacks or consensus-based attacks.
Besides, the BCD Platform is based on open
source software. There is a risk that third parties,
may intentionally or unintentionally introduce
weaknesses or bugs into the BCD Platform, by
interfering with the use of or causing loss of
BCDT.
7.9 Risk of capital loss
Capital invested in BCD ITS is not guaranteed.
Investing in tokens entails a significant capital
risk, which the Purchaser acknowledges and
accepts.

BCDiploma | Terms and conditions

Article 13 – Protection of personal
data
Pursuant to the EU Data Protection Directive
(95/46/EC) and the subsequent General Data
Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that will
apply from 25 May 2018, BCD shall implement
appropriate measures to prevent the
unauthorised use or disclosure of any personal
data made available to and processed by BCD
in connection with BCD Platform and the ITS
(“Covered Data”).
To this end, BCD has implemented and
maintained physical and technical measures
that reasonably and appropriately protect the
confidentiality, integrity, security and availability
of the Purchaser Covered Data.
Only the minimum and necessary amount
of personal data of the Purchaser is collected
by BCD at the time of the KYC procedure to
complete the ITS and to comply with the best
practices recommended by the regulatory
bodies. Besides, only those personnel of BCD
that have been duly authorized will access the
Covered Data and such access is strictly limited
to ensure the operational process of the ITS
and/or the security of the Covered Data.
Personal data collected from the Purchaser on
the forms available on the website are intended
for BCD personnel for administrative and
business management purposes. These data
are processed (i) to allow Purchasers to access
the ITS and use BCD Platform, and (ii) to enable
BCD to prospect for new users. Data marked
with an asterisk are mandatory. Failure to
provide such data may prevent the Purchaser
from participating in the ITS and using the
service.
By participating in the ITS and using BCD
Platform, the Purchaser agrees and authorises
BCD to share, if and when necessary the Covered
data with any trusted third party (which may be
located in a non-EU jurisdiction but providing
an equivalent level of protection across the
European Union) for the sole purposes of the
provision of the service. Besides, the Purchaser
acknowledges that BCD may be required to
provide the Covered Data to any regulatory
bodies or administrative authorities if required
by law.
33

BCD will maintain Purchaser’s Covered data
only for as long as is it is necessary, or as
required by law.
The Purchaser is entitled to object to the
processing of his personal data for legitimate
reasons, as well as to object to the use of such
data for the purposes of prospecting activities.
Pursuant to the General Data Protection
Regulation, the Purchaser shall be entitled
to request access to, rectification, erasure
of his own personal data, or restriction of
processing concerning the Purchaser or to
object to processing as well as the right to
data portability. However, given the nature of
the blockchain technology used, the Purchaser
may not be able to exercise all of these rights.
However, as far as technically possible, BCD
will enable the Purchaser to exercise his
rights. To do so, the Purchaser shall notify in
writing his request to BCD, with a copy of its
signed ID document to the following address:
contactus@blockchaincertifieddata.com

Article 14 – Legislative and/or
Regulatory Developments
The Purchaser acknowledges and accepts that
BCD Commercial Operation is taking place
within a French legal environment that is still
under development. New laws or rules may
subsequently frame, modify or clarify the
practice of such operations. Where necessary or
applicable, should legislative and/or regulatory
changes conflict with all or part of these terms
and conditions, BCD reserves the right to
amend the terms of the Commercial Operation
as appropriate, retroactively if necessary, in
order to ensure that the operation remains
legal and compliant with the various laws and
regulations or best practices that may be issued
by the French regulatory bodies.

Article 15 – Force majeure
Force majeure is deemed any event beyond
the parties’ control, which they cannot
reasonably foresee or reasonably avoid or
overcome, provided that its occurrence makes
it impossible for the parties to fulfill their
BCDiploma | Terms and conditions

obligations, and adversely affects purchase
execution (e.g. earthquake, storm or other
element of nature, embargoes, substantial
change in the price of resources, electrical
telecommunications, hardware, software or
other utility failures, armed conflicts, labor
disputes or other industrial disturbances,
changes in laws or regulations, changes in
blockchain technology (broadly construed),
changes in the Ethereum protocol or any other
blockchain protocols, etc.). The most diligent
Party shall promptly notify the other Party by
any means, and the Parties will then agree to
negotiate in good faith any changes required to
ensure the continuity of contract obligations. If,
however, such impossibility exceeds three (3)
months, the most diligent Party may terminate
the contract in writing without incurring its
liability and without entitling the other party
to claim any right of compensation, with BCD
retaining previously collected amounts, which
are irrevocably acquired.

Article 16 – Miscellaneous
If any clause of these Terms is deemed
to be invalid, illegal, deemed unwritten
or unenforceable, all other clauses shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect.
The failure or omission by BCD to enforce any
clause of these Terms will not constitute a
present or future waiver of such clause nor limit
BCD right to enforce such clause at a later time.

Article 17 – Language and Jurisdiction
These Terms are governed exclusively by French
law. Translations of the terms and conditions
herein, made available to the Purchaser, are
purely informative and are not legally binding.
The French version of these Terms has sole
legal force.
The Parties agree to seek an amicable settlement
prior to bringing any legal action. Failing this, any
dispute, of any nature whatsoever regarding
the Commercial Operation, will be brought
expressly before the court with jurisdiction over
BCD’s registered headquarter.
