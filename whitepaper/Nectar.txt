Introduction

The Nectar Token (NEC) was designed
in 2017 and launched at the start of 2018
with the aim of incentivising liquidity on
markets traded on the Ethfinex digitalasset exchange platform. Ethfinex's
initial vision was to decentralise its
platform along two streams in parallel:
Technology and Governance.
The Nectar Token was the instrument
for incentivising and enabling this
transitional evolution. This document
lays out the launch vision for Nectar
2.0, with a series of fundamental
design improvements enabling Nectar
to successfully deliver its goals.
