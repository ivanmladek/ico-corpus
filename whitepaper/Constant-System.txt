ABSTRACT
The Constant System is a decentralized global financial infrastructure that enables a new set of
financial applications for consumers and businesses. At the heart of the Constant System,
there is a decentralized, borderless, stable currency, called Constant.
Constant is a cryptocurrency with 3 defining, differentiating characteristics that make it the
ideal stablecoin. It is (1) a stable unit of account, (2) a secure store of value and (3) an efficient
medium of exchange.
Constant is not minted out of thin air; it is always backed by valuable assets. The first release
of Constant is backed by the US dollar only, combining ​the creditworthiness and price stability
of the US Dollar with the technological advantages of decentralized ledger technology
(blockchain technology). By maintaining a strict 1:1 peg, Constant is 100% backed by its
equivalent in USD, held in a fully audited Trust Vault, managed by an independent Trust
Company.
In subsequent releases, Constant will be backed by a broad variety of assets, including fiats
like the US dollar and Euro, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, or tokenized assets
like real estate and gold.
Different from other cryptocurrencies, Constant is designed for useability and real world
practicality. Constant is an upgraded money, a practical alternative that bypasses the
limitations of fiat currency, built to integrate seamlessly into daily use. In this white paper, we
outline the Constant System and its monetary policy, and also describe the first of many
practical use cases and applications of Constant.

PART I
STABLECOIN OVERVIEW

1. Introduction
The total addressable market of money is about ​90 trillion dollars​. From its first use in the Tang
Dynasty (A.D. 618-907), we’ve had more than a thousand years of practice holding and using
paper currency. Its limitations are keenly felt, now more than ever. With the advent of
cryptocurrency - borderless, frictionless, and decentralized - the world is beginning to think
more broadly about how money should, and can, behave.
Bitcoin is a powerful cryptocurrency that fails to be the everyday money. ​Due to its volatility,
you wouldn’t use Bitcoin, or any coin, to buy a cup of coffee or shop online. No one would
accept salaries or invoices in Bitcoin, so businesses don’t. As for financial services - offering a
loan or taking a deposit in an unstable coin is a gamble that few will take. As money, Bitcoin is
unusable.

Bitcoin fluctuated between $3,000 and $20,000 from July 2017 to Nov 2018
The stability of Constant enables these use cases at scale. Like Bitcoin, it is a decentralized
cryptocurrency; nobody owns or controls the Constant System. Unlike Bitcoin, however,
Constant is stable, so you can spend it on everyday things. People all around the world
continue to choose the US dollar for the benefits of price stability and creditworthiness, but
especially in emerging markets, it nervously sits under mattresses or in precarious bank
accounts. Constant is a digital upgrade of the US dollar that retains the benefits of the world
reserve currency, in addition to total freedom.
Constant is a cryptocurrency that embodies the ​three integral characteristics of usable money:
stable unit of account, efficient medium of exchange and secure store of value.

Stable unit of account
At its very core, Constant is built to maintain a 1:1 peg to the US dollar. The value of goods
and services are easily measured in terms of Constant, which holds its value as the USD does,
and is additionally designed to be easily converted at any time.

Reliable store of value
As far as savings go, Constant provides a viable refuge for multiple volatile economies. It
affords the price stability of the USD with the accessibility of a borderless digital currency.
Unlike many other digital currencies however, Constant straddles both worlds, and easily
converts back to fiat. Each Constant is backed by 1 US dollar, held in a Trust Vault with a
strict 100% collateralization.

Efficient medium of exchange
In addition to price stability and the practicalities that affords in any exchange of goods and
services, Constant also reduces the friction, distance, expense and inefficiency of every
transaction, made by anyone - to anyone - anywhere in the world.

2. Related work in economics
Constant is extensively influenced by both prior and current literature of monetary economics.
There has been a lot of work discussing the practicalities of feasibilities of a stable currency
(Jevons 1875, Marshall 1877, Wicksell 1898, Fisher 1913, Hayek 1978, Bordo 1984, Black
1987, Cagan 1987, Dorn 1987, Patinkin 1993, Dorn 2017).

The freedom of money
The Constant System is designed to unshackle money. Constant currency holders control the
System, independent of any governing body. The concept of monies free from governmental
control was first proposed in “The Denationalization of Money” (Hayek 1976). Hayek proposed
that market forces should dictate the issuance of money, not static government policy. At the
time, it was an arresting but impractical idea. 42 years later however, technological leaps have
given us the perfect infrastructure to bring Hayek’s idea to fruition - a government-independent
blockchain, like Bitcoin and Constant, with its own native currency.

The early years of central banking
Constant offers efficiency gains, cost reductions and financial empowerment, simply by
replacing middlemen banks with peer to peer technology. In the early years of central banking,
individuals and businesses held accounts with the Bank of England and the Sveriges Riksbank.
It was not practical during this era of paper bookkeeping to manually maintain a large number
of private accounts. As the number grew, the system buckled and had to be discontinued. So
people started to open accounts at separate commercial banks, which leads us to today:
trillions of dollars trickle sluggishly within arbitrary geographical boundaries, waiting for multiple
middlemen to take their cut before reaching their intended destination - sometimes more than
a week later.
With distributed ledger technology, it is fairly simple for anyone to open an account on the
blockchain and instantly send money across the world, bypassing commercial banks,
antiquated payment structures, markups and inflated fees. The bookkeeping process has
come a long way since paper, upgraded with military-grade cryptography and consensus
algorithms. Transactions, balances and records are now transparent, verifiable and accessible
from anywhere in the world. Money on the blockchain makes the world go round faster.

A systematic and transparent monetary policy
Monetary economists have reached a consensus that the conduct of monetary policy should
be systematic and transparent.
“The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to
the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates
well-informed decision-making by households and businesses,
reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the
effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and
accountability,”
The Federal Open Market Committee (2012)
The Constant System is systematic; everything runs exactly as programmed via smart
contracts, without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.
The Constant System is transparent: it is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or
controls the Constant System and anyone can own part of it.

A good normal anchor
Almost all central banks have chosen ​inflation targeting​ as their nominal anchor. However,
these inflation targets are not objectively or reliably fixed at specific values. The target can be
warped by a whole host of external factors such as desired election outcomes, undermining
the credibility of the central bank’s nominal anchor.
Replacing inflation targeting with ​price-level targeting​ has been proposed by various
economists. Price-level target is a specific numerical objective; that is, it is a natural focal point
for household and business expectation, and serves as a credible nominal anchor.
By design, Constant is 100% backed. For the first release, Constant is backed by the US
dollar, the world reserve currency. As the system develops over time, Constant will be backed
by a broad variety of assets, including fiats like the US dollar and Euro, cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin and Ethereum, or tokenized assets like real estate and gold. ​The price-level target
could be specified in terms of a ​crypto asset index​, constructed from the publicly listed prices
of crypto assets on various exchanges, fed by oracles. This method facilitates full
transparency, and can be reproduced and verified by anyone, at any time.

3. Related work in cryptocurrency
There are 3 existing approaches to creating price stability for cryptocurrency: fiat collateralized,
crypto collateralized, zero collateralized. The first release of Constant will be fiat collateralized,
chosen for its unwavering stability.

Fiat collateralized
Fiat-collateralized stablecoins work like this: Alice sends 100 USD as collateral to Stablecoin
Company and receives 100 stablecoin in return. This solution is simple for consumers to
understand and easy for Stablecoin Company to build and execute. In terms of price stability,
it’s absolutely 100% stable.
Companies: ​Tether​ (USDT), ​TrueUSD​ (TUSD)

Crypto collateralized
A crypto-collateralized stablecoin works similarly to fiat-collateralized, but instead of using
fiats, it uses other cryptocurrencies as collaterals. The problem is that cryptocurrencies are
volatile. A crypto-collateralized stablecoin solves this by over-collateralizing.
For example: Alice sends 1 ETH (about $100 value as of December 21, 2018) as collateral to
Stablecoin Company and receives 50 stablecoins (about $50 value) in return.
This comes with some limitations. First, it cannot be as stable as a fiat collateralized stable
coin. Second, what if the value of the collateral, ETH, goes below $50? Third, it’s a very
inefficient use of capital. Why would you want to lock up 1 ETH and only get out half of its
value?
Companies: ​MakerDAO​ (DAI)

Algorithmic
This system was first proposed by Robert Sams as ​Seigniorage Shares​. The idea was to build
an algorithmic central bank which issues and maintains the coin value at $1. This would mimic
and replace the real world central banks responsible for the monetary policies of a nation (e.g.
Bank of England) or a group of nations (e.g. European Central Bank).
Assume the coin value is $1.20 on the market due to fluctuating demand. The algorithm issues
more coins until its value goes down to $1.00, based on ​Quantity Theory of Money​. The newly
minted coins are then auctioned on the open market, bringing in some extra profits, called
seigniorage profits​.
What if the coin value falls below $1, say $0.5? The algorithm cannot just recall the coins to
reduce supply. A solution, as proposed by Robert Sams, is to issue ​seigniorage shares ​that
people can buy. When new coins are minted, seigniorage profits will be split among the
owners of the seigniorage shares. If the algorithm is a company, think of seigniorage shares as
the ownership shares of that company, and owners of those shares as shareholders of the
algorithm.
While this solution is elegant, a major drawback is that these seigniorage shares represent the
future growth of the system. What if it never grows? Or keeps going downhill?
Companies: ​Basis​, ​Carbon

No silver bullet
Modern monetary policy is the result of thousands of years of economic evolution. When it
comes to recreating monetary policy for cryptocurrency, there’s no silver bullet or deus ex
machina.

Constant is committed to developing a secure, stable system that integrates the strong points
of all three models.
Initially, the Constant System will launch with a fiat-collateral solution. Meanwhile, the
Constant R&D team continues to work on both crypto-collateral and algorithmic components
for the long-term realization of the Constant System. Our hope is to incorporate these
components into the future, optimal version of Constant.

PART II
THE TOKENS OF
THE CONSTANT SYSTEM

4. Overview of the tokens
The Constant System implements a multi-token approach. Each token is designed to serve
one of the following purposes: utility, governance, infrastructure, and collaterals.
●

The Constant Stablecoin (CONST): a ​utility token​ that is 1:1 pegged to the US dollar
and designed to be used in everyday transactions.

●

The Monetary Policy Token (MPT): a ​governance token​ that is required to conduct
monetary policy of the Constant System.

●

Ether (ETH): an ​infrastructure token​ that is used to pay for smart contract gas fees on
the Ethereum network.

●

The Trust Vault tokens: ​collateral tokens​ that are held in the Trust Vault in order to
back the value of the Constant stablecoin.

5. Utility Token: The Constant Stablecoin
(CONST)
The Constant Stablecoin (for short, just Constant) is the main utility token of the Constant
System. It is designed to be a utility token for everyday transactions. Constant can be held
and spent in the same the way we use the US dollar in everyday life, with a few new powerful
features: ​borderless, frictionless, and decentralized.

100% backed
Every Constant is backed by 1 US dollar, held in a secure, audited escrow account managed
by an independent trust company.

1:1 pegged to the US dollar
Constant is pegged 1:1 to the most stable, most usable currency in the world. One Constant
always equals one US dollar, and is easily switched for USD at any time.

Mining policy
One new Constant is minted when there is one new US dollar deposited into the Trust Vault.

Burning policy
One existing Constant is burned when there is one existing US dollar withdrew from the Trust
Vault.

Monetary supply policy
There is no limit in monetary supply for Constant.

Units
For simplicity, there are only two denominations in Constant.
Name

Value

Constant

≅ 1 US dollar

Nano

≅ 1 US cent or 1/100 Constant

Implementation
For practical purposes, Constant is implemented as an Ethereum ERC20 token, which has
been widely adopted by millions of users around the world. The existing infrastructure,
userbase and development community is strong and growing steadily; there are exchanges,
wallets and software that support ERC20 compliant tokens.

6. Governance Token: The Monetary Policy
Token (MPT)
MPT holders basically form a committee that performs the function of the central bank of the
Constant System. It conducts the Constant System monetary policy to achieve two objectives
(1) stable prices and (2) maximum meaningful adoption of Constant in everyday life.

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization

The Constant System purposely rejected the concept of a centralized system such as a central
bank. Instead, the Constant System is designed as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization
(Jentzsch 2016) with three distinct features.
●
●
●

a cryptonomic central bank governance token, called MPT
a delegated Board of Governors, elected by MPT holders
a decentralized decision making process, voted by MPT governors

We believe that having a dedicated Board of Governors, who is elected to conduct monetary
policy, is a more optimal setup than waiting for every single user in the entire system to cast
their vote on day-to-day proposal.

MPT relationships

MPT holders
Responsibilities
MPT holders elect the Board of Governors and delegate their voting power to the board. For
example, Alice can delegate her voting power to Bob, a well-know monetary economist in the
network.
Incentives
After accounting for all operational expenses (i.e. paying the Ethereum network for gas fees
and paying the trust company for maintaining the Trust Vault), any amount of Constant left in
the Constant System will be used to the benefit of the network. Some of the surplus will be
used to payout dividends to MPT holders.
MPT holders will receive an amount of Constant proportional to MPT tokens they hold, relative
to the total number of MPT tokens in the Constant System.

initially: R = 10%
dividend paid to user ​I

The dividend paid to user ​I​is calculated as follows:
P​
I​ = P x R x (MPT​
I​ / MPT)

MPT governors
Responsibilities
MPT governors play an important role in the governance of the Constant System monetary
policy. They submit new proposals to improve the monetary policy and vote on proposals
proposed by other MPT governors.
For example, there is an outstanding proposal to increase the redeem fee from 0.5% to 0.7%.
All MPT governors can cast their vote on the proposal. If the proposal meets the minimum
quorum and pasts majority margin, then the new redeem fee will be implemented.
The initial voting parameters are:
●

Purchase Fee:​ The purchase fee is a fee paid by every purchase of Constant. The
initial purchase fee is 0.0%.

●

Redeem Fee: ​The redeem fee is a fee paid by every redemption of Constant. The
initial redemption fee is 0.5%.

●

Transfer Free: ​The transfer fee is a fee paid by every transfer of Constant. The initial
redemption fee is 0.0%.

●

Collateral Asset: ​Constant will be backed by a broad variety of assets, including fiats
like the US dollar and Euro, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, or tokenized
assets like real estate and gold.

As the system evolves, new parameters will be added over time and some of the existing
parameters may be removed as they become obsolete.
Incentives
After accounting for all operational expenses (i.e. paying the Ethereum network for gas fees
and paying the trust company for maintaining the Trust Vault), any amount of Constant left in
the Constant System will be used to the benefit of the network. Some of the surplus will be
used to payout dividends to MPT governors.
MPT holders will receive an amount of Constant proportional to MPT tokens they hold, relative
to the total number of MPT tokens in the Constant System.

dividend paid to MPT governor ​I

The dividend paid to MPT governor ​I​is calculated as follows:
DP​
I​ = P x DR x (DMPT​
I​ / DMPT)

Mining policy
Users of the system who want to contribute to monetary decisions can buy MPT with Constant
and acquire the power to elect the Board of Governors. The Constant collected from the sale
will be stored in the Reserve Vault.
The decision of issuing new MPT is proposed and voted by every member of the Board of
Governors whenever they see the need of raising the Reserve Vault. Reserve Vault holds all
the Constant raised from the sales of MPT. Unlike a physical central bank vault, which is
usually 50 feet below the water and protected with an army, Reserve Vault is decentralized on
various blockchains and protected by cryptographic algorithms.
Every proposal to issue new MPT contains:
M
D
E
P​MPT
CONST​I

the target amount of Constant to raise
the discount rate
the deadline of the sale
the market price of MPT (fed through Oracles)
the amount of Constant that user ​I​pays with

If the proposal is approved by the Board of Governors, users have the chance to buy MPT
directly from the Constant System at a discounted rate D compares to open market price. The
sell is on the basis of first come, first served and ends either after the deadline or because M​ is
​
reached.
The number of MPT user​ I ​
received will be:
MPT​I​= CONST​I​/ (P​MPT​ x D)

Burning policy
MPT is not burnable.

Monetary supply policy
There is no limit in monetary supply for Constant.

Units
MPT is the single denomination of MPT.

Implementation
For practical purposes, MPT is also implemented as an Ethereum ERC20 token.

7. Infrastructure Token: Ether (ETH)
For practical purposes, the initial release of the Constant System is implemented on top of the
Ethereum network. Ethereum has been widely adopted by millions of users around the world.
The existing infrastructure, userbase and development community is strong and growing
steadily; there are exchanges, wallets and software that support ERC20 compliant tokens.
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as
programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.
The Constant System is implemented as a set of Ethereum smart contracts. Everytime a smart
contract executes one of its functions, there is a gas fee, required by the Ethereum network to
be paid to its miners.

8. Collateral Tokens: Trust Vault Assets
By design, Constant is 100% backed. The first release of Constant, as outlined in this paper, is
backed by the US dollar only. In subsequent releases, Constant will be backed by a broad
variety of assets, including fiats like the US dollar and Euro, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and
Ethereum, or tokenized assets like real estate and gold.
MPT holders can vote on adding, modifying, or removing an asset.

PART III
THE CONSTANT SYSTEM:
THREE KEY ENTITIES AND
FIVE CORE FUNCTIONS

9. Overview of the Constant System
A hybrid approach
We, like the rest of the world, like the stability of the US dollar. The US dollar is backed by the
battle-tested design of the Federal Reserve System, which was founded in 1913 as the central
bank of the United States, and has established the US dollar as the most stable currency in the
world.
We also like the innovation of decentralized ledger technologies (blockchain) from the field of
computer science. Pioneered by Satoshi Nakamoto (Nakamoto 2009), blockchains are
decentralized digital currency systems without central authorities such as banks. Transaction
management and currency issuance are instead carried out collectively by the users of those
networks. The Constant System runs on top of the Ethereum network (Vitalik 2013).
Constant is a hybrid. ​The first release of the Constant System ​combines the creditworthiness
and price stability of the US Dollar with the technological advantages of Decentralized Ledger
Technologies (blockchain). An audited, independent Trust Vault is integrated into the system
to ensure security and stability, strictly maintaining a 1:1 peg between Constant and the US
dollar.

The Constant System: 3 key entities and 5 key functions

The Constant System has 3 key entities:
●

The Decentralized Payment Network: ​ A peer-to-peer decentralized payment network
that operates without central authority or banks. Processing and managing
transactions are carried out collectively by the users of the network.

●

The Constant Foundation:​ The founding team that makes initial decisions with regard
to the building and running of the Constant System. This system is designed to
become increasingly decentralized over time, so that decision-making powers will
ultimately belong to the community at large.

●

The Trust Vault:​ An escrow account that holds one US dollar for every Constant in
circulation. The Trust Vault holding the USD is secured by an independent custodian, a
chartered, regulated financial institution.

The Constant System performs 5 key functions in the user’s interest to ensure the stability of
the stablecoin, and work towards both growth and adoption.
●

Conducting​ Constant’s monetary policy to ensure stable prices in both global and local
markets.

●

Handling​ payments and settlements safely and efficiently through blockchain
technologies, reducing expense and bypassing typical wait times and geographical
borders.

●

Maintaining​ an audited, 100%-backed reserve of USD for the equivalent amount of
Constant in circulation.

●

Creating​ UI/UX frameworks for decentralized applications built with Constant, focusing
on the useable, simple and intuitive.

●

Promoting​ meaningful adoption of Constant for use in everyday life.

Business Model
The Constant System is privately funded by the Constant Foundation. In the long run, the
Constant System should be able to self-fund its operations by charging competitive fees on
services such as transfers, purchases, and conversions.
Income derived from these fees will be directed towards covering the cost of those services,
including gas payments to the Ethereum network and operation expenses for maintaining the
Trust Vault.

Only after all expenses are paid for, will the net earnings of the Constant System be transferred
to the Constant Foundation. The Constant Foundation will then distribute these earnings fairly
among users of the system in accordance with a crypto-economics model.

10. Entity: The Constant Foundation
Purpose
The Constant Foundation is the founding team behind the Constant System. It is responsible
for designing and implementing the Constant System and promoting the mass adoption of
Constant in everyday life. Initially, the Constant Foundation makes decisions on building and
running the Constant System. However, over time, decision-making powers will be
decentralized and distributed to the community.

Key members
The Constant Foundation consists of 30 scientists, cryptographers, engineers, educators and
business operators, on a mission to bring freedom to money. Many of us have worked
together for years — either solving difficult scientific problems or engineering large-scale
practical real world applications.

Duy Huynh, Monetary Policy
Duy works on the monetary policy of the Constant System. He spends most of his days
studying the great economic thinkers of the last 100 years and turning their ideas into
unstoppable lines of code. Prior to Constant, Duy founded Autonomous, a startup that
combines AI & Robotics technologies to build smart office products. He grew the company to
100+ employees in 6 countries, with 300,000+ business customers in 60+ countries within the
first 24 months.
At age 18, Duy moved from Vietnam to the US to study at the University of Wisconsin, where
he completed a 4-year college degree in 3 semesters. At age 19, Duy was a PhD researcher at
the University of Maryland in the High Dependability Computing Program, funded by NASA, the

current focus is on preserving the anonymity and confidentiality of Constant transactions
through zero-knowledge proofs.
Thuc is a professor of applied cryptography at the National University of Vietnam, where he
co-founded the Department of Applied Cryptography and Computer Security. Thuc also
co-leads the Decentralized Cryptography Research Group, designing innovative cryptographic
tools and developing privacy-preserving cryptosystems that simultaneously achieve
post-quantum security and practicality. He also leads key projects on security and
cryptography for the Vietnamese government.

Professor Dung Tran, Consensus & Scalability
Dung works on the consensus & scalability algorithms at Constant. His current focus is on
increasing transaction throughput while preserving consensus properties. Dung has extensive
research and practical experience in distributed systems, computer networks, and game

theory, making him the perfect candidate for designing and implementing consensus and
scalability mechanisms at Constant.
Dung also lectures at the National University of Vietnam. As well as teaching courses on
distributed systems, Dung has published several papers on bandwidth measurement and
estimation, and is the author of two textbooks, ​Operation Systems​ and ​Computer Networks​.
He holds a PhD in computer science from the University of Texas.

Gaël Vo, Product Manager
Gaël designs, develops, and manages new innovative financial products at Constant, including
remittance, loans, salary, invoicing, and many others. Prior to Constant, he worked as a
financial engineer at BNP Paribas where he created a new framework to replace and centralize
complex applications, enabling users and other developers to control the system
independently.
Gaël holds a dual master’s degree in computer science and telecommunications from Institut
National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon, and an MBA in finance from Simon Business
School in New York. As an MBA intern at Five Star Bank, Gaël developed an automation layer
within loan management that cut processing time by 83%. Gaël hopes to create the future of
banking in emerging economies.

Bao Le, Infrastructure
Bao works on the infrastructure layer of Constant, integrating both on-chain and off-chain
components such as the consensus protocol, privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs, and
monetary policy algorithms. Prior to Constant, Bao built highly scalable systems for emerging
markets, including Viettel Group, Vietnam's largest mobile network operator, where he scaled
their products for 63M subscribers, and Central Group, Thailand's number 1 retail and service
group business.
Bao leverages his deep knowledge of peer-to-peer applications, cryptography, game theory,
and network applications to build highly scalable systems that quantify performance,
availability, and extensibility in each line of code. Thai Bao continues to acquire new
cryptography techniques, knowledge of computer networks, and regularly researches existing
networks to improve, find, and integrate new protocols and solutions.

Bill Pelletier, E-Commerce
Bill works on integrating Constant as a payment method for major e-commerce retailers. Prior
to Constant, Bill worked closely with some of the world’s biggest e-commerce retailers,
including Amazon, Overstock, Target, Wayfair and Home Depot. Before that, he developed the
investment portfolio of a major bank as a private banker, and has also advised multiple high
profile clients on mergers & acquisition, trust & estates, and provided litigation support.

Ning Tan, Community, South East Asia
Ning works on getting Constant into the hands of 700 million people in South East Asia. She
specializes in creating and clarifying concepts, distilling meaning and building useful things.
Prior to Constant, Ning was the Director of Communications at Autonomous, where she loved

spanning tree problem”, was published at IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

11. Entity: The Trust Vault
Purpose
Constant cannot be minted from thin air. Every Constant that circulates on the market must be
backed by a tangible asset, held in an audited Trust Vault, managed by an independent Trust
Company.

Assets
Initially, the Trust Vault will accept a single asset type - the US dollar, because of its
creditworthiness, price stability, and especially its liquidity.
Gradually, multiple asset types will be enabled and introduced to the Trust Vault. Potential
assets fall broadly among these types:
●
●
●

Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH)
Tokenized commodities such as gold (​DGX​, CryptoBullion, AUcoin)
Tokenized real estate and rental properties (​Harbor​, REX, Real, SmartRE, REIDAO,
Estate Coin, RealCoin)

●
●
●

Tokenized stock, bonds, and other financial instruments
Tokenized fine art (Maecenas)
Tokenized company shares (Polymath)

Examination
The US dollar escrow balance in the Trust Vault is examined monthly by a registered public
accounting firm, in order to verify the 1:1 peg and provide frequent, transparent reports to all
users of the system.

Direct banking
While the Constant System builds and provides all utilities, users only ever transact directly
with the bank of the independent trust company. The Constant Foundation never touches their
funds.

Implementation
The Constant System designates Prime Trust, an independent technology-driven trust
company, to manage the Reserve Vault. As a chartered, regulated financial institution, Prime
Trust is overseen by the banking commissioner’s office at the ​Financial Institutions Division​. As
a trust company, Prime Trust holds cash and non-cash assets such as stocks, bonds, Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies, tokens, real estate, and private business ownership interests. The
Prime Trust team has deep experience in all facets of trust operations, banking, securities
regulations, and governmental affairs.

12. Entity: The Decentralized Payment Network
Purpose
The Decentralized Payment Network is responsible for handling all payments in the Constant
System. It uses ​distributed ledger technology (blockchain), a digital innovation that reinvents
payments, clearing, and settlement processes - reducing operational and financial
inefficiencies of payment systems. The blockchain, collectively maintained and secured by
users of the system, presents a safer, more efficient, and more decentralized alternative to the
classic double-entry book keeping maintained by a central authority.

Distributed ledger technology
Distributed ledger technology is a remarkable alternative to the existing financial infrastructure.
In terms of efficiency, it eliminates intermediaries and their ridiculous markups, and allows
peer-to-peer direct transactions. In terms of finality, it provides an immutable record that
cannot be altered retrospectively. In terms of speed, settlement can be near real time. In
terms of safety, it uses cryptographic proofs without a central authority or trusted third party.
The Decentralized Payment Network provides:
●

Ubiquity​: universal access for everyone (personal, business, non-profit, the unbanked)
for multiple use cases, with cross-border functionality.

●

Safety​: a secure system that holds immutable records with cryptographic integrity
without a central authority or a trusted third party.

●

Speed​: near real-time clearance and settlement of transactions.

●

Low cost​: elimination of intermediaries and centralized monolithic infrastructure costs.

●

Convenience​: easy access with just an internet connection.

●

Finality​: irreversible peer-to-peer settlements of transactions, immutably recorded on a
ledger that cannot be altered retrospectively.

Implementation
The decentralized payment network is built on top of Ethereum, a decentralized platform that
runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of
downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. This framework supports various
programs (or smart contracts) that enable minting Constant, burning Constant, transferring
Constant among the users of the system, and maintaining the Trust Vault.

13. Function: Conducting monetary policy
Initially, the Constant Foundation sets and runs the Constant System monetary policy. Over
time, decision-making power will be decentralized and distributed to Constant holders.
Constant monetary policy is conducted with two goals in mind:
1. to achieve stable prices.
2. to maximize meaningful adoption of Constant in everyday life.
In order to achieve these two goals, the Constant System implements a dual-token model. The
Constant stablecoin is the main utility token of the system, and the Growth Token is linked to
the future growth of the Constant System, a reward to users for their contribution to the
system.

1:1 pegged to the US dollar
Constant is pegged 1:1 to the most stable, most usable currency in the world. One Constant
always equals one US dollar, and is easily switched for USD at any time.

Fees
The Constant System charges fees on transfer, purchase and conversion services. This
income is used to cover the cost of those services, including gas payments to the Ethereum
network, legal fees, and operation expenses for maintaining the Trust Vault.
The first release of Constant will be launched in the US and Vietnam with extremely
competitive fees. The operations team is working towards similarly friendly fees for the rest of
the world.

14. Function: Managing the Trust Vault
The Trust Vault comprises of a set of fully audited, independent escrow accounts. One of the
most widely used legal vehicles for third party funds management, escrow accounts enable
regular attestations and strong legal protection for Constant holders.
Our legal framework enables users to exchange USD directly with Constant escrow accounts.
The Constant System cannot touch the funds. When purchasing Constant or converting to
USD, users send or receive USD straight from Constant escrow accounts, managed by
independent Trust Company partners.
Constant designates licensed trust companies to securely hold the funds backing Constant.
For increased security and to avoid any potential conflicts of interest, Constant does not and
will not have access or control over any escrowed funds.

Minting new Constant

If Constant is to become a legitimate alternative to fiat, it must similarly stay in keeping with
world regulations. To purchase Constant, users must first pass a KYC/AML check. Once
complete, they are able to deposit their USD directly into the escrowed Trust Vault of an
accredited trust company that operates independently from Constant. Once funds reach the
Trust Vault, the custodian’s API instructs the System’s smart contract to mint the equivalent in
Constant, which is then sent straight to the user’s public Ethereum address.

This separation of entities is integral to ensuring the long-term stability of the system. As an
additional security feature, users’ funds will continue to be held safely in this independent
escrow account, inaccessible by both the Constant System and the impartial third party.

Burning

To switch Constant to USD, users must also have completed KYC/AML verification. Constant
tokens can then be sent to the Constant smart contract, which (1) burns those tokens,
removing them from circulation, and (2) automates the return of the equivalent USD from the
escrowed Trust Vault.
In this way, the Constant System has no access to any user funds, and the independent
financial institution can only enable the movement of Constant and USD through trustless
escrow accounts.

Funds guarantee
These escrow accounts are security guaranteed and covered up to $5,000,000 USD. All funds
in your account are 100% FDIC insured.

15. Function: Handling payments and
settlements safely and efficiently
The most important function of the Constant System is to manage the payment system. The
Constant System uses distributed ledger technology (blockchain) as its payment system,
reducing expense and bypassing typical wait times and geographical borders. ​ Details of every
transaction are recorded on this public ledger.
Using either a searchable transaction ID (TxHash) or the Ethereum wallet addresses of either
sender or recipient, anyone is able to quickly pull up the value of the relevant transaction, the
time in which it occurred, and any fees paid to the Ethereum miners for processing the
transaction and securing the network (Gas).

Addresses and keys
Each Constant user has one or more Constant address(es). A Constant address is a 20-byte
address of digits and characters, generated from a public key. An address can be used to
receive funds or send out funds.
An address could be controlled by either a ​single signature​ or ​k-out-of-n multiple
signatures​.

Transactions
Enabling and securing transactions are foundational to the Constant System. The System is
primarily designed to ensure that transactions can be created, propagated on the network,
validated, and finally added to the ledger.
Transactions are data packages that encode the transfer of value or information between users
in the Constant network. In the System, different transactions perform different tasks. Some
transaction types simply transfer value between users; others transfer information, such as
voting or multisig, with or without value, between them.

State transition system
Blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are essentially transaction-based state transition systems.
For example, a transfer transaction of 3 bitcoins moves the Bitcoin network from state S​i​ to
S​i+1​.

Constant can also be thought of as a transaction-based state transition system. It begins with
the genesis state and incrementally executes transactions to arrive at the next state.
Note that, while the state is a crucial component of the network, it is not stored on the
blockchain. Only transactions are stored on the blockchain. The state is often stored in
memory or in a fast key-value database such as ​LevelDB​.

Blocks
Multiple transactions are packaged into a block and multiple blocks are cryptographically
chained together. This is what constitutes the blockchain.
Each block is written into the blockchain as an immutable record, based upon the consensus
of the users in the network. Transactions that are packaged into a block are final and
irreversible.

16. Function: Promoting adoption of Constant in
everyday life
Constant moves faster and more freely than fiat. It is designed for security and transparency,
and built for flexibility, practicality and cost-efficiency. This upgraded money is both currency
and infrastructure, easily integrated into both life and code. Addressed to users below is a
broad outline of realistic use cases of Constant, as well as the role the Constant Foundation
will play in facilitating those use cases.
The Constant Foundation is responsible for:

●

Easing meaningful adoption of the Constant stablecoin for use in personal or business
capacities.

●

Building tools to enable developers to design new online and offline payment services.
Supporting them in creating solutions that previously could not exist, due to the
limitations of existing financial structures.

●

Developing the first group of applications to help users get more out of Constant, and
as blueprints for other developers to begin building their own decentralized applications
with Constant.

For personal
Fast international payments
Sending Constant across the world is easier than walking your cash across the street, and
much faster than relying on the traditional banking system. Constant doesn’t make you wait 3
business days, charge extra fees for making an international transfer, and doesn’t dictate
minimum or maximum amounts you can send.
Security and complete control over your money
Constant transactions are secured by military-grade cryptography, so nobody can take your
money or make a payment on your behalf. The blockchain is immutable, so no one can alter a
previous transaction or dispute an occurrence. Constant is designed for freedom, peace of
mind and autonomy.
Zero to low fees
Banks typically charge between $15 to $35 to receive international transfers. There are zero
fees involved when receiving Constant, no matter how far it has travelled. When it comes to
sending Constant, fees are low and fixed, regardless of amount. This means that there are no
transaction limits, and that sending 1,000,000 Constant costs the same as sending 1.
Mobile payments made easy
The Constant payment system is available via mobile web, so there is no need to download an
app. Simply scan to pay, or display the QR code representing your account address to the
other party, so they can scan it and complete the transaction.

Works everywhere, any time
Like email, it’s a protocol. The Constant System never sleeps, or takes weekends off - and the
tens of thousands of miners that sustain the system don’t take bank holidays. To make any
payment or transaction, all that is needed is the account address of the receiver. Any ERC20
compatible software, wallet, or exchange can receive it.

For business
Protection against fraud
Credit cards, Paypal, or even ACH encounter problems with chargebacks and reversed
payments. Constant payments are irreversible and secure, meaning that the cost of fraud is
minimized for businesses.
Fast international payments
Paying a supplier in China, a freelancer in a London, or a local vendor in New York costs the
same low fee, and takes the same amount of time - mere minutes - no matter the amount or
destination. Constant enables unlimited transfers of unlimited amounts, to anywhere in the
world, so you and your business can move quicker.
Zero to low fees
It costs you nothing to receive Constant, compared to the $15 - $35 international transfer fee
that banks typically charge. As for outward payments, Constant replaces the standard $45
international wiring fee with a low, fixed fee. So that no matter the size or location of your
business or finances, you remain as time and cost efficient as possible.
Multi-signature
Constant also offers more complex solutions for larger organizations. A multi-signature
scheme allows Constant to be spent only if a denoted subset of people collectively authorize
the transaction. Businesses can also lock requirements in place and automate payments when
those requirements are fulfilled, eliminating anxiety and needless back and forth. For example,
a large transaction of over 100,000 Constant can be executed only after both CEO and CFO
have digitally signed off on it.
Online payments
Adding Constant as an additional payment option on your ecommerce site is straightforward.
There are many 3rd party payment processing services that support ERC20 and provide stable
APIs.

Offline payments
Accepting offline payments is as simple as scanning a QR code. You can use any digital wallet
to scan the QR code from any wallet your customer happens to have, as long as they both
support the common ERC20 standard.

For traders
Hedging
Constant prices are immune to pump and dumps, and remain stable no matter how volatile the
cryptocurrency market is. By converting your other cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH into
Constant when the market is downwards trending, you can hedge against uncertainty and
volatility and protect the value of your assets.
An alternative to traditional currency deposit
Use Constant as an alternative to traditional fiat deposit and withdrawal methods for lower fees
and faster transaction processing times. Convert your fiats into Constant without exposure to
the volatility of BTC or ETH.

For developers
Be your own bank. Be your own payment gateway.
You don’t need approval from a bank or payment processor. You can just boot up a node and
become your own. The flexibility of Constant allows you to build products, systems and your
best ideas - in any way you like, for any customer or client.
Simple yet powerful programming model
The blockchain programming model ensures that you no longer have to store customer
information on your server and be responsible for protecting it. The chain itself is the most
secure database, immutable and protected from any single point of failure. All private keys are
stored and managed by users on the client side. Taking payments is as simple as a few API
calls to the blockchain via the ​web3.js library​.
Integrate into your existing web sites or apps
Since Constant is an ERC20 token, you can seamlessly integrate Constant into your existing
web and mobile apps via commonly used tools like ​Metamask​. Easily tap into the active user
base of the dynamic Ethereum ecosystem.

17. Function: Create UI/UX guidelines for
decentralized applications built with
Constant
Constant is designed for useability and real world practicality. We hope that one day Constant
will be integrated seamlessly into daily use. We describe the first of many practical use cases
and applications of Constant in the preceding sections, but for these use cases to work at
scale, we need to establish an empathetic design system that never alienates.
The product design team at the Constant Foundation is working on adapting familiar
frameworks, words and behaviors to better communicate new ideas and welcome new
interactions.

Performance
At some point in the future, we believe that the Constant System will be 100% decentralized.
We are not there yet. Asking a user to wait 10 minutes for a transaction confirmation is 10
minutes too long. The reality in January 2019 is that if we make it the user’s responsibility to
understand gas fees and navigate multiple disparate platforms to buy the 10 cents worth of
Ether needed to place a simple vote, no one will. And so the decentralized democracy grinds
to a halt.

The Constant Foundation is committed to finding the ideal balance of decentralization, that
optimizes the user experience while still preserving the transparency, security and stability that
will remain at the very core of the System.

Web
Here are some screenshots of the initial release of the Constant System on the web.

Mobile
Here are some screenshots of the initial release of the Constant System on mobile.

18. Open source & code architecture
Constant is open source at ​https://github.com/constant-money​. Its design is public; the
Constant System is built to evolve with the community.
At the infrastructure layer, Constant is built on top of the Ethereum network to enable
payments, and Prime Trust API, for escrow.
On the backend, Constant includes a number of smart contracts for minting and burning
Constant. It also includes off-chain components to provide better UX. Finally, it includes a set
of developer APIs to enable developers to integrate Constant into their products.

On the frontend, Constant provides both web and mobile interfaces. We hope that over time,
more web and mobile apps will be built with Constant.

19. Conclusion
The Internet in 1994 looked nothing like what we have today. Blockchain’s 1994 is happening
right now. The volatility of currencies like Bitcoin and Ether have attracted attention to the
rapidly developing, increasingly divisive crypto sphere - populating it with bright-eyed
developers and early adopters, alongside a majority of speculators and traders.

There is a great deal of evolution to come before crypto proves to be ultimately useful. The
volatility that characterizes the current landscape has also made the prevalent narrative of
financial revolution unconvincing at best. For crypto to be the new money, we should feel
secure spending it, saving it, and getting paid in it. It needs to hold its value.
The Constant System is designed to meet these essential conditions, open up bigger
possibilities, and bring the world closer together. By pioneering a stable global zone in the
crypto wild west, Constant hopes to lead the shift towards real world applicability. By building
a freer and more useful money for anyone, anywhere, Constant hopes to help make the world
go round better.
