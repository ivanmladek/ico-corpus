1. The problem, the opportunity and
company mission
1.1 SMART VALOR’s mission
The mission of the company is to give access to digital assets to people around the world in an
easy, secure and compliant way. Utilizing blockchain technology, the company will democratize
access to wealth.
Beyond digital assets, the company deploys tokenization to real-world assets making exclusive
investment opportunities more widely accessible and simple. Where you are in the world and the
extent of your wealth should not matter. The VALOR Platform will democratize access to great
investment opportunities and borderless wealth – independent of local limitations and the
dominance of Wall Street.
Just as the internet democratized access to information, blockchain will democratize access to
value and money. SMART VALOR believes that freedom of financial choice is as much a human
right as freedom of speech.

1.2 The problems SMART VALOR aims to solve
Today, investing in new digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, protocol tokens, and ICOs is
subject to high danger of hacking, poor user experience, and legal uncertainty1.
▪

On the legal side, the majority of investment platforms and exchanges in the crypto asset
space run as unauthorized businesses 2, holding limited legal obligation to users of these
platforms.

▪

As of today, USD2.3 billion in crypto assets have been lost in various hacking attacks3. This
is often due to the lack of a standard system-level and software security measures,
insufficiently secure wallets and usage complexity.

▪

In most cases, users need technical skills to be able to generate transactions, operate
wallets and store the related cryptographic keys. For traditional investors looking to gain
exposure to this new asset class this is simply not a viable option.

Beyond new digital assets, the space of alternative investments such as real estate, venture
capital and private equity is currently accessible only to big investors due to the high minimal
stakes and illiquid nature of these investments. Tokenization is set to solve this problem by
making alternative investments fractional, accessible and more liquid.
Lastly, the access to investment opportunities and protection of a stable and independent
jurisdiction is a privilege of people in the developed world. The legal framework of banking
systems in such countries as Switzerland and Liechtenstein protects the privacy and safety of

clients. Additionally, the open approach of financial supervisory authorities to crypto businesses,
makes it an ideal place to resolve the problem of access, legitimacy and data protection in the
crypto space.

1.2.1 Shortcomings of today's financial system
In a broader context, there are several shortcomings of today’s financial system, which blockchain
technology can help to mitigate.
Figure 1:
Shortcomings of today's financial system

EXPENSIVE
INTERMEDIARIES

WEALTH
REDISTRIBUTION

INEFFICIENT
INFRASTRUCTURE

▪

Multiple layers of intermediaries charge fees throughout the financial
system.

▪

The sheer quantity of intermediaries creates unjustifiable economic
slack and burdens on society.

▪

Regular banking crises redistribute wealth between insiders and
ordinary citizens through government bailouts.

▪

In developing countries, governments use inflation as a mean of wealth
redistribution from poor to rich.

▪

Access to banking and financial products is limited in most countries
outside of the developed world.

▪

Money transfers and transaction settlements are slow and expensive
due to complex institutional landscape and legacy.

The SMART VALOR team believes that it is a basic human right for people all over the world to
possess and make their own decisions about their money and investments. This is especially true
in developing countries, where there are multiple interferences that make it impossible for people
to manage their wealth efficiently and safely.
Some countries impose capital controls which prevent their citizens from transferring their own
money abroad or investing in specific assets. Many countries use inflation to solve economic
problems, while ordinary people bear its cost. Additionally, pension reforms and
misappropriation of assets can happen at any time, wiping out an individual’s wealth.
Members of business and government elites can usually protect their wealth. Safe havens like
Switzerland, the UK and Hong Kong have become some of the largest centers for offshore wealth
management. Beyond safety, access to attractive investment products, especially in the
alternative investment space, remains a privilege of the few.

1.2.2 Changing the status-quo
SMART VALOR believes that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have arrived to
challenge this status-quo. Today, anybody anywhere can buy Bitcoin or Ether and invest in
attractive startups alongside Silicon Valley investors.

However, this process - referred to as Initial Coin Offering (ICO) - currently suffers from regulatory
uncertainty. Regulation significantly lags behind the development enabled by blockchain
technology. In this context, Switzerland has emerged as one of the global leaders in the
blockchain space, as it benefits from its fundamentally liberal and principle-based regulatory
approach. Switzerland became the second largest country in terms of ICO volume and home to
many high-quality ICOs such as Bancor, Status, Cosmos, etc., who raised a total of USD1.06 billion
last year4.
As political leadership in Switzerland announced plans for the country to become one of the
leading nations in this field ('Crypto Nation Switzerland')5, the Swiss financial regulator created
'ICO Guidelines' which are targeted at enabling legitimate innovators to run compliant
fundraisings6. The dedicated Blockchain taskforce created by the State Secretariat for
International Financial Matters (SIF) is working on creation of further regulatory adjustments7. In
Liechtenstein, the government is also working on new Blockchain Law, which is expected to
become effective in 2019.

1.3 Tokenization: a technology-driven, tectonic shift
Frequently, the invention of distributed ledger technology (blockchain) is compared to the
introduction of internet and TCP/IP protocol in the early nineties. In the same way the internet
enabled global access to information, blockchain is set to enable global access to value, finance,
and money. In this sense, the blockchain is essentially the internet of value8.
The first effects of it are just starting to take shape in the form of remittances and globally
crowdfunded projects. This is just the beginning. As cryptocurrencies evolve and ownership of real
assets transform with tokenization, the fundamental change it drives will reverberate through
every branch of the financial system.
In this context, SMART VALOR has chosen to focus on building a decentralized marketplace for
tokenized alternative investments that will enable the democratization of access to wealth.
Traditional alternative investments like private equity, venture capital, and real estate represent
in many cases attractive investment opportunities. However, these are less liquid assets that are
not easily accessible to average investors. Many real-world assets, such as real estate, art,
diamonds and gold, are difficult to physically divide or transfer. Buyers and sellers often exchange
written contracts that usually represent the entire asset. These paper trails can make keeping
track of complex legal agreements difficult. High value, unavailability of fractional ownership, nonfungibility and high transaction costs lead to many of these assets being illiquid and excluded from
trade.
This is where tokenization comes in. Tokenization is the representation of rights to an asset
through a cryptographic token issued on the blockchain. Tokens are a frictionless way to transfer
the ownership of any asset.

1.3.1 Benefits of tokenization
Migrating assets to the blockchain offers several major advantages over traditional securitization
or other forms of digitalization. These advantages are summarized here.
Figure 2:
Advantages of Tokenization
DECENTRALIZED RECORD OF
OWNERSHIP
No need to trust a bank or any
other centralized institution to
keep a safe record of the
ownership of your assets.

INSTANT EXECUTION

The blockchain accommodates
both transfer transactions and a
record of ownership. Transfer of
ownership is instant (instead of
the 2-3 days settlement time on
today’s stock exchanges).

SMART CONTRACT-BASED
EXECUTION

24/7 ACCESS

Self-executing securities based
on smart contracts will allow for
more complex conditional
payment structures to be
reflected and automated.

Just as with cryptocurrencies,
tokenized investments can be
traded anytime, from anywhere
in a global P2P network.

FRACTIONAL OWNERSHIP

Tokens represent a tiny fraction
of the asset’s value, making
investing in that asset more
affordable to a wider group of
investors.

ENHANCED LIQUIDITY

Tokens can be traded at any
time. This creates greater
liquidity in traditionally illiquid
asset classes like private equity
and physical assets.

The major advantage of tokenization is that the digital representation of the ownership rights is
created on a public blockchain9. A public blockchain is a globally accessible ledger, with
decentralized management operated by a network of peers which comply within an open source
protocol. This network acts as the same place for the record of ownership and its transfer.

The transfer of ownership of any asset-backed token issued on the blockchain can be equally fast,
secure and cost-efficient as the transfer of Bitcoin or Ether on their respective networks. Figure 3
illustrates the difference between an exemplary share transfer via traditional process versus
blockchain.

SHARE TRANSFER IN PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY

In addition to the advantages mentioned above, the global distribution of security tokens can be
significantly simplified. “When securities are tokenized, compliance can be automated, which
means that regulated trade will no longer be restricted to walled gardens. Security tokens will be
able to trade anywhere, including decentralized exchanges. Further, baking compliance into the
token could help market participants navigate the extremely complex task of selling securities
across borders”10.
The potential of securitization on the blockchain is massive, which is why many exchanges and
banks have started to build their own applications on private blockchains. The size of the
opportunity becomes apparent when looking at the size of the market capitalization of listed
companies worldwide, which recently reached USD79.2 trillion after considerable growth in the
last 30 years as illustrated in Figure 4.

Figure 4:
Market capitalization of listed companies worldwide -1975-2017.11

(in USD)

In comparison, the crypto asset
market capitalization represents
only around 0.4% of today's
equities market. As tokenization of
real-world assets takes off and
ICOs morph into the new form of
IPO, the digital asset market
capitalization is set to grow
exponentially.

1.3.2 Challenges of tokenization
In a network that powers tokenized assets, consistency is key. The protocols underneath public
blockchains enable the secure, immutable and consistently reliable execution of transactions and
smart contracts. In dealing with real world assets represented by tokens new challenges arise.
One of them is ensuring consistency between the physical asset and its digital token12.
The tokenization of real-world assets is an ongoing challenge that requires innovative solutions.
These solutions need to incorporate technology with new business processes - and in some cases
- new legal forms. Clearly defined legal models need to be put into place to protect both the asset
seller and the investor. To manage these challenges, the VALOR Platform incorporates additional
auditing procedures. These procedures vary across different investment types.
For example, today the number of shares issued by a certain company is recorded in a public
company registry in the country where the company is domiciled. As these entities move to a
blockchain-based solution, the change of ownership will be directly registered in the public ledger
without any time lag. The first implementation cases are already in progress today, such as a
company registry in Switzerland13 and a real estate registry in Sweden 14. As more and more
centralized registries for all sorts of assets move on-chain in the coming years, consistency
between tokens and their underlying assets will become less and less of an issue.

12 This consistency is needed to avoid the situation in which an asset could be represented through redundant tokens
and sold many times on different market places.

2. What is the VALOR Platform and
who is it for?
The VALOR Platform is an online investment platform with focus on digital assets such as:
1. Cryptocurrencies and non-security tokens (protocol, utility and payment tokens)
2. Asset-backed security tokens such as equity in young companies, real estate, crypto
funds, venture capital, and private equity funds
All investments on the platform are created in a form of token, a cryptographic object issued on
the blockchain, powered by smart contracts.
All these investments belong in the space of alternative investments. Therefore, the VALOR
Platform is positioned as a marketplace for tokenized alternative investments. It is operated by
SMART VALOR AG, a Swiss company founded in 2017 in Zug (CH) 15.

SMART VALOR operates as Financial Intermediary, being accepted as member of the VQF
SRO, an officially recognized self-regulatory organization pursuant to the Swiss Anti-Money
Laundering Act.
The unique service proposition of the VALOR Platform is an easy, secure and compliant access to
alternative investments for investors independent of their wealth or destination.
For traditional investors it solves the problem of legitimacy and security in the crypto space.
Additionally, it gives them access to alternative investments, which are not available for them
today. This USD7 trillion industry is today accessible to only rich and influential people in
developed countries. The tokenization of assets is a gamechanger which will democratize access
to wealth, independent of net-worth and location.

2.1 What is the product offering?
The VALOR Platform will be rolled out in two major stages. In the beginning, it will focus on
cryptocurrencies and non-security tokens. The reason for the staged approach is the regulatory
approval process. In August 2018, SMART VALOR received Financial Intermediary status in
Switzerland which enables it to offer non-security tokens.
In the second stage of the roll-out, after receiving a bank license, the VALOR Platform will focus
on security tokens. Within the security token space, the platform will focus on tokens backed by
equity in young companies, crypto funds, real estate, venture capital, and private equity.

2.1.1 Cryptocurrencies and non-security tokens
Investments in cryptocurrencies and other non-security tokens are on an extensive growth
trajectory. Within the last two years, the total market capitalization went from USD12 billion to
252 billion, reaching 828 billion in between (as of 7th August 2018). Although it fell significantly
from the once-achieved peak, the annual growth of the last 12 months reached 252%. This kind of

growth attracted a significant number of investors. The volume traded daily grew from USD3.7
billion to USD11 billion despite the bearish market.
Beyond cryptocurrencies, there is another crypto asset class of non-security tokens such as
protocol tokens, payment and utility tokens often issued in ICO. These assets constitute an
expanding share of the total crypto market capitalization. Within the last year alone, their share
of total market capitalization grew by around a multiple of 3, expanding from ca. 11% to 30%.
Figure 5:
Crypto market composition16

The performance of crypto assets during the last years was beyond anything imaginable in
traditional capital markets. Last year, Bitcoin achieved a 1’369% annual growth, while all crypto
assets combined recorded a 707% return. SMART VALOR estimates cryptocurrencies to grow
further while Bitcoin has a good chance of establishing itself as a store of value (digital gold)17.
As more legal clarity is being brought to the cryptocurrency space, the interest from traditional
and institutional investors keeps rising. This investor segment will however only consider
platforms that provide fully compliant and secure ways to invest in these crypto assets. This is the
business opportunity SMART VALOR is focusing on initially.

2.1.2 Asset-backed security tokens
Alternative investments are a rapidly-expanding USD7 trillion industry of highly profitable but less
liquid assets, which are not easily accessible to most investors18. Private equity (PE) and venture
capital (VC) is the biggest category representing around one third of all alternative investments.

The problem with participation in this class of investments is that the entry threshold is very high,
typically several million dollars. The other limitation is that VC/PE stakes are highly illiquid
investments, where investors are usually bonded for 5-10 years. This makes PE inaccessible and
unattractive to affluent and high-net worth investors who prefer higher liquidity.
Putting these kind of investments on the blockchain has the potential to make this asset class
more liquid and more accessible. In this case, a certain tranche of the fund can be issued in a form
of a token that represents a more liquid portion of the fund. The first examples of VC funds going
through the ICO route include Blockchain Capital 19 and Science.
The potential of tokenization in real estate is even greater. There are estimates that the global
value of real estate is three times bigger than the global annual GDP, reaching above USD217
trillion20. It is in this industry where crowdfunding reached its highest levels in the last 5 years. This
growth is expected to continue with experts predicting it could reach USD300 billion by 202521.
Beyond ‘traditional’ alternative investments, there is the whole range of assets that can be made
accessible in the form of tokenized investments such as intellectual property rights, patents, art,
rare metals, and direct investments in tech startups. Alongside the native digital assets, the broad
variety of these alternative investments defines the product spectrum of the VALOR Platform.22

2.1.3 Tokenization of currencies
SMART VALOR’s approach to the Tokenized
Swiss Franc (CHFt)
In general, SMART VALOR does not act as
the asset issuer (tokenized assets do not
belong to SMART VALOR), whereas the
tokenization of the asset is merely a service
provided by SMART VALOR to the asset
issuer. One exception to this general
principle is the case of tokenized Swiss Franc.
The national currency issued by the Swiss National Bank has established itself as one of the most
stable currencies. Whereas USD has lost over 96% of its value during the last hundred years, the
Swiss Franc has established itself as ‘safe-haven’ currency. With that it is likely to become one of
the future alternative reserve currencies to fill the space of the diminishing dominance of USD.
Looking at the relative strength of CHF to USD, it becomes obvious that the USD lost 77% of its
value in relation to the CHF during the last 50 years. Around 50 years ago, 1 US dollar would cost
4.4 CHF, while today it is down to only 0.99 CHF.

SMART VALOR’s approach to the Tokenized Swiss Franc (CHFt)
SMART VALOR has taken the approach to create the Tokenized Swiss Franc (CHFt) as a fully
collateralized token, 100% backed by Swiss Francs (CHF), issued by the SMART VALOR bank, which
is currently in the process of going through the licensing application.
SMART VALOR observes that currently there is no stablecoin issued by a banking institution. The
first mover advantage in this context is enormous and initiates fast scaling and the network effect.
In general, in the space of protocols, cryptocurrencies and payments, once the adoption of a
certain standard takes place, it becomes difficult for late entrants to impose a different standard
even if it provides a better functionality.
The CHFt will be issued as token with the major goal of being deployed on tokenization platforms,
decentralized exchanges and traditional crypto exchanges. The difference between CHFt and
Tether can be summarized as follows:
1. Fully collateralized token 100% backed by real Swiss Franc.
2. To receive CHFt, customers need to pay in the equivalent amount of Swiss Franc into the
bank account of the SMART VALOR bank.
3. A legally binding contract ensures that at any time SMART VALOR will pay out the full
amount of Swiss Franc to the holder of CHFt.
4. To purchase CHFt online, the customer needs to go through the KYC/AML procedure
according to the applicable anti-money-laundry requirements.
More details on the SMART VALOR stablecoin will be presented in a separate White Paper.

2.2 Who is the VALOR Platform for?
The VALOR Platform caters to two major group of customers: investors and asset issuers.
For individual investors the VALOR Platform is positioned to offer secure access to digital assets
and the best tokenized investments. VALOR Platform customers consist of three different groups:
1. Traditional investors who aim for
exposure to new digital assets in a secure,
compliant way. These investors are interested
in more long-term investments, have limited
technical background and prefer a simple user
interface.
They tend to have limited experience with
digital assets but are open to alternative
investments.

2. Crypto investors from all over the world
who want to diversify into more stable
alternatives such as real estate and private
equity deploying cryptocurrencies. Many of
them come from developing countries and see
an additional advantage in a safe-haven
jurisdiction that can protect their privacy and
wealth.

These two groups of investors hold an average
of USD0.5-5 million net liquid assets, represent the next generation of mobile first and are open
to non-traditional investment opportunities.
3. Institutional investors, such as
independent wealth managers, family offices,
hedge funds, and smaller banks. For them,
the VALOR Platform acts as a product shelf
for digital assets custody provider for storing
their crypto assets.

On the opposite side of the marketplace, there is another segment of customers, referred to as
asset issuers. They can be any type of a private company, fund, real estate developer or other
player offering investment products to the public. The core value propositions of the VALOR
Platform for them are:
19

1. Issuance of their asset-backed tokens (creation of a smart contract, legal structuring due
diligence, etc.)
2. Initial listing on the VALOR Platform
3. Secondary trading of the listed tokens
The key benefit for the asset issuer is access to a new investor base. For example, for a crypto
fund it can give access to the USD4 trillion heavy Swiss-based global investor pool. On the other
hand, for the provider of real estate in Switzerland, it gives access to a global investor base which
would like to access this opportunity via the cryptocurrency rails.
The tokenization functionality enables the asset issuer to offer the previously not-very-liquid and
inaccessible investment, in the form of an asset-backed token, which is much easier to handle
than a limited partner paper contract in the millions of dollars.

2.3 What is the value proposition for core customer
groups?
The core value proposition for investors is to offer secure access to digital assets, unlocking
previously inaccessible investment opportunities. Due to SMART VALOR’s location in Switzerland,
they have the additional advantage of safe-haven wealth protection in a stable and independent
jurisdiction which respects data privacy.

Participants will benefit from performance and data transparency enabled by the blockchain.
There is no need to trust one centralized entity. The VALOR Platform is run on a combination of a
public blockchain and highly scalable permissioned solution.

2.3.2 Service offering of the VALOR Platform for asset issuers
The core value proposition for asset issuers is an opportunity to access and engage with new
investor audiences and raise funds faster through guided, fully compliant asset tokenization.

3. Business and go-to-market strategy
3.1 Business model design
The VALOR Platform business model is a multi-sided marketplace for investments. On one side of
this market there are asset issuers who can offer their investment products in the form of a token.
On the other side of the marketplace there are investors who can invest through the VALOR
Platform and receive rewards for contributing to the growth of the platform.
Additionally, there are contributors, facilitators, and service providers who are all involved in the
process of value creation on the VALOR Platform. Since most of these players are dispersed
globally and represent independent entities, this is referred to as the VALOR network. The
network is built on principles of decentralized value creation. It is powered by its own currency,
the VALOR token. The principles of the VALOR token economy are described in Chapter 6.
The core value proposition for various players on different sides of the market can be summarized
as such:
Figure 9:
Value proposition of the VALOR Platform

ASSET ISSUERS

COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTORS

Access and engage with new investor audiences
- and raise funds faster through guided, fully
compliant asset tokenization.

Help to shape the future of finance. They earn
monetary rewards for their participation and
contribution.

To enable the decentralized value creation on the VALOR Platform, SMART VALOR is

24

implementing a task marketplace where contributors can engage in performing different tasks,
for example such as:
▪

Referring an asset to be considered for listing

▪

Voting on an asset that has been suggested for listing

▪

Contributing to the due diligence and collecting material data

▪

Writing an investment review suggestion

▪

Submitting performance predictions

▪

Building an educational library for digital assets

▪

Sharing their successful investment strategies

The key advantage for community members is that they can earn rewards for contributing their
expertise and create their own publicly verifiable reputation.

How does it work?
A good example is the participation in asset performance reviews. Here an expert can
submit a 12-month performance prediction for a specific asset, for example. If he has
profound asset-specific expertise, he will probably be able to give a more probable
performance prediction. If the prediction is right within a specific range, the smart contract
will unlock, and the expert will be paid. The quality of the prediction automatically builds
the expert's reputation. In this way, smart contracts enable a completely independent,
automated process of price discovery, reputation building, and contributing expertise in a
decentralized way.

To summarize, the VALOR network is designed to enable a truly decentralized marketplace in
which a large part of overall value is contributed by independent entities. Blockchain technology
makes it possible by extending the spectrum of tasks far beyond programming work to many
other activities, which are today delivered only within centralized financial institutions, such as
banks.

25

3.2 The product spectrum
The product spectrum of the VALOR Platform can be categorized in terms of asset classes which
will be rolled-out at different stages of the platform implementation. This categorization is in
correspondence with the regulatory requirements for issuance and distribution of different types
of tokens.
Figure 10
Asset class coverage

26

BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
These include protocols, decentralized
infrastructure (payment, storage computation)
and crypto mining.

NON-BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE
Traditional infrastructure and project financing
including renewable energy, transport, utility,
healthcare, and communication.

BLOCKCHAIN AND TECH-RELATED STARTUPS
Young companies that would like to issue their
shares in the form of tokens.

CURRENCIES
These include cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin),
crypto-fiat currencies (Tether and CHFt) and
stablecoins (MakerDao, Basecoin), etc.

NON-FUNGIBLE ASSETS
These include real estate, art, crypto collectibles,
etc.

FUNDS
Funds refer to crypto funds, venture capital and
private equity funds, etc.

METALS AND COMMODITIES
These include diamonds, gold, and other precious
metals

INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Including intellectual property rights, patents,
music rights, etc.

The VALOR Platform will be launched in two-stages:
1. Cryptocurrencies and non-security tokens (protocol, utility, and payment tokens)
2. Asset-backed security tokens, such as equity in young companies, real estate, crypto funds,
venture capital, and private equity
The above displayed tokenized assets will be offered on the VALOR Platform after the full launch
in 2019. The full roll-out can be viewed in 5.2 Implementation roadmap.
Since all these assets have very different characteristics, the tokenization or securitization of each
will follow a different procedure. Thus, it will be very difficult for any singular player to develop
and implement a broad variety of such tokenization approaches. This is the reason behind the
emergence of providers specialized on one asset class, such as art, real estate or commodities.
SMART VALOR is not striving to cover tokenization of all those diverse assets within the whole
range of the value chain. The company sees a bigger opportunity in partnering with specialized
platforms. The mission of SMART VALOR is to give investors better access and a broad offering
of tokenized alternative investments. Therefore, SMART VALOR will not issue any of its own
assets but only tokenize assets of third parties. The only exception to this rule is CHFt, which is
needed on the platform to power smart-contract based actions and faster interaction with other
platforms.
This strategy can be better understood if the process of tokenization is broken down into several
steps of the overall value chain. The tokenization of assets follows several phases such as:
1. Set-up phase: selection of asset, creation of legal entity, registration, financial and legal
due diligence, etc.
2. Structuring of token issuance, creation of token, development of smart contact
embedding of legal modalities into smart contract, etc.
3. Initial public listing of a token
4. Secondary offering of the token
5. Servicing of the token and redemption
For most assets, SMART VALOR will focus only on phases 2-5 and partner with other players
during phase 1. For example, a real estate crowdfunding specialist may use VALOR Platform to
tokenize particularly large or prominent property, while the whole set-up process (selection,
27

registration, legal set-up, structuring) is led by this provider. Another example would be a
specialized platform for commodities and metals. If there is a new attractive offering, the VALOR
Platform may serve as a distribution partner for primary or secondary listing.
However, within certain asset classes, such as funds, SMART VALOR is aiming at covering a larger
part of the value chain. For example, a venture capital fund might use the legal set-up service
within SMART VALOR’s network in addition to the tokenization service of the VALOR Platform and
holding the initial listing on the platform.

3.3 Targeted investor segment and potential market
size
The VALOR Platform seeks to attract both type of investors: individual and institutional, such as
family offices, asset managers, and banks.
On the side of individual investors, the major focus is on following two groups:
1. Traditional investors who aim for exposure to the new digital assets in a secure,
compliant way. These investors are interested in more long-term investments, have
limited technical background and prefer a simple user interface. They tend to have limited
experience with digital assets but are open to alternative investments.
2. Crypto investors from all over the world who want to diversify into more stable
alternatives such as real estate and private equity deploying cryptocurrencies. Many of
them come from developing countries and see the additional advantage in a safe-haven
jurisdiction which can protect their privacy and wealth.

28

Figure 11:
Global footprint with staged regional focus

1st Stage Countries

2nd Stage Countries

Strategically, the VALOR Platform is positioned as a global online investment platform. However,
during the initial roll-out stage it will focus its efforts on “home-turf”, which is Switzerland,
Liechtenstein, the EU and the UK. The analysis of the regional distribution of wealth shows that
the major opportunity for the ‘retailization’ of alternative investments lies in exactly this region.
Here the total wealth of USD78 trillion is concentrated in the segments of affluent and (lower)
high net worth individuals. Therefore, the company’s marketing efforts will be focused on this
region. This is also in alignment with its regulatory approach, as active promotion and distribution
of investment products constitutes an activity which needs to be licensed by local regulators.
The second stage of the roll-out will concentrate on cross-border business in following countries:
Japan, South Korea, China, India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, and the US.
These countries are not only very active in the cryptocurrency space, but also hold around
USD120 trillion wealth in SMART VALOR’S targeted segment.

In terms of the wealth segment, SMART VALOR will focus on investors with net liquid assets (NLA)
in the range of USD 100’000 to USD 5 million.
Historically, this wealth segment has been underserved by traditional Swiss banks and therefore
presents an extraordinary opportunity. As the top-down revenue pool sizing estimate: if the share
of alternative investment in the portfolios of the investors in this segment is assumed to equal 3%
on average, while digital assets and tokenized alternatives could represent 10%, this results in a
total asset pool of USD234 billion in Europe alone25. This estimate does not take into account
additional flows which will be generated as institutional investors start to open up to the digital
asset class.
If the VALOR Platform were to gain 20% market share as the first mover in this space, it would
result in an accumulation of USD46.8 billion in assets under management (AuM), which at a profit
margin of 0.5%, could result in USD234 million annual profit within 2-3 years of operation only in
the core European market. The global wealth and presence in the above-mentioned top 10 focus
countries could triple that number.
Another approach to revenue sizing is to look at the size of the digital assets today and make
projections about its growth. Looking at the development of the last two years, it becomes
apparent that digital assets today are at the very beginning of their exponential growth, which will
be enabled by further development and application of blockchain technology. Yet even though
the total crypto market capitalization reached USD830 billion at the peak this year, it stands in
contrast to the USD79 trillion traded in public equity. Assuming that even a small fraction of other
asset classes such as real estate, private and public equity are tokenized, the size of tokenized
assets could easily reach USD10 trillion in 2020.

The obvious winners of this tectonic shift will be marketplaces, exchanges and wallets. This was
confirmed by Goldman Sachs purchasing crypto exchange Poloniex through its company Circle
earlier this year27. Further proof is the explosive growth of platforms like Binance, Huobi, Bibox,
Kucoin and other crypto exchanges. Coinbase is reported to have accumulated over 12 million
users, while adding 50,000 new users daily during the peak times. Moreover, traditional
exchanges such as NYSE, ASX and SIX announced their plans and are already working on applying
the tokenization of assets28.
Here it is important to note that SMART VALOR does not compete with traditional exchanges
pursuing tokenization of already listed public companies. Its focus is on the niche market of
alternative investments which goes beyond equity and bonds traded on traditional exchanges.
The company believes that the trend of tokenization which started with ICOs, has the potential to
extend into VC, crypto funds and ultimately the PE sector as well. This is where it holds maximum
added value, as tokenization of these relatively illiquid investments has the potential to
significantly improve accessibility for lower wealth investors with a shorter investment horizon.
In terms of size, the Private Equity industry is big, growing beyond USD2.5 trillion total assets. It
also exhibits strong performance: over the last 15 years, PE generated average annual returns of
14.5%, compared with only 7% in the public equity market.29 PE is therefore very well suited to
improve the overall performance of an investment portfolio and diversify risk.
As ICOs are likely to morph into a new form of IPO and further disintermediate VC players 30, there
is a big revenue potential in this space. Within the next three years, the tokenization of VC and PE
funds could reach up to USD112 billion, as demonstrated in Figure 14.

3.4 Revenue and distribution model
Positioned as a multisided marketplace, the VALOR Platform holds the advantage of multitudes of
revenue streams including the following:

31

▪

Listing fees for initial placement of tokenized assets

▪

Transaction fees accruing from buy/sell transactions

▪

Custody fees for providing storage solution for crypto assets

▪

Servicing fees for opening and maintaining banking accounts for investors and partners31

▪

Commission on the provision of services delivered through the VALOR network partners
and community contributors

After receiving a banking license through SMART VALOR AG

33

The VALOR Platform’s distribution model consists of own and third-party channels:

1. Own distribution channels

Starting with centralized exchange functionality, the platform is planning to move into the space
of decentralized auctions and asset swaps. Here, investors onboarded to the VALOR Platform can
use their wallets to participate in investment opportunities on other open platforms. This will
significantly enlarge the scope of the financial product offering. The prerequisite however, is the
compatibility with KYC/AML procedures as well as investment suitability requirements. This is a
new promising area for decentralized investment platforms in which the VALOR Platform is set
to play a leading role.

3.5 Competitive advantage
The tokenization of assets and distribution of digital assets is a very new field, which has not yet
been accessed by established financial institutions like banks and asset managers. Currently most
of the new tokenization platforms are operating in stealth mode or limited to the non-security
token space. Very few are considering traditional alternative investments for tokenization.
The two major challenges for all these business models are security and solving the regulatory
issues on the way to enable global listing of security tokens. SMART VALOR is uniquely positioned
in Switzerland, where the trusted relationship with authorities has been built over years of close
collaboration.
Positioning itself as the quality place for tokenized assets, focusing on security32 and fully
compliant operations, SMART VALOR is leveraging its base in Switzerland, one of the most cryptofriendly jurisdictions with impeccable reputation and status of the 5th largest global banking
center specialized in wealth management.
Therefore, SMART VALOR is building on three core competitive advantages:
1. Unique application of blockchain technology
2. Technical security expertise in the crypto space
3. Regulatory and reputational advantages
SMART VALOR’s technical team consists of leading experts in the IT technology and security field.
Additionally, the company is partnering with several security providers, including the leading
provider of exchange software, and other members of Ethereum Alliance. As the first step,

32 Smart

Valor. (2018). SMART VALOR leads the way on crypto custody, joining Ledger Vault. Retrieved from
https://smartvalor.com/smart-valor-leads-the-way-on-crypto-custody-joining-ledger-vault/

34

SMART VALOR has built a working prototype on permissioned blockchain for issuance of securities
in a secure and compliant way 33.
Additionally, jointly with its partners, SMART VALOR has implemented functionality of the
centralized exchange and complemented it with its own development in the field of decentralized
exchange functionality and smart-contract-based auctions. While focusing on issuance and
distribution of blockchain-based securities provided by third parties, there will be several
platform-native assets such as VALOR token and CHFt.
The implementation of the Tokenized Swiss Franc (CHFt) has a purpose to act as the settlement
layer not only within the VALOR Platform, but also be easily deployable on other investment
platforms and exchanges. The deep tech expertise in tokenization of assets represents one
component of the SMART VALOR competitive advantage.
In addition to this, there is a wide range of advantages connected to the regulatory and
reputational advantages of being in Switzerland/Liechtenstein.
To better understand the strategic positioning of SMART VALOR, it is necessary to summarize the
advantages of Switzerland as the core legal jurisdiction and home base for its platform.
Switzerland is one of the top five global banking centers and the worldwide leader in offshore
wealth management, holding around one quarter of all global offshore assets (ca. USD4 trillion) 34.
Switzerland is in an unchallenged position due to its political stability, safe-haven currency and
excellent reputation.
Over the last two years, there was a sharp turn in the direction of regulatory policy concerning
blockchain in Switzerland. The Swiss government took the decision to liberalize regulation to
promote Switzerland to a leading center of crypto finance. Swiss ex-president, and current
Finance Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann even proclaimed 'Crypto Nation' Switzerland
beginning in 201835.
The first major milestone in the Swiss regulatory space was licensing approval for one of the
largest Bitcoin custodians, Xapo. This case was led by Olga Feldmeier (CEO of SMART VALOR) and
became one of the most decisive moves taken by Swiss regulator FINMA to signal the willingness
of the regulator to open the doors to global crypto businesses36.
Furthermore, FINMA demonstrated openness to the crypto industry as the country became the
largest hub for ICOs37. Recently, FINMA issued ICO guidelines38 which provide clarity on the
country's regulatory approach to token sales. It emphasizes that FINMA wants to enable
compliant ICOs for legitimate innovators39. It continues to pursue prudent, principle-based,

technology-neutral regulation, which is currently the only sensible approach due to the very early
stage of this technology40.
The country’s focus on quality ICO companies is in full alignment with the SMART VALOR
approach. The goal of the VALOR Platform is to become the place for listing of the best companies
and projects.

3.6 Strategic competitive positioning
To better understand how the VALOR Platform is different from other players in the space, it is
helpful to visualize its place in the product-client segment matrix as shown below:
Figure 16:
Strategic positioning of the VALOR Platform in a product-client segment view

In this illustration, it is easy to see that the VALOR Platform is not comparable neither with crypto
exchanges such as Binance nor traditional exchanges such as NYSE or SIX. Obviously, it is also very
different from traditional banks. Its business model is closer to wealth management platforms
(roboadvisors), the key difference is that it is focused exclusively on digital assets and tokenized
alternative investments.

3.6.1 Competitive landscape: incumbents
In relation to existing financial institutions, SMART VALOR is primarily a challenger to traditional
Swiss banks, which are today among the largest and most profitable global players in the whole
financial services industry 41.

On the side of disruptive newcomers, currently there are very few projects in the space that have
comparable product-segment focus as the VALOR Platform. Being a Swiss company with deep
roots in Swiss private banking and the cryptocurrency industry, SMART VALOR sees a major
opportunity in the intersection of these two.
Comparable business models vary between platforms strictly focused on provision of tokenization

4. The technology behind the VALOR
Platform
SMART VALOR established a strong tech team of 20 led by two co-founders Dr. Julien Bringer and
Thomas Felber42. Currently there are 7 developers working full time on the implementation of the
VALOR Platform. Additionally, the company is extending its blockchain capabilities through
partnerships with several technology providers such as Ledger43 and one of the leading providers
of exchange solutions. SMART VALOR is also member of the Ethereum Alliance and other
associations.
As the first step, the VALOR team has built a working prototype on permissioned blockchain for
issuance of securities on the blockchain in a secure and compliant way44. Jointly with its partners,
SMART VALOR has implemented functionality of the centralized exchange and complemented it
with their own development in the field of decentralized exchange functionality and smartcontract-based auctions.
The team has designed a system that relies on an initial set of core functionalities and multiple
connections to the ecosystem, with the following philosophy:
▪

Blockchain-agnostic (internally and in terms of interfaces to external)

▪

Hybrid approach to enable trading

▪

A fully licensed and centralized exchange functionality for tokenized securities and
cryptocurrencies has been built

▪

Supporting decentralized price discovery, trade, and settlement directly on-chain

▪

Security-driven

▪

Open source for a significant part of the development

▪

Open APIs for 3rd party developers

▪

Interfaces to data feeds, oracles and ecosystem participants

4.1 Platform layers
The VALOR Platform consists of the several layers depicted in Figure 18.
The system is both a platform with applications, services and interfaces (including interfaces with
permissionless blockchains like Ethereum), and a network, as the company embeds their own
consortium blockchain with nodes that will be distributed among key network participants. The
consortium blockchain addresses the need to cope with today’s regulatory constraints (e.g.
controlling the transaction source and recipient for some assets) and to track all unitary
operations more efficiently. Nevertheless, the interface with an external permissionless
blockchain will be exploited to anchor the state of the VALOR Chain regularly.

network, to accelerate the go-to-market.
With the initial deliveries, third parties will be able to develop applications that offer additional
components and services, with SMART VALOR continuing to bring improvement to the core
platform and attached services. Some of the services and applications are provided free of charge;
others can be purchased or paid for through licensing agreements.

41

Figure 19:
Main components of the VALOR Platform

Consortium and public blockchain
Certain circumstances require assets to be
deployed on the VALOR Chain or another
private blockchain - e.g. asset issuers'
requirements, regulatory constraints. In
other instances, assets can be deployed to a
public blockchain.

App marketplace
Third party providers or individual
contributors can build applications on top of
the VALOR Platform. The community can
purchase or license these apps via the app
marketplace.

ICO platform with tokenization engine
Built-in smart contract sub-modules combine
and are parameterized to represent the asset
to be tokenized. The existence, legal
ownership and status of the underlying
assets are ensured via a dedicated process
during asset issuance. This includes checking
legal documents, institutional audits and
notary deposits. Appropriate safeguards (e.g.
custody) are taken to check that the token
model/smart contract is consistent with the
asset.

Task marketplace
The VALOR Platform enables decentralized
value creation. Contribute your Participants
can contribute their expertise where they
can, with coding, research, performance
predictions and more. Positive reviews from
the community, an accurate performance
prediction, etc., will build their publicly
verifiable reputation and increase their
earning potential.

Governance and voting engine
As a decentralized network, the governance
of a large proportion of the VALOR Platform
is in the hands of the community, who can
vote on decisions, contribute to polls,
introduce petitions, and more. Some central
responsibility is needed at the start of the
platform's life, particularly around regulatory
compliance matters. But once the
community is big enough, with services
capable of managing it, more decentralized
governance will be sustainable.

Rewards and bounty programs
Active stakeholders can earn rewards from
participating in the VALOR Platform in a way
that upholds what it stands for. Examples
are engagement in opinion polls, being
involved in governance matters, giving input
on new assets being considered for listing,
providing capital and liquidity etc. The
reward program can also be deployed by
asset issuers.

Decentralized auctioning marketplace
A smart contract-enabled auction
marketplace facilitates price discovery and
supports liquidity in infrequently traded
assets, for both investors and asset issuers.

Licensed exchange
List and trade asset tokens and
cryptocurrency on the VALOR exchange,
which accommodates all regulatory
constraints.

Authentication and identity
Robust protocols are in place to authenticate
and manage user IDs. Multi-factor
authentication is implemented.

Secure custody for crypto assets
Hold your tokenized assets safely and
securely in VALOR accounts or wallets. The
technology also interfaces seamlessly with
hardware wallets.

Portfolio management
Manage, update and review the VALOR
investment portfolio from a user-friendly
dashboard, available on desktop and mobile.
Integrate risk analysis and performance
prediction apps from the app marketplace.

4.3 SMART VALOR approach to decentralized
trading
The VALOR Platform follows a hybrid approach – apart from the initial centralized trading
platform, decentralized trading will also be supported. The first type of decentralized trading on
the VALOR Platform will be an implementation of smart-contract based auctions for less liquid
assets performed on both public and consortium blockchains. The current lack of liquidity on
decentralized exchanges is connected to user experience, which does not hide the complexity
underneath the operations for the less tech-savvy users.
Decentralized auctions for illiquid assets can be implemented by means of smart contracts along
the same lines of ENS45. These types of auctions will likely be sealed-bid auctions. In the current
prototype (www.smartvalor.io) SMART VALOR has implemented the reverse Dutch auction type.
This will keep bids secret in a public blockchain, where everyone can check the amount of
transactions sent to the network. Bidders are not actually required to send their bids in clear text,
but instead they generate salt and hash for the tuple (salt, amount) before sending it to the
contract together with a sum which is always in excess to the minimum bid allowed to their actual
secret bid. Locking more money than is actually offered in a bid is a way to hide the real amount.
Once the bidding period closes, the bidders have to reveal their bids during the “reveal period”
and the smart contract will verify the consistency among the revealed and actual bids. Once the
bids are revealed and verified, the winner is selected, the trade is settled, the assets transferred
and any excess money unlocked is sent back.
A great advantage of this approach is the full decentralization in the operations which are not
bound by the scope of the VALOR Platform, but will allow participants from other platforms with
their own wallets to directly participate in the auctions.
However, the above mechanism must be conciliated with the nature of asset-backed tokens
which require a strong enforcement of regulatory aspects. For this purpose, the identities of the
participants and the provenance of their assets should be managed. This does not necessarily
mean that they should disclose their identities to all parties involved, but at least they must
provide cryptographic proof that the funds are cleared and AML requirements are satisfied. The
details of this cryptographic proof can be embedded along the same lines of verification of
regulated token protocols mentioned above.
Another issue to be managed with sealed auctions on blockchain is scalability. Even in the case of
a limited number of bids for a given illiquid asset, it is still inefficient to place all of them on the
main chain, including those that will be discarded. Because an auction is basically a contract
involving a number of bidders and one seller, it makes sense to enroll participants beforehand
and to manage the bidding and revealing period in an off-chain yet decentralized way. In this
regard, a side chain solution like the ones described in EOS or the Plasma chain described by Poon
and Buterin46 are promising to build the decentralized trading functionalities in a public
blockchain, but within a confined environment otherwise only achievable with consortium
blockchains.

4.4 The VALOR Protocol
While there are many established protocols for decentralized trading of utility tokens around,
protocols to facilitate security tokens are still in their infancy. With development of the VALOR
protocol SMART VALOR is aiming at facilitating decentralized trading and governance of security
tokens.
A security token is in most instances modeled after existing securities - such as bonds, equities,
funds, derivatives, etc. When dealing in these securities the following challenges arise:
▪

Adherence to Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) regulations
in applicable countries

▪

Investor suitability criteria, prospectus and solicitation requirements

▪

Pricing and price discovery mechanisms

▪

Governance procedures through voting and consensus amongst owners

▪

Asset type specific functionality e.g. to handle dividend payments, payment terms,
reporting, staking, etc.

These challenges can be handled on the VALOR Platform through centralized services. But in
order to move in the direction of decentralized trading of securities, a set of open source smart
contracts will be provided. Here they are referred to collectively as the VALOR Protocol.
Currently, SMART VALOR is focusing on smart contracts for whitelisting wallets under Swiss
regulatory requirements (KYC/AML, investor suitability etc.) and, as demonstrated in the current
demo, on auction-based ownership transfer mechanisms. Over the coming months, SMART
VALOR will be rolling out a set of smart contracts for the respective asset categories traded on the
VALOR Platform (real estate, equity in startups, and special purpose vehicles/investment funds).
Further details on the VALOR Protocol will be released in a technical paper in the Q4 2018-Q1
2019 along with the code on the SMART VALOR GitHub repository.

4.5 Security and custody
4.5.1 Custody solution for crypto assets
Maintaining the security of assets is certainly the most critical functionality in the crypto space.
However, today there is no sufficiently complete solution for institutional investors, which still
lack the robust compliance frameworks and security tools to safeguard assets effectively.
To provide security for the platform assets and for the user accounts, SMART VALOR has decided
to deploy significant efforts in order to build its own secure custody solution. This will ensure its
development on strong roots instead of starting from the ground, notably relying on several top
security technology providers.
During the Consensus conference this year in New York, SMART VALOR jointly announced a
partnership with Ledger for the establishment of an enterprise-grade custody solution for digital
assets.47 After selling more than one million Nano S hardware wallets for digital assets, Ledger has
created an early access program for Ledger Vault. This new program provides asset security
through, in particular, Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and secure authentication of the
operators to the HSMs.
Figure 20:
Enterprise-Grade Vault Solution

During the Q3-Q4 2018, SMART VALOR is working with Ledger to develop a set of hardware and
software security features for digital assets. By combining the security of vault technology
together with additional layers of security, SMART VALOR will be a secure custody for crypto
assets.

4.5.2 Security strategy
From the very beginning, SMART VALOR identified the crucial importance of the security of the
platform and its processes. Security is vital for ensuring long-term resilience for end users, for
achieving the highest requirements as equivalent to current financial market practices and in
meeting regulatory expectations.
As the VALOR Platform relies on blockchain technology, security is an important aspect. Some of
the core known threats are: leakage of cryptographic keys, weakness of the consensus
mechanism, no identity assurance, and integrity alteration of content. Nevertheless, security (and
when needed, privacy) of blockchain technologies is a topic that is constantly being studied and
improved on. While SMART VALOR relies on existing solutions, the team is also continuously
monitoring new developments, with a view to implementing more reliable technologies as they
evolve in order to rigorously eliminate security risks.
On the other hand, the security of a blockchain system cannot be reduced to the sole question of
the security of the blockchain backbone. The whole system implementation and the enabled
usage modes introduce many more security risks that are often hidden behind the blockchain
context. They include: smart contract implementation and deployment threats, the security of
compatible wallets, the high-end security of custodies, and the security measures required at the
software layer, in particular for the applications and the system components interfaces.
The complexity and recentness of all but Bitcoin blockchain technologies, mean that system
security is still an important challenge for a system provider. Bitcoin is in use at significant scale,
its code has been extensively reviewed for almost 10 years, and its functionalities are kept simple.
This is not the case for other blockchain technologies, even for Ethereum, which is the main
technology used today for token generation.
These technologies offer more functionalities (e.g. smart contracts), with very recent applications
built on top, and their use comes with high complexity for most users. Smart contract
development programming requires a new mindset to manage actions that are, for the most part,
irreversible and where bailouts are not granted. Despite this, smart contracts currently stand as
the most transparent and automated way to execute complex financial transactions.
Several breaches, coins/tokens loss or theft and bugs with, for example, wallets and smart
contracts (increasingly since early 2017 with ICOs) have emphasized the urgency to manage the
use of blockchain technology as a complete system. This requires the implementation of
46

appropriate security measures to achieve end-to-end security. The vision is beginning to be
shared by different stakeholders, as illustrated by the Cryptocurrency Security Standard, which
lists some good practices 48, and the new ISO standards projects under development49 in the
working group led by SMART VALOR co-founder Julien Bringer.
SMART VALOR is fully aligned with this system approach and it will be continuously addressed
through overall software security, organization and risk management and by following other
classical practices. The company will also implement more specific measures dedicated to its
context, in particular security of wallets and secure custody. While perfect security is not possible,
they will work to improve its system constantly.
Secure custody, wallet security, system security, smart contract security, strong authentication,
blockchain security are the major elements that have been considered. Concerning smart contract
security, this is in particular covered by security audits (internal and external), reuse of existing
building blocks, release of code for community review, early deployment on testnets, formal
specification up to formal validation when possible.
An overview of the main security measures in the process of implementation on the VALOR
platform is provided in Appendix II. Details about some of these points are covered in ad-hoc
documents that will be released on the SMART VALOR website.

5. Current status and implementation
roadmap
5.1 SMART VALOR’s regulatory approach
Building the next-generation financial institution means overcoming regulatory hurdles. Rather
than applying existing inappropriate rules which would stifle the business, SMART VALOR’s
approach is to shape the new regulatory framework by working closely together with authorities
and regulators in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
The SMART VALOR team has an impressive track-record in overcoming regulatory challenges. The
CEO and co-founder Olga Feldmeier led the licensing efforts of Xapo, which is one of the largest
Bitcoin custodians today50. She facilitated the regulatory solution with the Swiss financial
regulator, which became one of the most important cryptocurrency regulatory case globally51.
Looking at the competitive landscape, today most crypto exchanges and wallets are not
authorized, and act without clear regulatory approval52. Such practices cut short on investor
protection and expose asset issuers to additional risks connected to non-compliant activity and
money laundry.
SMART VALOR is clearly distancing itself from such practices. It has dedicated significant resources
and time to securing regulatory approval prior to the launch of the platform.
In the first stage, SMART VALOR secured the approval to operate as Financial Intermediary in
Switzerland as member of the VQF SRO, an officially recognized self-regulatory organization
pursuant to the Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act. This regulatory status enables the VALOR
Platform to offer cryptocurrencies, payment, and utility tokens on its platform. This is the first
major regulatory milestone along the implementation roadmap.
The second stage is the receival of a banking license. Due to the delay in the introduction of
Swiss ‘banking light’ license for fintech innovators, SMART VALOR took the decision to pursue a
banking license in Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein has the strategic advantage of being part of the
European Economic Area. This makes it a member of the European Union passporting system for
banking institutions. The passporting system enables a financial institution from one EU country
to operate without licensing in any of the other 28 EU countries.
A banking license as such is not needed for a marketplace. However, it has a strong strategic
advantage. As significant proportion of payments into and out of the platform will be channeled
through cryptocurrency, difficulties with finding reliable banking partners are expected. Receiving
its own banking license will provide the VALOR Platform with independent status and reduce

operational risks connected with possible closure of bank accounts. This problem was
exasperated during 2018 as all Swiss banks stopped working with crypto and blockchain
companies53. Several banks in Liechtenstein remained open charging extremely high fees (of up to
2%) on ICO related capital flows. 54
Additionally, to reducing dependency on banks, it offers a regulatory framework for global
distribution of securities. Starting with a focus on the European Union the VALOR Platform will
expand into global distribution within certain segments.
SMART VALOR will also leverage its banking license to support the VALOR network partners with
provision of banking services such as bank accounts in payments. Near to mid-term, this setting
can be considered as a significant competitive advantage of the VALOR Platform.
Finally, as the regulatory environment for ICOs and cryptocurrencies becomes more restrictive in
many countries such as China, India and the USA, the number of crypto companies coming to this
region continues to grow. Switzerland's regulatory advantage combined with its highly reputable
banking center has already attracted more than 400 crypto companies (including Xapo, Bitmain,
Bitfinex, Status, Aragon, etc.)
In most cases, these foreign players underestimate the resources and time it takes to establish
trust and a working relationship with local authorities and institutions. As a native Swiss company
headquartered in Swiss Crypto Valley (Canton Zug) with years of experience doing business in
Switzerland, this is a strong key differentiator for SMART VALOR55.

OFFLINE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL ESTABLISHED
From the very beginning, while the technical platform was in development and licensing
process underway, SMART VALOR started to build brand awareness and offline
distribution channels. One of such is the flagship conference series Crypto Summit
(www.cryptosummit.ch).
Conducted bi-annually for the first time in September 2017, the conference has
established itself as Europe’s premier blockchain event, held in the heart of Swiss Crypto
Valley. The latest spring edition, Crypto Summit, took place in March 2018 and became
the largest blockchain conference in Switzerland. The conference drew key policy makers,
global industry leaders, investors and leading ICO projects from around the world with
1,400 participants from 40 countries, 34’000 via livestream, over 100 speakers and 50
exhibitors. The companies which announced their ICO at our Crypto Summit conferences
have already raised over USD300m.
In the summer of 2018, SMART VALOR has additionally rolled-out the Crypto Summit
World Tour targeted at growing its global footprint and brand recognition. Strategically,
this is an important part of our distribution engine which combines offline and online
channels. The next conferences are scheduled for 28-29 October 2018 and April 2019.

5.3 The VALOR Platform prototype
A first functional prototype of the VALOR Platform has been developed. The prototype was
revealed at Finovate in March 2018 in London. The recording of the live demo is available on the
official Finovate site:
http://finovate.com/videos/finovateeurope-2018-smart-valor/
The functional prototype of the VALOR Platform can be accessed and tested on
www.smartvalor.io.
Investors can navigate within the platform to easily visualize the different investment
opportunities available. They can dive into detailed information in order to conduct due diligence
and manage existing and future investments.

activities, like surveys, ballots for deciding the next assets to be selected, prediction models, new
software widgets, applications in the marketplace and so on. This participation will be rewarded.
The goal is to give the community the opportunity to drive the future developments of the VALOR
Platform and to ensure extensibility of the platform to new features and technologies.

6. The VALOR token
6.1 The role of the token in the business model
Most online marketplaces or networks face the challenge of scaling when they launch. Named as
the chicken-and-egg-problem and translated into investment platform terminology it can be
formulated like this: an increase in the number and quality of investment opportunities offered
through third party asset issuers increases the attractiveness of the platform to investors. In
turn a growing number of investors increases the attractiveness for asset issuers to place their
assets on the platform.
This phenomenon is called by economists the network effect: the platform’s value to any given
user largely depends on the number of users on the network’s other side. 60 Once the marketplace
reaches a critical inflection point, network effects kick in and growth follows an exponential,
rather than linear, trajectory.61
Since the VALOR Platform is a multisided marketplace, its main goal is to grow fast to achieve
network effect. The new enabler of the scaling can be found in the birth of a token (crypto)
economy that creates its own wealth via new business models, and peer-to-peer transactional
relationships between participants.62
This is the main goal of the introduction of the platform native currency, the VALOR token. The
design of the token is targeted at creating an incentive for participants to contribute and to
benefit from the value creation on the VALOR Platform. Providing the right incentives and
benefits is critical to attract a large community of investors, asset issuers and contributors.
Therefore, the token functionality is structured around utility it gives to the user of the platform.
A circular token economy is created through the built-in mechanism in which participants can
earn VALOR tokens for their contributions, but also spend them when using services or staking
them in order to obtain special benefits. With this goal in mind, the VALOR token is a tool to
achieve deeper engagement of a wider community of investors, partners and contributors, who in
turn will be the key beneficiaries of the growth of the platform.

6.2 Participants of the network
In a simplified sense, the VALOR network consists of the following stakeholder groups: investors,
asset issuers, facilitators and contributors.
Figure 27:
Stakeholder groups

THE INVESTOR GROUP
Consists of individual and institutional
investors seeking to gain portfolio
exposure to the new digital asset class
and tokenized real-world assets.
Within the group of institutional
investors, in particular, SMART VALOR
targets the following:

THE ASSET ISSUER
This term is referred collectively to
partners seeking to issue and
distribute their tokens on the VALOR
Platform. Within this group the key
stakeholders are:

THE CONTRIBUTORS AND
FACILITATORS
are a heterogeneous group of service
providers such as:

▪

Individual investors

▪

Independent wealth managers

▪

Asset management companies

▪

Family offices

▪

Venture capital and crypto funds

▪

Banks and other financial intermediaries

▪

Crypto hedge funds

▪

Venture capital and private equity funds

▪

Real estate issuers/owner

▪

Startups and growth companies and other issuers

▪

Placement agents and sponsors

▪

Market maker and liquidity providers

▪

Due diligence provider and legal advisors

▪

Fiduciaries and custodians for collateral

▪

Auditing firms

▪

Developer (e.g. smart contracts, apps)

▪

Individual contributors

Contributors are individuals who are participating in the VALOR task marketplace and contributing
to the development of the VALOR Platform. Facilitators are companies involved in provision of
services along the asset life cycle.
Certain partners can fall into multiple categories. For instance, a Venture Capital fund can use the
platform for deal flow (investor), to raise capital for the fund (asset issuer), but also place
portfolio companies for listing (facilitator).

59

6.3 How the VALOR token is used
The token will be issued as an ERC-20 token compliant to the public Ethereum blockchain. The
token is classified as a utility and payment token.
Figure 28:
How VALOR token is used
FUNCTION / UTILITY

Membership stake

Loyalty and reward program

DESCRIPTION
While the platform is open to members and non-members alike,
holding of a certain amount of VALOR tokens (“staking”) grants
special benefits or access to additional functionality and services.

Rewards will be offered to active contributors to the network. There
are various programs for the different stakeholder groups, e.g.
rewards for active investors, paybacks for asset issuers, rewards for
contributors of work. Membership status is needed to access most
of the reward programs.
Holding VALOR tokens alone without any active contribution of
work/expertise will not grant any revenue participation.

Payment

VALOR token can be used to pay for the platform’s service fees.
Certain services (e.g. transaction fees, listing fees, application fees)
are discounted when paid for with VALOR token.

Survey participation and
voting

Holding VALOR tokens enables participation in surveys and voting
polls. Depending on the vote, the participant’s quantity of VALOR
tokens will be used in weighing the results. From a legal perspective
the voting results are non-binding.

Bridge currency for trading

VALOR token will be one of the bridge currencies listed on the
VALOR Platform and as such will help to improve liquidity across
tokenized assets.

VALOR tokens are deployed and transferred within the VALOR network. The tokens can also be
circulated outside the network and beyond the circle of people registered in it. VALOR tokens will
be listed for trading on the VALOR Platform as well as other major crypto exchanges.
The VALOR token has been designed to incentivize and foster the network of partners, investors,
and contributor and community participation on the VALOR network. To this end, different
functionalities are embedded in the token model, relevant to the different stakeholder groups
and marketplace participants.

Over time, as the network grows, additional utility functions will be implemented. Mainly in the
area of decentralized trading of real assets, consensus algorithm of the permissioned VALOR
chain, curation and prediction markets. These kinds of implementations require further research,
development and also legal groundwork. SMART VALOR will contribute to this research and
expect to roll out additional functionality over time.

6.4.1 The VALOR Platform membership types
Private and institutional users of the VALOR Platform can become members of the VALOR
network. The membership is acquired through the staking of a certain amount of the VALOR
tokens or alternatively holding the VALOR token in their VALOR user wallet. Depending on the
type of membership, a specific amount of VALOR tokens needs to be staked. The minimum
membership duration is 12 months. If the user decides to end the membership, the staked tokens
will be released back to the user at the end of the membership period.

There are several benefits connected to this kind of staking:
▪

It improves "stickiness" of the platform incentivizing members to stay with the platform.

▪

It serves as an insurance against possible misconduct or non-compliance with obligations
from the side of asset issuers or service providers.

▪

It drives the demand for VALOR tokens: with an increasing number of network members,
there is increasing demand for VALOR tokens.

The range of benefits and number of staked tokens is dependent on the type of membership.
VALOR Prime Partners are eligible to participate in CHFt application
Institutional Partners such as crypto currency exchanges, crypto funds and banks require Prime
Partner membership to be able to deploy tokenized Swiss Franc (CHFt). This membership can be
received through staking of 200’000 VALOR tokens. For these kinds of partners, participation in
the pre-sale offers a low-cost entry to the VALOR network as, at this stage, the tokens are sold
with additional bonus.
After the initial 12-month lock-up period of their VALOR tokens for any type of membership,
investors or partners can either extend the membership or end it selling their stake to other
participants of the platform that are interested in obtaining the membership. As the platform
scales and more investors compete for purchase of the membership, the value of the membership
is expected to grow. In the same fashion, as the number of partners interested in issuing their
investment products on the platform grows, so grows the demand for the VALOR partner
membership, while the total supply of the memberships is limited by the number of VALOR
tokens in circulation.
These represent only some highlighted benefits. The full and final list of services included in each
membership package will be released during the operational launch of the platform and adjusted
as additional functionality is being developed.

62

6.4.2 The loyalty and rewards program for members
To achieve a broad engagement and to reward active users, various incentives such as loyalty and
reward programs will be launched. Most of the reward programs distribute VALOR tokens. Access
to loyalty and reward programs requires the staking of VALOR token. The higher tiered loyalty
levels and programs are exclusive to the above presented membership packages (requiring an
even higher staking/holding of VALOR token).
To earn the rewards and contribute to the development of the network, users can take several
actions:
▪

Actively trading on the secondary market

▪

Investing in initial listings

▪

Referring of new users/investors

▪

Introducing investment opportunities and syndication

▪

Other forms of participation in the decentralized value through the VALOR task market
such as contributing code, introducing asset issuers, participating in due diligence,
participating in asset voting, writing performance reviews, submitting performance
predictions, etc.

On the other side, for institutional users there are specific rewards:
▪

Rewards for introduction of co-investment opportunities (for funds)

▪

Participation in retrocession fee schedule (for wealth managers)

▪

Redemption of listing fees, if an issuance attracts new investors to the platform (for asset
issuers)

This listing represents an excerpt from the full list which will be finalized and published at the
launch of the platform.

6.4.3 The payment function of VALOR token
Any participant can use VALOR tokens to pay for services of the VALOR Platform, such as listing
fees, transaction fees, custody fees, etc. The services can be paid in fiat money or
cryptocurrencies. However, if paid in VALOR tokens, the fees are discounted. This creates an
incentive for asset issuers and investors to purchase VALOR tokens to pay for usage of the
platform in the platform.
When paying with VALOR tokens, services will be discounted according to the schedule presented
in Figure 30.

Third parties and partners offering services on the network can choose to accept VALOR tokens as
payment but are not required to do so. When accepting VALOR tokens, these third parties can
choose if they want to offer discounts.

6.5 The circular token economy
This constant flow of VALOR tokens going through reward distribution, purchasing, staking,
release, sale and payment creates a natural circular token economy which incentivizes the users
of the platform. Users can earn or purchase tokens in order to stake them for membership
benefits or to benefit from discounted payment terms. They can trade tokens on open
marketplaces but also redeem them for services provided by SMART VALOR or other VALOR
Platform participants.

Asset issuers can purchase and stake tokens to become VALOR (Prime) Partners to issue
their assets on the VALOR Platform.

▪

Individual investors can earn, purchase and stake tokens to become VALOR Prime
Investors to benefit from exclusive rights of the membership.

▪

Facilitators and Contributors can purchase and stake tokens to become part of the VALOR
network of contributors and preferred service providers.

At the same time, every participant of the VALOR network can:
▪

Spend VALOR tokens to pay for additional services of the platform on discounted terms

▪

Sell their VALOR tokens on the open market

The circular flow of VALOR tokens between the platform users should facilitate “stickiness” of the
platform, increase trust and reduce transaction costs normally connected with service provision

64

in an open marketplace. Overall this circular token economy as a key element of the business
model of the VALOR Platform should crucially support the growth of the VALOR network.

6.6 The launch of the VALOR Platform
The VALOR token will be the first token to be listed on the VALOR Platform as first proof of the
institutional-grade issuance and trading capabilities, followed by trading of selected crypto
currencies, utility and payment token prior to the roll out of security tokens in a second stage of
platform implementation.
Upon launch of the VALOR Platform, the introduction of memberships and staking of the VALOR
tokens aims to enable an early access to the platform to a limited number of stakeholders. As
explained in the previous chapter, this group of stakeholders enjoys a specific set of benefits
connected to the usage of the VALOR Platform.
Limited supply of VALOR memberships
The number of available memberships at any time is defined by the number of VALOR tokens
available on the open market and number of tokens required for staking. The total number of
VALOR tokens minted is limited to 100 million. Of this, only 45 million will be distributed during
the sale in 2018, which creates a smart-contract enacted limit on the initial total amount of
available memberships.
During the launch of the VALOR Platform, a certain VALOR token allocation is targeted as
presented in Figure 32. This allocation will be supported through the SMART VALOR approach to
the token sale and different engagement campaigns.

As a result, SMART VALOR aims to sell around 100 VALOR Partner and 100 VALOR Prime Partner
memberships. The asset issuer that manages to acquire VALOR tokens during pre-sale or ICO will
significantly benefit from the low-cost entry to the VALOR Platform and benefits connected with
these memberships. The same is true for participants on the other side of the market - investors.
SMART VALOR aims to initially distribute only 100 VALOR Prime memberships to institutional
investors and around 20,000 memberships to individual investors.
In this model, similar to a traditional stock exchange model such as the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE), there is only a limited number of memberships that are available at any given time.
Therefore, the price of the membership fluctuates depending on supply and demand for the
memberships. On the NYSE, the price of the membership can reach USD2.5 million during the high
economic activity cycle.

66

Figure 33:

TIME
As the confidence and the size of the network grows, the company expects early adopters of the
platform to be the key beneficiaries of the successful scaling of the VALOR Platform.
Here it is important to note that SMART VALOR plans to dedicate a significant part of revenues
to the incentivization of the Platform users through the enactment of a comprehensive rewards
program. The prerequisite for participation in the rewards program is the holding of a respective
VALOR token stake.
Finally, it needs to be pointed out that the company foresees the network growth being
uninhibited by the limited number of memberships. Memberships represent the incentive for
early adopters of the platform. These early adopters become vital stakeholders in shaping the
development of the platform, contributing to the selection of investment products through
voting, sourcing deals, providing insights and due diligence process and contributing to the
technical development of the platform. The more actively they contribute, the greater the
financial benefit will be. If, however, they choose not to engage, the upside potential might lie for
them in the appreciation due to the limited supply of the tokens and memberships.

6.7 Comparable token-based models
Token-based platforms are a relatively new invention in terms of the business model design.
Currently there are a lot of protocols and DApps being developed with different purposes and
monetization criteria. Until recently however, there were very few token-based investment
platforms closely comparable to the VALOR Platform.
To a certain degree, the VALOR Platform can be compared to token-based cryptocurrency
exchanges such as Binance and Huobi. These exchanges issued their own token to act as payment
for the use of the exchange on discounted terms (for example). Since September 2017, the BNB
token realized a stunning 22,660% return within 4.1 months, while Huobi peaked at 277% in 7
months respectively.67

Figure 34:
Binance, LTM price and volume68

Figure 35:
Huobi, LTM price and volume69

These models are only partially comparable. While functionality of exchange is also given on the
VALOR Platform, the key difference is that SMART VALOR sees itself as an online investment
platform which enables not only investment in new digital assets but also tokenization of real
assets and offering of banking services. Additionally, its targeted investor segment is a more longterm oriented investment style as opposed to daily trading typical for exchanges.
Tokens that are backed by a real asset such as real estate, shares of companies and even funds,
are fairly straight forward to value. The value of tokens not backed by real assets, such as Ripple
or most ICO coins, can be estimated by looking at the total number of network users or total hash
power (not to be confused with total tokens), in accordance with Metcalfe’s Law. ICOs can be
valued using the proposed “Framework of Token Confidence”, as these are likely to be valued
more highly if they first build investor confidence.70

Drawing some numbers from exchanges like Binance and networks such as Ripple, it is apparent
that there is a direct correlation between investor confidence, use of the platform and its native
token price. For example, in the Ripple network, as its daily payment transactions reached the
sustainable growth levels and some major partnerships announcements have been made, the XRP
price soared to from 0.065USD to 3.56USD rewarding investors with a stunning 53,769% within 12
months between January 2017-18. Its total market capitalization has at that moment reached, a
staggering USD138 billion, while it stood at only a modest USD236 million just a year before.

Figure 37:
Ripple, LTM price and volume72

With a view that Ripple is not a fully distributed, decentralized network where XRP is not needed
to pay transactions in the sense of the protocol native token such as ETH on the Ethereum public
blockchain, the Ripple price development demonstrates that the price of any given token can rise
significantly once the use case and expansion of the platform is confirmed by increased
participant or transaction numbers.
In contrary to these models, the VALOR token is needed by asset issuers and key partners to
engage on the VALOR Platform. The demand for VALOR tokens is driven by the number of
partners and prime investors. Therefore, the VALOR token, given the timely adoption of the
VALOR Platform and broad use of its stablecoin CHFt has the potential to significantly benefit its
early contributors and adopters.
Overall, the combination of increasing platform usage and limited token supply has been proven
to act as a proxy for increasing the token price of a multitude of exchanges as shown in Figure 38.

DISTRIBUTION
OF TOKENS

VALOR Platform and partner exchanges

30 days after closure of ICO

7.2 Token generation and allocation
SMART VALOR will generate a total of 100’000’000 VALOR tokens as ERC-20 tokens. These tokens
will be created at the time of the Token Generation Event (TGE), with 100’000’000 VALOR tokens
constituting the maximum number of tokens ever generatable. The details of the smart contract
will be published during the TGE on SMART VALOR website.
VALOR tokens can be acquired during the pre-sale of the VALOR token, during a subsequent
public ICO or afterwards on the VALOR Platform and some other major crypto exchanges.
VALOR tokens will be allocated as follows:
1. 45% (45’000’000) will be sold to future users of the VALOR Platform during the Pre-Sale
and ICO. Unsold tokens from this allotment will be destroyed through a Token Burn.
2. 26% (26’000’000) will be retained for future development of the VALOR Platform. These
tokens are locked up and cannot be accessed before 2021.
3. 5% (5’000’000) will be used for early community incentivization and network growth.
4. 5% (5’000’000) will be deployed for liquidity management after ICO.
5. 19% (19’000’000) will be reserved for founders, current and future employees, and
advisors.

Team allocation
This allocation results in the distribution of ¾ of the total amount of tokens to the community
(76% = 45% + 26% + 5%), where 19% is reserved for the team, including founders and
advisors, future employees, etc.
To align incentives of SMART VALOR with the interest of contributors, a significant part of both
the founders and employee’s salary is paid in VALOR tokens. This part of the salary is subject to a
3-year vesting period. Starting from the closing of the ICO, they receive quarterly distributions of
the tokens allocated to them. All members of the team have a 12-month lock-up period on the
sales of their tokens. Additionally, there is a cliff period of 12-months. Only team members that
stay with the company for at least 12-months receive any token allocation at all. From then
74

onwards, they still do not have access to their total allocation but receive the quarterly
distributions. Therefore, if team members leave, they will not continue to receive tokens. Their
tokens can be granted to new team members that support development. These measures are put
in place to incentivize the long-term commitment of founders and employees.

7.3 Token Sale Process
7.3.1 Pre-sale and ICO
The Token Sale consists of several rounds of private pre-sale and eventually a subsequent public
ICO. The Hard Cap on the total amount of tokens to be distributed during the Pre-Sale and ICO is
fixed at 45’000’000 VALOR tokens. This means that no more than 45 million VALOR tokens will be
distributed during the pre-sale and ICO.
During the Token Sale, users acquire a claim for delivery of VALOR tokens, expected 30 days after
ICO closure. These claims are non-transferrable prior to final token distribution to the wallets of
contributors on the VALOR Platform.

STAGES OF THE TOKEN SALE
1st private pre-sale round
The number of tokens sold in each round is capped. The first round took place in October 2017
and 2’000’000 VALOR tokens were successfully sold. This first round was reserved for strategic
contributors at an early stage of the project. A total bonus of 81% was granted to the
contributors. All contributors agreed on a 12-month lock-up period after the closure of the ICO for
the whole sum of the allocated tokens.

2nd private pre-sale round
The second round of pre-sale started in April 2018 and was capped at 5,000,000 VALOR tokens
with a bonus of 50%. All tokens sold in this round were subject to a lock-up period of 6-months
after the closure of the ICO.
Additional bonuses were granted for:
▪

5% bonus for additional 6-month lock-up period

▪

5% bonus for contribution equal to or larger than CHF 50’000 and lower than CHF 100’000

▪

10% bonus for contribution equal to or larger than CHF 100’000

Minimal contribution for participation was CHF 10’000.

3rd private pre-sale round
The third round of pre-sale starts on 01st of November 2018 and runs until 26th of November 2018
at 23:59 CET (midnight). In this round, up to 8’000’000 VALOR tokens are up for sale. A bonus of
35% is granted and tokens are subject to a lock-up period of 6-months after the closure of the
ICO.
Additional bonuses are granted for:

75

▪

5% bonus for additional 6-month lock-up period

▪

5% bonus for participation equal to or larger than CHF 50’000 and lower than CHF
100’000

▪

10% bonus for participation equal to or larger than CHF 100’000

Minimal contribution for participation is CHF 1,000.
The final ICO of the remaining VALOR tokens is expected to take place in Q4 2018, around the
time of the operational launch of the VALOR Platform. This facilitates regulatory compliance, as
the key utility of the VALOR token will become available at or shortly after the distribution of
tokens.

7.3.2 How to participate?
Participation exclusively through the VALOR Platform
The 3rd round of the token pre-sale will be held directly on the VALOR Platform itself. To
participate in the token sale, contributors need to open an account on the VALOR Platform and
whitelist for the pre-sale. This means that eligibility for the token sale will be proofed. All
contributors need to go through an identification process (KYC) according to Swiss Anti Money
Laundry Act (AMLA).
Distribution limitations
Although VALOR tokens represent utility/payment tokens and not security tokens, there will be
no distribution in some countries opposing token sales, such as China, as well as countries on
sanctions lists.
For US citizens, participation in token sales is limited to accredited investors in certain states only.
SMART VALOR AG has applied for exemption from registration requirements according to
Regulation D Exemption 506 (c).
Payment method
During the pre-sale rounds, payment is accepted in Swiss Francs, Bitcoin or Ether. The number of
tokens is calculated based on the current price of Bitcoin or Ether in Swiss Franc at the moment of
contract issuance.

The funds raised during the Token Sale will be used to further build out the technical platform, to
expand the VALOR Platform and to obtain the needed financial licenses in Switzerland and
Liechtenstein. This will involve extending the team from 37 to 45 by the end of this year and up to
a full team of 100 employees (FTE: Full Time Equivalent) by the end of 2021.
The company estimates that the total cost of operation of the VALOR Platform for the next three
years will amount to around CHF 33 million. This number corresponds to the goals of the ICO,
where are the remaining tokens are locked up for three years.
This implementation strategy is designed in a flexible way in order to be able to adjust to the
sequence of asset types to be listed and the evolving regulatory effort needed. The key cost block
is connected to security, development of the technical infrastructure, legal fees, and minimal staff
levels required for running a banking institution.

7.5 Best-practice approach and advantages of the
token sale
SMART VALOR is a part of different working groups dedicated to the code of conduct for ICOs and
is actively supporting the creation of self-regulatory organization (SRO) for ICOs. In particularly,
Switzerland is renowned for its long-standing tradition of self-regulation in financial services.

77

Therefore, SMART VALOR’s own ICO is crafted with the goal in mind to be one of best-practice
examples. This will be achieved through adherence to the following principles:
▪

Hard Cap on fundraising

▪

All contributors will go through the KYC process according to Swiss compliance
requirements

▪

Allocation to the founding team, employees and advisors is vested over a 3-year period
with 12-months lock-up and a 12-months cliff period

▪

Funds raised will be held in protected wallets with a multiple approvers process

▪

Financial statements will be certified by a public accountant and published on an annual
basis

▪

Quarterly performance updates will be provided to contributors and the wider community

▪

Salaries paid to founders and employees do and will not exceed average market rates

Advantages of token-based participation
Finally, it needs to be pointed out that token-based participation holds several advantages in
comparison to traditional equity-based early stage company funding:
1. Token participation represents non-dilatable participation in a project. In contrary to
shares in a company, the number of which can be increased in a capital raise, the
number of tokens in existence cannot be increased. In principle, it is similar to Bitcoin
in regards to limited supply of token, which are however in difference to Bitcoin all
pre-mined.
2. Every contributor is a stakeholder in the network with clearly defined rewardcontribution-rights connected to his or her engagement on the platform.
3. Incentives of contributors, developers, and founders are fully aligned.

9. Disclaimer and risk factors
Please read the following risk factors carefully prior to purchasing VALOR tokens.
Acquisition of VALOR tokens involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks
described below, together with all information contained in this White Paper before making the
decision to acquire VALOR tokens. The following risks entail circumstances under which, the
SMART VALOR business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer.

9.1 Risks associated with the acquisition of VALOR
tokens
SMART VALOR may not successfully develop, market and launch the VALOR Platform and
protocol.
The VALOR Platform has not yet been fully developed by SMART VALOR and additional capital
funding, as well as developer and management expertise, time and effort will be necessary in
order to fully develop and successfully launch a version of the VALOR Platform in which various
types of activities as described in this White Paper can be conducted (the “VALOR Platform
Launch”).
SMART VALOR may have to make changes to the specifications of the SMART VALOR Protocol or
VALOR tokens for any number of legitimate reasons or SMART VALOR may be unable to develop
the VALOR Platform in a way that realizes those specifications or any form of a functioning
protocol. It is possible that there may never be operational VALOR tokens or an operational
VALOR Platform.
The SMART VALOR Protocol or VALOR tokens, if successfully developed and maintained, may not
meet expectations of holders of VALOR tokens at the time of use. Furthermore, despite good faith
efforts to develop and launch the VALOR Platform and subsequently to develop and maintain the
VALOR Platform, it is still possible that the VALOR Platform will experience malfunctions or
otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the VALOR
Platform and VALOR tokens.
SMART VALOR will use the proceeds of the Pre-Sale to make significant investments to develop an
operational version of the VALOR Platform and will subsequently continue to enhance the VALOR
Platform's utility and value, with the goal of achieving the VALOR Platform Launch. However,
SMART VALOR may not have or may not be able to obtain the technical skills and expertise
needed to successfully complete development of the VALOR Platform and progress it to a
successful VALOR Platform Launch.
While SMART VALOR has sought to retain and continue to competitively recruit experts, there
may be a shortage of management, technical, scientific, research and marketing personnel with
appropriate training to develop and maintain the SMART VALOR Protocol. If SMART VALOR is not
successful in its efforts to demonstrate to users the utility and value of the VALOR Platform,
SMART VALOR may not be able to proceed with the VALOR Platform Launch.
The acquisition of VALOR tokens may involve a high degree of risk.
Financial and operating risks confronting startups are significant. The startup market in which
SMART VALOR competes is highly competitive and the percentage of companies that survive and
prosper is small. Startups often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product
89

development, marketing, financing, and general management, among others, which frequently
cannot be solved. In addition, startups may require substantial amounts of financing, which may
not be available through private placements, public markets or otherwise.
SMART VALOR may be forced to cease operations or take actions that result in a Dissolution
Event.
It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable
fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and at currencies, the inability by SMART VALOR to
establish the VALOR tokens’ utility, complete development of the VALOR Platform and proceed
with the VALOR Platform launch, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property
ownership challenges, SMART VALOR may no longer be viable to operate and SMART VALOR may
dissolve or take actions that result in a dissolution event.

9.2 Risks associated with VALOR tokens and the
VALOR Platform
The VALOR Platform may not be widely adopted and may have limited users.
It is possible that the VALOR Platform will not be used by a large number of individuals,
companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and
development of distributed ecosystems (such as the VALOR Platform) more generally or
distributed applications to be used on the VALOR Platform. Such a lack of use or interest could
negatively impact the VALOR Platform and the utility of the VALOR tokens.
The VALOR Platform may be the target of malicious cyberattacks or may contain exploitable flaws
in its underlying code, which may result in security breaches and the loss or theft of VALOR
tokens. If the SMART VALOR Protocol’s security is compromised or if the VALOR Platform is
subjected to attacks that frustrate or thwart users’ ability to access the SMART VALOR Protocol,
their VALOR tokens or the VALOR Platform data monetization services, users may cut back on or
stop using the VALOR Platform altogether, which could seriously curtail the utilization of the
VALOR tokens.
The VALOR Platform structural foundation, the software application and other interfaces or
applications built upon the VALOR Platform and underlying networks are still in an early
development stage and are unproven, and there can be no assurances that the VALOR Platform
and the creating, transfer or storage of the VALOR tokens will be uninterrupted or fully secure,
which may result in a complete loss of users’ VALOR tokens or an unwillingness of users to access,
adopt, utilize and build upon the SMART VALOR Protocol.
Further, the VALOR Platform may also be the target of malicious attacks seeking to identify and
exploit weaknesses in the software or the VALOR Platform, which may result in the loss or theft of
VALOR tokens. For example, if SMART VALOR and the VALOR Platform are subject to unknown
and known security attacks (such as double-spend attacks, 51% attacks, or other malicious
attacks), this may materially and adversely affect the VALOR Platform. In any such event, if the
VALOR Platform Launch does not occur or if the VALOR Platform is not widely adopted, the VALOR
tokens would have no utility.
There may be occasions when certain individuals involved in the development and launch of the
VALOR Platform may encounter potential conflicts of interest in connection with the VALOR
Platform Launch, such that said party may avoid a loss, or even realize a gain, when other holders
of VALOR tokens are suffering losses.

90

There may be occasions when certain individuals involved in the development and launch of the
SMART VALOR Protocol or VALOR tokens may encounter potential conflicts of interest in
connection with the Token Sale and the VALOR Platform Launch, such that said party may avoid a
loss, or even realize a gain, when other holders of the VALOR tokens are suffering losses. Holders
of VALOR tokens may also have conflicting tax, and other interests with respect to VALOR tokens,
which may arise from the terms of the VALOR tokens, the VALOR Platform code, the VALOR
Platform, the timing of the VALOR Platform Launch or other VALOR token offerings, or other
factors. Decisions made by the key employees of SMART VALOR on such matters may be more
beneficial for some holders of VALOR tokens than for others.
Holders of VALOR tokens may lack information for monitoring their holdings
A holder of VALOR tokens may not be able to obtain all information it would want regarding
SMART VALOR, VALOR tokens, or the VALOR Platform, on a timely basis or at all. It is possible that
a holder of VALOR tokens may not be aware on a timely basis of material adverse changes that
have occurred with respect to the VALOR Platform. While SMART VALOR has made efforts to use
open-source development for the VALOR tokens, this information may be highly technical by
nature. As a result of these difficulties, as well as other uncertainties, a holder of VALOR tokens
may not have accurate or accessible information about the VALOR Platform.
VALOR tokens have no history
The VALOR token will be a newly formed token and has no history. Each VALOR token should be
evaluated on the basis that SMART VALOR or any third party’s assessment of the prospects of the
SMART VALOR Protocol may not prove accurate, and that SMART VALOR will not achieve its
business objective.
If the VALOR Platform is unable to satisfy data protection, security, privacy, and other
government-and industry-specific requirements, its growth could be harmed.
There are a number of data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industryspecific requirements, including those that require companies to notify individuals of data security
incidents involving certain types of personal data. Security compromises could harm the VALOR
Platform’s reputation, erode user confidence in the effectiveness of its security measures,
negatively impact its ability to attract new users, or cause existing users to stop using the VALOR
Platform.
The further development and acceptance of blockchain networks, including the VALOR Platform,
which are part of a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are
difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain
networks and blockchain assets would have a material adverse effect on the successful
development and adoption of the VALOR Platform and the VALOR tokens.
The growth of the blockchain industry in general, as well as the blockchain networks with which
the VALOR Platform will rely and interact, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors
affecting the further development of the cryptocurrency industry, as well as blockchain networks,
include, without limitation:
1. Worldwide growth in the adoption and use of ETH, and other blockchain technologies
2. Government and quasi-government regulation of ETH, and other blockchain assets and
their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain
networks or similar systems
3. The maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the ETH
networks
4. Changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences
91

5. The availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and
services, or trading assets including new means of using fiat currencies or existing
networks; or
6. General economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies
A decline in the popularity or acceptance of ETH or other blockchain-based tokens would
adversely affect the results of operations.
The slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of
blockchain networks and blockchain assets may deter or delay the acceptance and adoption of
the VALOR Platform and the VALOR tokens.
The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of digital assets
could materially and adversely affect the business.
The prices of blockchain assets such as ETH have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations
and are highly volatile. Several factors may influence the utility of the VALOR tokens, including,
but not limited to:
1. Global blockchain asset supply
2. Global blockchain asset demand, which can be influenced by the growth of retail
merchants’ and commercial businesses’ acceptance of blockchain assets like
cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, the security of online blockchain
asset exchanges and digital wallets that hold blockchain assets, the perception that the
use and holding of blockchain assets is safe and secure, and the regulatory restrictions on
their use
3. Holders' expectations with respect to the rate of inflation
4. Changes in the software, software requirements or hardware requirements underlying
the SMART VALOR Protocol and VALOR Platform
5. Changes in the rights, obligations, incentives, or rewards for the various participants in the
SMART VALOR Protocol and VALOR Platform
6. Interest rates
7. Currency exchange rates, including the rates at which digital assets may be exchanged for
fiat currencies
8. Monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and
revaluations
9. Regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of blockchain assets such as the VALOR
tokens
10. The maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the VALOR
Platform; or global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations.
A decrease in the price of a single blockchain asset may cause volatility in the entire blockchain
asset industry and may affect other blockchain assets including the VALOR tokens. For example, a
security breach that affects VALOR token holder or user confidence in ETH may affect the industry
as a whole and may also cause the utility of the VALOR tokens and other blockchain assets to be
uncertain.

Loss of private key and risks associated with the wallet
VALOR tokens can only be accessed by using an Ethereum wallet with a combination of the
investor’s account information and private key or password. The VALOR token can be stolen if the
92

private key or password is lost or stolen. SMART VALOR and any of its employees, bodies, or
contractors are not responsible for the wallet to which VALOR tokens are transferred to and they
are not responsible for the access and security of a wallet, for any security breach, any loss
resulting from a service wallet provider, including any termination of service by the wallet
provider and/or bankruptcy of the wallet provider. Anyone investing in VALOR tokens confirms
that they understand the working of a wallet and the related risks.
Lack of consensus of miners and risks related to forking
The network of miners is ultimately in control of SMART VALOR and that there is no warranty or
assurance that the network of miners will allocate the VALOR token to the investor as proposed
by any terms. The network of miners could agree at any time to make changes to the VALOR
token and to run a new version of the smart contract. A group of people may take the software
and modify it to accept a different set of tokens, or no tokens, which might devalue the VALOR
token.

are applicable to your possession of this White Paper such part thereof (as the case may be) at
your own expense and without liability to SMART VALOR or the VALOR Platform. Persons to
whom a copy of this White Paper has been distributed or disseminated, provided access to or who
otherwise have the White Paper in their possession shall not circulate it to any other persons,
reproduce or otherwise distribute this White Paper or any information contained herein for any
purpose whatsoever not permit or cause the same to occur.
The regulatory regime governing the blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, tokens and token
offerings such as VALOR Platform and the VALOR tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or
policies may materially adversely affect the development of the VALOR Platform and the utility of
the VALOR tokens.
Regulation of tokens (including the VALOR tokens) and token offerings such as this,
cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges currently is
undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve, varies significantly among international, federal, state
and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive
bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future, adopt laws, regulations,
guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact the development and growth of the VALOR
Platform and the adoption and utility of the VALOR tokens. Failure by SMART VALOR or certain
users of the VALOR Platform to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may
not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a
variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.
Blockchain networks also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many non-U.S. jurisdictions
such as the European Union, China and Russia. Various non-U.S. jurisdictions may, in the near
future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the VALOR Platform. Such laws,
regulations or directives may conflict with those of the U.S. or may directly and negatively impact
the SMART VALOR business. The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict,
but such change could be substantial and materially adverse to the development and growth of
the VALOR Platform and the adoption and utility of the VALOR tokens.
New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, in the
U.S. and other jurisdictions, may materially and adversely impact the value of the ETH virtual
currency used to acquire VALOR tokens and otherwise materially and adversely affect the
structure or VALOR tokens and the rights of the holders of VALOR tokens.
Issuance of VALOR tokens May Constitute the Issuance of a “Security” Under U.S. Federal
Securities Laws
94

The VALOR token is a utility token that has a specific consumptive use – i.e., it allows participants
in the VALOR Platform to receive and pay value for data sharing by individuals and entities, and
make data available, on a distributed network with significant advantages over current data
sharing solutions. Due to the nature of the VALOR tokens and the manner, in which they are being
offered, we do not think they should be considered “securities”, as that term is defined in the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). VALOR tokens might only be distributed
to “accredited investors” as defined in US securities laws and to not more than 150 non-qualified
investors under the EU Prospectus Regulation.

Appendix I
Competitive landscape in the startups space
Competitive landscape in the startups space has just started to emerge. Comparable business
models vary between platforms strictly focused on provision of tokenization services (Polymath),
Crypto currency exchanges expanding into distribution of other crypto assets (Binance),
alternative liquidity providers (BANCOR) and multitude of US focused businesses (T-Zero). The full
list and comparative analysis is provided in Appendix II.
Polymath
The Polymath Network78 is a blockchain-based system that coordinates and incentivizes
participants to collaborate and launch financial products on the blockchain. The Polymath
team aims to create a standard token protocol that embeds defined requirements into the
tokens themselves - easing the primary issuance and secondary trading of blockchain
security tokens. The ST-20 token is planned to hold the legal and compliance features required for security
tokens.
The Polymath Network is a blockchain-based system for launching financial products. The Polymath team
aims to create a security token standard to be able to operate securities according to legal and compliance
requirements.

Differentiation factors
Polymath is specialized in the development of its securitization-focused technology, in order to create the
token equivalent of a security - and fulfilling all the regulatory requirement of a security. Currently it has
nothing to do with alternative investments, which are SMART VALOR’s focus. Despite its Barbados
incorporation, Polymath is a Canadian company and is fully focused on the SEC regulation and US
requirements.

TrustToken
TrustToken is a US-based platform to create asset-backed tokens79. The first asset token
created on the TrustToken platform is TrueUSD, a stablecoin that can be redeemed 1-for-1 for
US dollars which have received some regulatory approval.
According to TrustToken, in the next one or two years, it expects holders of trust tokens to be able to
participate in staking, but it's unforeseeable how soon it will be able to open up its platform for other
entities to create new asset-backed tokens. TrustToken describes itself as “securitization company, so we
are waiting to be one of the last followers on SEC clarity on utility tokens”.
For participants in the CoinList sale, the token itself should become available to buyers sometime between
January 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.

LATOKEN
LATOKEN is a blockchain platform for tokenized real-world assets80. Any asset can be
accommodated, including securities, commodities, real estate, fine art, etc. While securities
were traded in 2017, this has been halted due to unknown reasons and the exchange is
currently limited to cryptocurrencies and ICO listings. They plan to add works of art and real
estate. The asset-backed tokens are linked to the fiat value of the underlying asset, and have a set lifetime.
At a pre-determined settlement date, the asset’s fiat value will be settled in LAT tokens. During the asset’s
lifetime it is held by an approved third-party LAT custodian.

Differentiation factors
LATOKEN is based in Russia and the LAT Foundation Limited, the legal counterparty and holding company of
LATOKEN is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Whereas the Cayman Islands offer multiple advantages for
holding companies, the legal setup is expected to be rather negative for the tokenization of regulated
assets. Also, LATOKEN does not currently offer alternative investments and seems unlikely to return to this,
due to the termination of its security tokenization. Also, the holding setup via a LAT approved custodian has
a reason it simultaneously raises new and sensitive risks.

Lykke
Lykke is a zero-commission crypto exchange 81. Founded 2013 in Switzerland, Lykke offers a
user-friendly, commission-free trading platform for cryptocurrencies that is compliance risk
managed. Immediate settlement and direct ownership is enabled by the blockchain. In addition
to the crypto exchange, Lykke is developing margin trading, an automated trading strategy,
and payment services. Additionally, Lykke has issued its own fiat-pegged tokens, similar to Tether.

Differentiation factors
Lykke has no activities in the alternative investments asset class. It is strongly focused on its trading
platform and fiat-pegged currencies. It is aiming to achieve financial licenses all around the world, including
the US, but is currently only licensed in Cyprus and the Pacific island of Vanuatu.

Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange
GBX is a subsidiary of the Gibraltar Stock Exchange and is supported by the local
regulators82. Its aim is to create a listing platform for utility tokens, subject to the vetting
procedures and requirements of GBE. The Gibraltar Stock Exchange further plans to
become blockchain-based stock exchange.

Differentiation factors
Due to the backing of the Gibraltar Stock Exchange, GBX has good standing regarding the compliance
requirements for tokenized securitization. However, Gibraltar suffers from a less positive image as its
jurisdiction attracted questionable businesses. The consequences of Brexit are another competitive
disadvantage. While access to the UK market is expected to increase, it remains to be seen how
developments with the EU will turn out. In its business offering, GBX is currently limited to new token
offerings and remains to develop its trading facilities all together.

tZERO is a US-based company that aims to increase the efficiency and transparency of capital
markets via a Blockchain-powered trading system83. tZERO was founded by Overstock.com,
which has added a strategic acquisition of a certified alternative trading system operating
approximately 3% of US equity flows. Adding blockchain technology to the existing securities
trading infrastructure and serving existing capital market players will address current shortcomings. tZERO
has launched the first privately held bond and equity on the blockchain.

Differentiation factors
The regulatory side of tZERO is very similar to that of SMART VALOR in that they offer full compliance to
current regulation. However, as a SEC-regulated trader, tZERO is currently fully focused on the US market.
Security trading is subject to local licensing, so whenever tZERO intends to trade non-US underlyings, the
company will be subject to the local licensing of the underlying title or US distribution authorization
thereof. SMART VALOR focuses on non-US titles and its main distribution is to Swiss and EU users where
regulation limits other geographies.

BnkToTheFuture
BnkToTheFuture is a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands84, with
offices in the UK and Hong Kong. It is an online investment platform for
professional and accredited investors and has investments in fintech, bitcoin
and blockchain deals listed on its platform. US residents can transact on BnkToTheFuture thanks to the
company’s cooperation with Keystone Capital Corporation, Inc., a registered US broker-dealer with FINRA
and member of SIPC. Keystone operates sections of BnkToTheFuture where Regulation D offerings filed
with the SEC are conducted. It currently focuses on crowdsourced financing for fintech and crypto
companies.

Differentiation factors
BnkToTheFuture currently limits all its users to accredited investors, narrowing the participants in start-up
funding. For US residents it has a legitimate setup with its broker-dealer collaboration. Mainly based in the
UK, it will also need to create a setup for post-Brexit services within the EEA that complies with regulations.
In contrast, SMART VALOR applies user limitation only in accordance with some asset class restrictions, not
generally to accredited investors. Furthermore, its setup primarily assures participation for Swiss and EEA
investors.

Bancor
Bancor is a token exchange that created a trading setup with liquidity provision
through an automated market-making mechanism that goes beyond traditional
order book matching 85. The exchange service is accessible without user
registration. Today Bancor’s offer is limited to cryptocurrency tokens. The advantage of the Bancor model is
that it allows investors to sell tokens directly back to the issuer without having to find a buyer on the other
side. This is supported by 3% of the capital raised relay held by Bancor, which is used for market-making.

Differentiation factors
Bancor is primarily an exchange. It does not only offer intra-token exchange but also access to network
relays and bounty programs for new tokens. Beyond crypto tokens Bancor does not offer alternative
investments as SMART VALOR. In its distribution it does not follow regulatory requirements as it does not
conduct user verification as Bancor relies on the used verificartion done by the user’s wallet providers). This
is another stark difference to SMART VALOR - beyond complying with the usual KYC and AML legislation, we

will also comply with pertinent trading requirements as a Swiss Organized Trading Facility and Liechtenstein
bank where necessary.

Binance
Binance is a Chinese company, incorporated in Hong Kong and Tokyo which
has been in existence for less than a year 86. It went through its own ICO and
grew significantly in the last 6 months. An ICO lab has been created with
focus on supporting and listing potential strategic partner ICOs.
Regulatory set-up: having moved from China/HK to Japan after China’s clamp down on crypto exchanges,
Binance was looking to avoid regulatory issues. Since then Binance suspended the trading of China-based
coins. However, in March Japan’s financial watchdog issued a warning to Binance for operating without
registration, possibility starting criminal investigations. This led the company to search for yet another
jurisdiction. Switzerland, being an extremely crypto friendly jurisdiction, was obviously not considered as it
is known for its strict Anti-Money-Laundry requirements. Instead the company is said to be looking at Malta
and Bermuda.

Differentiation factors
Regulation: Fully compliant regulatory set-up of SMART VALOR in Switzerland, the country where is was
founded and is headquartered, is one of the key competitive advantages. Binance being originally a Chinese
company was able to grow fast due to a lax regulatory approach. This growth paths will provide more
challenges in the future as more regulatory scrutiny is expected in most of credible jurisdictions.
Product: SMART VALOR has a more strategic view of the broader alternative asset class including security
tokens and tokenization of real assets, aiming far beyond ICOs. Binance is very strong in the cryptocurrency
space and is currently building out ICO services like advisory, funding and listing which are mostly around
exchange providers that qualify for future partnerships.
Security: Binance was reported to be hit by a series of hacking attacks. While this is one of the major risk
factors of the operational model of any exchange, SMART VALOR takes a different approach of partnering
with leading providers in the crypto security space such as Ledger, to build out its institutions-grade Ledger
Vault secure storage solution.
Similarities between Binance and SMART VALOR: Both companies have a community-based approach and
are financed through issuance of their own currency. Also, the structure and functionality of their tokens
are similar.
