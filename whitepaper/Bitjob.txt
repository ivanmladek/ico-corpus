PROJECT DESCRIPTION
BitJob is a decentralized p2p freelance marketplace platform for student jobs,
powered by Ethereum. STU is the token used for paying for services within the
platform.
Students and employers have similar problems all over the world. Students do not
usually have much work experience, but during their education they always need to
earn money over short periods. On the other hand, employers need cheap
professionals to fulfil temporary freelance positions. The BitJob project will connect
students and employers to solve these issues.
In addition BitJob will offer fraud prevention, conflict management, and participant
rating services.

RESUME
The freelance market sector continues to develop rapidly and is generally profitable
for investors. However, the market sector is very competitive, and partial
decentralization is not enough alone to capture market share.
We found the project to be at an early stage of development. We did not find any
advantages over the competition or enough distinctive features.

CONCLUSION
Pluses (strengths):
- growth of the freelance market sector;
- an easy to understand idea;
- the project has many partners; one being the Government of the Netherlands.
- an alpha-version of the software is already launched. The platform’s service is easy
to use and understand.
Minuses (weaknesses):
- there are many competitors;
- a financial model is not available for scrutiny;
- the difference between minimum and maximum volume of raised funds during the
ICO is too great.
- STU tokens depend on the platform’s popularity, a negative factor when
considering future price.

REVIEW OF COMPETITORS
The project has large-scale competitors, both blockchain-based and centralized. The
largest are:
- Freelancer.com (www.freelancer.com), formerly GetFreelancer. Includes 20
million registered freelancers. Fee for both parties is between 3% and 10%.
Membership price is $0.99 - $49.95 per a month.
- Upwork (www.upwork.com), formerly oDesk, merged with Elance. One-time
project price is 20%. Initial price of long-term projects is 10%, subsequently
5%;
- Fiverr (www.fiverr.com). Price of any service is 5$. The charge of every sale is
1$. Equivalent to 20% service price.
- Ethlance – blockchain-based platform (www.ethlance.com). This project has
already launched and is fully decentralized. Charges are 0%; fees are just for
transactions on the Ethereum network.
The list of competitors mentioned above is just a selection; in fact there are many.
The project needs a professional (and therefore expensive) marketing plan,
appropriate pricing, and a product of good quality that differs from other competitors.

MARKET AND INDUSTRY REVIEW
The freelance market is large. In the USA alone there are 53 million freelancers,
35% of the USA workforce. They make $715 billion, 4% of USA GDP. According to
forecasts, by 2020 there will be 60 million freelancers or temporary employees, 40%
of the American workforce1.
According European data, freelancers have come to make up 25% of the total
workforce since 2004. Nowadays, of course, freelancers are employed by every kind
of concern - from start-up companies to large-scale established businesses.

TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE PLATFORM
The BitJob platform is built on the BitJob HYBRID infrastructure. This is both a
centralized platform if traditional methods of payment are used, and a decentralized
one (for signing on, identification, charging, distribution of partners’ remuneration,
and so on).
To start, a student fills in an application in the BitJob application interface. The
application then sends this data to a student register, every student having an ID
number. Lists of students and employers are kept in the blockchain. In the Ethereum
network, a unique account address is created for users to convert funds into STU
tokens and vice versa.
The service is free of charge and simple to use; a student offering his services enters
the platform, chooses a kind of work, fulfills it and gets payment immediately.
An alpha-version has been already launched; you can see and test this on the official
website.

DOCUMENTS
The BitJob website is executed in different languages; the whitepaper describes the
platform’s functioning in detail. There is a general description of development plans,
marketing strategy, and the project’s budget scheme, but there is a lack of detailed
financial data.

PLANS OF THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
The project was commenced in November, 2016; the website was completed at the
beginning of 2017. Currently staff are preparing for pre-ICO and ICO in September,
2017. (the token is aimed to be listed on exchanges in October 2017.) The project
will then be implemented according to the following plan:
• Creation of beta-version up to 2nd quarter of 2018 and later – an open platform for
developers;
• The project is will be launched from the 2nd quarter of 2018 with continuing further
development.
As to partners, the founders will start by working with Student Unions in North
America. If this is successful, BitJob will expand to work with universities in India and
China. The largest quantity of students are in these regions - 315 million5.
In future the company intends to launch another system of funds collection and issue
new tokens for each particular country, and to integrate this system into the existing
platform to convert the new tokens. Besides that, in future they plan to establish
several projects in co-operation with large-scale freelance platform developers.
