Introduction:
Tokugawa Coin got its name from the famous Shogunate that was beneficial for Japanâ€™s history
for about 250 years.
Here comes the first Japanese Masternode coin for its users. With an aim provide its users /
investors the huge ROI of 1000% per annum. All that the users have to do is to purchase 2500
coins and make a Masternode. Users then get 80% of the rewards of each block, for the PoS coin.
If users cannot buy as much as 2500 coins, then they can buy any number of coins and do
staking. Staking gives 20% of the rewards of each block.
The coin is developer and manage by real developer, and not by someone who just buys the coin
or code. This is why you can expect regular maintenance and smooth flow of transactions /
Blockchain.

Features:
Tokugawa coin has 14 coins in every block as reward. This is split into 80% (11.2 coins) for
Masternode and 20% (2.8 coins) for staking.
There is a Single wallet setup option for both staking and Masternode. This means that users do
not need to worry about the staking of rewards, as the wallet does both Masternode services
and gives rewards for coin staking too.
The wallet can be used for multiple Masternodes and all the rewards can be auto staked
automatically.

Advantages of investing in Masternode coin:
Early investors get coins in ICO Stage 1 at 50 cents per coin. This rate increases to 90 cents per
coin in Stage 3.
Early investors can right away start making Masternods with the 2500 coins they receive. They
can do staking if they have amount greater than 2500 or less than 2500.
We are not distributing tokens in ICO, but directly coins in ICO. This is why users can directly
start earning before the coin even hits the exchanges.
We are planning on getting the coin on minimum 4 exchanges to ensure proper liquidity and
proper popularity.

Rewards distribution:
There are 1440 minutes in a day, which means there are 86400 total seconds in a day. Divided
by 90 seconds for every block, we get 960 Blocks made every day. The reward of 14 coins per
block is divided into 80% for Masternodes(11.2) and 20% for Staking (2.8)
Further the rewards are distributed to all running Masternodes. The more number of
Maternodes, the less rewards you get, because the rewards are distributed to each Masternode
in a timely manner.
