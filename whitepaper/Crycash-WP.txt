1. INTRODUCTION
CRYCASH is an independent decentralized ecosystem of custom-tailored products for
gamers which operates with its own utility token called “CRC”. As an ecosystem CRYCASH
will disrupt gaming industry by creating marketing tools, based on innovative technologies
for game developers and give gamers the possibility to receive CRC tokens by completing
tasks set by game developers, buy virtual goods, bett and participate in cybersport tournaments. For that CRYCASH will build an ecosystem consisting of 4 components: Plink application, Advertising Platform, Decentralized Marketplace for trading games and in-game
items, Cybersport Platform. The first one will serve as a messenger and a wallet for CRYCASH tokens. Developers will use Plink as a safe payment method and a user acquisition
channel that will reinvent the way developers attract players into their games. This ecosystem will be built in cooperation with Crytek GMBH, Plink and other third party developers.
CRYCASH Legal Entity will issue ERC-20 digital tokens called CRYCASH (CRC) tokens.
They will be used as a payment method in the CRYCASH ecosystem. Game developers
will use CRC tokens to promote their products and attract gamers, which, in their turn,
will use them as currency for in-game purchases, as well as receive rewards for completing game tasks. Game developers and advertisers will get the possibility to pay for the
services provided by the CRYCASH platform using CRC tokens as well as fiat currency. In case game developers and advertisers make payments in fiat currency, CRYCASH
Legal Entity will provide buyback of CRC tokens in order to be able to pay gamers who completed tasks. CRYCASH Legal Entity will get a fee equal 20%, that will include 10% fee for
Plink. In addition CRC tokens allow for getting access to the unique content and become
one of the payments methods in products developed by Crytek GMBH such as Warface
(Turkey), CRYENGINE Marketplace and future products where suitable. CRYENGINE Marketplace will be the first marketplace to join CRYCASH decentralized gaming ecosystem.
However later any company or developer will be able to join CRYCASH platform using its SDK.
The cooperation between CRYCASH Legal Entity and Crytek GMBH is very important for both parties since it creates synergy effect and allows users to enjoy most of
the functionality of CRYCASH decentralized gaming ecosystem at its early launch.
Plink is an application that is being developed by Plink in collaboration with CRYCASH
Legal Entity. It will be the first application that will be used as a wallet for CRYCASH
tokens holders. In addition Plink is the first application for gamers that enables tracking achievements in games and finding new friends for cooperative game with a neural
network technology. This application is integrated with CRYCASH Advertising Platform.
The technology of tracking achievements will allow game developers to create tasks for
gamers inside Plink. After accomplishment of every task, set by game developer, will
receive rewards in CRYCASH tokens.

2. INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Sustainable growth of gaming industry will play a major role in establishment of CRYCASH
decentralized gaming ecosystem. According to Newzoo market research in 2017 2.2 billion
individuals across the globe are expected to spend US $108.9 billion on computer
games. This represents an increase of US $7.8 billion, or 7.8%, from the year 2016.
In addition the global gaming market is expected to reach US $128.5 billion by 2020 [1].

Digital game revenues will account for $94.4 billion or 87% of the global market. Mobile
is the most lucrative segment, with smartphone and tablet gaming growing 19% year over
year to $46.1 billion, claiming 42% of the market. In 2020, mobile gaming will represent
just more than half of the total games market. The PC and console game markets will
generate $29.4 billion and $33.5 billion in 2017, respectively [1].
Growth of in-game purchase volumes is another important factor to consider. Recently
Transparency Market Research has published a comprehensive report on the Global
Social Gaming Market. It is forecasted to reach US $17.4 billion by 2019. This market
has three main segments: virtual goods market, advertising, lead generation. Virtual
goods market will be the main growth driver for the Global Social Gaming Market with
expected CAGR of 15.2% over the forecasted period. Surprisingly most of the virtual
goods are purchased in so-called Free to Play Games (see Figure 2.2.) [2].

It is important to mention that currently there are no tools that would enable users to
transact directly with each other, so a third party is needed. Gaming platforms usually
play role of such intermediaries. However they are unable to support all countries their
users originate from due to a small size of average purchases (see Figure 2.3. “Average size of purchases”) and high fixed costs associated with money transfers. Such situation is a deficiency of current financial system that blockchain provides instruments
to solve.

So sustainable growth of global gaming market and lack of standardized payment methods as well as inefficient advertising tools generate a need for a new highly reliable
advertising instruments and payment methods that CRYCASH strives to fulfil.

3. BENEFITS FOR GAMING INDUSTRY
Gaming industry is international and diverse by its nature. It involves billions of gamers
and millions of developers interacting. However this interaction is inefficient due to
flaws in traditional financial system and outdated marketing approaches. It lacks effective tools for players to monetize their game time, collaborate and communicate. Game
developers are challenged by high fees from marketplaces and high costs of acquiring
users. CRYCASH decentralized gaming ecosystem solves these problems by introducing revolutionary custom-tailored products for players and developers.
The primary goal of CRYCASH is to change the way gaming industry operates by utilizing programmable logic of smart contracts, immutability of blockchain ledger and high
speed of transactions that blockchain technology enables. These features are crucial to
CRYCASH Platform and they lie in the core of every product or service that CRYCASH
delivers. However for making the most of these features a token is necessary. CRC
token fuels the Ecosystem serving as a utility token which is designed to incentivize
users to interact with CRYCASH Ecosystem and make profit.
Borderless nature of blockchain with the help of CRC tokens will allow peer-to-peer ingame transactions. Distributed essence of blockchain combined with CRC tokens will
create a framework for fostering interaction between gamers and developers so the latter can promote their products more efficiently. Even though CRYCASH Legal Entity is
the only entity in CRYCASH Ecosystem that exercises all managerial and promotional
functions it has no authority to control users and developers and, thus, it has no instruments to resolve disputes within the Ecosystem. CRC token is used to align incentives
of all stakeholders of the Ecosystem.

3.1. Benefits For Gamers
Currently there are a lot of inconveniences that users face when playing games. There
is no easy way to find players that would fit the rest of the squad by such criteria as
gaming experience, language, location and favourite gaming time. Players spend hundreds hours of gaming time on finding valuable in-game assets that worth something
on the market and then they still face difficulties with making in-game transactions.
In addition there are high entry barriers for new players that want to earn money by
participating in e-sports tournaments.
CRYCASH Ecosystem solves the above mentioned problems in the following way:
● Earn CRC tokens by completing tasks set by game developers
		 and advertisers at Plink
● Pay with CRC tokens within Crytek products (for example Warface Turkey)
● Pay for products and services on the CRYENGINE Marketplace
● Pay for games, in-game items and trade with hard-to-get,
		 rare and collectible items
● Team up with other players at Cybersport platform to create your
		 own game tournaments or participate in third party challenges
● Make bets for e-sports events and win CRC tokens at Cybersport
Betting Platform

		

● Make a cash-out to fiat money or pay within CRYCASH Ecosystem
● Enhanced security of each transaction with CRC tokens thanks
		 to blockchain technology

3.2 Benefits For Game Developers
Each year game developers spend billions of dollars on customer acquisition. However
considerable amount of that money is wasted due to the inefficient advertising tools
that are available on the market right now. CRYCASH Ecosystem provides them with
a wide range of unique tools for boosting their profits and promoting online products.
Game developers will benefit from using CRYCASH Platform by:
● Gaining a critical mass of users quickly and cost-efficiently

● Getting an access to a new efficient and secure way of receiving payments
		 from gamers
● Significantly reduced customer acquisition cost
● Increased customer lifetime

● Enhanced engagement of new users

● Possibility to use unique gamers targeting instruments (gaming activity,
		 favourite time of playing, gaming experience, age, gender, location and etc)
● Increase in returns on per user basis due to in-game purchases

● High growth of LTV driven by gamers hunt for items and accomplish tasks
		 from game developers for CRC tokens

4. CRYCASH ECOSYSTEM GAMING SOLUTIONS
4.1 Plink Application
CRYCASH Legal Entity allows investors to earn CRC tokens using PLINK application
(Plink) by carrying out tasks of game developers. Plink is a blend of messenger and
social network for gamers. Its neural network allows them to look for friends to play
cooperative games with. In addition Plink enables users to track each others’ progress
in various games, get updates on what their friends are playing at a given moment of
time, form teams (squads) for daily combats, communicate with each other via voice
conferences and cross-platform chats.
The technology in question (earning CRC tokens for accomplishing tasks) will be made
possible by the Advertising Platform that is being developed by CRYCASH Legal Entity. This platform will serve game developers as a tool for setting specialised tasks for
gamers. The aim of such tasks will be to attract new users in games. Also this platform
will provide game developers with a withdrawal mechanism of rewarding gamers with
CRC tokens for successfully accomplished tasks.
Let us consider an example. Warface TURKEY sets a task to a gamer with Advertising
Platform. This tasks will become available for gamer through Plink. Definition of task:
Register in WARFACE and kill 100 enemies with a head shot and add 5 friends. For that
user will receive 5 CRC tokens.
CRYCASH decided to use Plink application to build the technology for rewarding players
due to its advanced functionality that allows Plink to track gamers activities crossplatform in games. This technology will enable Advertising Platform to monitor the status of
tasks assigned to gamers by developers as well as to transfer them CRC tokens. These
tokens will be delivered to СRYCASH wallet in Plink.
CRYCASH Legal Entity has an exclusive partnership with Plink and will promote this
application among gamers. By doing this CRYCASH Legal Entity will increase number
of users and enhance potential profits from advertising opportunities within the app.
Advertising Platform will charge game developers 20% commission fee of the amount
of the gamers’ remuneration in Plink application. This fee will be split equally between
CRYCASH Advertising Platform and Plink.

4.2. Advertising Platform For Game Developers
Feedback that CRYCASH received from game developers gives solid evidence that there
is a problem of insufficient engagement of new players in video games. Developers
spend their time and resources on creating state-of-the-art action games that players
would love. However the latter usually quit playing before they actually get acquainted
with gameplay. In fact more than half of users spend less than hour in the game after
registration. That is why they usually do not have enough time to appreciate the quality
of gameplay.
Before, game developers had to spend their marketing budgets on inefficient Facebook
ads, Google ads or some types of CPA advertising. However these marketing tools do
not fit the needs of modern gaming industry. That is why CRYCASH Legal Entity introduces its very own Advertising Platform (AP) which is designed to interact directly with all
products of CRYCASH Ecosystem. Currently AP utilizes Plink and CRYCASH Cybersport
Platform for engaging new users.

9

Plink has a unique task setting system which allows to track users’ progress in accomplishment of quests they took from developers. Currently the latter use services of advertising agencies’ to attract new gamers. In this business model game developers pay
for each user that is registered in the game. Usually advertising agencies use bots to
create fake accounts, so it is hard to evaluate efficiency of such customer acquisition
channel. In addition it is impossible to calculate the time that a user spent playing the
game. As a result game developers waste their money. Task setting system via Advertising Platform (AP) in Plink introduces an elegant solution to these problems. Now
game developers will be able to create special intelligent tasks in their games that can
not be accomplished by bots. Essentially, CRYCASH Ecosystem is developing “Proof
of Game” that will make new users prove their active presence in the game by actually
playing it. It is the role of Plink to track it. As a consequence, individuals will be fully engaged into the games they play and developers will have better chances to sell in-game
items. It is AP and Plink that track progress so developers have time to actually built
new products. Mobile application Plink has already started to support tracking users’
activity in more than 90% of the most popular games cross-platform. API of the Advertising Platform can be used by game developers to interact with users if their game is
still unsupported by AP and Plink.
AP has a wide range of analytical instruments for efficiency assessment of advertising
campaigns in Plink and Cybersport Platform. All the reports can be accessed through
user ’s profile. Their copies are also sent to the advertisers by an email. An advertiser
can manage levels of access of its employees through user ’s profile.
AP allows game developers to top up their account with fiat money as well as with
CRC tokens. In case of account replenishment with fiat money 5% fee is charged. It is
done to incentivize game developers to utilize CRC tokens as means of payment in the
ecosystem. Large game developers will be able enjoy postpaid services of CRYCASH
Ecosystem. For that 30% of raised funds will be reserved for token buyback and elimination of cash gaps.
Advertising Platform developed by CRYCASH Legal Entity will provide game developers with a possibility to set tasks for gamers with web interface and through the API.
Game developers can keep track the number of users that started completing tasks and
monitor their progress in the game.
Advertising Platform will make it possible to choose specific tasks. This will allow game
developers to set tasks with wide range of specific configurations based on users online data and stats, such as:
• geolocation
• gaming preferences
• gaming experience
• popular time playing
• users sex and age

10

In addition AP will enable game developers to promote and host decentralized eSports
tournaments for both professional and amateur gamers and allow them to receive CRC
tokens in such tournaments via CRYCASH Cybersport Platform. Cybersport Platform
will be integrated with AP as well. With the help of AP game developers and advertisers
will sponsor tournaments, set sponsorship rewards and buy advertising services. As of
today there are no promotional tools and platforms that would have as revolutionary
functionality as AP will provide.

4.3 Marketplace
Making its way into the market, CRYCASH Legal Entity established partnership with
CRYENGINE – the highly advanced development solution for the creation of blockbuster games, movies, high-quality simulations and interactive applications. Powered by
Crytek, CRYENGINE is the only all-in-one game development solution for the PC and
game consoles which brought into the world such legendary bestseller as Crytek’s FarCry, as well as dozens of third-party games under Crytek’s licensing scheme: Sniper:
Ghost Warrior 2 and SNOW. Warhorse Studios uses a modified version of the engine
for medieval RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance.
Introduced in 2016, CRYENGINE’s Marketplace offers developers access to Crytek’s
own asset library, as well as community contributed materials, sounds, and 3D objects
that can be used to build their games. Now CRYCASH will be available as one of the
payment methods at CRYENGINE Marketplace, in addition to traditional payment options. Paying for assets, in game items, and services has never been so easy and secure!
Game developers who sell their products at the Marketplace will also be able to receive
payments in CRC tokens and either use them to reward gamers for completing their
tasks, or easily cash-out to fiat currencies. This innovation will allow the CRYENGINE
community to rearrange a seamless payment process for third party developers’ products.
Moreover, CRYENGINE Marketplace will feature the built-in CRYCASH SDK delivering the ultimate experience to game developers. With CRYCASH SDK developers can
integrate CRYCASH into their products and take advantage of making and receiving
payments in CRYCASH tokens. This integration will be completed in the Q1 2018 and
CRYENGINE Marketplace will provide its customers with CRC token payment method
in Q2 2018.
Integration with the CRYENGINE Marketplace will be an additional incentive for the
token’s seamless flow within the CRYCASH Ecosystem.
The global vision of CRYCASH is to launch an independent blockchain-based Marketplace for third party developers. The CRYCASH Marketplace will become a secure
and a convenient platform for purchasing games with CRC tokens. Using CRYCASH
SDK will also allow game developers to cut fees which they have to pay with traditional
distribution platforms – for instance, for STEAM this fee may be up to 20%. CRYCASH
Ecosystem plans to expand its integration into other games and distribution platforms,
such as STEAM, BATTLENET, OVO and others. Launch of the independent CRYCASH
Marketplace for games and in-game content distribution is scheduled for the end of
2018.

11

CRYCASH SDK
CRYCASH SDK is designed for developers to create their in-game marketplace to sell
in-game items and earn CRYCASH. By integrating the CRYCASH SDK and adding the
list of game items for sale, game developers give users an opportunity to sign in using
their Plink account connected with their CRYCASH wallet. After this users can make
purchases in games with their CRYCASH wallet and confirm all transactions via 2FA in
the app. Smart contract for GameDeveloper ’s SDK will guarantee the item’s delivery
to the user, check user ’s balance and offer him particular items etc.. Various business
models will be supported (pay-to-play, free-to-play and pay-to-win).
The CRYCASH SDK won’t be available publicly, but anyone will have a possibility to
test it within their product or game by downloading the necessary libraries and using
test access. Once the product is developed, we will verify function call to the smartcontract to exclude any possible errors in the code responsible for the transaction. This
way we’ll guarantee that all CRYCASH users will receive the assets they paid for. All
transactions are stored in blockchain and every user can easily prove the fact his purchase has been paid for, if it hasn’t been delivered for some reason.
Our libraries will work with most of the popular engines, such as CryEngine, Unreal
Engine and Unity3D. Other programming languages used by game developers will be
added later.
SDK methods:
• Auth (ApiKey and SellerId)
• Plink oAuth
• ItemsList (ItemName, Price and etc.)
• Add
• Remove
• Transaction (ItemID, UserID and etc.)
• Sell
• Refund
• Status
• CheckUserBalance
Making transactions using CRYCASH and sell in-game items will be available using the
API for GameDevelopers.
CRYCASH SDK will be first integrated with the CRYENGINE Marketplace. Eventually
this SDK will be adapted, supported and developed for other popular platforms.

4.4. CRYCASH Cybersport & Betting Platform
The global e-sports market has 14402 active players as of 2017. In 3187 different tournaments
over $98 million dollars were distributed as rewards among winners [4,5]. It is important to note
that such tournaments are extremely centralized and significant entry barriers prevent
millions of players from becoming professional gamers. In addition to this problem
e-sports industry suffers from scaling issues and lacks efficient mechanisms of attracting new players.

12

CRYCASH will build a decentralized Cybersport Platform on Ethereum. This blockchain
was chosen due to functionality that can be achieved by using its smart contracts.
CRYCASH Platform will allow enthusiasts to compete in their favorite games through a
decentralized and automated platform which will:
1. Decrease entry barriers for both professional and amatuer players

2. Mitigate risks associated with non-payment of rewards to the winners
		 by different intermediaries

3. Allow less popular and known players to start participating in international
		 competitions
4. Reward gamers by using API of CRYCASH Cybersport Platform

5. Provide game developers with a unique advertising tool which will increase
		 players’ engagement
6. Host tournaments for both professionals and amateurs

7. Provide access to new types of events that can be bet on
CRC token will become an inevitable part of CRYCASH Ecosystem that will allow its
users to:
●
●
		
●
		
		

		

Bet on e-sports events registered on CRYCASH Cybersport Platform
Win CRC tokens by competing in various tournaments. Web/PC/Game consoles/
iOS/Android games will be supported
Access additional premium functionality such as getting rewards for taking
different actions within the Ecosystem (e.g. linking social network accounts
to the Platform, attracting new users and accessing premium content
of CRYCASH)

For the first time users will have a complete control over their funds which is possible
due to the decentralized nature of CRYCASH Platform. The payments and payouts
made by the players and settled on the Ethereum blockchain without being processed
by a bank or any third party entity. This decentralized model reduces transaction and
other operating costs. Saved funds will be passed on to the consumer by adding value
that competitors cannot provide. Existing centralized solutions put consumers at risk
since gamers’ accounts and deposits can be hacked, embezzled, or even blocked.
The CRYCASH Cybersport Platform will host both centralized and decentralized gaming tournaments.
Decentralized Tournaments
Platform’s decentralized tournaments will be set up and run by users of the platform
who have CRC tokens. The latter will be the only accepted tokens in the decentralized
tournament ecosystem. CRYCASH plans to use smart contracts to allow gamers to
create tournaments for Web/PC, game consoles (Xbox, PlayStation) and Mobile (iOS,
Android) games. Similar to CRYCASH itself, these tournaments will be under full control of the players, with witnesses to verify results.
In addition gamers can create their own tournaments and use their own CRC tokens or
virtual assets as prizes. This will allow all interested gamers to participate in tournaments by using smart contacts embodied in the CRYCASH Cybersport Platform.

13

Centralized Tournaments
Centralized gaming tournaments will take place as well. They will be run by developers
and used for promotion of their games through CRYCASH Advertising Platform. These
tournaments will serve as an instrument to encourage player participation within a particular game. Gamers will earn CRC tokens from sponsorship contributions from game
developers.
Gamers that have achieved a certain profile status based on CRC tokens earned or
held, may have special eligibility into some or all of these tournaments.
Future Vision
CRYCASH aims to be the preferred global platform for skill­- based eSports competitors
and to play an essential part in shaping the future of blockchain­- based projects. This
project will initially focus solely on gaming community, but will expand to include all of
the major competitive eSports games. Ultimately, CRYCASH will be a leading brand in
competitive e-sports, affiliated with P2P gaming as well as influential regional and global tournaments. CRYCASH will also work with game developers by forming symbiotic
relationships to enhance the gaming experience for all users. Doing so will encourage
a higher level of participation on both parties’ platforms and bring CRC tokens and decentralized applications one step closer to mainstream.
CRYCASH INTENDS TO OBTAIN ALL THE NECESSARY APPROVALS FOR THIS IMPORTANT FEATURE AS ONE OF THE KEY STEPS POST-ICO.

14

5. СRYCASH CONFIRMED PARTNERSHIPS
CRYCASH has established partnerships with legendary brands such as Crytek’s Warface
Turkey, as well as achieved confirmed integration into CRYENGINE Marketplace and Plink.
There are ongoing negotiations with other potential partners to expand CRYCASH network.

WARFACE TURKEY
Brought by Crytek, Warface Turkey is a fast-paced shooter crammed with cooperative
and competitive action, stacks of game modes and a wealth of weapons for players to
get their hands on. Gamers can choose to play as Riflemen, Medics, Snipers or Engineers as they work together and attempt to uproot the Blackwood military faction in
Co-op play, or choose their side and lock horns with fellow players in versus battles.
CRYCASH will be integrated into Warface Turkey as one of the payment methods for
in-game items.
Warface Turkey will also use CRYCASH Advertising Platform to acquire new users.
Gamers will be able to earn CRC tokens by completing tasks set by Warface Turkey at
Plink.

CRYENGINE MARKETPLACE
CRYENGINE Marketplace created by Crytek enables developers to access individual assets from Crytek’s own library, as well as thousands of materials, sounds, and 3D objects
created by the CRYENGINE community and other trusted vendors. CRYCASH will be integrated into Cryengine Marketplace as one of the payment methods allowing to pay and
receive payments for assets, in-game items and services

PLINK
Plink is the first application for gamers designed for collaboration and communication
among players and receiving CRC tokens for completing tasks set by game developers
and advertisers through Advertising Platform. Plink will also be used as a wallet for
CRC tokens holders.

15

6. PROFIT GENERATION OF THE CRYCASH Legal Entity
CRYCASH Legal Entity uses such methods of monetization that will allow company not
only to generate profit but to develop and promote CRYCASH cryptocurrency and to
establish new partnerships as well.
Revenue sources of CRYCASH Legal Entity are as follows:
1. Payment processing

• Fee will be charged for making transactions in CRYCASH Ecosystem using
		 CRYCASH Wallet. The latter will be integrated into Plink application
		 and will be available in iOS/Android/Desktop versions for each member
		 of CRYCASH Ecosystem

• CRYCASH will provide CRYENGINE Marketplace with SDK to accept payments
		 with CRYCASH. CRYCASH will charge CRYENGINE Marketplace 1,5% fee
		 for all payments

2. Advertising platform
• 20% fee is paid for the rewards a gamer receives for accomplishing tasks in Plink
		 (this fee will be split between Plink app and СRYCASH Legal Entity equally)
3. CyberSport & Betting Platform

• Betting fees
• Tournaments sponsored by developers are subject to 4% fee of the size

		 of prize pool
• In decentralized tournaments СRYCASH Legal Entity provides gamers with smart
		 contracts that automatically manage funds and distribute rewards. For that 2% fee
		 will be charged of the size of prize pool
CRYCASH Ecosystem plans to establish more partnerships in the future. In addition
long-term strategy of CRYCASH Legal Entity implies launch of new monetization methods.

16

7. TOKEN BUY BACK STRATEGY
To secure the CRC token’s stability and stimulate continuous market demand CRYCASH Ecosystem will apply its Token Buy Back Program designed for the benefit of all token holders. Within this strategy the CRYCASH Ecosystem will buy its own CRC tokens on
the secondary market (at cryptocurrency exchanges) to reward players who successfully
complete game tasks picked up through the Plink application, or winners of the CyberSport
Platform tournaments and bets. For this, 30% of the amount raised during the token sale
will be reserved at a dedicated fund to be used for token buy back program in the future. In
the future CRYCASH will spend up to 80% of profits for buying the CRC token at exchanges to reward users for completing tasks set by game developers. This approach will ensure
CRYCASH token’s seamless flow within our Ecosystem and provide for its ultimate vitality.
CRYCASH Platform is going to start its Token Buy Back Program just after the release of CRYCASH Advertising Platform in Q1 2018.

17
