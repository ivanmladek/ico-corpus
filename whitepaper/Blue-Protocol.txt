BLUE Protocol White Paper
April 12, 2018

Abstract
Blue is offering a family of developer tools, consumer software, and guidelines for the
development of digital assets tools on the Ethereum network. The existing infrastructure
relies heavily on the storage of private keys and passwords to authenticate the transfer
of funds. These are easily phished, lost, or stolen, and have led to the loss of a massive
amount of funds since the inception of the Ethereum network. We use the following
major components to protect user funds, improve user experience, secure the safety of
digital assets, and help Ethereum and cryptocurrency at large thrive.

BLUE Protocol
A series of smart contracts and backend systems that allow all the network to function
securely and conveniently. The Blue Protocol allows for 2-factor authentication without a
central party. Funds are held in smart contracts for users, who maintain complete
control over these meta-wallets. This is secured by the blockchain identification system,
secure asset storage, smart contract analysis, blockchain analysis, address blacklisting
and whitelisting, and anti-phishing capabilities.

BLUE SDK
We offer wallet developers, exchanges, and e-commerce sites the option of integrating
the Blue Protocol in to their own systems with the same automatic verification of digital
assets and transactions as the BLUE Wallet offers. By integrating our easy to use SDK,
with only a few lines of code our partners are able to demonstrate their commitment to
security and protection of user’s digital assets.

BLUE Wallet
The BLUE Wallet is a multi-platform application that allows for sending, receiving, and
storing of ethereum based assets such as ERC20 tokens and beyond. By building our
own wallet we are able to integrate our security protocol, including decentralized 2FA,
deep integration with dApps, and a user friendly user experience using an internet-wide
identification system secured by the blockchain.

1

BLUE Standard
We have created an open source set of guidelines that should be followed by token
developers, ICOs, and other digital asset creators and fund custodians. By following
these guidelines and adhering to the Blue Protocol, our wallet and SDK can
automatically validate and verify the safety of crypto assets.

Single Sign-On for Login
SSO Would allow for users to use a single identity for dApps, websites, services. The
identify platform includes detailed permissions. So users can share only what they want
to share. Government agencies, companies, and others will be able to build upon our
platform to provide identity support for Ethereum wallets. This is decentralized using
smart contracts, allowing any group to offer identity access to Ethereum consumers. For
example a government agency performing KYC may include support for the following
fields:
15
Public address

15

Username

15

Real name

15

Email

15

Government ID Hash

15

These identities are verifiable with issuing agency, for KYC or other key factors currently
missing from the Ethereum ecosystem. These can not be reversed to discover ID without
issuing agencies private keys.

An additional use-case of this system is for collectible dApps (such as CryptoKitties.)
These may offer data on the collectible items in a way that they can be easily read and
written by other supporting dApps, truly decentralizing the collectibles model.

About Blue
Underlying Beliefs
We believe that decentralization strengthens the individual’s right to privacy and control
of their data. This is a benefit to the entire world and all of humanity. As internet
technology has grown, so has government and corporate surveillance. The current state
of the market means organizations receive rewards for surveillance and trading of the
private data of internet users, and decentralized assets are the first realistic solution to
this problem.
We believe that the biggest problem we face today that holds back mainstream
adoption of cryptocurrency and digital assets is the combination of poor security and
complex user experience. We believe it is critical to relieve both simultaneously before
the mainstream audience will be willing and able to adopt cryptocurrencies.
We believe that today there is great complexity in understanding and using
decentralized software for the average person. The mainstream audience does not
understand decentralization, or how it impacts their security.

5

Our Mission
To make crypto safer, easier to use and understand, and easier to develop for.

Our Vision
By making crypto easier and safer to work with, we aim to bring cryptocurrency and
blockchain technology to the mainstream audience, enabling every person in the world
to participate in the decentralized revolution.

Evaluation of the current market
Proliferation of Fraud
In an analysis of one million smart contracts, a new analysis tool called MAIAN found
that 34,200 had security vulnerabilities.1 Before we transition to a blockchain-based
digital economy, we need to address the flaws in this system. MAIAN flagged 34,200
contracts, including a flaw in the Parity blockchain app that rendered $169 million worth
of Ether inaccessible to owners back in July 2017. The team then manually analyzed
3,759 contracts and found exploitable vulnerabilities in 3,686 of them. This application
was using extremely rudimentary tools for only superficial static analysis of the smart
contract code. As a result we believe the 34,200 contracts are just the tip of the iceberg.
In our early testing of the Blue Standard on the Ethereum chain, we can determine that
the truth is that nearly all smart contracts have at least one vulnerability. Based on our
analysis, nearly half of all smart contracts have ​critical ​flaws.
Within the first 2 months of 2018, over $1.36 billion worth of crypto has been lost due to
scams.2 In the time it takes you to read this sentence, $850 will have been lost. There
were over 22 separate cases involving money losses of $400,000 or more in just the
first 3 months of 2018. Summing these losses equates to over $14 million a day
(Kharpal).

The ICO Problem
In a recent article published by Sherwin Dowlat & Michael Hodapp of Satis Group, On
the basis of the above classification, we found that approximately 81% of ICO’s were
Scams, ~6% Failed, ~5% had Gone Dead, and ~8% went on to trade on an exchange
(Dowlat).3
The ICOs were broken down into groups, with the following definitions:
1. Scam (pre-trading): Any project that expressed availability of ICO investment
(through a website publishing, ANN thread, or social media posting with a
contribution address), did not have/had no intention of fulfilling project
development duties with the funds, and/or was deemed by the community
(message boards, website or other online information) to be a scam.
2. Failed (pre-trading): Succeeded to raise funding but did not complete the entire
process and was abandoned, and/or refunded investors as a result of insufficient
funding (missed soft cap).

3. Gone Dead (pre-trading): Succeeded to raise funding and completed the
process, however was not listed on exchanges for trading and has not had a
code contribution in Github on a rolling three-month basis from that point in time.
4. Dwindling (trading): Succeeded to raise funding and completed the process, and
was listed on an exchange, however had one or less of the following success
criteria: deployment (in test/beta, at minimum) of a chain/distributed ledger (in the
case of a base-layer protocol) or product/platform (in the case of an app/utility
token), had a transparent project roadmap posted on their website, and had
Github code contribution activity in a surrounding three-month period (“Success
Criteria”).
5. Promising (trading): Two of the above Success Criteria.
6. Successful (trading): All of the above Success Criteria.

Token Economics as a Distraction
Because so many ICOs are created strictly to raise funds, often the actual need for
blockchain technology is not present. This however, does not stop ICOs with no actual
use-case from raising millions of dollars from contributors who do not care or know how
to evaluate the technical details. This inevitably leads to the team having a focus on
token price, exchanges, and other aspects of managing a token-focused project. This
detracts from the development process and is an overall net negative for the forward
development of blockchain technology overall. Instead of producing results, ICO teams
often produce only hype. This may come in the form of partnership announcements
where there is no business need, additional exchange listings that are not needed for
the project’s development, or simply marketing events that focus only on intentionally
manipulating price action.

Lack of Utility
Because so many ICOs are so focused only on using tokens to raise funds, these
developers often build a token that does nothing at all. This is bad for everyone because
if there is no utility, over time the token is simply sold off by the initial contributors. This
in turn causes a loss of excitement over time, and often an abandonment of the project.

Deliberate Fraud
While the problems we listed above may be present in deliberately fraudulent token
sales, they may also be present in well-meaning development team where a lack of
knowledge or skill led to an eventual exit. On the other hand, as shown above 81% of all
ICOs are outright deliberate scams. These projects are relatively transparent to those
8

with a programming background, as the technical details are often plagiarised, or
unusable and obviously not created by a competent development team. However, the
average consumer who is interested in contributing to ICOs are easily fooled. This is a
huge problem for the crypto space at large, and is the number one threat to
cryptocurrency. Not only does the proliferation of fraudulent ICOs create fear and drive
away contributors, but it also invites governmental regulations to step in and take drastic
regulatory action.

Self Regulation
Self regulation is the act of putting restrictions and requirements on the activity of an
industry, by the industry player’s own volition. This is necessary in the cryptocurrency
space as the massive number of scams and hacks have proliferated over the years. If
we as an industry can’t act to present our own regulatory guidelines, world governments
will be forced to step in and present potentially harsh regulations that may weigh down
innovation and development of the industry. Self-regulation is much preferred, and the
time to act is now. This is why we have introduced the Blue Standard, an open source
repository of guidelines that anyone can contribute to. (The Blue Standard
https://github.com/BlueCrypto/BLUEStandard​)

Intimate Knowledge of the Space
A key benefit to providing self-regulation as opposed to government regulation is that
the industry players are best suited to provide these guidelines and standards due to
their knowledge of the space. Being close to the business at hand allows for expert
strategic decisions that will have the most positive impact to be selected. If left to
government regulators, we may find cryptocurrency regulated out of existence due to a
lack of understanding and appreciation for the massive benefits this technology can
provide.

A Faster Path to Commercial Applications
With self-regulation, we’re able to speak more confidently of our own products, and give
peace of mind to the mainstream population. This means more users and improved
growth over time. By accelerating adoption we also accelerate development. As it
becomes more clear and easier to interpret, these regulations can simply be adopted by
developers, allowing for a proliferation of new and innovative technologies with
meaningful commercial applications.
9

Improved Investor Confidence
Knowing that basic safeguards are in place to police the cryptocurrency industry would
allow new or curious investors to join the space with a greater confidence. Calculating
risk is a critical aspect of investments, and there are many moving pieces to consider.
Even with mature regulations this is a difficult task for investors. This is why it’s
important to remove the concern, and give investors peace of mind, allowing the space
to grow.

Government Support
Governments around the world have called out for self-regulation in the cryptocurrency
industry. According to Forbes, “A top commissioner with the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC), Brian Quintenz, a Republican, has said operators in the
cryptocurrency space could do well to consider adopting self-regulatory standards and
“industry-wide” best practices to policing the new technology-driven space amid the
authorities and government mulling further possible regulatory action.”4 This sentiment
has been echoed by countless others and represents a positive outlook on
self-regulation.

Solutions
The Blue Protocol
We invented and pioneered a modular smart contract system. Users assign metadata to
a smart contract they control, allowing for proxy controls, identification, 2FA, and more.
By just pointing these compatible contracts to another smart contract or series of smart
contracts, developers are able to do amazing things. Our platform will be made open to
developers through our framework and guides. This opens up an unparalleled way to
look at money, wallets, and utility of money, and it’s all decentralized. By utilizing this
protocol along with the Blue Standard, it becomes easy to enforce self-regulatory
actions by scanning tokens, evaluating fraudulent parties, and enforcing guidelines on
the standards by which we come to agree upon as an industry.

Improved Security
Through our protocol, we enable the creation of secure ethereum wallets for on-chain
transactions. In addition, by following the industry standard security requirements from
the traditional financial industry, we pioneer the safest and most secure applications of
the protocol.

Improved User Experience
Email-based cryptocurrency
Users can send crypto to others knowing only their email. The recipient will get an
automated message, that allows them to claim X amount of crypto worth X amount by
just downloading an easy to use wallet. This is a similar system that Paypal used to
grow and gives us a similar opportunity to grow and market through our users.

Smart Contract Based Wallets
A Smart contract is a programmable piece of code living on the blockchain, it has an
address just like a standard Ethereum wallet. At BLUE we think this presents an
untapped opportunity to make amazing things. We have invented a way for everyone to
create a smart contract based wallet easily, for any user, and then proceed to use it like
a normal wallet. We avoid overcomplicating things, with the additional steps needed for
security opaquely happening behind the curtains. This enables boundless additional
possibilities and functionality. Here we discuss some examples of the functionality that
BLUE SDK will have in this system.

Two Factor Authentication
Every website and bank has caught up on this. We need more security because the end
user often does not have adequate security. We have created a
two-factor-authentication system living on the blockchain.
Here is how it works :
- User makes a smart contract wallet (1)
- User opts in for two-factor-authentication, which creates another smart contract
- Your smart contract (1) points to two-factor-authentication smart contract,
requiring it to sign off on the transaction. For it to proceed. This can be triggered
by a specific sum, or at all times, this too is specified by the user.
- User downloads a app providing him with two factor codes or user gets two factor
codes from a trusted party via a message on request.
11

-

Smart Contract (1) looks up if smart contract 2 agrees and transaction goes
through

Spending Limits
Spending limits are a floating point calculation on every transfer the user makes. He
sets his limits of transfers or amount of transfers per unit of time (for example max of
5ETH per day). The smart contract tracks the transactions, and triggers whatever the
user wants, similar to a throw operation. This can also be presented as a security
escalation to request for two factor authentication before proceeding.

Identity and Collectibles Management
Our groundbreaking modular wallet system allows anyone to prove their identity to
whoever they want, with whichever portion of the identity they want.
How this works :
- User types his secret message, his secret message is hashed and put on the
blockchain
- A trusted party signs of on this message, saying it's truthful
- This data now lives in an anonymised form on the blockchain validated by a
trusted party
- User wants to sign in somewhere proving their identity
- User submits the parts of the identity they want
- The person receiving this message hashes it through the same hash that user
has in their smart contract
- The person looks up who said this data was truthful (eg. a government)
- We can now trust the data and the identity of the user

Inheritance
Our modular smart contract system will allow users to add trusted parties in their
contract. This effectively allows users to select various wallet addresses, which can
spend all funds in the wallet. We can also indicate a criteria where this is only true after
a certain amount of inactivity, or a set time frame.

Recovery
BLUE will offer a recovery of your tokens and ETH in the same way inheritance works.
Users set an amount of time of inactivity and register an email or their preferred method
to be contacted. If this time passes users can trigger a recovery request by sending a
request to the BLUE company, or any other provider that adopts the same system using
12

our open standard. BLUE will charge a small, fixed percentage of the funds for
recovery. In the event of 2 years of inactivity, the user will be prompted via email. If
there's no activity or response, BLUE will empty the wallet, and proceed according to
current laws for forfeiture.

Automated Clearing House
The automated clearing house allows for merchants or other providers to elect to enable
spending limits, refund opportunities, and to integrate between multiple types of digital
assets in a seamless way.

Blue SDK Definition
With the Blue SDK, we are offering an SDK that allows third parties to easily utilize our
systems and standards without building every aspect from scratch. This means wallets,
exchanges, and others building on the Ethereum network can greatly improve their
security, while also saving development time.
Developer’s innovating with Ethereum can spend their time best working on their
product and trying new things. Today they are currently forced to instead focus on
building out complex security solutions as no standard for security exists. Our SDK
allows these developers to integrate with the Blue Protocol, saving them much-needed
time and energy, allowing them to focus on innovation, all while keeping customer funds
safe.
Because the Blue SDK is built using industry standard npm packaging, it is easy to use
across multiple platforms. Developers are free to choose which aspects they need, and
which aspects they don’t, allowing for a high level of customization and modularity.
The Blue SDK offers support for two-factor authentication, fraud prevention, secure
asset storage, smart contract analysis, blockchain analysis, address blacklisting,
address whitelisting, and anti-phishing capabilities.

Off-Chain Smart Contract Scanning
Additionally our SDK provides the ability for a consumer to request a scan of a smart
contract or wallet address. The scan is requested by using one of our client libraries to
call a smart contract that queues the scan job to be picked up by one of our many scan
13

workers. These scan workers can be horizontally scaled to meet the demands of clients.
Once a scan worker picks up a job they will run a number of tests against the smart
contract. Examples of these tests include the below.

Integration Testing
A copy of the contract in question is deployed to a local blockchain. Compatible tests
are selected from our database of test cases using the contracts ABI, and run against
the smart contract.

Static Analysis
The contract opcodes are scanned for patterns that indicate vulnerabilities using a
number of different algorithms.

Blacklisting and Whitelisting
Addresses are checked against a number of community and Blue-maintained black and
whitelists which identify known attackers, and verified recipients of funds. Once the scan
worker has completed the testing the results are compiled and hosted on our blue
servers. Users can view their results and get friendly descriptions of each vulnerability
found.

14

Single Sign-On for Login
SSO Would allow for users to use a single identity for dApps, websites, services. The
identify platform includes detailed permissions. So users can share only what they want
to share. Government agencies, companies, and others will be able to build upon our
platform to provide identity support for Ethereum wallets. This is decentralized using
smart contracts, allowing any group to offer identity access to Ethereum consumers. For
example a government agency performing KYC may include support for the following
fields:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Public address
Username
Real name
Email
Government ID Hash

These identities are verifiable with issuing agency, for KYC or other key factors currently
missing from the Ethereum ecosystem. These can not be reversed to discover ID
without issuing agencies private keys.
An additional use-case of this system is for collectible dApps (such as CryptoKitties.)
These may offer data on the collectible items in a way that they can be easily read and
written by other supporting dApps, truly decentralizing the collectibles model.

The Case for an SDK
True to our mission, we want to make crypto secure and more user friendly. Choosing
the SDK route means current software developers can easily implement this into their
code base, improving security of already onboarded clients instantly. This allows for a
strengthening of crypto as a whole and speeding up the mainstream adoption.
Our SDK also allows us to shift the current path Ethereum tokens are heading towards,
something we call “token madness”. We are heading towards a future where users need
6 different tokens to do one transaction. This is not how Ethereum should work. This
multi-token approach will lead to slowdowns of the ETH network, and reduce user
friendliness. We are avoiding this by pioneering a new type of token utility through our
SDK and developer tools.

15

The BLUE Token
The utility of the BLUE token is very simple. By holding a variable amount of BLUE
decided by the platform in real-time, any Ethereum wallet is given full free access to the
Blue Protocol features. This works for the BLUE wallet, any wallet using the BLUE SDK,
exchanges using the BLUE SDK, and any supported dApps. This token can be bought
and sold on secondary markets any time, enabling users to use the BLUE services via
the token, and effectively return it if it they decide to stop using it, or to easily transfer it
to any wallet that they own. The token also features unique replay protection both in
terms of spending and in threat analysis. The BLUE token system contains a
cryptographic signature that is altered by a nonce, and the associated metadata, so
threat definition changes can never be replayed or spammed in order to attack the
token’s security model.

BLUE Token Utility
A token for this is needed due to a few reasons. First, it would simply be impossible to
provide the BLUE membership services for free if user’s only needed to hold ETH. By
having the BLUE token be used to stake for decentralized services, we avoid a
per-transaction fee structure where ETH would need to be spent upon every
transaction, or during any scan of an Ethereum address.
Second, we are able to use the token’s smart contract to do tracking and versioning of
the blacklist and whitelist using a custom metadata field inside the token’s smart
contract, along with a nonce. This allows the token to be used to alter the signing of
transactions for threat signatures, to avoid false threat signatures from being broadcast
to the network.
Third, by only providing services to those who have purchased BLUE tokens, we are
able to reasonably assume that botnets, spammers, and other attackers will not be able
to successfully spam the protocol with bad transactions in an effort to render them
ineffective, or too slow to use. It would simply be too costly for an attacker to purchase
enough tokens to perform an effective​ ​sybil attack.

BLUE Membership
We would like to offer institutions such as exchanges an easy way to assign Blue
Protocol capabilities to their users. This is needed in certain situations such as when an
exchange generates new deposit addresses on the fly, which regularly change. It would
16

be costly in gas to continuously shift tokens around between wallets. Additionally,
having a large exchange simply buy millions of BLUE on the open market would have a
destabilizing effect on the economics of the token. Particularly concerning is if use is
discontinued, the exchange would then need to sell those tokens back to the market. To
address this concern, we have created the BLUE Membership. As an alternative for
B2B customers who would like to perform mass deployment of the BLUE token, we
provide a Smart Contract that can ascribe all the features in the Blue Protocol to a fixed
number of Ethereum wallet addresses quickly and easily using a side-chain that is
under the company’s control. We use the dev team tokens held in escrow to power
these features without the exchange needing to go to secondary markets for their
tokens.
Users can also directly purchase BLUE Memberships instead of holding BLUE tokens,
leveraging the token reserve, however this is a fixed fee that is non-refundable and
non-transferable.
The most common approach for individuals will be to utilize BLUE tokens directly.
Individuals have significantly better mobility with their memberships, and never need to
pay for these services. They will always be provided for free to BLUE token holders.

The BLUE Wallet
The BLUE Wallet is our best foot forward in the wallet development game, and a
showcase for our technology. We anticipate dozens of wallets supporting our SDK, and
use our own as a demonstration as to how our technology improves the safety and ease
of use of Ethereum based cryptocurrencies today. This wallet we’ve created as a demo
is one of the best experiences available for token usage. We’re able to deliver on this
streamlined experience because we take security seriously, which enables us to also
provide great convenience. In the future, all wallets using our technology will be safer
and easier to use.

Multi-platform Support
Today our demo wallet is available as a Chrome extension, but over the next year we
will be shipping updated versions with support for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac OS, and
Linux. Each of these wallets will use our SDK to deliver safety and convenience to our
users, regardless of where they prefer to transact their business.

17

dApp Support
A common use of the Ethereum network today is to power dApps, decentralized apps.
Popular dApps today include EtherDelta, IDEX, and CryptoKitties to name just a few. By
injecting a web3 instance in to the user’s browser, we offer an interface to these dApps
using your securely stored wallet information. This means you can trade on EtherDelta,
or buy and sell your CryptoKitties with just the BLUE wallet in a secured environment.
Because transactions are so easy to perform on your behalf using basic web3 calls, it is
a security issue to simply sign in with your private key. MetaMask partially solved this
problem by intercepting these calls and providing an authentication prompt before
letting them go through. However because of the interface currently provided by
MetaMask, phishing is still quite easy. We have solved this problem with a feature
called Deep dApp Integration.

Deep dApp Integration
By integrating with the most popular dApps in the world, we are able to show user
friendly dialog prompts when authenticating transactions in dApps. We also uniquely
identify the smart contract you are working with using a logo display, and verified
checkmark. If using the BLUE wallet, you will never get phished with a fake dApp ever
again. If that sounds complex, see the figure below comparing BLUE Deep Integration
with ForkDelta, as opposed to how MetaMask renders the same information today.

18

Deep dApp Integration with ForkDelta

Decentralized Two-Factor Authentication
The need for a decentralized 2FA
Currently the best way to secure an Ethereum wallet is to purchase a hardware wallet.
This is because the private key is used on the wallet outside of the computer being used
to interact with the blockchain, and the key is never exposed to the computer being
used. Without a hardware wallet, the second best option is to use an encrypted signing
bridge like the BLUE Wallet. However, when this private key is stored on the user’s
computer it is far too easy to lose access to it, or have it stolen by phishers, malware, or
social engineering. The private key for a hardware wallet can be stolen if the recovery
mnemonic is lost. The funds on a hardware wallet are easily stolen by simply restoring
to another hardware wallet with the same mnemonic. By providing two-factor
authentication, even a lost private key is safe from theft because no thief will have
19

access to the changing second authentication code. This is more secure than a
hardware wallet, and is highly needed for crypto to thrive.

Centralized 2FA
Currently, many exchanges and platforms offer 2FA, but this is done in a centralized
way. This is not to be confused with decentralized 2FA. Two factor authentication
typically operates by confirming a secret key, that is shared with both the authenticating
device (such as a smartphone app) and the centralized authority who validates login.
When an exchange is hacked or it’s database is otherwise exposed, this secret key can
be stolen by attackers, and user’s funds can be lost. To add to this concern, exchanges
are frequently losing their own funds which back the representative funds in user
accounts. When this happens there is often no recourse. These centralized authorities
take custody of user funds, and your balance is only truly available because you place
trust that they will accurately maintain your correct balances as a form of an IOU. This is
not secured by the blockchain properly, and poses a constant threat to the entire crypto
industry when these funds are lost. Simply enabling 2FA on a centralized exchange
does nothing to protect digital assets, and only serves to protect your account
credentials to the exchange.

Our Solution
The Blue team has designed a modified version of the HOTP algorithm for 2FA support
on the Ethereum blockchain. By delegating support for code injection in to the smart
contract (the meta-wallet), we allow support for third party providers of 2FA. Providers
use the open standard for BLUE HOTP codes. Any developer or team can implement
their own version and integrate with their own authentication system. This allows for
2FA that is not dependent on our service. We will however offer our own provider
support as a convenience.
Using the 2FA codes should be very familiar to anyone who has used such systems in
the past. When sending funds, a user will be prompted to provide a HOTP code to the
wallet before funds can be sent. This code can be retrieved from compatible
smartphone apps that produce the one time code.
This is enabled by our use of the meta-wallet, a smart contract and proxy for the user
that stores funds, not in the user’s wallet, but inside the smart contract. The smart
20

contract effectively implements multi-signature requirements where both the private key
of the owner, and a second key are required to authenticate and process transactions
on the user’s behalf. Because the key recovery process changes on each transaction,
the same code can not be used for a second follow-up transaction by an attacker.
A native mobile BLUE Auth app will be developed that produces HOTP codes, based on
our modified algorithm. This algorithm is open source, meaning any developer can
implement a competing app or software using the same scheme. The BLUE Auth app
will be offered for convenience, and the added security of BLUE’s engineering efforts.

Blockchain Analysis
BLUE Geth is our modified Ethereum node, written in the Go programming language.
The BGETH node is responsible for utilizing a full node’s worth of data, and performing
blockchain analysis on ERC20, ERC223, and Ethereum transfers, for the purpose of
identifying flawed contracts, bad actors, and phishing attempts. By integrating directly
we are able to extend the Ethereum RPC API, and add evaluations for tokens,
addresses, transfers, and balances. This system simplifies access to the node and
performs much faster. Instead of accessing the node via a REST call, we access the
data directly, and present the aggregated information in an aggregate REST call. This
greatly simplifies the amount of chatter between implementing applications, thereby
reducing latency, bandwidth, and round-trip time constraints currently present in the
ethereum network.

Fuzz Testing
The BLUE geth server allows us to do fuzz analysis on smart contracts, so even without
manual review we are able to identify problematic contracts. This enables us to detect
cases where a token may have support for locking of transfers, freezing assets,
transferring funds without the owner’s approval, destruction of funds, infinite minting,
and much more.

Market Manipulation Detection
By being fully compatible with the main Ethereum network, we can identify faked
volume on major exchanges, calculate true liquidity on any token, detect pump and
dump behaviour on exchanges, and warn users of this activity. Using this we can warn
users of spiking volume and trading price, and notify them to look for evidence that the
21

change in price legitimate. This works for all ERC20 and ERC223 tokens

Blockchain analysis for token distribution
When purchasing tokens from an ICO or in secondary markets, it’s important to be able
to get a general sense of the fairness of distribution. If a token developer still controls
50% or more of the supply, it is very easy for them to sell massive quantities, putting
heavy downward pressure on the price. This is seen too often in this space, and until
now the average user has not had the tools necessary to determine this specific risk
factor. The Blue Protocol helps make this easy, and the wallet makes it seamless and
user friendly.
Many tokens developers hold significant portions of their own supply. We are able to
detect and notify users of this if the amount is higher than a certain threshold. Using our
BGETH system, we can perform these analyses with ease
1. Analyze the top 10 wallets
2. Determine the true circulating supply.
3. Detect trades between the top wallets, which are often a form of wash trades.
4. Detect if developer wallets are frozen.
5. Analyze the top 10 wallets and determine if the token distribution is healthy.

The BLUE Standard
The standard by which BLUE evaluates all ERC20 tokens for participation in the BLUE
Seal of Approval program This format highly inspired by the Ethereum EIP contributor
standard.
BLUE Improvement Proposals (BIPs) describe the standards by which we hold tokens,
wallets, exchanges, and other blockchain actors to when assigning reputation in the
BLUE ecosystem.
Blue standard is a community driven standard that will be applied to every ICO and
blockchain focused company/token. To keep bad actors accountable, and give well
meaning actors a way to look up what's expected of them. As well as a “to do” list of
good practices. As an example, see the infinite minting item in the Blue Standard below.

Abstract
Token creators can optionally choose to opt-in to giving themselves or others the ability
to mint tokens. We believe this should be limited in time, scope, or quantity. Whether
intentional or accidental we should introduce a fuzz-testing layer to the EVM that can try
random inputs until it is determined that the total supply may be increased or decreased
through smart contract interactions.

Motivation
Currently, there is no clear way for the average investor to know that a token may
increase or decrease it's supply. The only way for investors to understand the different
is to read and understand the source code of every item they trade. Not only is this
time-consuming for the skilled investor, it is impossible for the novice investor. As a
result there is a large quantity of blind trading happening, where investors have no idea
whether or not their tokens are backed by a constant supply, or a fixed-rate fluctuating
supply

Implementation Details
It is trivial to implement fuzz testing on an ethereum side-chain and simply try random
input parameters, and then calculate the total supply to measure whether or not any set
of inputs changes the total supply. If it does, as a matter of standard metadata output,
we include this as a boolean flag in the t​ okenMeta.json​ in BLUE Geth.

Other Examples from the Blue Standard include:
1. Token Locking
2. Clear cash flow standard
3. Token locking for founders
4. Clear howey results
5. Clear token economics
6. Separation of concerns with tokens and ico code
7. Code standards - clear descriptions of functions so investors know if they are
being deceived easily. No excuses after the fact
8. ICO standards - why does your ICO need to have a token? Why does it need to
be on blockchain - an explanation
9. Code standards - gas usage. Useless functions and dependencies
10. dApp Standardisation of naming conventions
11. Acceptable plagiarism definitions (math equations etc)
12. Anti-Kill switch unless conditional multisig

Spearheading the crypto self governance
Today, Blue is the only organization actively seeking to solve the self governance
problem. This is important, and must happen, as we pointed out earlier in this
document. Hacks, loss of funds, custodial failures, and other reasons lead to problems
every day in the industry. Cryptocurrency is not yet adopted by the mainstream, or even
the early adopters. We need standards and compliant partners to step up and join
forces in the self-regulatory effort. This is what we need to bring adoption to this new
and exciting industry.

Words to regulators
The crypto world is more knowledgeable of crypto-currency than regulators, and is
better suited to self-regulate. Given the complexity of crypto and the unique needs, a
self-regulatory effort will help protect crypto investors, without sacrificing the
technological leaps made possible by blockchain technology. If the world governments
want to continue regulating cryptocurrency, they will be met with more and more
resistance with modern tools to obscure crypto trading, and pushback from the
community. Cryptography is both ubiquitous and unbreakable. These tools are
important for the world, and we must protect the rights of those who choose to work with
them. We urge regulators to let this infant crypto community educate, and self-regulate
for themselves.
