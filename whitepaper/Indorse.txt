Executive Summary
‘Indorse’ is a revolutionary platform using new models of tokenization and decentralization to
change the shape of professional social networking. ​Unlike traditional platforms, we aim to give
back ownership of the data to the member, and ​to reward them for sharing their skills and using
the platform.
Indorse uses internal rewards (Indorse Rewards) and a reputation system (Indorse Score) to
incentivize members to add their skills / accomplishments and indorse those of others.
Through participation in the platform, members are able to earn Indorse Rewards for sharing
more about themselves and for indorsing the claims of others. Advertisers in turn purchase
space on the platform with cryptographic Indorse Tokens (​IND tokens​). A portion of these IND
tokens are shared with the members who created the content. In a nutshell, members are finally
able to receive rewards due to their data, instead of watching passively as the revenue goes to
companies holding their data.
We envision a serverless, decentralized future, where the members will build their profiles and
benefit from their reputation. This future will need a decentralized platform where others can
judge the quality of a person’s profile not just by where they have gone to school, but what they
have actually done in their professional and personal lives.
Indorse is being developed by the team at Indorse Pte. Ltd., a blockchain company based in
Singapore. The founders of Indorse Pte. Ltd. are CTO Gaurang Torvekar and CEO David
Moskowitz. Gaurang is the co-organiser of the Ethereum Singapore Meetup, while David is the
co-organiser of the Bitcoin Singapore Meetup. In 2013 David founded a Bitcoin brokerage which
serviced hundreds of clients in Singapore. David successfully exited that business in 2015.
Gaurang and David are also the founders of Attores Pte. Ltd. (​Attores​), a company also based in
Singapore but focused on simplifying the creation, deployment and execution of smart
contracts on blockchains. Although their experience with Ethereum goes back to before they
founded Attores, they formally began working on Ethereum applications in January 2016,
releasing open source code for swaps and forward contracts for exchanging digital assets.
Attores currently has a pilot with a Polytechnic college in Singapore for their digital certificate
issuance platform along with installation of an Ethereum blockchain on campus.

This White Paper outlines the motivation behind the platform, the internal mechanisms and the
roadmap for the development process. Our vision is to build the infrastructure which gives every
member an avenue to showcase their personal profiles, which could ultimately extend to several
other projects. We believe Indorse might become the ultimate reputation system which can be
the backbone of generations of future DAPPs. Join us in this ambitious project!

Chapter 1 - Overview of the Indorse Project
Taking ownership of your data
“If You're Not Paying for It, You're the Product” - Unknown
Social networks have proliferated over the last several years. They have become an integral part
of our lives, to the point where they can control our actions or how we behave, as evidenced by
Facebook’s experiment with the emotions of its members [1].
This is but one example of how technology has become a double-edged sword. Issues about
personal privacy, data protection and ownership of information have surfaced, rightfully, over
increased flows of information. These issues regarding ownership of personal information and
commercialisation of such information must be fixed once and for all. This is our core focus.
The average social media user might not realise it, but social networks have value. Metcalfe’s
law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users.
Our information and interactions build a profile of ourselves, and our inclinations and ability to
spend become valuable to advertisers. One obvious manifestation of this is the USD 3.4 billion
that Snapchat raised during its IPO despite its loss-generating revenue model. The 158 million
active members (and growing) of that network represented value that could be tapped by
advertising [2]. In fact, Google and Amazon, some of the most ubiquitous internet platforms that
we use every day, were the earliest to tap into the information of members on their platforms.
We feel that the root cause of the problem that plagues social networks is the current model of
centralisation. Centralisation gives rise to three problems: we call them the economic problem,
the autonomy problem and the trust problem.
The economic problem.​ Social networks are public goods that contribute significantly to the
well-being of members when they are provided (we can attest to social media being a huge part
of our lives) but are impossible to charge for use. Ordinarily, this would result in a market failure,
as no corporation would want to provide a platform for free, and society would accordingly incur
significant welfare losses. As such, providers of social networks have turned to advertising as a
revenue stream, doing so by requiring members to assign rights to their content and information
to the provider and selling them to advertisers and recruiters. In a sense, social media is not
Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

“free” for use, it is being paid for by micro-incursions of privacy and future revenue from the
information produced by members. We feel the current model is inequitable - members should
be able to reap the rewards of the information they produce; we believe that free use and
equitable reward distribution are not inconsistent concepts.
The autonomy problem. ​The centralised nature of social media today means that the platform is
almost entirely controlled by the platform providers, with members having limited say over the
direction of the platform. We find it unsettling that platform providers have an almost unlimited
licence; it opens the door to potential abuses. In fact, the aforementioned experiment by
Facebook to influence emotions felt by members just goes to show how much control members
have over something central to their daily lives. We feel that user communities should determine
the course of, and contribute to, the platform, and in doing so take ownership of a platform that
is uniquely theirs.
The trust problem. ​Closely linked to the autonomy problem, the trust problem is the result of the
concentration of power in the hands of the platform providers. Although we are inclined to
believe that the developers are responsible and committed individuals who act in accordance
with the terms of use (i.e., they do the right thing), the potential for abuse remains. For instance,
Facebook’s moderators censored a photograph depicting the atrocities of the Vietnam War
because it contained nudity, and in so doing, missed the point about the photograph’s intention
[3]. As our platform deals with personal information and the authenticity of such information, it
is important that no one centralised body has power to determine such facts without oversight.
The real world implications would be unfathomable.
To be clear, we are not against advertising, and we are most certainly not against social media.
However, we are against the centralisation of social media. We believe the solution is a new
model of social networks - a decentralised one that places ownership of information back in the
hands of the members.

The advent of a Skills Economy
Where it used to be the case that a qualification was valuable as a representation of the
knowledge acquired during the period of study, this is no longer true. Today, information shifts
occur with increasing frequency and rapidity. What is learnt in school could become obsolete
very quickly, and it is not uncommon to find individuals employed in positions with little relation
to what they had studied in college. Some of these may have been the result of a consolidation
of various jobs, each different in scope; other positions may not have existed before. The idea of
Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

school as an institution for the imparting of knowledge cannot account for these trends in the
workforce.
We have also witnessed the commodification of education. While it used to be the case that
higher education was the exclusive domain of a few in the past, today higher education has
seen a rapid increase in the number of students, as a result of a push to make good education
(and better jobs) more accessible to everyone. Institutes of higher education have proliferated,
and technology has made it possible to earn a higher qualification without being physically
enrolled in school. In Singapore, the government has announced the goal of increasing the
higher education participation rate to 40% of each student cohort by 2020 [4]. Some students
are lamenting their bleak employment prospects upon leaving school [5]. Elsewhere in countries
like China, India and South Korea, graduates are spilling out of higher education institutes in
record numbers, but many are unable to find jobs after graduation [6]. The numbers game no
longer works out in favour of the many university graduates who are chasing an ever smaller
pool of jobs.
What then is the value of qualifications, if not as representations of knowledge or scarcity? We
believe that qualifications are representations of skills acquired. In this age of constant influx of
information and knowledge, the only constant is change. That, and deep skills which allow us to
ride the changes. The right skills allow us to adapt to situational and information changes
quickly and flexibly; they are our means of navigating this increasingly complex world. So it
seems the academics and governments are not that far off in their claims - our economy is the
skills economy.

Enabling Crowd Economics 2.0
We believe that new economic models are being enabled with technologies like Ethereum. With
these advances, we can enable millions of previously excluded people to participate in the next
wave of economic change. Unlike past cycles where only those who owned the assets could
profit from their usage, in the new decentralized model, millions and perhaps billions of people
can now be direct economic beneficiaries of the businesses they are consumers of. As
economic beneficiaries, users are also more likely to utilize the service and tell others about it.
This creates a virtuous cycle of growth and opportunity for all.

Growing the Cryptographic Token Ecosystem
Throughout the eventful history of the cryptographic token market it has been rather difficult for
new users to enter and access their first tokens. Typically, users must register at exchanges,
Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

clear KYC hurdles and transfer money from their bank accounts to the exchanges. This is often
met with difficulties as banks have not been the most supportive institutions in the
decentralization revolution.
By allowing members an easy way to earn rewards for the activities that benefit them, we are
lowering the barriers to entry into the cryptographic token ecosystem and so enabling a billion
new people to become holders and users of cryptographic tokens.

How are we solving this?
Indorse is an attempt to give back ownership of data to members. A platform which is not only
fun, but also rewarding to the contributors of the content. Here, the value of the content is
accrued to the members who create it. We will also design in-built mechanisms and integrations
with other applications like uPort to minimise the damage caused by Sybil attacks. It will also
have an in-platform token system where honest contributors will be rewarded for their
contributions while persons who make the wrong indorsements will be penalised.
The members own their identity on the platform . The crowd economy is not only about sharing
assets, it’s about the crowd owning, sharing and profiting from those assets which they fund,
build and use. We are giving professionals, and for that matter anyone, an avenue to put up their
documents and have a choice whether to advertise their personal information, with full control
over their data. What’s more, instead of relying on a central authority like a notary or a University
to “attest” that you indeed hold such academic credentials, we are giving that power back to the
public!
To be clear, validation is not a strict attestation to the factual accuracy of the claim. A validated
claim can be taken to be true, on a balance of probabilities, as verified by the indorsement
process of the platform. It would be ideal to achieve 100% confidence in the factual accuracy of
the claim, but very often we don’t require 100% confidence. Most of the time, “good enough”
works out fine. This is our aim - to give any credential a certain degree of validity and vote of
confidence, one that is good enough a standard to be used for most things in life.
This platform can be likened to a combination of a decentralized LinkedIn and Instagram, but with
“verified” claims and indorsements.​ It has mechanisms to reward good actors and penalise bad
ones.

Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

Why Ethereum?
The platform needs a network effect to succeed. While existing social networks like Facebook
and LinkedIn have bootstrapped the growth of their networks, new technologies like blockchain
have put us in a better position to kickstart these kinds of networks. We see this as a unique
opportunity to tap on the existing blockchain communities in order to create a network to begin
with and incentivize the supporters themselves to use it.
Among blockchains, Ethereum provides the much needed transparency needed for a crowd
economy to succeed and incentivize its own growth. Hence we are using Ethereum as our
compute engine, while using the Inter Planetary File System (​IPFS​) as the storage mechanism.
While the Ethereum community is relatively young, it is one of the fastest growing, and shows no
signs of slowing down. Today, ​there is a growing base of developers using Ethereum, with an
estimated 30,000 developers working on various projects related to the Ethereum protocol,
any of whom can write smart contracts and decentralised applications that run on the
Ethereum Virtual Machine. There are hundreds of decentralised applications that have been
created or are in the pipelines [7], and these are only the ones we know of. To date, no other
blockchain protocol, not even the market leader Bitcoin, has this level of interactivity with
the core blockchain protocol. In fact, Ethereum has already surpassed Bitcoin in its own
way: there are now more developers and nodes on Ethereum than there are on Bitcoin [8].

The nature of Ethereum makes it a natural fit for the project that we want to create. We
envision Indorse to be decentralised and transparent, with its own ecosystem of dApps that
feed into and rely on the platform for information. For that, we are building Indorse on this
future proof platform.

Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

Chapter 2 - Platform Model
Core features
The core features of the Indorse platform will be implemented through the combination of a few
technologies, which include Ethereum, IPFS/Swarm, and Whisper. We envision the Indorse
platform to have a serverless, decentralized architecture, with the content and code on IPFS,
and the Ethereum blockchain as the computational engine.
Each member can take part through two main roles on the platform ● Claimant
● Moderator
The entire process flow starts with a claimant making a “claim” associated with his profile. A
“claim” can be either that of professional information / skill (forming the core part of your
profile) OR a personal skill. With every claim made, the claimant needs to attach one or more
proof(s) of information. The moderators verify the claims separate from the blockchain and
either indorse it or flag it.
We are using a mechanism similar to Proof of Stake, called an ​Indorse Score​, wherein every
claimant or moderator will stake his reputation on either the claim or indorsement. If their claim
gets approved [or their indorsement is supported by other users] their reputation will increase,
otherwise, it will decrease.

Example from a member's perspective
●
●

Alice joins the Indorse network. Upon registration, she is issued a minimum Indorse
Score (SCR token) that will enable her to post a single claim to her profile.
She starts by creating her unique profile identity, and then adds a claim. She claims that
she graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2017 with a Specialist Diploma in IT
Network Systems. She provides a link to the Ngee Ann Polytechnic verification page for
her certificate information. She submits the claim with that and her Indorse Score is
locked. The Indorse platform randomly chooses a number of other members who can
indorse the claim, and the claim enters the gestation period.

Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

●

●

●

Bob is an Indorse member who is chosen to indorse the claim. He receives a notification
and sees that Alice has placed a link to the verification page for her certificate. He
verifies that the claim is valid and indorses the claim, locking up his Indorse Score.
The gestation period ends with a consensus of indorsements. Alice’s Indorse Score is
increased by 1, for making a valid claim. She is also rewarded with Indorse Rewards. Bob
also has his Indorse Score increased by 1 and receives an Indorse Reward.
Alice’s Indorse Rewards are automatically converted to IND Tokens paid to the platform
for advertising and other services on the platform which were obtained by business
customers for the period.

Example of a personal claim
●

●

●

●

●

Apart from claiming educational credentials or job experiences, a member can also
claim additional skills that can make his profile well-rounded. For instance, a member
can claim that he can code in JavaScript, and put his Github repository as proof. The
moderators can go there, verify and thereby indorse or flag the claim.
Market forces will regulate the indorsement of claims of such kind. As members are
staking their Indorse Score when indorsing, they would need to be reasonably confident
of their ability to determine the factual validity of claims. In other words, members will be
reluctant to participate in the indorsing process if the claim is too subjective as they are
scared of reducing their Indorse Score.
Suppose someone claims - “I can bake a tasty cake”, then there is no way in which the
indorsers can find out that a particular cake was indeed tasty (short of meeting the
person and actually eating the cake).
For such highly subjective claims, not only will the indorser be unable to determine the
factual validity of the claim, but also that other indorsers are similarly unable to do so.
Game theory would suggest that continuing to indorse such a claim would result in a
random outcome where indorsers are not at all sure that their Score would increase, and
as such each indorser would, independently, choose not to indorse the claim.
The collective end result will be that no indorser will indorse the claim, and the claim will
go unindorsed. Hence, we think indorsers will shy away from such claims, which will in
turn discourage people from submitting claims which are too subjective.

(We might give an option for members to keep “unverified” claims on their profiles. These claims
won’t add any Indorse Score or give them any Indorse Rewards though. But they can be used for
advertising).

What happens to members who indorse ‘wrongly’?
If a member of the platform, be it a claimant or a moderator, keeps indorsing against the
majority, either by way of making frivolous claims or by indorsing or flagging in a dishonest way,
their Indorse Score will be reduced, until it reaches a minimum score on the platform. This
member will only be eligible to earn back his Indorse Score by making ‘correct’ indorsements,
beginning one at a time, for a period of time.

Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

13

How do members receive an Indorse Score?
The early supporters in the token sale for IND tokens will receive SCR tokens along with IND
tokens. New members to the platform will also start with a minimum Indorse Score, which
allows them to indorse only one claim at a time. The members have to do some work and
contribute to the platform to earn both a higher Indorse Score and Indorse Rewards.

Core Components
The platform will be integrated with the following third-party (D)apps
● Indorse DE -​ Indorse will be building a deployment engine (​DE​) for profiles and content,
tying them back to the tokens and Ethereum smart contracts.
● Attores Certificate Issuance (CI) Platform - ​Attores has been working for more than a
year on the certificate issuance platform, wherein a university or an institution can issue
their degrees or diplomas directly on the blockchain in the form of a smart contract.
Attores plans to open source this code and use that as one of the core modules of the
Indorse platform.
● IPFS -​ IPFS, which is like a decentralized Dropbox, is going to form the core of the
Indorse platform. Most of the content, including documents, claims, updates to profiles
and indorsements are going to be stored there. With the advent of systems like Filecoin,
users of IPFS get one more chance to earn revenue from their content or storage space.
This is ultimately going to help in the proliferation of the ecosystem as a whole.
● uPort -​ uPort is a self-sovereign identity system that allows people to identify
themselves and authenticate both on and off the blockchain. The Indorse platform will
be integrated with uPort so that the identity of the member on the platform corresponds
with his real identity. uPort is also useful for signing the blockchain transactions directly
from a mobile phone.
● Truffle -​ Truffle is a development environment for Ethereum smart contracts, which
includes smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management. This
is the current state of the art for the Ethereum blockchain. We are going to use Truffle to
write the smart contracts and integrate that with the front-end of the application.
● Spectrum -​ Spectrum is an all-in-one wallet system for Ethereum currently under
development by Digix. The Indorse platform will integrate with that since it provides ease
of use for the end users and makes their life much simpler, while also providing security
for the platform developers.
● Status -​ Status is an open source messaging platform and mobile interface to interact
with decentralized applications that run on the Ethereum Network. We also plan to
Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

14

integrate Status in one of the releases so that there can be in-platform chatting, all on
the blockchain.

While the aim of the team behind Indorse is to create a completely serverless, decentralized
architecture, the actual development needs the application to be divided into several tiers
nonetheless - namely, the service layer, the API layer and the app layer. Having said that, it’s
important to note that since the code for the service layer is going to be open source, any 3rd
party apps can always directly interface with the service layer smart contracts to take
advantage of the distributed nature of the blockchain.
The description of each of those layers is as below –
Service layer – ​This layer will contain the core logic of the platform, which will include a suite of
smart contracts and the indexing system for the file system, IPFS. This is more of a logical layer
of the platform, and it will be interfacing with the API layer in order to speak with the App layer.
API layer – ​This layer will consist of the NodeJS + Express application, the backend of the
system, which will act more like an API so that the other front end web apps / mobile apps / 3rd
party apps can access the information from the Indorse platform. Since some of the data needs
Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

15

to be persisted in order to allow for efficient execution, without spending too much gas, we will
be persisting this data in a MongoDB database.
App layer – ​This layer will consist of the ReactJS web application in the POC phase. Later, we
may want to develop a mobile app as well using any of the technologies like React Native or
even native Android and iOS apps. We also plan to leverage the mobile Ethereum OS built by
Status in order to provide a decentralized version of the platform on mobile phones. Other 3rd
party apps can also leverage the API of Indorse in the future in order to leverage the full-fledged
reputation and profiling system that we are building.

Advertising
Another integral feature of the platform will be advertising. Advertisement placement and
impressions will be bought by advertising agencies and marketing agencies at certain fixed
rates. We will follow a model similar to Google Adwords, but with the difference that a portion of
the cryptographic tokens paid for advertising on the platform goes back to the users of the
platform!​ ​More details about how this mechanism works are discussed in the next section.

Different forms of the Indorse dApp
While the Indorse dApp will be in the form of a web application in the beginning, we will also be
releasing it as a mobile app subsequently as part of the development milestones. You can find
more information about this in the subsequent sections.

Anonymous Indorsement Protocol (AIP)
When a member makes a claim, he will have two options for indorsements - either choose
random indorsements or get his claim verified from an influencer on the platform. In the latter
case, the member will have to pay using either his SCR tokens or Indorse Rewards. If he
chooses the option of getting random indorsements, the Indorse platform will choose random
indorsers based on the degrees of separation from the member.
Our protocol for choosing the random indorsers from the platform and keeping the
indorsements anonymous is inspired from the research paper written by Patrick McCorry et. al.
[9] and the random datasource on Ethereum developed by Oraclize [10]. The AIP protocol has
two phases Phase 1 -​ Choosing a random set of indorsers
Phase 2 -​ Managing the anonymous indorsement process
Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

16

In the first phase,​ the platform will choose random indorsers from the Indorse platform using
the following steps. Selection of the random indorsers will be done through the service layer of
the platform, by accessing the member profiles from the indexed dataset from IPFS. It will
follow these steps Step 1 -​ Set up an indorsement program
1.1 - Find out the n most active members from the claimant’s first and second
degree separated set of contacts.
1.2 - Find the members who are most likely to be “similar” to the claimant’s
profile by ‘clustering’ and ‘classification’ techniques.
1.3 - Set the minimum threshold N
1.4 - Get a random sample from this set of members to indorse the claim
1.5 - Send requests to these members for indorsements
Step 2 -​ Indorsers will register their interest and deposit their SCR tokens in an escrow
smart contract. During registration, every indorser broadcasts their indorsing key g​x​i ​and
a (non-interactive) Zero-Knowledge Proof ZKP (x​i​)
Step 3 -​ In case the threshold is not met (n < N), resend the requests to a new set of
indorsers by following steps 1.4 and 1.5 again
Step 4 -​ Minimize the threshold in case the minimum number of indorsers aren’t
registered
Step 5 -​ Invite the remaining indorsers for registration and depositing their SCR tokens.
After the number of registered indorsers reaches the minimum threshold, the period of
indorsements begins.
In the second phase,​ the registered indorsers are given a specific time period, denoted by t​indorse​.
If they fail to indorse, then they’ll lose their SCR tokens, thus reducing their reputation on the
platform. From the registered indorsers n, we need at least m indorsers to complete their
indorsements before the computation of the consensus. Where,
n-m < α
denoting the variance which can be tolerated by the system, α always approaching 0. Each of
the m indorsers will either “vote” yes(1) or no(0) on this claim. Out of the m indorsers who
manage to finish the process, the algorithm will give out the result of the claim - either indorsed
or not indorsed when the indorsers reach a consensus denoted by ​β​, where ​β​ depends on a
variety of factors and will be adjusted according to the use of the platform and from previous
and anticipated indorsement thresholds. There are two cases to be considered -

Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

17

Case 1 Claim​indorsed​ iff ∑ m(1) > β
In this case, most of the indorsers have confirmed that the claim is valid. Since, ​β ​is a high
value like 70% or 80%, it is safe to assume that the remaining indorsers with ​m(0) ​are behaving
in a malicious way, and they would be penalised, thus forfeiting their deposit.
Case 2 Claim​unindorsed​ iff ∑ m(0) > β
In this case, most of the indorsers have confirmed upon reflection that the claim is invalid. Since
β ​is a high value, it is again safe to assume that the remaining indorsers with ​m(1) ​are behaving
in a malicious way, and they would be penalised, thus forfeiting their deposit.
The entire process can be divided into roughly five stages -

●

●

Stage 1 - First set of requests go out
Stage 2 - If minimum threshold is not met, second set of requests goes out
Stage 3 - Registration period for indorsers

Chapter 3 - Token Model
Alignment of Incentives
In order to create a reward mechanism that fairly distributes ownership and aligns the
incentives of all parties, the platform has ​1 tradeable token and 1 internal accounting token
(based on the ERC20 interface):
(a) Indorse Token (IND) ​[tradeable]
(b) Indorse Score (SCR)​ [accounting of reputation]
The purpose / role of each of these tokens are as follows:

Tradeable Token:
IND Token:​ ​The IND token is the token that will be issued during the Token Sale. Token Sale
purchasers will also receive Indorse Score (SCR) tokens in addition to their IND tokens, once the
platform is released on the mainnet. This will enable them to indorse the profile postings of
members on the platform. In this way, the IND token holders have a vested interest in
participating in the platform and indorsing viable claims. As the IND token will be the required
payment method for buying advertising space on the platform, advertisers will need to purchase
IND tokens (such as through an exchange) in order to avail of advertising units on the platform.

Internal Accounting Token:
This token will for the most part not be known as a ‘token’ to the member. We present it here so
that the community can understand the mechanics of the system and how we are using them for
the transparency of the network.
SCR Token:​ ​SCR tokens (Indorse Score) are tokens that are required to post updates to the
member profile, or indorse and flag claims. SCR tokens are denominated in whole units (no
decimals) and are non-transferrable between members. A member may gain or lose SCR tokens
as a result of his interactions with the platform, as expounded upon elsewhere in this paper.
However, there is a minimum SCR token threshold built into the platform. The amount of SCR
tokens that a member may hold in his wallet can never fall below 1 SCR token - the minimum
required to act as an indorser. As much as we aim to encourage constructive participation in the

platform, and to discourage misuse of the platform, we would not wish to exclude anyone from
using the platform.
SPECIAL NOTE​:
Please note, in the earlier versions there was an additional internal token: Indorse Buck (BUC).
However, based on the community feedback, it has been decided to NOT make the BUC as a
token. BUC (now called Indorse Rewards) will be an internal point based system and will be
external to the blockchain.

Considerations
Indorse Score (SCR) - Accounting Token
SCR tokens are primarily accounting tokens, and as mentioned earlier, majority of members will
not be aware that they are tokens. They will not be exchangeable between members and never
leave the platform. They are used to keep track of the reputation of the members. We use
Ethereum tokens to allow for an element of transparency - it would be possible to see the
amount of SCR a member holds, using independent platforms like Etherscan.

Converting Indorse Rewards into IND tokens - Vesting Periods
After an initial three month vesting period, subsequent to the platform being deployed on the
mainnet, all the Indorse Rewards will be accumulated and automatically converted into IND
tokens based on the amount of IND in a pool from incoming advertising and the inflation
mechanism (see below). The three month period is both a security mechanism and a way to
reduce gaming of the network. Please note, Indorse may choose to amend the three month
vesting period.

Indorse Rewards to IND token Conversion - Pooled Tokens
Half of the IND tokens used to purchase advertising credits and talent acquisition services (see
discussion below) will be placed into a pool (​IND pool​) and the other half will be put into an
administrator fund to be used to pay for the operations of the platform.
These funds (in the form of IND tokens) in the IND pool will be distributed for the Indorse
Rewards created in the last 10 months with 10% being allocated equally to each of the months.
Please note, this distribution mechanism can undergo a change as and when we implement the
platform. This is an indicative distribution mechanism, and Indorse may choose to update this
Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

20

distribution mechanism at a later stage.
During the conversion to IND tokens (that is, after the end of the entire period discussed above),
the Indorse Rewards will be ‘consumed/burned’.
IND tokens (representing the IND inflation tokens) will also be added into the IND pool.

Advertising revenue with IND tokens
IND tokens will be the initial revenue source for the platform members. The IND token will be the
required payment method for buying advertising space on the platform. This means advertisers
will need to purchase IND tokens through an exchange. If no public exchange is available, the
platform administrators may accept a direct sale of IND tokens for Ether (​ETH​) for the media
buy at no better rate than that offered to the existing IND token holders.
Half of the IND tokens from the media buys will go into the IND pool and the other half will be
put into an administrator fund to be used to pay for the operations of the platform. The ETH
received from direct sale of IND tokens will be used to fund development and marketing for the
platform.

Talent Acquisition revenue with IND tokens
Indorse will endeavour to engage in talent acquisition and human resource acquisition services,
from Year 2. It is envisaged that the relevant data to provide such services will only be available
from Year 2 onwards. Similar to advertising revenue, IND tokens will be the required payment
method for seeking such services from the Indorse platform.
The IND tokens earned by the Indorse platform for these services will go into the IND pool, 50%
of which will be put into an administrator fund to be used to pay for the operations of the
platform and the remaining 50% will be rewarded to the members in the manner similar to that
of the advertising revenue.

IND Token Inflation - Pooled Tokens
The inflation pool will begin alongside the initial three month vesting period of the Indorse
Rewards. The inflation pool will begin at 5% of the initial token supply. The inflation rate will be
halved every twelve months until it reaches 0.625%. The 0.625% year will be the final year for
inflation. The halving is to correspond to increasing IND in the pool from advertising buyers.

Chapter 4 - Use Cases
We hope our platform will inspire a variety of use cases and integrations, leading to a flourishing
ecosystem that adds value to our members. Here are some of the ways in which we envision
the platform could be used.

Companies looking to hire
With a large numbers of graduates being the norm these days, companies are becoming more
discerning with regards to their hiring practices. For instance, most of the tech companies today
look not only at the coding chops but also the cultural fit of prospective candidates. The Indorse
platform can be the perfect way to show how good you are as a human being, just beyond your
Ivy League education and your job experience at Facebook or Google. If you can claim (and
prove through indorsements) that you can skateboard, or that you’re a swimming champion, or
that you have watched the Star Wars rhapsody at Gardens by the Bay two times in the same
night, then the hiring managers can get a clearer picture of you as a person, and a better idea as
to your fit with the company culture.

KYC
KYC, or Know Your Customer has always been the Holy Grail of the blockchain community, with
many companies and teams making it their mission to solve this. While projects like uPort are
the first steps taken towards achieving this goal, we believe the Indorse platform will take the
ecosystem significantly closer to the end goal. By attaching your identity, profile, and
achievements to an Ethereum address in a decentralized manner, we are a step closer to an
independent identity system.

Oracle for Prediction Markets
The Indorse platform can also feed into existing prediction markets like Gnosis or Augur.
Claims, and the subsequent indorsement process can serve as prediction markets. So now,
instead of prediction markets like ‘Is Hillary or Trump going to be the next President’, there can
be questions like ‘Is John able to code a Smart Contract’. Additionally, we can even start treating
highly subjective claims in a manner similar to Prediction Market results, where people can vote
on the outcome of a certain fact being true.

Please note that this is a draft of the White Paper and is subject to change.

23

Advertising
The most direct use of the data collected on the platform is for targeted advertising. This
includes the persons viewing the profiles and the profile creators themselves. Profile creators
will be able to opt-out if they do not wish to share their data, however staying in will allow them
to receive rewards in the form of Indorse Rewards.

Freelance Services
As much as 11% of working Americans have already entered the ‘gig economy’ [11]. Intuit
further predicts that up to 40% of the population may be working as freelancers by 2020 [12].
With credentials being indorsed on the platform, contract work and other job requests can be
posted and filled by members of the community.
With more decentralized sites like Ethlance coming about and changing the landscape of
freelancing communities, we think that Indorse will feed into this ecosystem perfectly and can
be the go-to place for people to check the credentials of their freelancers, before hiring them.

Challenges
We are also cognizant of the fact that there are indeed some challenges in building this
platform. What we are envisioning is really ambitious, and some of the components/features
are dependent on external factors. These are the challenges that we foresee at the outset.
● Integration with uPort -​ Since uPort is one of the essential components of the system,
we are somewhat dependent on it. Obviously, it can certainly work without uPort, but
then it’ll have to depend on centralized solutions like Gmail or Facebook for
authenticating the members.
● Integration with Status -​ messaging is an integral part of any social network. If the
integration with Status is not successful, or there are delays in the launch of Status, the
ability for in-platform messaging might be affected or delayed.
● Uncertainty of data storage on IPFS -​ one of the drawbacks of IPFS is that the data
stored there might not be always available, since some of the nodes or peers might stop
sharing or storing the data. We can mitigate this by creating multiple IPFS nodes
ourselves or encouraging the members to host their own IPFS nodes. Solutions like
FileCoin might remove these risks, but since the launch dates of FileCoin aren’t known,
this is one variable outside our control.

Chapter 6 - Token Sale
Initial Token Sale - IND Tokens
The initial token sale for the IND tokens to support of the development of the Indorse network
will be made via a sale for ETH. A distribution of 1,000 IND tokens will be distributed to token
sale participants per 1 ETH under the IND Token Sale Terms and Conditions. IND tokens sent to
token sale participants will represent approximately 35% of the total supply created.
Approximately 37.71% of the total supply will be reserved for future use and approximately 25%
to be held by the network administrators, team, and advisors. The remaining 2.29% were issued
to seed round supporters.
Token sale participants will send their ETH to an account specified on the Indorse website after
a specified block number. The initial token sale will end when the end block is created, or when
the amount of ETH sent to the account reaches the maximum. If the token sale fails to result in
a minimum number of ETH, then the token sale will be cancelled and ETH sent to purchase IND
tokens will be returned.
Advisors and team members will have a lockup period of 240 days before their IND tokens can
be redeemed.
In addition to the IND Tokens, Indorse will also be issuing SCR tokens to its token sale
participants. Details in relation to issuance of the SCR will be announced once the platform is
released on the mainnet.

Post Token Sale - holding of the funds
In order to limit downside risk of the ETH received losing value relative to the US dollar and to
help ensure we will be able to meet the financial obligations needed to complete the project, we
will be hedging some of the ETH from the token sale.
A portion of the funds will be sold for US and/or Singapore dollars for short and mid term
operational costs and some will be exchanged for gold-backed asset tokens in US dollar terms.
The remaining balance of funds in ETH will be converted to US Dollar or other currency as
needed to fund the platforms development and costs. Whenever possible, expenses will be paid
directly in ETH.

Chapter 8 - Funding Usage Breakdown
Funds received from the token sale are intended to be used mostly for the development and
advancement of the platform. The level of funds that are received will dictate the extent and
timeline of development. An approximate breakdown of use $1 million received through token
sale is as follows:
Development: 65%
Research and development will involve the building of the technology as described in this
document. This includes: the Token App, smart contract systems, publishing system, claim
voting system, advertising system, and the other relevant components.
Sales and Marketing: 20%
Marketing spending will be used for bringing in new members into the platform, developing
partnerships, and bringing in advertising to the platform.
Operations: 10%
Operational costs such as office rental, accounting, and other day to day operational needs and
overheads are covered here. Operational costs also include code reviews and security audits.
Legal Fund: 5%
We think it’s a prudent idea to hold a portion of funds for any potential legal issues that may
arise.
