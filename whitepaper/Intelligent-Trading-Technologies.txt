1 - Executive Summary
Cryptocurrency markets have increased in popularity in recent years. What started with Bitcoin,
a decentralized payment system to circumvent government manipulation of currencies and
redefining “Money” as we know it, has evolved and has recently gained critical mass with
investors, traders, entrepreneurs and consumers. From a total cryptocurrency Market
Capitalization of less than $10B in 2012 to ~$144B today (17-Aug-17), cryptocurrencies
continue to gain in value and distribution.
Although the recent increase of the cryptocurrencies’ market cap and presence is rather
unprecedented, many believe that that this trend will not only continue, but will increase. With
the near-constant inflow of newly available cryptocurrencies, traders are spending more time
than ever trying to find suitable investment opportunities among the sea of choices. Numerous
tools have risen already to help traders in their quest for profit. Trading bots, and alerts are
already around, but these are constantly leaving traders wishing for more.
The availability of cryptocurrencies is a new and transformative phenomenon, and relevant data
sources are scarce and fragmented. Nevertheless, it is without question that blockchain
technology and cryptocurrencies will play a more important role in our lives going forward.
Blockchain technology is a complete game-changer, and investing in these disruptive
technologies at the very early stages should undoubtedly be extremely profitable. The real
question is ​which​ of the cryptocurrencies will dominate this space in the coming future. Investors
in this space (both new and experienced) need a tool to discern the good from the bad
investments, and an efficient method to make this selection process as easy as possible.
Our mission is to increase adoption and awareness of cryptocurrencies. Using the hyperbolic
technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify market signals and patterns that cannot be
programmed by humans, we are building the tool that will undoubtedly help you become a more
knowledgeable and successful trader.

2 - Background, Problem Overview
Cryptocurrency Markets
Cryptocurrency markets continue to increase in awareness and popularity. In 2017, the prices of
more popular virtual currencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, have soared to record highs amid
increased investor interest. This increase in investor interest has led to the emergence of many
other available options.
With just a few lines of code, nearly anyone can issue their own new cryptocurrencies and offer
it to the world. These other options include numerous “alt-coins” and “app tokens”, which have
arisen to tackle many different opportunities for which the blockchain provides next-gen
solutions. These currencies, developed on the blockchain, offer built-in transparency - but an
understanding of coding is required to comprehend the technologies and whether they are truly
capable of the disruption they claim.
This increase in the number of available cryptocurrencies has allowed for an unprecedented
opportunity for traders, but it also makes it makes a trader’s job increasingly more complex to
identify exceptional investment vehicles. Cryptocurrency market participants are overwhelmed
by a very large and growing amount of data that needs to be digested and understood to be
successful.
Young, volatile, borderless, and available 24/7 - these markets are extremely far from efficient.
This means that there are significant excess returns to be had, or Alpha - especially when
compared with traditional markets. Cryptocurrency markets are still in their infancy and we have
yet to see a significant influx of institutional interest.
The cryptocurrency market has evolved during the age of the internet, so information itself is
quite easy to come by - but good unbiased information is very difficult to identify from the
massive amount of available information. There are multiple instances of misinformation,
disinformation and widespread “pump & dump” schemes. With all of this conflicting available
information, what is the truth and what is a distraction? If traders can properly analyze and
absorb only the useful information, there are myriad ways to generate superior returns and profit.

Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence, specifically neural networks used in machine learning, are designed as
software that emulates the activity of the human brain and how it processes information. These
neural network models are particularly useful for predicting future events when trained on
historical data.
The use of these technologies has improved data science and data analyses and has recently
become impressively effective for certain tasks when compared to traditional algorithms based
on hard coded rules and pure statistical analysis. Machine intelligence as an evolving field,
11

represents the largest opportunity for staying ahead in any market where competition makes
innovation necessary.
Artificial Intelligence has been around for a while, and investments in Artificial
Intelligence-based startups is not a new thing. Since 2012, the number of deals and dollars
contributed to Artificial Intelligence startups has been on the rise, and 2016 was a record year for
startups globally. The chart below displays the increasing funding rounds of AI startups over the
last 5 years.

Source:​ ​CB Insights
Current popular utilization of AI technology is the simple substitution of routine human tasks.
This is the simplest application because AI is fast and accurate, without fatigue. For example,
estimation of stock price impact of news announcements by comparing precedential cases,
reading financial results or analyst reports to find hidden causality between many companies’
results, text mining of Twitter to find correlation between stock price and some words, etc.
Artificial intelligence has been used for over 18 years in traditional financial market trading, to
generate additional returns for many hedge funds and banks. This trend is expected to continue.
For investment and trading decisions, financial services have recently been adopting AI tools.
Capable of processing and comprehending data faster than any human, the potential for both
high-frequency trading and longer-term predictions based on intelligent intuitions leads to
substantially greater captured profits.

Artificial Intelligence in Cryptocurrency Markets
Currently, cryptocurrency traders spend countless hours in chat groups, forums, social media and
scanning new sites for information - all while trying to simultaneously comprehend complicated
technical analysis and execute trades at the precisely right time.
If a tool were to exist to help traders analyze all of this available information and allow them to
easily profit from it, it would be incredibly useful. This is done by pairing traditional market
(stocks, fiat currencies, bonds, derivatives) trading concepts with today’s cutting-edge pattern
recognition and machine learning capabilities. These technologies allow the software to scan,
analyze, and interpret the massive amount of information available. With this information, this
intelligent tool would then identify entry points and notify the trader about these price
movements ​before​ they happen. This would allow traders to profit from these moves when they
happen, not get an alert after the profits have been made. Fortunately, Intelligent Trading
Technologies (ITT) is building this ultimate companion for the ALL traders.
Let ITT’s platform do the heavy lifting and analyze all the relevant input data for
cryptocurrencies and deliver game-changing trading ideas to you to execute. ITT trading bots can
be customized to cater to your preferences for time of day, trading volumes, risk level, hold
timings, among others. ITT will monitor all of the relevant information, 24/7, on your behalf.
ITT’s platform will automatically author a strategy, and it give you the commands to execute.
ITT will then send you actionable trading alerts during the day and in time for you make the final
call whether to trade.
Our intelligent bot (Tier 2, scheduled to be released 4Q17) will be capable of self-programming
and reprogramming to match changes in the market, adjusting indicator weights, and continuous
optimization as an agent motivated solely on maximizing the traders hourly return rate.

13

3 - Mission Statement
The goal of Intelligent Trading Technologies is to empower traders with consolidated
cryptocurrency market predictors served by our fleet of AI-powered data bots orchestrated to
produce intelligent insights from a vast world of real-time data.
Thousands of alt-coins price movements across multiple exchanges is just the initial torrent of
data users must ingest to effectively trade cryptocurrencies. The most experienced traders rely on
a host of services to help them derive insights from the slew of market indicators popping up
every second. We want to empower every beginner trader with consolidated insights on when to
buy, sell, or hold their diverse portfolio of coins. Intelligent insights mean using deep learning
and statistical analysis to communicate a “why” behind each market predictor.
State-of-the-art data science tools and neural networks should be employed to provide actionable
real-time trading signals for success in the cryptocurrency markets. These disruptive
technologies are constantly and consistently changing our lives. It’s time to leverage these
technologies into cryptocurrencies.
The ITT team will use the token sale funds to further our current model, rolling out new and
exclusive bots only available via the ITT Platform with subscriptions payments accepting ITT
tokens.

“Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.” – Pablo Picasso
“I believe that the most important single thing, beyond discipline and creativity, is daring to
dare.” – Maya Angelou
In determining a good investment in any market, there are two primary methods used to try to
predict an asset’s future price:
● Fundamental Analysis (FA)
○ Typically for longer-term trading, FA involves determining an asset’s true value
based on its intrinsic properties as well as the state of the market.
● Technical Analysis (TA)
○ Technical analysis involves reading indicators and chart patterns to determine
price trends, TA is normally not concerned with the company’s fundamentals.
Technical analysis is typically used for day/swing trading (i.e. short-to-medium
term trading) and looks at past price action to determine future values.
Looking at simply FA & TA is not enough, however. There are many day traders out there trying
to profit from this.
Fortunately, trading using TA works really well in cryptocurrency markets, and ultimately the
goal is to provide you with quality data to make educated choices. However, when trading based
on TA, it is fairly common to receive mixed indicators (one bullish, one bearish). The added
value from a smart platform powered by AI is to intelligently scan for even more indicators or
signals from multiple data sources to support one direction or the other. AI is constantly learning
and adapting to changing market conditions.
ITT’s platform learns from historical time series of price and volume. ITT’s data bots are
constantly scanning and learning from the vast array of data available on the internet. Therefore
the model is expected to be effective if the market environment is consistent with the near past.
This is something that the machine learning helps with - because at times mere humans may
perceive the cryptocurrency market as unpredictable when in fact clear patterns emerge when
reading between the lines.
Even in a nascent, volatile, and not yet efficient market such as the cryptocurrency markets,
technical analysis can accurately predict price action based on historical data. The shortfall
comes with that this cannot predict a human’s motivations and actions. If a whale decides to
move a market, given the lack of regulations and potential for market manipulation, the best
quantitative model in the world won’t be able to predict the price swings. Obviously, the model
does not foresee any of idiosyncratic event such as natural disaster, referendum, or political
change which are very difficult for humans too. Who could’ve predicted the GDAX, one of the
largest and most active cryptocurrency exchanges out there, and the flash crash in June where
ETH prices dropped from $319 to $0.10 in an instant.

15

When deciding what indicators to use on ITT’s platform, we did a thorough analysis of what
currently exists, and made a wish-list of indicators that would be included on the platform.
From nearly a year of meticulous backtesting and tweaking our indicators, we have come up with
a useful lot.
The exact triggers for these indicators is proprietary, but the source code for Tier 1 pricing
indicators is available on GitHub.

ITT Bot UI Mock up

The above screenshot is from the current Tier 1 ITT Platform. The data is pulled live from
multiple exchanges. Each alert will be a concise summary either “BULLISH” or “BEARISH”
and has a link to full details of the report.

Alert Description
The alerts are easy to understand. Current Tier 1 alerts are showing the following:
● Trading Pair
○ The cryptocurrency pair for which the alert is triggered. In this example,
ETH/USDT (Ethereum/USD Tether).
● Overall Rating
○ This gives you a quick sign of what our algorithms are predicting with the asset.
The two options are:
16

●

●
●

■ Bullish
■ Bearish
○ The strength of this signal will be rated up to 5 stars (strongest signal)
○ This is a weighted summary of the summation of all the indicators. These
weightings continue to be optimized for excess returns.
○ This rating is a link to a full report detailing the alerts that were triggered.
Time Horizon
○ Each alert comes with an expected Time Horizon for the alert. These horizons are
defined by number of trading periods (15 minute intervals).
■ Short (minutes)
■ Medium (hours)
■ Long (days)
○ Short Time Horizon represents <20 periods, Medium represents 20-50 periods,
and long represents >50 periods.
Exchange
○ This shows the exchange on which the trading alert was triggered, in this
example: Bittrex.

Details of the Alert
By clicking on the alert link, users will be taken to a summary of what triggered the trading
alerts. This summary is broken out into:
Technicals - Price & Volume
In development of the bot, we have incorporated many different technical indicators for testing.
Currently, the only the most relevant and consistent indicators are being used.
How indicators work is all about how they are used in a trading plan. Moving Averages, MACD,
RSI, CCI do their job in terms of calculations. The real added value is how ITT's technology
interprets the information and learns from it as part of an overall trading strategy. There is
absolutely no "holy grail" single indicator or signal. Proper use of standard indicators with
meticulous backward and forward testing, paired with having the use of these indicators evolve
as the market evolves to optimize the trading strategy for maximum trade returns.
This section will start with an overall rating for the section, based on a weighted-average of the
indicators included in this section.

5 - Roadmap
"Collaboration allows teachers to capture each other's fund of collective intelligence." --Mike
Schmoker

Phase 1: Initial Development
4Q16
● Concept realization of a trading assistant for Cryptocurrency Markets.
1Q17
● Development of an advanced trading assistant (on Telegram) begins as a side project.
● Initial Telegram Bot included trading alerts based on predefined price and volume change
with limited available cryptocurrencies.
● Testing continues by founders, friends, and advisors.
● Increased development leads to introduction of technical analysis indicators in trading
alerts.
2Q17
● Authoring of whitepaper as 3 new advisors join the team.
● Continued development and testing of more advanced features with Telegram bot - an
additional artificial intelligence professional joined to incorporate AI features into ITT.

Phase 2
3Q17
● ITT Platform (bots and algorithms) continues to be tweaked and optimized to produce
market-beating returns.
● Private Beta Tier 1 ITT Bot released on Telegram for limited public use (using Technical
Analysis, AI features not included).
● ITT Token Sale.
● Acceleration of development in statistical data modelling, and trader experience patterns.
4Q17
● Tier 2 AI-enabled ITT Bot released on a subscription-based model.
● Personalized trading alert settings made available on ITT Bot.
● Availability of Portfolio management companion app.
1Q18
● Support added for Simplified Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Cantonese, Spanish
● Additional Features added to ITT Bot - Social Media Sentiment Indicators. Investigate
potential inclusion of predictive markets - partnership with Augur/Gnosis.
● Continue to build ITT community of traders.

21

Phase 3
2Q18
● ITT users gain access to exclusive cryptocurrencies Research reports (buy/sell)
● Release of alternative alerts - via Slack, WeChat, Twitter, Wire, Ambit
3Q18
● ITT launches separate quant fund.
Ongoing
● ITT Bot will continue to be tweaked and developed - these data bots will be constantly
re-tested and optimized.
● We intend to bring institutional-level trading technology and make it available to the
masses. Smart automated loss prevention trades available.
● API access to user accounts on exchanges for faster trade initiating and option for
implementing smart automated loss prevention trades.
Machine learning and specifically the implementation of generative adversarial networks will
will further disrupt the growing effectiveness in trading crytpocurrency assets. Furthermore, our
focus will remain on both infrastructure and tuning the neural models to effectively produce
high-confidence trading predictions from trillions of data signals ranging from media outlets,
social networks, international trade relations, current events, and technology advancements.
While timing is difficult to predict, the team has its sights set upon an AI assistant capable
self-programming, retraining, and continued self-optimization. And, at the same time promoting
open and transparent transacting inside smart contracts on the Ethereum network blockchain.

6 - Token Mechanism
The Intelligent Trading Technology Token (ITT) is an ERC20 Ethereum token. Ethereum tokens
are represented as smart contracts that are executed on the publicly-available Ethereum
blockchain. The ITT token’s design follows the widely-adopted token implementation standards.
This allows token holders to easily store and manage their ITT tokens using existing solutions
including Ethereum Wallet.
The source code to ITT’s smart contract is publicly available on GitHub. The supply of ITT
tokens is limited to 21 million ITT tokens. The Ethereum network enforces that there will never
be more than this initial 21 million ITT tokens minted.
ITT tokens are essential to pay subscription fees on the ITT platform.
Subscriptions, paid in ITT tokens will target prices to that uphold two goals:
- maintains enough exclusivity to prevent the user crowd from becoming a
market-manipulator
- remain available to amateur low-volume traders
Tier 1 Subscription Services - ​This ITT Bot sends alerts based on numerous technical
indicators, and will start off around $5/month, payable in ITT Tokens.
The pricing mechanism is a product of factors including number of subscribers, inverse
relationship of the USD value of the ITT Token, and elastic to the ratio of total subscribers to
Total Market Cap of all cryptocurrencies.

Tier 2 Subscription Services - ​This ITT Bot will send customizable alerts personalized by
artificial intelligence (neural network) models tuned to your trading goals and optimized to your
individual trading ability. The Tier 2 ITT Bot will start off around $20/month, payable in ITT
Tokens.
A similar pricing mechanism was used in producing the ideal pricing equilibrium, adding
elasticity in price according to the ratio of AI-Powered traders (ITT Service users) versus
non-AI-Powered traders. This ensures the effectiveness of the AI advantage of ITT’s Platform.
