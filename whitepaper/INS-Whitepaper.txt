1. ABSTRACT
This white paper explores global grocery market challenges, a technology paradigm shift
offering transformative potential, and the business and technical aspects of the solution INS is
developing for capitalizing on this potential. Highlights of the paper follow below:

The grocery market, one of the largest consumer markets in the world, is forecast to reach $8.5
trillion by 2020. It is reaching a digital tipping point, with much of its growth to come from
online. Online grocery, being the target segment for INS, is expected to grow from $98 billion in
2015 to $290 billion in 2020, according to IDG estimates.

Despite the tremendous growth, the grocery market has two large interrelated
problems - abuse by grocery retailers and ineffective trade promotions.
The grocery market dominated by retailers. ​Retail chains capture a very high share of grocery
revenue and have a huge influence over manufacturers, causing deep impact on consumers
worldwide. Retailers dictate what food is grown and how it is processed, packaged, priced and
promoted. As an example, in the UK, four retailers serve as a slim conduit for 7,000
manufactures to sell their products to 25 million households1, which demonstrates how the
existence of retailer abuse in the grocery industry has not only been allowed to develop but also
thrived.

Ineffective, costly and outdated trade promotions practice. ​Trade promotion spending
represent 17% of manufacturer’s sales2. Each year, over $50 billion3 on trade promotions never
reaches the consumer. Unfairness in today’s promotion-laden atmosphere go hand in hand with
the rising costs of promotions and the inefficiencies they produce. 95% of manufacturers admit
that trade promotions inefficiency is an extremely important issue.4

INS is implementing a decentralized ecosystem enabling consumers to save up
to 30%5 on everyday shopping buying directly from grocery manufacturers.
Direct interaction between consumers and manufacturers. ​Bypassing retailers and wholesalers
means a more personalized and transparent grocery shopping experience at lower prices.
Сonsumers will be able to decide which brands they want and goods they need. We call it
“Consumption 2.0” since 21st century customers are tired from a one-way street type of
communication, whereby retailers push goods onto them that maximize retailer’s profit - not
what consumers really want. We also want consumers to have unimpeded access to
independent and local manufacturers, including farmers, that do not fit retailer supply chain or
procurement terms and can’t get their goods on retail shelves.
Enabling manufacturers to market their goods directly to the consumers. ​No more costly and
inefficient trade promotions grabbed by retailers and wholesalers. INS will enable
manufacturers to create bespoke marketing programs to reward their customers directly. These
programs run on smart contracts and powered by the INS token as a means of reward. It is

similar to miles-based reward programs of many airlines, but more advanced, cheaper to run
and personalized thanks to smart contracts behind them. This was hardly possible before the
blockchain and smart contract era.

INS has the prerequisites to perform an ambitious task of disrupting the grocery
industry based on our deep industry knowledge and confirmed interest from the
largest grocery manufacturers in the world.
More than 4 years of grocery industry track record​. INS is founded by veterans of the online
grocery industry, using the knowledge and experience acquired since 2013. ​We have built strong
relationships manufacturers and gained valuable feedback from consumers.
INS received strong interest from both large and small consumer goods manufacturers in the
world. ​Selected logos of manufacturers that expressed interest to sign up (on a global or
regional basis) are provided below.

2. INTRODUCTION
2.1. GROCERY MARKET CHALLENGES
ABUSES OF BUYER POWER BY RETAILERS
The global grocery industry is dominated by mass-market retail chains. At the national level in
many countries, a large share of the grocery market is frequently in the hands of few retailers.
While some amounts of buyer power are understandable and simply desirable for competitive
advantage, the high level of concentration causes a growing imbalance of buyer power within
the supply chain.
Exerting buyer power is natural when not abused​. It is understandable that any industry
participant would seek bigger volumes as a tool for negotiating better prices. But retailers push
the limits of what is fair. Grocery retailers are perpetually and aggressively extracting better
terms from already squeezed manufacturers, going far beyond the benefits a player should
receive for attaining economies of scale.
Large or small, no manufacturer has enough power​. Global constituents, such as Procter &
Gamble, Nestle, and Unilever, do play a role in the industry and have more negotiating power
than small manufacturers. Still, these companies simply are no match for the extensive control
retailers have on end-customers throughout the supply chain. For example, Wal-Mart’s sales are
approximately 5 times greater than those of its largest supplier, Procter & Gamble.6 Wal-Mart
accounted for 16% of Procter & Gamble sales in 2016.7
Retailer buyer abuse extends beyond normal pressure​. The explanation of this pressure is
abuse of buyer power. Such power allows retailers to determine what will and will not be
stocked, and on what terms, such as sources, quantity, quality, delivery schedules, packaging,
returns policy, and above all, price and payment conditions. Indeed, a supermarket company
wields an important bargaining chip, namely the threat to stop selling one or more products.
Evidence of retail power abuse - The Competition Commission in the UK, for example, did find
that major retailers enjoy a price advantage that exceeds the cost difference. Additional
departures from proper retail conduct included: delaying payments to manufacturers beyond

the terms in the contracts; and changing quantities or product-quality specifications at less than
three days’ notice, and without paying compensation to manufacturer.8 The figure below offers
specific evidence of retail buyer power abuse and lack of adherence to codes of conduct, which
was covered in various news outlets.

INS will help grocery manufacturers to bypass retailers and wholesalers and
directly sell and promote their products to consumers.

SUPPLY CHAIN INEFFICIENCIES
High distances between manufacture and consumption​. The average meal in the US travels
about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate.9 This problem is relevant for many countries and
leads to acute financial and ecological consequences with significant adverse impact in the
long-term. Food miles, the distance food travels from the place it has been grown to where it is
ultimately consumed or purchased, increase significantly when buyers import food from other
parts of the country, region or world.10
Waste in various areas of the supply chain​. In distribution centers and on grocery store shelves,
food is being wasted. Every night, some perishable items must be thrown out. According to a
recent survey, 400 million pounds of food is served by supermarkets, yet nearly a third of it is
wasted annually.11 Unfortunately, current retail systems are designed to reduce stock-outs
rather than measure and manage food waste. Therefore, managers optimize to ensure food is
left over on the shelf.12

INS will decrease food miles, enabling consumers to unimpededly access local
manufacturers, including farmers. INS will implement the effective "pull" system
to reduce inventories and out-of-stocks that would decrease the food waste.

TRADE PROMOTIONS ARE INEFFECTIVE, COSTLY AND OUTDATED
Grocery manufacturers spend up to 17% of their sales on trade promotions. Trade promotions
comprise a growing category of manufacturer expenses directed to wholesale and retail
distributors rather than to consumers. Manufacturers spend more than $500 billion on trade
promotions annually13, and according to some reports 66% of that spend generates negative
returns and leads to higher grocery prices.

INS is targeting to replace trade promotions with a more personalized, direct
and efficient marketing, thus driving grocery prices down and facilitating the
effective direct interaction between manufacturers and consumers.

2.2. FOUNDERS’ EXPERIENCE
INS founders gained a first-hand and practical experience in the grocery industry while
developing and growing Instamart, the largest venture-backed grocery delivery operator in
Russia. Instamart employs over 200 people, has signed contracts with the largest retailers in the
country, and works with the leading grocery manufacturers.
Four years of operating experience in the grocery retail sector helped to identify major
inefficiencies and abuses in the industry’s current construct. INS pursue a large opportunity to
disrupt the global grocery retail market via establishing a decentralized and fair ecosystem that
directly connects manufacturers and consumers.

3. MARKET OVERVIEW
3.1. GLOBAL GROCERY MARKET
❖ The grocery market is one of the largest consumer markets in the world: it is expected
to reach $8.5 trillion by 2020 with up to 50% share of a customer’s wallet
❖ Grocery retailers have acquired a dominant market share and high concentration: up to
90% of the market in many countries is controlled by a handful of retailers
❖ The grocery industry is reaching a digital tipping point, with much of its growth
expected to come from online

A VERY LARGE MARKET WITH EXTENSIVE IMPACT
The global grocery industry is forecasted to grow at a 6.1% annually from 2016 to 2020,
reaching an estimated $8.5 trillion in 2020.14 The grocery market is a defensive one which
means that it tends to stay stable in good and bad economic times, given there will always be a
demand for food.
One of the biggest segments of retail and comprising a significant share of the consumer’s
wallet, the industry has a deep impact on grocery sector stakeholders, particularly
manufacturers and consumers. As an example of the consumer impact, the figure below shows
the portion of consumers’ household spending on food in a variety of countries.

HIGH MARKET CONCENTRATION LEADS TO HIGHER PRICES
The concentration of grocery retail markets is high throughout the world. Top grocery retail
corporations comprise an incredibly high share of the market. For example, in Portugal, 90% of
the grocery market is controlled by the nation’s top three retailers. As the market becomes more
concentrated, competition gets weaker and prices of grocery products rise.

3.2. ONLINE GROCERY MARKET
❖ Online grocery, being the target segment for INS, is expected to grow from $98 billion
in 2015 to $290 billion in 2020
❖ Grocery is the last major consumer market moving rapidly into online, offering
tremendous opportunities for those who will lead this shift
❖ INS is well equipped to lead in the online grocery segment and is addressing key
consumer demands - cheaper prices, higher convenience, better quality, and unique
rewards directly from manufacturers

ONLINE GROCERY WILL EXPLODE
The global online grocery market increased by 16% in 2016. IGD projects double-digit annual
growth rates for online grocery in largest markets by 2020. Top 10 global markets alone are
expected to explode from $98 billion in 2015 to $290 billion in 2020.17

DEMAND AND SUPPLY DRIVERS
Consumers are becoming increasingly time-starved. The rapid growth in online grocery retail
can be attributed to various factors such as demographic profile of consumers, number of
working women, good internet connectivity, rising usage of smartphones, convenience, etc.
Traditional in-store buying of grocery is becoming more cumbersome given the fast pace of
lives, especially in urban areas. Moreover, buyers are overcoming the biases of wanting to touch
and see food and grocery products before buying. Consumers, pressed for time, are looking for
options which offer increased convenience and save time. Online grocery buying offers exactly
that and hence is gaining popularity across consumer segments.
Demand drivers

INS Ecosystem Limited, incorporated as a BVI company (“INS”), is the official entity that creates
the INS tokens, platform and technology. INS is focused on releasing open source cryptographic
technologies that enable operation in the INS ecosystem. For the avoidance of doubt, the INS
tokens do not provide token holders with any ownership or other interest in INS. Token holders
are not entitled to any guaranteed form of dividends, revenue distributions, and voting rights.
To become an ecosystem participant, the user creates an account on the INS platform. During
the registration, the system will create a user profile and a wallet. Each participant of the
ecosystem will be provided with a wallet that preserves all data in the decentralized database
and interact with other parties, utilizing smart contracts. We plan to place the INS token on
cryptographic token exchanges, giving an opportunity to openly buy them (to residents of
countries where the purchase of digital tokens does not violate local laws).
15

4.2. ECOSYSTEM PARTICIPANTS
The ecosystem will be built in accordance with a scalable and decentralized approach that
ensures stability and sustainability in the long term.
The ecosystem will involve the following participants, which will participate as depicted in the
next diagram:

4.3. BLOCKCHAIN & SMART CONTRACTS
Blockchain is a shared-database technology, mostly popular for underpinning bitcoin digital
currency. It works with linked databases that update digital ledgers unceasingly.
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer
and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained
therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. Smart contracts permit
trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties
without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism. They
render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.
The INS platform is designed as a very high-load system. The market potential for the INS
ecosystem consists of millions of users, each of them making dozens of orders per year. The
main focus is on performance, in which we seek smart contracts support, predictability, stability,
and ease of use. We plan to use the most proven and scalable open source technologies and
constantly monitor alternative technical implementations.
As the existing blockchain platforms such as Ethereum have inherent limitation in transaction
bandwidth (currently limiting to a dozen tx/sec), and prospective platforms and frameworks are
only in the development stage, we also consider designing and developing our own INS
blockchain platform in the future, where nodes are selected from a semi-trusted set of
supporters. Given the trust in the nodes, we will implement one of much faster consensus
algorithms from the BFT family (HoneyBadgerBFT/Zyzzyva/others), enabling up to thousands
transactions per second. A smart contract virtual machine will run on top of the consensus
algorithm. The state of the INS blockchain will be regularly anchored to the most popular smart
contract ledgers (at least ETH) so that proofs of state and proofs of transaction (within INS) can
be verified by Ethereum smart contracts (like it is currently done in BTCRelay or will be done in
the future in Plasma). Common optimization techniques such as state sharding and payment
channels will be also implemented.

SMART CONTRACTS
Blockchain and smart contracts provide the tools and framework to create a new generation of
marketplaces where supply and demand sides can engage in trusted trading transactions,
according to various business rules, without the need of a central brokerage entity.
Consequently, the same way online marketplaces disrupted many traditional brick and mortar
businesses, blockchain and smart contracts will give birth to a new kind of peer-to-peer
marketplaces that will unsettle the current ones.
INS will provide a number of smart contract templates that will be used to facilitate the sale
mechanism. The peer-to-peer structure is the perfect fit for the decentralized nature of the INS
ecosystem and has the benefit of handing over the power back to the people participating in the
ecosystem.

PAYMENTS
The payment process in e-commerce currently entails more than 10 different steps to settle a
transaction and up to 15 separate fees to pay for payment gateways, thus making transaction
fees range from 2% to 6%, a long route that could be cut short with blockchain use. Blockchain
is the perfect tool for ecommerce to be more efficient and more trustful. Payment processing
through blockchain has a significantly bigger potential for transaction high speeds and low
prices, let alone all the possible variety of ways smart contracts can improve both ecommerce
and payments. A tokenized ledger will provide a complete token-based system, similar to “real”
money where tokens are sent and exchanged at different times and for different reasons, based
on predefined rules and events.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
E-commerce companies must manage a complex supply chain of manufacturers, third-party
vendors, carriers and logistics providers. A blockchain of the transaction, containing order
details and negotiated fees and commissions (in the form of smart contracts) will be used to
capture documents, delivery and possible return events, and drive financial settlement with
fewer opportunities for dispute. The public-private nature of blockchain records means that
each party can make data visible to the others. All parties have visibility into the transaction and
no custom interface has to be negotiated between partners (only to/from the blockchain).
The blockchain is the system of record for the entire transaction. It doesn’t merely record the
transaction, it drives the whole process. This will reduce time delays, added costs and human
errors that plague transactions today, automate inventory control, and streamline fulfillment
processes, but errors to some extent are possible since grocery products are not digital, the
blockchain records of their track is inevitably post-factum.

5. INS PLATFORM
5.1. KEY COMPONENTS AND PROCESSES
PRODUCTS
Products in the consumer markets constitute the basic item that actions revolve around. To
make it simple and convenient, products on the INS platform are required to have several
defined parameters, such as name, category assignment, volume, price, description, ingredients,
etc. that makes it easy to find and choose products for ordering.

PLACING ORDER
Consumers choose products to buy, specify delivery details, and pay in fiat, BTC, ETH or INS
tokens. Depending on the payment method, consumers will be eligible to different prices and
rewards.

Consumer can order products using the official INS website, the official app or a derivation of
the official app released by a specific manufacturer.

PRODUCT SEARCH
The decentralized file storage network (we explore different options from IPFS to Storj) is used
to maintain up-to-date databases of products listed by manufacturers. Consumers can apply
sorting and filters to choose what they want to buy. Manufacturers may distribute proprietary

21

apps derived from the reference implementation, in which they can choose specific sorting
methods and filters for products.
68% of consumers that shopped online say they are very likely to switch grocers for a better
online shopping experience (quick, easy, convenient, enjoyable)21. Browsing tens of thousands
of products online can be very daunting for consumers, so we will make it as easy as possible
for them to find the products that they love. For instance, we will provide catalogue filters for
item attributes such as Local, Gluten-Free, Organic and On Sale.

We will use the 1-to-1 personalization right from the homepage where consumers should feel
that the experience has been tailored specifically to them. Consumers will see their previous
orders, have access to their most frequently purchased items, and be shown products and
specials that are relevant based on their shopping history. The 1-to-1 personalization will extend
to search results, the products displayed at the top of each department, product
recommendations in the cart, and daily/weekly offers.

Today's consumers have a range of choices about where to shop, and sellers need to work hard
to earn repeat business. Rewards and discount programs give customers more reason to come
back again, especially in the competitive grocery market. In the INS ecosystem, manufacturers
will be able to apply any logic in the smart contract to create bespoke reward programs
according to their needs.
LOYALTY
Loyalty reward mechanisms is one of the best ways for manufacturers to easily set up a loyalty
program to reward long-term customers. Payments are processed by smart contracts making it
possible to proof that a consumer is eligible for a reward. Manufacturers set the rules such as
reward type, expiration date, product lists that the reward can be spent on, amount, etc. Loyalty
reward instruments will be coded in a smart contract, which accepts reward funds from the
manufacturer and distributes them to those who provide proofs of eligibility linked to consumer
wallets.

PROMOTION
Automated promotion reward mechanism is built to incentivize consumers to make a first
order. Promotion reward mechanism will be coded in a smart contract, where manufacturers set
the rules (expiration date, list of products, customer parameters, etc.) and deposit tokens that
can only be used to buy pre-defined products during a limited period of time.
CROSS-MARKETING
Cross-marketing mechanism will be used by manufacturers to promote products to new
audiences and generate more sales. Manufacturers can find partners - other manufacturers that
created custom apps and sell complementary products, and cross-promote each other.
Cross-marketing reward instruments will be coded in a smart contract, where the product
details and reward rules are specified. The cross-marketing mechanism intends to incentivize
manufacturers to share app traffic with other manufacturers and help consumers discover more
products.
REFERRAL
INS will create the INS Reserve Fund as the part of the token generation event with the primary
goal to use these tokens as referral rewards to new customers and popularize the INS
ecosystem.
FEEDBACK
Manufacturers, seeking to receive direct customer feedback on their products, will be able to
incentivise consumers with INS tokens to motivate them to participate. The feedback reward
mechanism allows to set a specific set of parameters and create a focus group of consumers
from whom a manufacturer wants to receive feedback. The customer data will not be shared
with manufacturers and will initially be processed in a centralized way on the INS platform, but
later decentralized as consumers will provide privacy-preserving proofs of eligibility which
enable them submitting a feedback without being identified.

MINIMUM BALANCE
Manufacturers will be required to hold a balance in INS tokens equal to some portion of
previous month sales to guarantee the ability to pay all types of rewards. Manufacturers can
either keep tokens received from consumers or buy tokens on exchanges to comply with the
requirement.

23

RATING SCORE
The reputation system is important to establish trust between counterparties. Initially rating
scores will be deployed for manufacturers and fulfillment parties, and later might possibly
include consumers too.
We plan to code the rating smart contracts so that they would count the ratings and accept
privacy-preserving proofs of validity from consumers, while satisfying the following security
requirements:
●
●
●
●

Transparency: it should be clear how the ratings are accrued
Legitimacy: only certain set of participants (i.e. manufacturer’s customers) are able to
rate
Integrity: it should be difficult, if not impossible, to manipulate the ratings
Privacy: the consumers who rate do not disclose their identity or other personal details

ORDER STATUS
All smart contracts are limited in their ability to read data outside the blockchain. The natural
way to make smart contracts process external data is to submit it digitally signed by a proper
participant (oracle) from off-chain so that a contract can verify the signature and process the
data.
The order status report will form automatically during the fulfillment process and contain the
following signed confirmations:
●
●
●
●
●
●

Manufacturer: supply request received and fulfilled
Worker: products delivered to a fulfillment center
Worker: order assembled and ready for delivery
Courier: order picked up
Courier: order delivered
Consumer: order received

Each participant has a private key to his account securely encrypted and stored in the wallet,
and the latter also creates and verifies signatures so that the entire process is smooth. Once the
statuses are reflected on-chain, this data is available to other participants or various smart
contracts in the system.

24

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Maintaining a high rating score incentivises all ecosystem participants to act truthfully,
rendering the dispute mechanism unnecessary in practice in the vast majority of cases. The
dispute mechanism will be built to make it as easy as possible to solve a dispute without calling
a 3rd party arbiter. If failed, an INS employee will serve as an arbiter. The dispute result can
influence the rating score for both defendant and complainant.

PERSONAL DATA SECURITY
Handling personal data securely is a task of great importance to us. Due to the public nature of
data in the blockchain, we cannot store such information as customer names, addresses,
mobile numbers, KYC data, and documentation there. Permissions on the blockchain will be
made easily verifiable to allow cooperation of different entities in the ecosystem. The actual
personal data and information will be stored in a centralized storage, managed and secured by
INS. As the decentralization continues, we will store less and less personal data.
The secure storage will allow accessing the data without the need for usernames or passwords
using the following scheme:
●
●
●
●

When the data is saved into the storage it will be linked to the public identifier of the
entity such as a blockchain address
The party that wants to retrieve the data should confirm their identity by signing the
request with the private key that corresponds to their blockchain address
Storage service will get the information about permissions from blockchain, check that
the signature is valid and the requester has the right to access the data
If the check is successful, the data will be returned to the requestor and a confirmation
record will be made in the blockchain

INCENTIVES FOR CONSUMERS
●
●
●
●

Order everyday grocery and consumable products cheaper than at retail stores
Get orders delivered to the doorstep without need to spend time on offline shopping
Leave feedback to influence manufacturers
Get different types of rewards

26

6. APPS & INTERFACES
We plan to develop and publish a website and mobile apps for consumers, as well as mobile
apps and web interfaces for all other ecosystem participants.

CONSUMER APPS & WEBSITE

Consumers will shop for groceries and provide feedback on the website or in the apps. The
official consumer app implements the consumer side of the model including access to smart
contracts and access to products from a decentralized cloud storage.
The app will be published as open source software on GitHub and serve as the formal reference
implementation. Manufacturers can alter the official app and release their own branded and
customized apps. We will publish an open source customization software development kit
(SDK) with tutorials and documentation to make the app customization process as easy as
possible. Customized app implementations are not forks of the INS platform and are not forks
of the INS token but simply a different client for the same network.
27

FULFILLMENT APP
The fulfillment app will provide a smooth order fulfillment process to allow fulfillment center
workers and couriers to coordinate with each other, manufacturers and consumers. The
fulfillment app will be published on Android Play.

WEB INTERFACE FOR MANUFACTURERS

The web interface for manufacturers will run in a web browser without the requirement of local
installation and allow to perform all actions, including listing and editing products, performing
stock control, setting delivery options and reward policies.

WEB INTERFACE FOR FULFILLMENT CENTER OPERATORS
The web interface for fulfillment center operators will run in a web browser without the
requirement of local installation and allow to set warehousing fees, receive statistics and
earning reports.

28

7. ROADMAP
Our roadmap involves many different aspects, such as technology development, operational
infrastructure installment, signing partnerships, and launching marketing initiatives. The
preliminary roadmap is presented below. Dates and activities may be subject to change.

29

7.1. DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP
Our goal is to create the leading decentralized consumer marketplace used by broad audiences
by maintaining a thriving ecosystem of consumers willing to buy everyday products at lower
prices and manufacturers looking to sell directly and surpass existing retail chains. Our main
role is to develop the open source technology required for running the platform and create a
successful model to incentivize all participants.

MILESTONE #1: PLATFORM IMPLEMENTATION
The first milestone is the implementation of the decentralized INS platform. We always
welcome feedback from the community regarding the specifics and plan to continually improve
the platform to make it fully secure and transparent.
After the ICO period, all contributors will receive the ERC20 compatible INS token on the
Ethereum network. After launching the INS platform on own blockchain platform or a blockchain
platform that will be chosen from the list of suitable alternatives, a token native to that platform
will be deployed. The ERC20 compatible INS token will be exchanged 1-to-1 with a native INS
token.
The main part of the decentralized platform will be implemented as a set of smart contracts
carrying out the behaviors described in the INS platform section of this document.
The official smart contracts will be published as open source software on GitHub and include
implementation for:
●
●
●
●

Basic functionality like trading tokens between addresses
Product publishing
Fulfillment process reporting
Reward mechanisms

MILESTONE #2: APPS AND WEB INTERFACES DEVELOPMENT
While the first milestone concentrates on the backend of the system, the second milestone
concentrates on the frontend and end-user experience.
30

We plan to release the consumer website, a reference implementation of the consumer app, and
the fulfillment app. We plan to use React/React Native technologies to share most of the
codebase between web/mobile. The apps will include a thin client based on a standard open
source implementation that will allow the apps to communicate with the various smart
contracts on the INS platform. The web interface for manufacturers and fulfillment center
operators will run in a web browser without the requirement of local installation.

MILESTONE #3: ECOSYSTEM EXPANSION
With the majority of required technology for operating the INS ecosystem at scale available, our
main focus will shift from development to growth. Investment in network growth will not wait
until all development has been finalized and will take place in parallel as soon as viable versions
of the apps and interfaces are available for preliminary release. Growth of the network is
two-sided and depends on both manufacturers and consumers.
MANUFACTURERS
The INS ecosystem will benefit from as many high-quality manufacturers joining the ecosystem
as possible. Manufacturers are the publishers and providers of products in the ecosystem and
serve as engines for driving traffic. Manufacturers consume INS tokens to provide all types of
reward programs. Channels for attracting manufacturers include manufacturers who already
supported the INS idea, direct contacts with manufacturers, participation in relevant meetings
and conferences, forming partnerships with manufacturer associations, and providing guidance
and support to new manufacturers interested in joining the ecosystem in order to make the
process as seamless as possible.
CONSUMERS
The more active consumers are in the network, the more turnover and the greater the profits will
be for manufacturers. Greater turnover increases the ecosystem value. Channels for increasing
the consumer base include marketing and promotion of the INS apps and website to broader
audiences and promotion of the online grocery delivery in general. Attracting more consumers
is not the only avenue of growth; improving engagement of existing customers is equally
important. Customer retention in the network can be increased by ongoing improvement to the
core product.

31

7.2. GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION PLAN
We plan to choose cities for expansion based on the population size, income level and grocery
market concentration ratio. The map below presents a preliminary list of cities, which might be
subject to change as we progress with the project.

INS founders’ previous experience with Instamart serves as a very solid jump start. We plan to
actively engage independent fulfillment center owners to join the INS ecosystem, further
accelerating expansion and enhancing the decentralized nature of the ecosystem.

32

8. INS TOKEN
8.1. STRUCTURE
After the ICO period, all contributors will receive an ERC20 exchangeable INS tokens on the
Ethereum network. Whenever the INS blockchain is launched with its own token mechanism, the
ERC20 token will be always accepted for exchange to a new token 1-to-1.
The INS token is a core component of the INS ecosystem and is designed to facilitate all kinds
of operations that make the token an integral part of the ecosystem and the driver for its
economy. The INS token is fractionally divisible, transferable and fungible.The token balances
and transfers will be tracked by INS. In the case of any force majeure, such as large token theft,
contract compromise, or a disrupting change of Ethereum protocol, INS may opt to freeze token
transfers and issue a new token contract with balances replacing that of the original token
registry by certain date. In the case of an Ethereum fork, INS will properly announce which
branch it will support.
INS Token Contract Address: 0
​ x5b2e4a700dfbc560061e957edec8f6eeeb74a320

8.2. USAGE
The INS token is planned to be the only means of exchange for handling all types of rewards
and one of the means of payment within the INS ecosystem. We plan that INS tokens will be
accepted as a payment method in partner services.

INS TOKEN USAGE
Manufacturers
● Rewards: loyalty, promotion, cross-marketing, feedback
● Minimum balance hold
Consumers
● Payment for orders
INS
●

Referral rewards to consumers
33

8.3. ADOPTION
One of our key goals is the introduction of a decentralized consumer marketplace to audiences
that have little experience with cryptocurrencies and likely to have little-to-no knowledge of
blockchain-based technologies. The INS ecosystem will be expanding beyond the crypto
community and focusing its activity on the broad audiences. Providing services to this audience
requires perfect knowledge of the grocery industry and its specifics.
Given extensive industry experience, our team knows exactly what consumers want. We will
make it very simple and straightforward for consumers to buy, earn and use INS tokens. The
complexities of opening and maintaining a cryptocurrency wallet will be made seamless in the
INS website and apps.

12. RISK FACTORS
An acquisition of the INS tokens involves a high degree of risk. Each potential purchaser of the INS tokens should
carefully consider the following information about these risks before he decides to buy the INS tokens. If any of the
following risks actually occurs, the INS platform and the value of the INS tokens could be materially adversely affected.
Risks and uncertainties described below in this White Paper may not be the only ones token holders face. Additional
risks and uncertainties may also materially adversely affect on the INS platform or the value of the INS tokens.

1. RISKS CONNECTED TO THE VALUE OF INS TOKENS
1.1. Lack of Development of Market for INS tokens. Because there has been no prior public trading market for the INS
tokens, the sale of the INS tokens described in this White Paper may not result in an active or liquid market for the INS
tokens, and their price may be highly volatile. Although applications have been made to the cryptographic token
exchanges for the INS tokens to be admitted to trading, an active public market may not develop or be sustained after
the INS token sale. If a liquid trading market for the INS tokens does not develop, the price of the INS tokens may
become more volatile and token holder may be unable to sell or otherwise transact in the INS tokens at any time.
1.2. Risks Relating to Highly Speculative Traded Price. ​The valuation of digital tokens in a secondary market is
usually not transparent, and highly speculative. The INS tokens do not hold any ownership rights to Company’s assets
and, therefore, are not backed by any tangible asset. Traded price of the INS tokens can fluctuate greatly within a short
period of time. There is a high risk that a token holder could lose his/her entire contribution amount. In the worst-case
scenario, the INS tokens could be rendered worthless.
1.3. INS Tokens May Have No Value. The INS tokens may have no value and there is no guarantee or representation of
liquidity for the INS tokens. Company Parties are not and shall not be responsible for or liable for the market value of
the INS tokens, the transferability and/or liquidity of the INS tokens and/or the availability of any market for the INS
tokens through third parties or otherwise. For the purposes of this Section of the White Paper, the term "Company
Parties" shall include Company and its respective past, present and future employees, officers, directors, contractors,
consultants, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent
companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns (hereinafter in this
Section – "Company Parties").
1.4. INS Tokens May Be Non-Refundable. Except for as provided in a legally binding documentation or prescribed by
the applicable legislation, Company Parties are not obliged to provide the INS token holders with a refund related to the
INS tokens. No promises of future performance or price are or will be made in respect to the INS tokens, including no
promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that the Tokens will hold any
particular value. Therefore, the recovery of spent resources may be impossible or may be subject to foreign laws or
regulations, which may not be the same as the private law of the INS token holder.
2. BLOCKCHAIN AND SOFTWARE RISKS
2.1. Blockchain Delay Risk. On the most blockchains used for cryptocurrencies' transactions (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin
blockchains), timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production can occur at random
times. For example, the cryptocurrency sent as a payment for the INS tokens in the final seconds of the INS token sale

43

may not get included into that period. The respective blockchain may not include the purchaser’s transaction at the
time the purchaser expects and the payment for the INS tokens may reach the intended wallet address not in the same
day the purchaser sends the cryptocurrency.
2.2. Blockchain Congestion Risk. The most blockchains used for cryptocurrencies' transactions (e.g., Ethereum,
Bitcoin blockchains) are prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may
also intentionally spam the network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens. That may
result in a situation where block producers may not include the purchaser’s transaction when the purchaser wants or
the purchaser’s transaction may not be included at all.
2.3. Risk of Software Weaknesses. The token smart contract concept, the underlying software application and
software platform (i.e. the Ethereum, Bitcoin blockchains) are still in an early development stage and unproven. There
are no representations and warranties that the process for creating the INS tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free.
There is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the
complete loss of the cryptocurrency and/or the INS tokens.
2.4. Risk of New Technology. The INS platform, the INS tokens and all of the matters set forth in this White Paper are
new and untested. The INS platform and the INS tokens might not be capable of completion, creation, implementation
or adoption. It is possible that no blockchain utilizing the INS platform will be ever launched. Purchaser of the INS
tokens should not rely on the INS platform, the token smart contract or the ability to receive the INS tokens associated
with the INS platform in the future. Even if the INS platform is completed, implemented and adopted, it might not
function as intended, and any INS tokens may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology is
changing rapidly, so the INS platform and the INS tokens may become outdated.
3. SECURITY RISKS
3.1. Risk of Loss of Private Keys. The INS tokens may be held by token holder in his digital wallet or vault, which
requires a private key, or a combination of private keys, for access. Accordingly, loss of requisite private keys
associated with such token holder’s digital wallet or vault storing the INS tokens will result in loss of such INS tokens,
access to token holder’s token balance and/or any initial balances in blockchains created by third parties. Moreover,
any third party that gains access to such private keys, including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted
wallet or vault service the token holder uses, may be able to misappropriate the token holder’s INS tokens.
3.2. Lack of Token Security. ​The INS tokens may be subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or other malicious
groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the token smart contract which creates the INS tokens or the INS
tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based
attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ethereum platform rests on open source
software, there is the risk that Ethereum smart contracts may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses
which may negatively affect the INS tokens or result in the loss of INS tokens, the loss of ability to access or control the
INS tokens. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of the INS tokens
are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.
3.3. Attacks on Token Smart Contract. The blockchain used for the token smart contract which creates the INS tokens
is susceptible to mining attacks, including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, "selfish-mining"
attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the token smart contract, expected proper
execution and sequencing of the INS token transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract
computations.
3.4. Failure to Map a Public Key to Purchaser’s Account. ​Failure of a purchaser of the INS tokens to map a public key
to such purchaser’s account may result in third parties being unable to recognize purchaser’s INS token balance on the
Ethereum blockchain when and if they configure the initial balances of a new blockchain based upon the INS platform.

3.5. Risk of Incompatible Wallet Service. ​The wallet or wallet service provider used for the acquisition and storage of
the INS tokens, has to be technically compatible with the INS tokens. The failure to assure this may have the result that
purchaser of the INS tokens will not gain access to his INS tokens.
4. RISKS RELATING TO PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT
4.1. Risk Related to Reliance on Third Parties. Even if completed, the INS platform will rely, in whole or partly, on third
parties to adopt and implement it and to continue to develop, supply, and otherwise support it. There is no assurance or
guarantee that those third parties will complete their work, properly carry out their obligations, or otherwise meet
anyone’s needs, all of might have a material adverse effect on the INS platform.
4.2. Dependence of INS Platform on Senior Management Team. Ability of the senior management team which is
responsible for maintaining competitive position of the INS platform is dependent to a large degree on the services of
each member of that team. The loss or diminution in the services of members of respective senior management team
or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional senior management personnel could have a material adverse
effect on the INS platform. Competition for personnel with relevant expertise is intense due to the small number of
qualified individuals, and this situation seriously affects the ability to retain its existing senior management and attract
additional qualified senior management personnel, which could have a significant adverse impact on the INS platform.
4.3. Dependence of INS Platform on Various Factors. The development of the INS Platform may be abandoned for a
number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects,
or departure of key personnel.
4.4. Lack of Interest to the INS Platform. Even if the INS platform is finished and adopted and launched, the ongoing
success of the INS platform relies on the interest and participation of third parties like developers. There can be no
assurance or guarantee that there will be sufficient interest or participation in the INS platform.
4.5. Changes to the INS Platform. The INS platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes
over time. Although the project management team intends for the INS platform to have the features and specifications
set forth in this White Paper, changes to such features and specifications can be made for any number of reasons, any
of which may mean that the INS platform does not meet expectations of holder of the INS tokens.
4.6. Risk Associated with Other Applications. The INS platform may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted
by unaffiliated third parties, under which the INS token will have no intrinsic value.
4.7. Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Cryptocurrency Value. ​The proceeds of the sale of the INS tokens will be
denominated in cryptocurrency, and may be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of
cryptocurrencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the INS token sale, the project management team may not be
able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the INS platform in the manner that it intended.
5. RISKS ARISING IN COURSE OF COMPANY PARTIES' BUSINESS
5.1. Risk of Conflicts of Interest. ​Company Parties may be engaged in transactions with related parties, including
respective majority shareholder, companies controlled by him or in which he owns an interest, and other affiliates, and
may continue to do so in the future. Conflicts of interest may arise between any Company Party's affiliates and
respective Company Party, potentially resulting in the conclusion of transactions on terms not determined by market
forces.
5.2. Risks Related to Invalidation of Company Parties Transactions. Company Parties have taken a variety of actions
relating to their business that, if successfully challenged for not complying with applicable legal requirements, could be
invalidated or could result in the imposition of liabilities on respective Company Party. Since applicable legislation may
subject to many different interpretations, respective Company Party may not be able to successfully defend any

45

challenge brought against such transactions, and the invalidation of any such transactions or imposition of any such
liability may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the INS platform.
5.3. Risk Arising from Emerging Markets. Company Parties or some of them may operate on emerging markets.
Emerging markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets, including significant legal, economic and
political risks. Emerging economies are subject to rapid change and that the information set out in this White Paper
may become outdated relatively quickly.
6. GOVERNMENTAL RISKS
6.1. Uncertain Regulatory Framework. The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets and blockchain
technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental
authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority
may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets,
blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact the tokens in various ways,
including, for example, through a determination that the tokens are regulated financial instruments that require
registration. Company may cease the distribution of the INS tokens, the development of the INS platform or cease
operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to
continue to do so.
6.2. Failure to Obtain, Maintain or Renew Licenses and Permits. Although as of the date of starting of the INS token
sale there are no statutory requirements obliging Company to receive any licenses and permits necessary for carrying
out of its activity, there is the risk that such statutory requirements may be adopted in the future and may relate to any
of Company Parties. In this case, Company Parties' business will depend on the continuing validity of such licenses and
permits and its compliance with their terms. Regulatory authorities will exercise considerable discretion in the timing of
license issuance and renewal and the monitoring of licensees’ compliance with license terms. Requirements which
may be imposed by these authorities and which may require any of Company Party to comply with numerous
standards, recruit qualified personnel, maintain necessary technical equipment and quality control systems, monitor
our operations, maintain appropriate filings and, upon request, submit appropriate information to the licensing
authorities, may be costly and time-consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of
operation of the INS platform. Further, private individuals and the public at large possess rights to comment on and
otherwise engage in the licensing process, including through intervention in courts and political pressure. Accordingly,
the licenses any Company Party may need may not be issued or renewed, or if issued or renewed, may not be issued or
renewed in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements which restrict any Company Party's ability to conduct its
operations or to do so profitably.
6.3. Risk of Government Action. The industry in which Company Parties operate is new, and may be subject to
heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that
governmental authorities will not examine the operations of Company Parties and/or pursue enforcement actions
against them. All of this may subject Company Parties to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Company
Parties to restructure their operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could
harm Company Parties' reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect
on the INS tokens and/or the development of the INS platform.
6.4. Risk of Burdensomeness of Applicable Laws, Regulations and Standards. ​Failure to comply with existing laws
and regulations or the findings of government inspections, or increased governmental regulation of Company Parties
operations, could result in substantial additional compliance costs or various sanctions, which could materially
adversely affect Company Parties business and the INS platform. Company Parties operations and properties are
subject to regulation by various government entities and agencies, in connection with ongoing compliance with existing
laws, regulations and standards. Regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in matters of enforcement and
interpretation of applicable laws, regulations and standards. Respective authorities have the right to, and frequently do,

46

conduct periodic inspections of any Company Party's operations and properties throughout the year. Any such future
inspections may conclude that any Company Party has violated laws, decrees or regulations, and it may be unable to
refute such conclusions or remedy the violations. Any Company Party's failure to comply with existing laws and
regulations or the findings of government inspections may result in the imposition of fines or penalties or more severe
sanctions or in requirements that respective Company Party cease certain of its business activities, or in criminal and
administrative penalties applicable to respective officers. Any such decisions, requirements or sanctions, or any
increase in governmental regulation of respective operations, could increase Company Parties' costs and materially
adversely affect Company Parties business and the INS platform.
6.5. Unlawful or Arbitrary Government Action. Governmental authorities may have a high degree of discretion and, at
times, act selectively or arbitrarily, without hearing or prior notice, and sometimes in a manner that is contrary a law or
influenced by political or commercial considerations. Moreover, the government also has the power in certain
circumstances, by regulation or government act, to interfere with the performance of, nullify or terminate contracts.
Unlawful, selective or arbitrary governmental actions have reportedly included the denial or withdrawal of licenses,
sudden and unexpected tax audits, criminal prosecutions and civil actions. Federal and local government entities have
also used common defects in matters surrounding the Token sale as pretexts for court claims and other demands to
invalidate or to void any related transaction, often for political purposes. In this environment, Company Parties'
competitors may receive preferential treatment from the government, potentially giving them a competitive advantage
over Company Parties.
