Ripto Bux ($RBX)

Ripto Bux
Summary:
Ripto Bux $RBX is a non-ICO (Initial Coin Offering), dual-blockchain asset/token
that has been issued 1:1 on the Waves and Ethereum blockchains. It is swappable
upon command by utilizing Incent Blockswap technology. It is the native currency
of the Waves Asset Tip-Bot. The total supply of Ripto Bux ($RBX) is
1,000,000,000 (one billion) and it is a non-reissuable asset.
Functions:
As an asset/token $RBX will serve the following functions:
- $RBX aims to be the primary tipping asset/token of the Waves-Asset TipBot. [The Tip-Bot is a proprietary tool integrated into slack channels that
allow users to easily transact $WAVES and Waves Assets through simple
commands. At time of publishing, it is installed in Waves, Incent, and
Cryptocopia slacks.]
- $RBX will be distributed to newly created tip-wallets at a rate of 500 $RBX
per new wallet. This automatic distribution will allow new users to
immediately participate in tipping other community members without the
need to supply their own asset/token or any up-front capital. (This
distribution is subject to change depending on availability.)
o Ancillary benefits of using $RBX as the primary tipping asset/token
are a transferring of real value and increasing the transaction rate of
the $WAVES network, which in turn rewards those who stake
utilizing POS (proof of stake) and/or LPOS (leased proof of stake).
- The second function of $RBX will be to provide new projects and their
corresponding token (or core token), known from here on out as $XYZ, with
an immediate exchange rate and price floor. This will be achieved through
negotiations with the yet-to-be released projects and tokens, and will result
in an $RBX/$XYZ pairing. This allows both parties to have control of a
portion of the other’s supply as immediate collateral. Then, through
matching services, an $RBX/$XYZ pairing will appear on the Waves DEX
at a reasonable, consistent price. This will facilitate early trading volume,
easy buy access, and will establish a price ratio for $XYZ token calculable
by referencing the current $RBX/$WAVES rate.

Liquidity & Value Creation:
- With the support of the WAVES community, $RBX will be able to act as an
intermediary asset/token separately from $WAVES and $BTC. One of the
drawbacks of transacting in $WAVES and $BTC is that the end user may
expect that either currency will rapidly increase in value, in which case they
may choose to remain holding their token, and forego transacting all
together. This manner of price speculation is not useful in terms of
facilitating currency liquidity. $RBX holders should feel at ease transacting
in $RBX as its value is derived not from speculation, but its ubiquitous
accessibility through measured distribution and the $RBX/$XYZ pairs that
traders will have access to when trading with $RBX. This derivation of
value differs from other assets/tokens in that it does not stem from
speculation on future price increases.
A combination of utilizing the Waves-Asset Tip-Bot and automatic airdrops,
coupled with the ability to trade newly created tokens in an $RBX/$XYZ pairing
will facilitate liquidity & confer real value to the $RBX asset.

Distribution Breakdown:
40% of the $RBX supply will be distributed, free of charge to its recipients,
during multiple intermittent airdrops to $WCT holders, $WAVES holders, and
$RBX holders respectively. The first airdrop was a swap in the form of a credit to
all accounts holding “Old Ripto Bux” at a fixed ratio of 1:1. This airdrop took
place on February 25th, 2017. The second airdrop took place on March 8th, and
rounded out the first 100 million of distribution. The third airdrop took place on
March 25th; 100 million $RBX were distributed. Future airdrops will be structured
such that $RBX is distributed, in weighted amounts, to $WAVES holders, $WCT
holders, and $RBX holders. Airdrops intended for further supply distribution will
occur on dates as of yet to be established.

25% of the $RBX supply will be used to purchase new tokens and assets at a bulk
rate. This will create early price floors for these newly announced projects and
their corresponding tokens. After this exchange is made, an $RBX/$XYZ trading
pair will appear on the DEX, and market making for the new token will occur,
denominated in $RBX. This will be particularly helpful for assets that have
difficulty being listed on centralized exchanges, or are of non-ICO / community
origin to establish a valuation and some liquidity.
10% of the $RBX supply will be transferred to the Ethereum blockchain to make
it easier for Ethereum user to access the $RBX token. These tokens will also be
integrated into Ethereum-based $RBX token contract applications.
10% of the $RBX supply will be listed on an exchange, centralized or
decentralized, in order to create an early and steady price point. The funds
generated from the listing of $RBX will go towards the creation of a dedicated
$RBX full node & matching services for trading $RBX & its asset/token pairings.
5% of the $RBX supply will be reserved as a slush fund for rewarding
contributors to the project, a potential reserve of trading pair collateral, an
additional airdrop, etcetera.
10% of the $RBX supply will be reserved for the creator of $RBX, and for
developer assistance.
The Benefits of Dual Issuance:
Ripto Bux is able to exist on two blockchains at once by utilizing Incent’s
Blockswap technology. Through this capability, $RBX is able to take advantage of
the unique properties offered by each blockchain.
$RBX on the Waves blockchain will be better able to perform it’s role as a tradingpair token on the platform’s easy to use DEX. Additionally, transference of the
$RBX token will be easier as the Waves blockchain has quick block times (1
minute.)
$RBX issued on the Ethereum blockchain will have access to smart contract
technology that, is as of yet, not present on Waves Platform. This opens up many
possibilities for future implementations and potential use cases for $RBX, some of
which have already begun development.
