Value Proposition
LikeCoin aims to reinvent the ​Like ​by realigning creativity and reward. We enable
attribution and cross-application collaboration on creative contents. With a ​reinvented
Like button and our unique ​LikeRank algorithm, we trace content footprint and
reward content creators by P
​ roof of Creativity​ mechanism.

Realigning rewards and creativity
In the Internet, rewards and creativity have been decoupled for long. This is especially
true for independent content creators and freelancers. In the early days of the Internet,
indies made money by selling their works online. All technical aspects of the Internet are
now dramatically improved, yet the revenue model is not. In fact, it is worse. Content
creators are not getting incomes but ​Likes​. While some can take freelance projects and
advertising jobs, such model is rather indirect. LikeCoin protocol is thus designed to
monetise creative contents directly, so that creators can focus on creating great
contents rather than selling or looking for business models.
As technology evolves, everyone with a smartphone is a content creator of some sort. In
particular, some photos taken by smartphones may have quality and resolution as high
as single-lens reflex cameras. The crowds of freelance content creators and citizen
journalists are huge and the market demand is extremely high. Once rewards and
creativity are realigned, an explosive potential will be unlocked.

Elements in the LikeCoin Ecosystem
An ecosystem of collaborated content creation involves various elements and
stakeholders. Their roles in the LikeCoin ecosystem are defined with the following
example, where ​Alice ​takes ​A.jpg ​and upload to ​Apple.io​, ​Bob ​writes ​B.txt ​on ​Banana.com​,
Carol adopts their work to become ​C.doc ​on ​Cherry.net​; and finally, ​David ​shares ​A.jpg on
Durian.org​.

Creative content
A digital photo, illustration, article, footage or sound clip. In contrast to private data, a
creative content allows consumption by other people under certain copyright terms,
such as Creative Commons. Each ​creative content ​is represented by a unique content
fingerprint in the LikeCoin ecosystem. In our example, ​A.jpg​, ​B.txt ​and ​C.doc ​are ​creative
contents​.

Content creator
A person who produces a ​creative content​. ​Alice​, ​Bob ​and ​Carol ​are all ​content
creators​.

Service provider
A web or native application supporting LikeCoin, by incorporating the ​LikeCoin
attribution protocol ​and/or the ​reinvented Like button​. In our example, ​Apple.io​,
Banana.com​, ​Cherry.net ​and D
​ urian.org ​are all s​ ervice providers​ of LikeCoin.

3

Derivative work
Adopt one or more ​creative contents ​produced by oneself or other ​content creators​,
on the same or another ​service provider​, to generate a new ​creative content​. ​C.doc ​is
a ​derivative work​.

Content adopter
The ​creator by whom and ​the ​service provider on which a ​derivative work is
produced. ​Carol ​is a c
​ ontent adopter​.

Content source
The ​creative content ​on which a ​derivative work is adopted from. A ​content source
itself may have its own c
​ ontent source​. ​A.jpg a
​ nd ​B.txt ​are c
​ ontent sources​ of ​C.doc​.

Content origin
A ​creative content ​without a ​content source​. In other words, a ​creative content
which is not a ​derivative work​. ​A.jpg a
​ nd ​B.txt ​are c
​ ontent origin​.

Original creator
The ​content creator by whom and the ​service provider on which a ​content origin is
produced. ​Alice a
​ nd B
​ ob ​are ​original creator​.

Distributed Content
Without modification, use a ​creative content produced by another ​creator in the same
or another s​ ervice provider​. ​Image A o
​ n ​Durian.org i​ s a ​distributed content​.

Content distributor
The ​content creator by whom and the ​service provider on which a ​distributed
content​ is used. ​David a
​ nd ​Durian.org ​are ​content distributors​.
In the LikeCoin ecosystem, ​original creators and ​content adopters receive LikeCoin
through Proof of Creativity from the Creators’ Pool or out of audiences’ own wallets;
from c
​ ontent adopters​; and from ​content distributors​.
This profit sharing mechanism is the key to incentivise ​content creators and ​service
providers​ to adopt LikeCoin protocol.

LikeCoin Attribution Protocol
LikeCoin creates unique fingerprints for creative contents and traces footprints of all
derivative works along with content creator and service provider of them. Further than
that, LikeCoin incentivises attribution and cross-application collaboration with Proof of
Creativity mechanism.

LikeCoin technical stacks

Decentralised creative content library
The cornerstone of LikeCoin protocol is a global, decentralised and resilient creative
content library on​ ​IPFS1.
A LikeCoin service provider plays one or more roles among original creator, content
adopter and content distributor. Original creators curate creative contents and record
the data on blockchain for other content creators to use. The content creator and the
service provider both get LikeCoin as an incentive when a content is ​Liked ​or ​Super-liked
(see ​LikeCoin Mining Protocol​). Two major original creators funded by LikeCoin
Foundation will be ​puttyimages​, an open stock image DApp (decentralized application)
and ​blogchain.md​, a blogging DApp which records each post on a LikeCoin smart
contract. An example of content adopter is ​oice​, an asset remixing storytelling editor,
also funded by LikeCoin Foundation.
A content distributor, on the other hand, displays or plays the creative contents in the
LikeCoin ecosystem. Some examples include ​Famisu​, ​Lifehack.org​, ​The Initium and ​The
Stand News​, etc.
Each original creator and content adopter runs her own ​IPFS node and is responsible
for ​pinning all the files she curates from content creators so they are not removed. Since

worldwide ​IPFS nodes help one another distribute the contents, such decentralised
creative content library also serves as a content distribution network, speeding up
access from locations unreachable by Internet backbone. Service providers do not have
to be concerned about from which IPFS node users will retrieve the content.
In the library, each creative content is addressable by a cryptographic hash rather than
a URL. Any changes in the application layer such as domain name, IP and directory
structure induce no change to the content address since the hash depends only on the
content itself. The content address is thus decoupled from the application where it was
created on and where it is used, making it consistent and future-proof. This prevents
creative contents from being locked up by specific applications such as Facebook and
Instagram. Such cryptographic hash is called ​content fingerprint ​in the LikeCoin
protocol.
As an example, let’s say content creator ​Alice has painted I​ mage A ​on service provider
Apple.io​, and content creator ​Bob ​has uploaded his photo I​ mage B o
​ n service provider
Banana.com​:

Apple.io ​and ​Banana.com ​are service provider for content creation and run their IPFS
nodes. Now, ​Image A a
​ nd ​Image B ​are stored and pinned on IPFS, with Fingerprints 0x825622a44f13fdb776d72570458ae0dc664efbe8b231735b3d838c3739acce34
and
0xf71ce651a525fd4e746b6bed8d8e1db4052912d88313a93d076e27540a8ecd4f
respectively, and can be accessed through the IPFS gateway with their corresponding
IPFS
address
​QmXWs1nKHbfAHgMjSgB1d6EVCbrpskFvrq1px7rfAsJ9dK
and
QmPs3LyZFEuMscttMnkNM2GweTUc2JkdJqWVheF6aEMu7h​.

Fingerprint and metadata hash
At the same time when ​Image A ​and ​Image B ​are stored on IPFS, a unique, one-to-one
content fingerprint ​of each file is generated by the SHA-256 hash function. Metadata
of the images are stored off-chain as an ​IPLD object (see section ​Metadata Objects
below) on IPFS. Only the ​metadata hash ​and the ​content fingerprint ​are written to
the Ethereum blockchain with the private keys of the service providers through a
LikeCoin smart contract. Such two-tier architecture maximises speed and flexibility
while minimising the gas needed to write to Ethereum.
Continuing with our example, the ​content fingerprints ​and ​metadata hash ​of ​Image A
and ​Image B ​are written to Ethereum through the LikeCoin smart contract by ​Apple.io
and B
​ anana.com ​respectively. The gas needed is borned by the service providers.

Metadata Objects
Metadata are stored as ​IPLD objects, which are linked objects that can contain reference
hash of other IPLD objects and build a path across them. Since IPLD objects are stored
7

on IPFS, they are represented by 1-to-1 hashes as well. Such feature is used to build
content footprint ​of every creative content, to be discussed in the next section.
Three kinds of ​IPLD objects are defined in the LikeCoin protocol following schema.org's
ImageObject schema. They are ​content metadata object​, ​service provider object ​and
content creator object​, three of which are all interconnected through hashes of the
objects.
Content metadata IPLD object

{
"creator",
"dateCreated",
"description",
"license",
"likeFingerprint",
"likeFootprint",
"likeIpfs",
"likePreviousVersion",
"likeProviderShare",

"type",
"uploadDate"
}

Content creator IPLD object

{
"description",
"email",

"likeUport",
"name",
"type"
}

Service provider IPLD object

{
"description",
"likeAddress",
"name",
"type",
"url"
}

In our example, the metadata of ​Image A ​and ​Image B ​are both stored in IPFS as ​content
metadata objects​, which further refers to the corresponding ​content creator objects
and ​service provider objects​. The IPFS addresses of the ​content metadata objects
are
​zdpuB1JCLTPNYA7TmedHVR4Py6s2HcXXXZvvg9tNWX3yKayMp
and
zdpuAyRdyyTwWf9eLaxtMB6u1MrGhgvVMbAMdYvREWQ11bQ7G​, respectively.

​ nd ​service provider object

​ n ​Banana.com

Content Footprint
Content fingerprint ​is like the DNA of a creative content, while ​content footprint ​is
like the family tree of it.
For every derivative work in LikeCoin protocol, IPLD references of the content sources
are recorded in a ​footprint array ​in the metadata object. In our example, when ​Carol
uses C
​ herry.net ​to apply a filter on I​ mage B ​to generate ​Image C​:

In this case, ​content metadata object of ​Image C ​will include an ​IPLD reference to point
to ​Image B​, ​Bob ​and ​Banana.com​. By appending ​/likeFootprint/0/link in IPLD URL
of ​Image C​, IPLD of ​Image B ​can be retrived. This is how ​content footprint ​of a creative
content can be traced, so that derivative works are pointed to their content source(s).
9

Content footprint of a new creative content can only reference existing content
fingerprints, so that the content footprint relations form a directed acyclic graph similar
to a citation graph. This structure allows easy analysis of inheritance tree of a particular
creative content. It also prevents the existence of any reference loop in the profit
sharing process.
Now ​David​, a content creator on ​Durian.org​, designs a poster ​Image D ​by adopting ​Image
A ​and I​ mage C​, which is itself a derivative work of ​Image B​:

10

Similar to the previous case, IPLD references of the content sources, in this case ​Image A
and ​Image C​, are written to the metadata ​metadata object of ​Image D​. And since ​Image C
has its content source written to ​Image B​, ​Image B ​can also be traced as the level 2
content source of I​ mage D​.

While there are various blockchain projects such as po.et2 and KODAKCoin3 which use
technology similar to content fingerprint to keep track of photo copyright, LikeCoin
traces the derivative works of a content with this unique ​content footprint​ technology.
Content fingerprint is static and tells who owns the content; while content footprint is
dynamic and traces how contents flow, from a content creator to another, from a
service provider to another. Content fingerprint is about ownership; while content
footprint is about collaboration.
We do think protecting content creators copyright is a noble task, but the mission of
LikeCoin is instead to help maximise creativity with reasonable rewards under a
permissive license such as Creative Commons. ​Content footprint forms the
fundamental of the LikeCoin mining mechanism, to be discussed in the next section.

LikeCoin Mining Protocol
LikeRank
20 years ago, Larry Page and his classmates at Stanford published the now famous
paper “The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web”4 which became the
fundamental technology of Google search.
Inspired by citation of research paper, PageRank was revolutionary. As the title of the
paper says, it brings order to the web. Prior than PageRank, web searches almost
always resulted in web pages which did include the keyword, yet irrelevant.
However, PageRank can only cover web pages but not creative contents such as images,
footage and music. We know the ​importance ​of a web page which often includes various
creative contents, but not the ​importance of a particular creative content. LikeRank is
designed to address that.
Based on content footprint tracing in the LikeCoin protocol, ​LikeRank measures the
importance, or ​creativity ​as we define it in this context, of a creative content. In
general, the more derivative works a creative content generates, the more ​creative the
creative content is, and thus the higher LikeRank of the content. LikeRank is the
quantifier of the creativity of contents.

As one may easily see, such definition of ​creativity ​is to encourage sharing and favour
contents with more permissive, open license terms. For example, other conditions being
equal, contents licensed under cc0 enjoys a higher LikeRank than those licensed in CC
BY-NC-ND. In contrast, a more restrictive license such as all rights reserved copyright
lowers LikeRank. Also, with a permissive license, more derivative works will be
generated, which helps boost LikeRank.
LikeRank is also used to incentivise proper attribution through LikeCoin protocol. A
properly attributed creative content enjoys a LikeRank bonus, while a derivative work
without following the attribution protocol will not receive LikeCoin, since the derivative
work does not have content fingerprint and outside of the LikeCoin ecosystem all
together.
That is to say, LikeCoin is to promote permissive license while at the same time tailor
make a business model for it. Contradictory to the traditional wisdom, the more open is
the license term of a content, the more likely it is for the content to earn LikeCoin
because of the higher LikeRank and also the increased number of derivative works.

Like Button reinvented
While PageRank is 20 years old, Like button is 10. The Like button was launched on Oct
30 2007 by Friendfeed, which was acquired by Facebook.
Like button was revolutionary, but over the years it deteriorates. Getting thousands of
Likes hardly means anything anymore. And from the very beginning till now, it has never
meant any income for content creators - no matter how many Likes a content receives,
the content creator gets nothing. LikeCoin is to change that.
LikeCoin’s Like button is designed to combine two user experiences into one. By
tapping/clicking the Like button for 1 to 5 times, or long press/hover then drag to 1-5, a
user shows his/her appreciation and helps the content creator to ​mine LikeCoin from
Creators Pool. If the user really appreciates, s/he may go directly to “Super Like” to pay
the content creator certain amount of LikeCoin from his/her own wallet.

We combine the two user experience not only for simplicity, but also to cultivate user
behavior over time. Most Internet users are used to showing appreciation to contents at
no cost, only a small fraction of them pay content creators out of their own pockets. We
believe creative contents have intrinsic value and content consumers are receiving
13

value. To supplement the advertising model, we make possible a new ecosystem where
content consumers pay content creators directly according to their level of appreciation.

Proof of Creativity
While blockchain miners usually understand mining as solving a mathematical problem,
it does not have to be the case. Say for example, proof of stake (PoS) mechanism does
not involve hash power and thus has little impact on environment.
With a focus on rewarding content creators, LikeCoin measures the importance of
creative contents, i.e. ​creativity​, and allows content creators to ​mine LikeCoin with their
creative contents. We call the mechanism p
​ roof of creativity​, or ​PoC​.
PoC defines creativity in two dimensions:
1. The higher the LikeRank of a creative content is, the more creative it is.
2. The more Likes a creative content receives, the more creative it is.
A creators pool of 1bil, which accounts for 50% of total number of LikeCoin tokens in the
long run, is reserved as the ​mining pool​. At each day ​t,​ ​x LikeCoin will be minted from
creators pool for distribution to content creators, according to the formula:

x =
x =

N
1+e−

when t = 0 to 1460

0.4(1461−t)+730
120

when t > 1460

N = 391132.253127

14

The minting formula is designed based on the following principles and assumptions:
1. Majority (90%+) of the creators pool should take 10 years to mint. We believe
consumers receive value by high quality creative contents, and encourage them
to pay voluntarily. But attitude cultivation is a long process so we allocate 10
years for consumers to convert. Ultimately, we target to have tipping model
coexist with advertising model.
2. The minting should smooth out after 10 year period with a very long tail, in our
formulae, 28 years. This gives the community time to adopt.
3. The minting should have a slow start. It allows time for content creators and
service providers to join the LikeCoin ecosystem and avoid early birds to be
overly beneficial.
4. After one year, however, it is assumed that number of creative contents
increases quickly.
5. The factor ​difficulty ​will be set every day so that the total number of LikeCoin
distributed to content creators equals the total number of LikeCoin minted.
Take day 365 as an example. x=

391132.253127

= 17,827 LikeCoin are minted. At the
t−730
1+e− 120
same day, 10,000 creative contents have received a total of 1,000,000 Likes across all
the service providers. At end of day 365 GMT, LikeCoin will be distributed to the 10,000
creative contents according to the number of Likes they received as well as their
LikeRank. When a derivative work receives Like, the original content(s) receive a cut of
LikeCoin as well. The service provider of the creative content also receive a portion. The
factor d
​ ifficulty ​is calculated so that all of the above added up to be exactly 17,827.

Content creators can access their own creative contents easily on Like.co, and receive
detailed analytics of them.
Like.co will also be served as a peer-to-peer payment site. Each content creator has
his/her ​LikeCoin ID similar to a Twitter account. Users may transfer LikeCoin by a
user-friendly web interface without owning ETH for gas. This is realized by the
delegation function in LikeCoin smart contract, where LikeCoin Foundation serves as a
proxy for transfer of LikeCoin token between users for Super Like and other
peer-to-peer transfers.

LikeCoin Token
LikeCoin token is a utility token based on Ethereum and is ERC-20 compliant.

Token Distribution
The total number of LikeCoin token is capped at 2bil and is divided into 4 pools: ​token
sale ​(600 mil), ​ecosystem development (​ 200 mil), ​team ​(200 mil) and c
​ reators (​ 1 bil).

Before the token sale takes place, 200mil tokens in the the ​ecosystem development
pool ​is minted to start building the LikeCoin ecosystem. Such tokens are used for sales
and marketing, bounty program, rewarding content creators before Proof of Creativity
mining officially starts, and anything that facilitates the development of the ecosystem.
Then, during the public ​token sale​, up to 600mil tokens will be minted in proportion to
the amount in ETH provided by the buyers (see the next section, ​Token Sale​).
After the token sale, tokens in the ​team pool ​will be used for payroll. Up to 200 mil
tokens are reserved for the team, advisors and potentially consultants, with a vesting
period of at least 48 months. Most of the team members take LikeCoin as
compensation.
Finally, certain number of tokens will be minted daily from the ​creators pool​, according
to a set formula for rewarding contents by ​proof of creativity ​(refer to the previous
18

section ​LikeCoin Mining Protocol​). It will be a process of over 10 years, and the total
number of tokens minted will be 1bil at the end of the period.

Token Sale
LikeCoin tokens are only exchangeable with ETH during token sale period. The standard
rate is 1ETH to 40,000 LikeCoin, with optional bonus of lock up period of 6 months.
Tokens will be sold in 4 stages: ​Early Believers ​(50% bonus, i.e. 20,000 extra LikeCoin
per ETH), ​Institution (50% bonus), ​Early Bird ​(25% bonus) and ​Public Sale ​(no bonus
except referral bonus). Remaining token at the end of the token sale period, if any, will
be transferred to the Ecosystem Development pool.
For the avoidance of doubt, LikeCoin is designed to be used in the ecosystem and
LikeCoin holders will not receive any voting rights at board meetings or shareholder
meetings.

Use of Proceeds

While LikeCoin tokens will be used for settlement of majority compensation of the team
and part of the ecosystem development, proceeds from token sale will be used in ETH
or converted fiat currency in other areas.
19

50% of the proceeds are budgeted for development and operation, especially hosting of
the creative contents; 30% to marketing and development; 10% legal and administration
and finally 10% for contingency and long-term reserve.

LikeCoin Foundation
All the LikeCoin tokens and proceeds from token sale are managed by LikeCoin
Foundation Limited, which is a tax-exempt NGO under Section 88 of the Inland Revenue
Ordinance of Hong Kong. The Directors of the Foundation are independent and are
responsible for monitoring the issuance of tokens, payrolls or material contractors’
compensation and use of proceeds in general. The financial reports of the Foundation
were and will be released to p
​ ublic​.
The LikeCoin team are employees of the Foundation or her subsidiaries, and will be
managing LikeCoin protocol as an open source project under GPL 3.0 license. Contents
created by the Foundation, including this whitepaper, will be licensed in Creative
Commons.

Conclusion
With an aim to realign creativity and rewards, LikeCoin attribution and mining protocols
incentivises protocol adoption and ​permissive license ​by offering ​reasonable rewards​.
Permissive license and rewards reinforce each other, and maximise creativity of the
content creators.
On the community side, LikeCoin is a movement to cultivate the habit and culture of
voluntary payment for high quality creative contents. By providing a large creators pool
for mining by Proof of Creativity over 10+ years, the community may get used to
voluntary payment model gradually over a long period of time. If a paradigm shift
happens in 10 years and indie content creators can make a living in the LikeCoin
ecosystem, we regard LikeCoin as a success.

Appendix 1: roadmap

2017 Q1-Q3: brainstorming, R&D: ​the team developed oice, a visual novel editor which
is the origin of LikeCoin. In oice, a director remixes art and music assets provided by
other content creators to make interactive stories, next to which detailed credits are
shown automatically.
Other than credit, the team believes each content creator involved should receive a
share when the story receives income. Lots of technologies and tools were evaluated
but none could meet the requirements, until we finally landed on cryptocurrency. We
then generalize the idea to serve broader use cases and LikeCoin protocol was born.
