Overview of the Freelance Market

Current Freelance Market

Despite the demerits and risks in this industry, it is a
Freelancing Issues

rather lucrative one. One of the most popular
platforms in the freelance workspace is Upwork. In
the year 2014, the company recorded $941 million in

Coinlancer

freelancer earnings. In the same year, the entire
industry generated an estimated $3.2 billion.

Coinlancer Token

Considering the rate of population growth and the
gradual increase in internet literacy, the freelance
ICO

industry is bound to grow further. In fact, it is
estimated that the industry could grow to $10 billion
annually in the next six years. This, therefore, means

Team

that there is an inherent need to undertake measures
to curb some of the challenges faced by freelancers
presently. Blockchain technology is an optimal

Moving Forward

solution in this regard.

Upwork is one of the renowned companies in the freelance space, and until recently, a freelancer
loses about 10% of the amount paid by the client to the website. It requires the freelancer to pay the
site 20% on the first $500 earned, 10% on $501-$9,999 and 5% on $10, 000 and above. The catch in

Team

this structure is that the fees are charged on a per-client basis. For instance, logo maker deals with
several clients on a daily basis, which means they will be charged 20% on their earnings quite often.
In other words, about one-fifth of their earnings will be lost to fees.

Another issue faced in the freelance industry
presently is the safety of the funds for the players in

multisignature escrow. This would ensure that funds
for the client, freelancer and facilitator remain safe.

Coinlancer

Another issue faced in this market is particularly dear
to the freelancers themselves, and that regards fees
Coinlancer Token

Mediator

charged per job. Freelancers lose a good percentage
of their earnings to the mediators. These mediators
are technically existing freelance companies such as
Upwork, freelance writing service and Fiverr among

others. These mediators could potentially be
eliminated through an established network that

would act as a link between the freelancer and the
client, demarcating any surcharges.

Besides above-discussed issues, the freelance market is faced with another major challenge
regarding identity theft. Hiring people on the freelance websites exposes the participants to the risk
of identity theft especially if their private user information is accessible. Freelancers stand at a greater

Team

risk of identity theft than the other participants in this arrangement. For instance, a malicious
individual may steal John’s identity information. John is a qualified accountant with an incredible
rating on the freelance website. The malicious individual then goes ahead to request for work

charging $100 per hour. While the malicious person may benefit from this move, the integrity of the
person whose identity is being wrongly used could be compromised.

1. No Suspension of User Accounts

Current Freelance Market

Freelancing Issues

Freelancer accounts are often suspended on account
of violating platform policies. The reasons for such
suspensions have always been ambiguous and can

Coinlancer

range from sending too many proposals to
prospective clients to inability to obtain projects due
to poor matched skills. In most cases, reinstating of

Coinlancer Token

user accounts is a cumbersome process. Also, one of
the main reasons freelancing projects fail is due to
lack of support on such traditional platform. Contrary

ICO

to traditional freelancing platforms, no unannounced
suspensions occur on Coinlancer. The Freelancers
Tribunal decides on accounts that are deemed

Team

violative and fairly decides on it.

2. Fair Dispute Settlements

Current Freelance Market

Freelancing Issues

The subjectivity of work on a freelancing platform
often calls for discrepancies in opinions and
settlements in disputes. A typical freelancing platform

Coinlancer

does not guarantee such settlements. The dispute
settlements often involve surplus arbitration costs and

Coinlancer Token

unfavorable binding decisions, which may not be in
the best interest of a freelancer. On Coinlancer, the
discretion to decide on the arbitration of disputes lies

ICO

with the Freelancers Tribunal. Every Freelancer within
the tribunal is mandatorily a freelancer with a highprofile ranking, preferably a 4 Star Applicant, eligible

Team

to decide on matters of arbitration.

3. Secure Payments

Current Freelance Market

Freelancing Issues

Delay or non-payments are problems typical to any
freelancing platform. The clients and freelancers have
Coinlancer

very little control over payments. In most cases, after
project submission, either the client doesn’t receive
high-quality work by a freelancer or the freelancer

Coinlancer Token

does not get paid at all. Our Ethereum based
platform uses the escrow payment system which

ICO

holds the contract fees until the set obligations of the
contract are met. On project completion, the funds
are released, securing the interests of both the parties

Team

involved.

4. Less Transaction Fee- 3%

Current Freelance Market

Traditional freelancing platforms require a freelancer
to pay the site 20% on the first $500 earned, 10% on
Freelancing Issues

$501-$9,999 and 5% on $10, 000 and above. Since
freelancers deal with clients on daily basis, 20% fee on
each project will amount to huge earnings lost.

Coinlancer

Coinlancer confirms a fair control of fees. On any
signed contract between a freelancer and a client,
Coinlancer sets only 3% of the fees payable for a job

Coinlancer Token

offer.
Also, in most cases, the waiting period for the payouts

ICO

to reflect in the freelancer’s bank account is often
painstaking. It could be easier to incorporate
payments to freelancers on the Ethereum network.

Team

This would not only make the payments prompt but
would also reduce transaction charges incurred on
bank transfers. Additionally, the security of the funds

would be ensured through multisignature escrow.

Current Freelance Market

Fake reviewing on most of the freelancing sites have been a
popular earner with more and more individuals writing fake

reviews by means of unique identity and email addresses.
Thus, reviews on traditional platforms are rather deceptive.
Coinlancer is an Ethereum platform that works on escrow

system that constantly builds checks and balances in the
system.

Coinlancer Token

It implements a customized software that detects
suspicious reviews and removes those identified as fake.
This is done by developing proprietary security algorithms

for detection of scripts/bots that can be run on the
platform.

in addition to termination of contracts on fraudulent

susceptible to discrepancies. Our Ethereum based
platform confirms a fair control by means of a
Freelancers Tribunal into our system. The tribunal

Coinlancer

involves freelancers with a high-profile ranking into
the settlement of disputes. Every freelancer in the

Coinlancer Token

tribunal is entitled to cast a discerning vote that favors
the rightful party and the consequences will be
executed according to the Freelancers Tribunal. After

ICO

the arbitration process, 3% of the funds in the Escrow
will be held as the platform fees and the remaining
funds are released from Escrow to the deserving

Team

counterparts of the dispute. The Freelancers Tribunal,
however, does not receive any compensation for the
votes cast.

Legal Disclaimers
The purpose of this White Paper is to present the company PGEP Limited and CoinLancer(CL) Token to potential token holders in connection with the proposed Token sale. The information set forth below may not be exhaustive and does not imply any elements
of a contractual relationship. Its sole purpose is to provide relevant and reasonable information to potential token holders in order for them to determine whether to undertake a thorough analysis of the company with the intent of purchasing CoinLancer(CL)
Tokens.
Nothing in this White Paper shall be deemed to constitute a prospectus of any sort or a solicitation for investment, nor does it in any way pertain to an offering or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in any jurisdiction. This document is not composed in
accordance with, and is not subject to, laws or regulations of any jurisdiction, which are designed to protect investors.
CoinLancer(CL) Token is a utility token. This product is not a digital currency, security, commodity, or any other kind of financial instrument and has not been registered under the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state of the United States or the securities
laws of any other country, including the securities laws of any jurisdiction in which a potential token holder is a resident.
CoinLancer(CL) Token cannot be used for any purposes other than as provided in the White Paper, including but not limited to, any investment, speculative or other financial purposes.
CoinLancer(CL) Token confers no other rights in any form, including but not limited to any ownership, distribution (including but not limited to profit), redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property), or other financial or legal
rights, other than those specifically described in the White Paper.
Certain statements, estimates and financial information contained in this White Paper constitute forward-looking statements or information. Such forward-looking statements or information involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which
may cause actual events or results to differ materially from the estimates or the results implied or expressed in such forward-looking statements.
This English language White Paper is the primary official source of information about the CoinLancer(CL) Token. The information contained herein may from time to time be translated into other languages or used in the course of written or verbal
communications with existing and prospective customers, partners etc. In the course of such translation or communication some of the information contained herein may be lost, corrupted, or misrepresented. The accuracy of such alternative communications
cannot be guaranteed. In the event of any conflicts or inconsistencies between such translations and communications and this official English language White Paper, the provisions of this English language original document shall prevail.

Risk Factors
The purchase of any tokens involves a high degree of risk, including but not limited to the risks described below. Before purchasing CoinLancer(CL) Tokens, it is recommended that each participant carefully weighs all the information and risks detailed in this
White Paper, and, specifically, the following risk factors.
A. Dependence on computer infrastructure
PGEP Limited's dependence on functioning software applications, computer hardware and the Internet implies that PGEP Limited can offer no assurances that a system failure would not adversely affect the use of your CoinLancer(CL) Tokens. Despite PGEP
Limited's implementation of all reasonable network security measures, its processing center servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other disruptions of a similar nature. Computer viruses, break-ins or other disruptions
caused by third parties may result in interruption, delay or suspension of services, which would limit the use of the CoinLancer(CL) Tokens.
B. Smart contract limitations
Smart contract technology is still in its early stages of development, and its application is of experimental nature. This may carry significant operational, technological, regulatory, reputational and financial risks. Consequently, although the audit conducted by
independent third party increases the level of security, reliability, and accuracy, this audit cannot serve as any form of warranty, including any expressed or implied warranty that the CoinLancer(CL) Smart Contract is fit for purpose or that it contains no flaws,
vulnerabilities or issues which could cause technical problems or the complete loss of CoinLancer(CL) Tokens.

www.coinlancer.io

37

Legal Disclaimers
C. Regulatory risks
The Blockchain technology, including but not limited to the issue of tokens, may be a new concept in some jurisdictions, which may then apply existing regulations or introduce new regulations regarding Blockchain technology-based applications, and such
regulations may conflict with the current CoinLancer(CL) Smart Contract setup and CoinLancer(CL) Token concept. This may result in substantial modifications of the CoinLancer(CL) Smart Contract, including but not limited to its termination and the loss of
CoinLancer(CL) Tokens as well as a suspension or termination of all CoinLancer(CL) Token functions.
D. Taxes.
Token holders may be required to pay taxes associated with the transactions involving CoinLancer(CL) Tokens. It will be a sole responsibility of the token holders to comply with the tax laws of the relevant jurisdictions and pay all required taxes.
E. Force Majeure.
PGEP Limited’s performance may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to force majeure circumstances. For the purposes of this White Paper, force majeure shall mean extraordinary events and circumstances which could not be prevented by PGEP
Limited and shall include: acts of nature, wars, armed conflicts, mass civil disorders, industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts, slowdowns, prolonged shortage or other failures of energy supplies or communication service, acts of municipal, state or federal
governmental agencies, other circumstances beyond PGEP Limited's control, which were not in existence at the time of Token sale. If such circumstances occur prior to issuance of CoinLancer(CL) Tokens and PGEP Limited is unable to issue CoinLancer(CL)
Tokens within months from the projected date, the escrow agent may issue a refund at the request of the CoinLancer(CL) Token purchasers. The refund will be issued in the original form of payment to the same digital wallet or bank account where the funds
were transferred from.
F. Disclosure of information.
Personal information received from CoinLancer(CL) token holders, the information about the number of tokens owned, the wallet addresses used, and any other relevant information may be disclosed to law enforcement, government officials, and other third
parties when PGEP Limited is required to disclose such information by law, subpoena, or court order. PGEP Limited shall at no time be held responsible for such information disclosure.
G. Value of Coinlancer(CL) Token.
Once purchased, the value of CoinLancer(CL) Token may significantly fluctuate due to various reasons. PGEP Limited does not guarantee any specific value of the CoinLancer(CL) Token over any specific period of time. PGEP Limited shall not be held responsible
for any change in the value of CoinLancer(CL) Token.
Assumptions with respect to the foregoing involve, among other things, judgments about the future economic, competitive and market conditions and business decisions, most of which are beyond the control of the PGEP Limited team and therefore difficult
or impossible to accurately predict. Although the PGEP Limited team believes that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of these may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, the PGEP Limited team can offer no assurances
