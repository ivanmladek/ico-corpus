Token Distribution Event is fully compliant with all applicable federal and state securities laws.

Abstract
Through public-private partnerships with manufacturers at the local, regional and
national levels, SyncFab’s Smart Manufacturing Blockchain will advance efforts to
decentralize manufacturing via a public, peer-to-peer ecosystem, powered by the
MFG Utility Token.
This document examines current burdens faced by small to mid-sized enterprises working
within the manufacturing supply chain, and provides a comprehensive set of solutions to
engage isolated and inaccessible manufacturers, widening their inter-industry networks and
encouraging collaboration to meet global production demands.
By collecting quality data about today’s opaque manufacturing supply chain and making it
public, SyncFab’s platform aims to make the supply chain more transparent, efficient, and
sustainable.
The paper highlights the development of SyncFab’s decentralized application, the MFG Utility
Token which incentivizes streamlining of bidding and procurement processes, and details the
upcoming MFG Utility Token Distribution Event (token sale).
Blockchain and smart contracts serve as the way forward into the Industrial Revolution 4.0,
creating economies of scale and potentially aggregating supply. Decentralized manufacturing
will make the industry more accessible, secure and economically sound for more participants
in a direct peer-to-peer (P2P) ecosystem.

This document contains forward-looking statements, subject to risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially.

1.0 Industrial Revolution 4.0: Where Manufacturing
Technology Meets Global Demand
The United States and China account for more than a third of the world’s gross
domestic product (GDP), and their combined GDP dominance is expected to continue
into 2050, especially if their industries make the transition to new manufacturing
processes. Manufacturing and trade gains signal growth for global economies as a
whole, according the International Monetary Fund. According to a study performed by
PWC and shared by the World Economic Forum in 2016 - Companies from all sectors
across the globe are embracing “Industry 4.0”, or business in the digital age. About one
third of 2,000 companies surveyed in 26 countries already rate their level of digitisation
as high, and this value is expected to rise on average from 33% to 72% by 2020. In
South Africa, the current level of digitisation and integration is expected to rise from
27% to 64% by 2020.
Forging into the Industrial Revolution 4.0, U.S. manufacturing companies (95% of which
are independent, small- to medium-sized shops) must solve issues that currently hinder
production, and find ways to aggregate their capacity to handle global demand more
efficiently.
Significant advances in robotics, sensors, big data, artificial intelligence, and augmented
reality have connected the digital and physical realms of manufacturing through robust
and reliable networks.
With these technologies, integrated production and purchasing processes operating
seamlessly along the supply chain would save time and resources; improve efficiency;
and increase scalability and security.

6/66

Demand for services that support this potential global exchange of data, and its
transaction of both data and contracts between businesses fuel the expansion of the
Internet of Things (IoT) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).

As an industry leader said:
“The Internet of Things has already set in motion the idea of a fourth industrial
revolution—a new wave of technological changes that will decentralize production
1

control and trigger a paradigm shift in manufacturing.”

1.1 SyncFab’s Contribution to the Industrial Revolution 4.0
Silicon Valley-based SyncFab aims to harness technologies and connect with the
IoT and the IIoT to provide purchasers and manufacturers with high quality data
that would streamline processes along the supply chain.
Connecting

purchasers

with

manufacturers

in

the

IIoT

through

its

business-to-business (B2B) SaaS ecosystem, SyncFab creates a public,
peer-to-peer ecosystem whereby purchasers can find companies capable of
advanced machining of on-demand precision parts production and engage
participants passionate about improving efficiencies in the supply chain. While
the government built the Internet (ARPANET), SyncFab believes the IIoT will be
built collaboratively, through public-private partnerships (of which SyncFab has
formed). Such cross-sector partnerships will collect and combine best practices
and share wisdom from multiple perspectives.
Inventors, innovators, and designers enter an interactive, cloud-based portal
where a growing network of certified machine shops and advanced

With SyncFab’s curated and adaptive services, companies attempting to shift
their manufacturing processes to high-tech smart factories, and those exploring
ways to optimize their “cost-to-serve” process (lowering overhead costs per
customer account) can find solutions such as sourcing, tracking and organizing
precision parts production and improved procurement systems.
A recent report found that U.S. companies spent an estimated $20 billion in
2012, and are forecasted to spend approximately $500 billion by 2020 on smart
3

technologies.

In the 2016 Forbes’ Manufacturer Outlook, 32% of companies surveyed said
their corporate strategy largely relies on integrated technologies via the IIoT. See
4

Chart: Putting Technology in the Supply Chain.

These forward-looking companies are the customer base for SyncFab’s services.
Essential to SyncFab’s Smart Manufacturing Blockchain will be the use of the
MFG Utility Token, a first of its kind to incentivize community users to embrace
blockchain technology. Core to the blockchain’s adoption is a shared sense of
trust between purchasers, developers and manufacturers built on a public and
more transparent supply chain system, where small to medium-sized
manufacturers can access a blockchain and be a supplier in spaces where they
are currently obscured.
For example, to compensate for work done on RFQs creates more responses to
the just-in-time needs of supply chain purchasers and buyers. Purchase

transparency into cost and quality control.
With the MFG Token’s launch, SyncFab serves as an early adopter, protocol
developer and integrator of Smart Contracts into the manufacturing supply
chain blockchain. The MFG Token will be utilized firstly on SyncFab, secondly on
SyncFab's soon to be developed Smart Manufacturing Smart Contract Ethereum
Blockchain and ultimately adopted by new and emerging partner manufacturing
supply chain blockchains using SyncFab's developed blockchain smart contract
protocols or their own with the industry's first MFG Token Smart Contract-based
incentive mechanism.
The MFG Token will be integrated on the SyncFab platform which has a strong
network launchpad built out from public-private partnerships. Though it’s
designed to serve a public, peer-to-peer Smart Manufacturing Blockchain, it’s
utility is designed to be complementary to third party standalone solutions, such
as those future supply chain blockchains which are more inward-looking, private
enterprise based supply chain blockchains.

Processes
Industrial manufacturing in the U.S. steadily rose, with growth forecasted at 5%

compounded annually into 2018. In 2014, an estimated $1.4 trillion in exported goods
were made in the United States.

Yet major manufacturing companies still face inefficiencies that drain resources and
time, and contribute to the overall slowness and costliness within their manufacturing
process.
U.S. companies investing heavily in IIoT technologies stand to gain yields from global
demand as high as $10-$15 trillion by 2030, according to an Accenture Technology

report. Investments in such technology are limited to large conglomerates, while the
vast majority of independent, small- to medium-sized companies still face well-known
burdens within the manufacturing process, such as:

2.1 High costs related to procurement brokers and agents when
sourcing materials
To source parts, companies hire an internal procurement manager (or rely on
externally-contracted brokers or agents) to search for and order parts.
Companies compensate for procurement salaries and commission bonuses,
paying brokers “finder’s fees” or taking a markup fee on top of the
manufacturer’s quoted price – which affect overhead costs that lower overall
revenue. SyncFab’s Procurement Platform 2.0 supplants the need for brokers,
or cuts time spent by Supply Chain Purchase Account Managers on putting out
bids. SyncFab’s all-in-one platform matches purchasers’ RFQs to potential
manufacturers. Through Smart Contracts, Sync Fab’s 3.0 platform will match up
the requirements to supplier capabilities intuitively and unlock contract values
as conditions are fulfilled.

2.2 High minimums for production because of time spent on finding
the right manufacturing suppliers. Data regarding: performance
track record, quality, and size of contracts between purchasers and
manufacturers remain in silos.
In a survey conducted by Deltabid, 31% out of 500 purchasers said finding the
9

right supplier remains a major obstacle. A contributing factor is the risk
manufacturers

face

when dealing with unknown and non-transparent

purchasers’ profiles and their buying histories. Manufacturers want to ensure
their orders are paid on time while purchasers are confronted with delays when
unsure if a manufacturer can produce their product within specification needs.
Without a broker’s reputation and network, purchasers spend hours on the
phone or search through multiple directories. Sometimes, purchasers lack the
sufficient technical understanding of the product to specify their search
10

requirements, leading to dead-end outreach.

On the purchasers’ side, they

want proof of experience and expertise from manufacturers to safeguard the

integrity and quality of their product. Negotiating the complexity of these needs
results in high minimums, a required minimum number of parts produced.
SyncFab’s mapping feature allows for local sourcing, which lowers minimums,
especially when procured through trusted channels. By aggregating demand
and creating economies of scale, SyncFab’s access to manufacturing capacities
creates access to markets in ways that would revolutionize how small to
medium-sized manufacturing businesses meet supply chain demand.

2.3 Difficulty seeing manufacturer capacities and capabilities to
achieve economies of scale within the supply chain
Purchasers and manufacturers both suffer from a lack of data and high-quality
information into the sourcing and production process of their supply chain. An
astounding 39% of companies and individuals surveyed (See graph on Figure 2:
“Lacking Visibility”) state they aren’t clear about the supply and capacity of their
suppliers and logistic partners; 38% cite “some visibility,” accounting for a total of
77% of those surveyed. With SyncFab products, purchasers and manufacturers
can manage cross-functionality and look deeper into the end-to-end supply
chain, enabling better real-time decisions to optimize and streamline their
procurement and supply chain process.

decisions

to

optimize and streamline their

procurement and supply chain process.

2.4 Difficulty tracking progress along the supply chain (when
purchasers and manufacturers confront delays, or need to resolve
problems in real-time throughout the production process)
Manufacturing is driven by details and specifications, making clear and precise
communication vital between purchasers, manufacturers, suppliers and
logistical partners along the supply chain. Miscommunication can lead to delays
within the production process, drastically increasing costs when mistakes
happen. A delay in communicating changes in design requirements between the
procurement department and engineering department could increase the
design to production time. Purchasers and manufacturers often forget to
regularly communicate updates in production or material requirements,
increasing lead time and increasing product cost or affecting product quality.
SyncFab’s automatic updates on production progress and tracking will be an
evolving feature, which would replace the need for constant phone calls or
status request updates between purchasers and manufacturers as automation
would streamline communications.

2.5 Loss in labor-hours to inefficient procurement processes
According to research by The Topline Strategy Group, inefficient procurement
processes account for a yearly loss of $1.5 billion in revenue among North
12

American businesses.

Most companies currently have little to no procurement

software, while larger companies mainly use in-house, company-specific
software that can be slow and difficult to use across the supply chain. The
resources required to manage and maintain such software account for $32
million in labor-hours, all of which can be reallocated to finding more cost-saving
technology and providing hands-on value to existing and prospective
customers. SyncFab’s frontend and backend software updates in real time, a
benefit that reduces the financial burden of maintaining locally-hosted software.
Purchasers can share files, improve communications, streamline procurement
and manage parts inventory helping them hone in on creating quality products.

2.6 Security concerns about protection of intellectual property
Security concerns over intellectual property remain a scrutinized topic within the
industry. In “Cyber Risk in Advanced Manufacturing,” a study done by Deloitte,
only 52% of executives surveyed felt confident or extremely confident their
organization’s assets were protected from external threats. Some 48% felt
somewhat confident or less confident. Of all those surveyed, 36% cited
13

protection of intellectual property as a top concern. How can new technologies
create some added security for manufacturers and purchasers who want to
protect their ideas? Remaining competitive requires deep financial and time
commitments, a luxury reserved for bigger, more established companies who
can afford cybersecurity staff. For secured transactions, SyncFab’s platform
stores intellectual property, forms, and documents in Amazon Web Services
(AWS) servers backed by top security protocols such as SSO, firewall and DDoS
protection. All RFQs, IP, and transactional history are easily accessed in real time
to help users compare pricing or past requirements to speed up the
procurement process.

3.0 SyncFab’s Pathways to Decentralized
Manufacturing
Given the burdens of current manufacturing systems which perpetuate lack of
transparency and inaccessibility for a multitude of stakeholders within the supply chain,
SyncFab’s solutions attempt to solve complex problems with five key innovations.

3.1 Re-shaping supply chain management through a public, direct
peer-to-peer (P2P) manufacturing ecosystem
Traditional manufacturing economies of scale perpetuate a lack of transparency
and inaccessibility, reserving privileged access to centralized assets controllers.
The largest purchasers, often conglomerates, monopolize access. Brokers
control networks and procurement by keeping information in silos, complicating
the entire supply chain management process.
A public, peer-to-peer (P2P) ecosystem, paves the way to an entirely
decentralized supply chain management environment. Innovators, suppliers,
and manufacturers regain control over the success, quality, and delivery of their
product.
With Smart Contracts and the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain, decentralizing
the manufacturing supply chain economies of scale, makes the entire system
more accessible, transparent and profitable to all participants, and replaces a
predominantly exclusive business-to-business model. SyncFab’s public-private
partnerships,

and expansion of local ecosystems builds trust among

stakeholders in the supply chain based on shared knowledge of track-record
performance, capabilities and capacities in ways that would transform the
manufacturing industry.

3.2 Incentivizing Change in Supply Chain Management
The MFG Utility Token plays a vital role of the SyncFab platform in that it creates
an online value sharing system within the decentralized manufacturing
ecosystem.
Built on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, and sold to existing and new SyncFab
users, the MFG token will be used by early adopters to pay for order quotes.
After the future build, users will be able to unlock and update Smart Contracts
and pay transaction fees.
With the MFG token, in a decentralized system, users dictate the ecosystem’s
economy of scale by incentivizing and rewarding its community users.

In the current SyncFab Web 2.0 platform, MFG tokens will incentivize
manufacturers for traditionally uncompensated time for putting together quotes
and make manufacturers more responsive to time-sensitive production
deadlines. Enticed by a reward for timely quotes, manufacturers are expected to
respond more quickly. With such token incentives, the pool of manufacturers a
purchaser can choose from might increase and diversify.
SyncFab’s public-private partnerships, investment into the platform and the MFG
Utility Token are built to solve current supply chain trust dilemmas, where
purchasers currently don’t know enough about their suppliers to take the risk of
placing an order. Many will turn to Smart Manufacturing Blockchain because of
its openness to new suppliers, backed by an immutable distributed transaction
ledger with cryptographic proofs of the integrity and access to transaction
tokens which may well encourage manufacturers to hire a supplier in minutes,
whereas previously they could never do so without face-to-face meetings.

3.3 Smart Manufacturing Blockchain
Blockchain applications within the IIoT are fast-emerging as the new standard in
many sectors, including finance, real estate, food industries and manufacturing.
Blockchain’s function as a digital ledger of codes containing programmed data
and encryption, make records nearly incorruptible within its distribution
networks.
As a shared database, where information is stored, verified and agreed upon
simultaneously by the millions of computers within its hosted consensus,
blockchains are considered extremely difficult to hack, and create an ideal
ecosystem for manufacturing companies concerned with security and
intellectual property.

18/66

Figure 4: Transactions and Recording Contracts Between Blocks on Blockchain

SyncFab’s Smart Manufacturing Blockchain Smart Contract Protocol will utilize
blockchain’s system of records to match purchasers with their most ideal
manufacturers.
Comparing various manufacturer’s order histories, machine capacities, and
previous product designs to a purchaser’s project criteria, the Smart
Manufacturing Blockchain will directly link purchasers to manufacturer,
expediting procurement and production without brokers or banks.
Completed purchase orders recorded onto the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain
will help build a user's service history, providing access to information to others
in the network about performance, reliability, and on-time delivery. This online
history will afford purchasers and manufacturers confidence that orders placed
can and will be fulfilled.

By eliminating intermediaries such as brokers, outdated software, and inefficient
procurement processes, the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain aims to lower the
barrier of entry, and connect innovators to manufacturers, smart machines to
factories and create a transparent and decentralized network for supply chain
management.

3.4 Smart Contracts for Transparent Procurement Processing
SyncFab’s Smart Manufacturing Smart Contract Protocol will be pivotal in the
standardization of a decentralized supply chain management.
SyncFab DApp’s Smart Contracts will work on two levels.
Using SynFab’s future procurement process, Smart Contracts will store RFQs,
quotes and encrypted intellectual properties, on the Smart Manufacturing
Blockchain, but only allow access to those with allocated rights to track, record
and monitor a manufacturers’ assets. In the initial stages of SyncFab’s
procurement system the company charges a broker’s fee , but as the system
becomes decentralized, and Smart Contracts will be better tailored to
purchasers’ and manufacturers’ needs, a fully decentralized ecosystem will
emerge and fees adjusted to match services.
Meanwhile different datasets within the Smart Contract can be accessed by
prospective purchasers on the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain. Data regarding
purchasers’ and manufacturers’ profiles and their successful production orders
will be recorded to the ledger, with each order leaving a digital paper trail of a
company’s credibility and performance.

3.5 Smart Business Model for Decentralized Supply Chain
Management
Currently, SyncFab’s platform includes a financial markup applied on top of the
final agreement between purchasers and manufacturers — an industry practice
for third-party referrers. However, in addition to connecting producers with

20/66

purchasers, SyncFab now already provides technologies for a faster and
streamlined buying process. The markup usually equates to a much smaller
quote compared to those received from purchasers without SyncFab.
SyncFab anticipates that in a decentralized supply chain management network,
markup fees will likely be eliminated. Instead transaction cost on all final
payments will be a percentage determined during development and after the
Smart Contract proof of concept.
The Smart Contract proof of concept is where SyncFab plans to develop and
improve Smart Contracts by adjusting and tailoring contracts to purchasers and
manufacturers “real-life” and relevant procurement processes. As more
companies seek a decentralized ecosystem, SyncFab will apply lessons learned
and determine an appropriate fee based on a better understanding of
purchasers’ needs and each business’ Smart Contract uses.
To pilot services, SyncFab collaborates with local cities and federal agencies
building public-private partnerships to advance industry innovation and
economic development.

4.0 MFG Utility Token: Incentivizing Blockchain Buy-in
SyncFab envisions a vibrant ecosystem of purchasers, manufacturers, suppliers and
logistics service providers actively buying, selling and ordering manufacturing-related
services within the Smart Manufacturing Smart Contract Blockchain. Initially, incentives
to join will be in the form of the MFG Utility Token, which give value to tasks those within
the supply chain already do and are not currently compensated for, such as suppliers
putting together quotes for purchasers. Incentives work for both purchasers and
manufacturers as a way to bring them into the blockchain.
The MFG Token’s value will shadow the value of relevant workers’ hourly wage in
accordance with its intended reward audience. So essentially the value of buying the
MFG Token includes:
●

Buying into SyncFab's existing production capacity network

●

of

SyncFab's

smart

manufacturing production capacity network
●

Expanding partner network adoption of the MFG, smart manufacturing and smart
contract blockchain buildout on SyncFab and in the supply chain industry

●

Incentivizing workers to embrace the technology and be more responsive to
buyers requests while compensating them for a critical function for which they are
taken for granted - RFQs (Details outlined in Section 3.1)

4.1 Incentivizing the Manufacturer (Bidder)
To reduce the time to production and drive competition, SyncFab plans to use
MFG Tokens to reward manufacturers who place faster bids and price more
competitive (lower-priced) quotes in proportion to their quote acceptance rates.
Every RFQ created will be listed as an auction, attached with a MFG Token
reward to the manufacturers for their bidding efforts. Similar in process to a
unique bid auction, the winner usually offers the lowest bid, but also has the

22/66

skillsets, capabilities and certifications required to successfully complete the
work.
A minimum requirement will be placed on all RFQs listed -- an amount to be
determined after the initial token distribution. Rates and values are subject to
change upon future user feedback and engagement. The amounts will vary and
are dependent on the scope and delivery of the project. Added benefits for
using the system, include:
●

Manufacturers earn compensation for their responsiveness to all RFQs
including those from small and mid-sized business buyers.

●

Manufacturers see upfront investment by committed purchasers who offer
MFG Token bid rewards.

●

Manufacturers can focus on production and spend less time in
pre-production communication qualifying walk-in customers.

●

Hard-to-find small to mid-sized businesses and other less accessible shops
will more likely make bids, because of the lowered barrier of entry.

●

Manufacturers gain confidence in purchasers who compensate for their
effort – whether their bid wins or not.

●

Manufacturers increase engagement on SyncFab or partner networks to
search and seek out MFG Token bid rewards.

●

Manufacturers potentially will be able to submit a portion of cost related to
incomplete or flawed orders to be partially compensated by tokens.
Currently these substantial cost flaws are covered by the manufacturer or
their insurance agents in full.

●

Manufacturers who perform exceptionally well receive “tips” from their
buyer.

4.2 Workflow
Blockchain

for

Purchaser Bids on Smart Manufacturing

1. Purchaser creates an RFQ (auction listing).
2. Purchaser will submit project budget inclusive of a tolerance amount of
how much they’re willing to go over budget. The proposed budget will be
visible to the manufacturers, while the tolerance amount will not.
3. Purchaser adds the MFG token bid reward amount. A minimum amount of
MFG token bid reward will be determined for all RFQ auctions.
4. RFQs come in bid packages of three. If the Purchaser wants more bids, they
would buy two packages for a total of 6 bids.
5. RFQ is sent via Smart Manufacturing Blockchain to multiple manufacturers
for bidding.
6. Manufacturers review the RFQ and decide to make a bid.
7. SyncFab’s system compares bids, automatically rejecting bids above the
tolerance amount set by purchaser. Manufacturers will be informed
beforehand that any bids exceeding the purchaser’s tolerance will not be
included in the three-bid package to the purchaser.
8. However, manufacturers whose bid amount exceeds the tolerance will be
given the option to revise and re-price their bid only once during the
bidding process.
9. The Purchaser selects the winner.

4.2.1 Tiered-Rewards for Bids
Once a purchaser selects a winner, a tiered reward for bids takes effect:
Scenario with three bids or more:
●

50% of the MFG bid reward will be awarded to winning bidder.

24/66

●

20% of the MFG bid reward will be awarded to each of the two (2) losing
bidders, totaling 40%.

●

10% of the MFG bid reward will be allocated into the Loyalty Pool to
incentivize future users for increased engagement.

Scenario with less than three bids:
●

Purchaser will be refunded 20% for every bid that was not received.

●

If there is only one bid with said bid accepted as the winner, the 50% of
reward goes to the winner, 40% is refunded to the purchaser with the
remaining 10% allocated to the Loyalty Pool.

●

If there is at least one bid with no winner accepted, 20% will be allocated
to each bidder, 10% to the Loyalty Pool and the remaining refunded to
the purchaser.

●

If there are no bids, 10% will be allocated to the Loyalty Pool, and the
remaining will be refunded to the purchaser.

4.3 Incentivizing the Purchasers
Similar to purchasers being able to add rewards to RFQ auctions, manufacturers
can tag on a MFG Token quote reward.
Upon submitting a quote to a purchaser, the manufacturer can include a reward
in an amount of MFG tokens on top of their quote (the “MFG quote reward”).
The MFG quote reward can be viewed as a discount, which is then awarded to
the purchaser if the offering manufacturer is selected as the winner. Usually
quotes are good for 30 days, and giving purchasers MFG tokens could increase
their rate of re-order.
This will allow manufacturers to allocate the MFG token they’ve been awarded
through the bidding process back into the ecosystem through the purchasers.
The amount will depend on the manufacturers as they can allot the same
amount as the amount of MFG as stipulated to the winning bidder. The

25/66

manufacturer can also allocate a larger amount of MFG to further incentivize the
purchaser to select their quote as the winning bid. This incentive model will also
help to resolve rare occurrences where purchasers will receive bids of exact
amount from multiple manufacturers - a bid with a reward will make it more
favorable. Additional benefits to purchasers, include:
●

Purchasers with time-sensitive projects can expect faster and more quotes
from manufacturers if they add MGF token bid rewards.

●

Purchasers drive competition among manufacturers who offer reduced lead
time, competitive prices and faster quotes.

●

Purchasers who make commitments and order faster give and get MFG
token incentives from manufacturers.

●

Purchasers can use token rewards and values re-circulated into the
ecosystem for various incentives such as placing quicker re-orders or
rewarding future purchases.

4.4 Workflow and Distribution for Manufacturers
1. Manufacturer designates “X” amount of MFG as a quote reward on top of
their bid.
2. Purchaser accepts the offer and is rewarded 80% of MFG allocated as
the reward.
3. The remaining 20% will be reallocated into the community pool.

4.5 Transaction Fee
A transaction fee will be added to the final purchase orders amount transacted
within the ecosystem. The transaction fee is paid for by the purchasers on top of
the quoted price. Said value is to be determined during development. The fee
will be distributed between SyncFab, Smart MFG Tech LTD and the Loyalty Pool.

26/66

4.6 More Potential Uses for MFG Tokens (Future Builds)
MFG Token development is dependent and prioritized based on SyncFab’s user
feedback, engagement within the platform, feedback from Smart MFG Tech and
partner network adopters. The SyncFab team sees unlimited potential in the
MFG Tokens for future builds on SyncFab and partner supply chain partner
networks. A few applications may include:
●

With

some

customer

education

and

outreach,

the

MFG token’s

instantaneous and secure financial transactions would replace traditional
forms of payment through bank wires, ACH and paper checks.
●

MGF tokens may be used as payment for contractors, such as designers,
engineers, and quality control consultants. These service professionals
could be integrated into SyncFab’s ecosystem alternatively into partner
supply chain blockchain networks. Design service professionals can give
feedback

to

purchasers’

engineering

designs

and

audit

machine

compatibility to production requirements.
●

SyncFab or partners could be paid in MGF tokens for concierge delivery
services and/or consultations to manufacturers on how to network their
machines and more closely integrate with SyncFab’s network and the
supply chain blockchain.

4.7 MFG Economic Model
The Smart Manufacturing Blockchain has a fixed amount of one billion
(1,000,000,000) MFG tokens. The tokens will be generated prior and will be
distributed during the token distribution event. (Please refer to Section 7.0 for
additional information regarding the token distribution event.) No additional
MFG tokens will be created after the token distribution event.

4.8 Loyalty Pool (Transaction Turnover)
The Transaction Turnover and Loyalty Pool is used to promote and encourage
continued engagement within the supply chain ecosystem by rewarding users

27/66

with MFG tokens. Examples of such engagement are: regular logins to SyncFab
and partner networks, creating and updating Smart Contracts, placing orders,
auction listing, and bidding on projects.

5.2 Example of Parts Procurement Workflow Using SyncFab 2.0
A procurement process on SyncFab Web 2.0 platform saves significant time
compared to traditional procurement processes within the supply chain as it
currently functions.

30/66

1. Purchaser searches the SyncFab database of vetted manufacturers.
2. Purchaser creates RFQ and sends to SyncFab for RFQ quality control.
3. SyncFab sends out approved RFQ to manufacturers.
4. Manufacturers review RFQ, decide to send quote.
5. SyncFab receives quotes, reviews bids for tolerance amounts, applies
markup on top of quote and sends bids received to Purchaser.
6. Purchaser reviews and accepts winning quote, which sets an automatic
notification to the selected manufacturer that they’ve won the bid.
7. SyncFab creates an electronic agreement between the parties.
8. New Purchasers make 1st payment or deposit amount to SyncFab.
9. SyncFab issues said deposit to the manufacturer.
10. Purchaser tracks production on SyncFab’s web and mobile app.
11. Part is completed and delivered to the purchaser with tracking code.
12. Purchaser makes final or complete payment to SyncFab.
13. SyncFab issues final payment to manufacturer.

5.3 SyncFab Platform Web 3.0 and the DApp (Decentralized
Application): Smart Contracts and Smart Manufacturing Blockchain
(Planned Build-Out)
Planned improvements to the

SyncFab Platform will integrate SyncFab’s

Decentralized Application DApp, which will expand the blockchain.
As SyncFab builds back-end architecture to store different types of smart
contracts and create tools that allow easy access to them, integrated data set to
automation will further improve efficiencies in the supply chain.

32/66

As community members populate smart contracts, architectural concepts can
change during development because of customer use cases and other changes
within the industry.
To start, the SyncFab DApp will collect data and create three types of smart
contracts:

5.3.1 Identity Contract
●

Stores records of user identification within the system, i.e. username, email,
wallet, ratings, historical order volume, etc.

●

Takes MFG tokens to create and update.

5.3.2 Purchase Order Contract
●

Serves as an account record for type of work sought/provided:

●

Documents scope of work: Request for Quotation (RFQ), bidder and quote
amount, production criteria, designs files or any other shareable IP, and
inspection reports.

●

Records all agreement documentation: contracts and payment terms.

●

Takes MFG tokens to initiate an update on the Smart Manufacturing
Blockchain.

5.3.3 Payment Contract
●

Initiates and confirms payments

●

Allows Purchaser to stipulate payment terms

●

Takes MFG tokens to initiate an update on the Smart Manufacturing
Blockchain

After the initial integration of the three Smart Contracts, SyncFab anticipates
adding more types of smart contracts which foster the ecosystem’s exchange
and efficiency as part of an adequately funded future buildout:

5.3.4 Account Contracts
●

Stores company information that is accessible by multiple users

33/66

●

Contains company wallet, ratings, machine capabilities

5.3.5 Insurance Contract
●

Outlines

coverage

for

defective

products

insured

by

the

Smart

Manufacturing Blockchain

5.3.6 Production Contract
●

Stores data inputted and outputted by users

●

Drives private and public data feeds, such as material cost price fluctuations

●

Updates parts production status via smart machines

Figure 8: SyncFab Smart Contract Architecture

​Example

of

Smart

Contracts Procurement Transaction

Workflow
Using the Smart Contracts, the back and forth of a parts procurement process
between the purchaser and manufacturer is streamlined:

34/66

1. Purchaser creates RFQ on the SyncFab platform.
2. Purchaser submits RFQ to SyncFab for quality assurance services.
3. SyncFab rep reviews or suggests edits to the RFQ.
4. RFQ is approved by SyncFab.
5. The DApp then generates a Purchase Order Contract.
6. RFQ and agreement documents are sent to the manufacturer(s) via the
DApp.
7. Manufacturer(s) review the RFQ and agreement terms.
8. Manufacturer(s) quote, and agree to the terms, then submits to quote the
DApp.
9. SyncFab reviews bids for tolerance amounts, applies markup on top of
quote and sends 3 bids to purchaser.
10. Purchaser reviews bids and approves the quote on the DApp.
11. The manufacturer is automatically notified to produce the product.
12. When part is completed, manufacturer completes an inspection report.
13. Inspection report is sent to the purchaser on the SyncFab platform.
14. The purchaser reviews the inspection report on the SyncFab platform.
15. SyncFab generates a Payment Contract.
16. Purchaser selects shipment option via a third-party API on the SyncFab
platform. (ex. FedEx). All shipments require a signature upon receiving.
17. A shipment tracking code is generated by the third-party API.
18. The purchaser makes the payment to the manufacturer on SyncFab via a
third-party, such as Stripe.

35/66

19. The logistic partner picks up product and delivers to purchaser.
20. The purchaser receives the package and signs off.
21. The logistic partner updates the status to “Delivered”, which is reflected in
the SyncFab platform under the shipment tracking dashboard.
22. The Purchase Order Contract is then marked as “Completed” and recorded
to the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain.

5.5 ​More Streamlining of Procurement and Transaction within
SyncFab Features
With adequate funding, SyncFab plans more advanced features of Smart
Contracts to record and validate procurement transactions in the Smart
Manufacturing Blockchain, such processes would trim delays in payment.

Figure 9: Streamline Procurement transaction with blockchain

36/66

5.6 Example of Decentralized Procurement Transaction Workflow
A high-level overview of a parts production workflow within a decentralized
system highlights the efficiencies of the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain:
1. Purchaser creates an Identity Contract, which holds contact information,
wallet, past order history, and purchaser ratings.
2. Manufacturer creates an Account Contract containing contact information,
wallet, manufacturer rating and current machine capabilities that can be
regularly updated with usage of MFG token.
3. Purchaser creates a Purchase Order Contract on the ledger, which contains
the RFQ, manufacturer requirements, and all associated agreement
documents.
4. The ledger filters manufacturer matching machine capabilities to RFQ and
best location fit.
5. Matching manufacturers receive the RFQ to bid on the project.
6. The bid and associated agreement documents are sent to the purchaser
for approval.
7. Upon approval, and agreement of terms, the Purchase Order Contract is
updated to “In Production.”
8. The Purchase Order Contract is used to update production status and store
machine data.
9. Upon completion of the production, the manufacturer issues an inspection
report to the purchaser.
10. Upon purchaser’s approval, a Payment Contract is created between the
purchaser and manufacturer.
11. Manufacturer reviews the Payment Contract.

37/66

12. Upon approval of the Payment Contract from the manufacturer, a Purchase
Order Contract is created between the purchaser and logistic company for
product shipment.
13. Upon the completion of this contract, the original Purchase Order updates
its status to “Completed” and is recorded to the ledger. All previous
processes continue at Step 3.
14. Upon arrival of the product, the Purchase Order Contract with the logistic
company updates its status to “Completed” and updates to the ledger.
15. Upon complete payment from the purchaser to the manufacturer, the
original Purchase Order Contract updates its status to “Completed” and is
recorded to the ledger.

5.7 Premium Features Planned for Future SyncFab DApp (Future
Build-Outs)
As the ecosystem of manufacturing stakeholders adopt SyncFab’s services,
purchasers and manufacturers can easily manage their end-to-end supply chain
production. SyncFab’s forward-looking approach would include premium
features, such as:

5.7.1 Application Program Interface (API)
In creating a public API where companies, vendors and other blockchains can
interact and transact on the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain, the supply chain
can share and industry-wide standard platform.

5.7.2 Machine Data Feed
Direct and live data feeds from smart (or smart-adapted) machines to the Smart
Manufacturing Blockchain will allow purchasers and manufacturers to track their
parts production in real-time, directly from machine status updates. Inclusive
add-on, inserted hardware would attach to factory equipment and the internet

38/66

so that smart machines communicate directly with the Smart Manufacturing
Blockchain in real time.

5.7.3 Public Data Feed
Real-time feed from public databases will provide insights into real-time
commodity cost, private and public machine capabilities, news RSS by keyword
and other related data. Manufacturers can, in turn, use data to better price their
quotes based on real-time material costs. Purchasers will have a broader
comparative view into machine capabilities outside of the Smart Manufacturing
Blockchain.

5.7.4 Connection to Logistics Providers
When the ecosystem expands, Smart Manufacturing Blockchain, can track
real-time delivery throughout the supply chain to manage their entire
production from concept to delivery.

39/66

6.0 Competitive Analysis
Blockchain and expansion of IIoT has been a growing area for investment for many
private companies, focused on pinpointing and correcting company inefficiencies.
These investments have been largely made by conglomerates hoping to capitalize on
global demand for manufactured products.

There are limited, direct comparisons to Smart MFG Tech’s and SyncFab’s
industry-specific MFG Token incentive system to facilitate blockchain engagement and
build-out on the shopfloor or in the factories. As the blockchain flourishes, large
manufacturers or supply chain companies looking for blockchain solutions will adopt
the MFG on their networks or simply use SyncFab’s smart manufacturing smart contract
protocol and/or production capacity network.
Within

the

competitive

landscape,

companies are approaching decentralized

manufacturing in different ways:
●

General Electric: Focused on finding inefficiencies within its own systems, GE’s
migration towards smart factories is mostly self-contained and aimed at improving
the company’s performance within its massive enterprise and vast product lines.
Large conglomerates like GE can afford to invest millions of dollars on
company-specific smart technologies.

●

IBM: Hyperledger is designed for business-to-business exchanges, and functions as
a private enterprise blockchain for companies who may already do business
together and trust each other enough to share documents, designs and contracts.
Aimed at creating efficiencies among partners, this system would serve prominent
manufacturers who may already dominate the supply chain in various ways.

●

Google: Google search engines place priorities on paid advertisers. In a given
search, topping their lists are supply chain players who pay to get business to their
door. Yet many precision parts machine shops remain unknown. The effort it takes

40/66

for purchasers to investigate and learn more about a company’ capabilities and
capacities can’t be easily accessed on public search engines. Such clearinghouses
for small- to medium-sized shops do not exist yet.
●

SyncFab serves as the first, public peer-to-peer manufacturing ecosystem. A
decentralized manufacturing platform where token holders can interact directly
with each other to launch projects and procure parts, pay for services, and get
them delivered creates trust among community users. In the future, SyncFab
would authenticate off-chain data sets on-chain using Cornell’s IC3 developed
Town Crier System. SyncFab plans to explore the public to private blockchain smart
contract data synthesis using Cornell's Town Crier project when SyncFab proceeds
to build out its live machine data feed in the scenario the funding hard cap is
achieved.

41/66

7.0 Roadmap
Conceptual development planning for the MFG Token, the Smart Manufacturing Smart
Contract and SyncFab Platform Web 3.0 began in August 2017 with a goal of completing
token integration soon after the end of MFG Token Distribution Event and completion
of a smart contract adapted 3.0 platform by 2019. SyncFab is committed to the
long-term success of the platform and the standardization of the Smart Manufacturing
Blockchain. Listening and adjusting to customer feedback is ingrained in SyncFab’s
approach and essential to building a product of high value that will save time or reduce
overhead for clients.
If the ETH minimum crowdsale target is met the MFG Token launch will involve:
●

Creation of the smart contracts to generate and distribute the 1,000,000,000
supply of MFG to the allotment stipulated in the Token Distribution Plan.

●

Creation of five (5) wallets. Each will store its individually distributed MFG amounts
in the allotment. An encrypted digital wallet stores its encoded MFG or ETH, and
can be decoded to validate its actual amount on the Ethereum Network.

●

Creation of a crowdsale smart contract to distribute the MFG tokens in the amount
relative to the ETH contributed from the Token Distribution Sale.

●

Creation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to secure, execute and validate
the previously mentioned smart contracts, future smart contracts, and the transfer
and conversion of MFG to ETH, and vice versa on the Ethereum Network.

●

Integration of the EVM into the current SyncFab 2.0 platform and technology stack.

of one billion (1,000,000,000) MFG tokens.
2. A total of three hundred million (300,000,000) MFG will be offered to the public
(current SyncFab users and the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain early adopters).
3. Each MFG wallet account will store MFG tokens on the blockchain to the unit of
18

decimal

places

-

the

smallest

unit

of

an

MFG

token

being

0.000000000000000001 MFG.
4. The distribution Smart Contract does not permit any new tokens to be created
or destroyed after the token distribution event. At the conclusion of the
distribution event, the token distribution Smart Contract will destroy any MFG
publically-allocated tokens which are not sold at the close of the event.
5. There will be no inflating of the MFG.
6. The total supply of MFG is dependent on how many MFG’s are sold during the
distribution event; the final supply has yet to be determined.

tokens will be distributed to potential partners who commit to implementing the
Smart Manufacturing Blockchain into their current systems.
The MFG tokens will also be distributed by the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain
partners to their current user base to promote adoption and engagement
within their own networks. For example, to ease the barrier of entry of adopting
a new ordering system, the partner can allocate their current users with 1,000
MFG tokens to start using within the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain to procure
parts production. New members to the ecosystem are given incentives to use
allocated amounts to cover time and resources needed to learn about and
promote the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain.

9.0 Risk Factors
There are many challenges that can potentially serve as a barrier of entry for mass
adoption of the Smart Manufacturing Blockchain in the manufacturing industry,
including widespread acceptance of the proposed economic model. Some initial risk
factors may include:
●

Reluctance by suppliers to adopt new technology. SyncFab would have to provide
effective training to use the platform

●

Brokers resist change and hold on to customers.

●

Supply capacity bottlenecks and price surges.

●

Manufacturers want to remain siloed and isolated. SyncFab would create ways for
them to adapt to its reporting systems and communications channels.

●

Local ecosystems and laws could be slow to adapt.

Additional risk factors apply to SyncFab’s business in general and the MFG Token Sale
event in particular, and

of widespread adoption of the Smart Manufacturing

Blockchain:
●

SyncFab may not reach the minimum, soft cap or hard cap target sale amounts
and may not have the sufficient funds to execute on its business plan.

●

The MFG token may be significantly influenced by digital currency market trends
and MFG value may be severely depreciated due to non-MFG related events in the
digital currency markets.

●

Areas of the manufacturing supply chain industry may fall under global or local
regulation that may limit the use of tokens for supply chain procurement.

●

SyncFab Web 3.0 is a complex software platform, and its launch may be
significantly delayed due to unforeseen development barriers.

●

Competition may introduce same or better manufacturing supply chain smart
contract solutions and cause SyncFab to lose market share and eventually fail to
deliver on its business goals.

●

The use of MFG tokens may come under the scrutiny of governmental institutions.

52/66

●

The ownership of MFG tokens may fall under new and unpredicted taxation laws
that will erode MFG benefits.

●

Smart MFG Tech LTD may not succeed in creating the necessary momentum and
acceptance for the MFG token, which may result in low liquidity and depletion of
trades.

●

The positions and plans outlined in this white paper may be altered as the project
progresses.
