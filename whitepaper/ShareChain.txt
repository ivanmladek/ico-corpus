ShareChain White Paper

Decentralized and Valuable Credit Data
Platform for The Global Sharing Economy

-1-

1. What is ShareChain?
Based on the sharing economy, ShareChain is a smart, reliable,
open, decentralized and valuable credit data platform and also an
underlying structure created by blockchain technology. As
blockchain technology subverts the existing centralized credit
platform, ShareChain is designed to realize value quantification and
circulation on the platform by using the Super Smart Share, briefly
called "SSS", to build a credible credit system, in which the data is
real and unique, to create a credible ecological circle of the sharing
economy, and to pursue the great vision of “ interconnected credit
and sharing future”.

2. What are the goals of ShareChain?
ShareChain is aimed at finding specific and practical
applications of blockchain technology in the new global sharing
economy business and relevant fields.

3. What is the sharing economy?
The sharing economy means on the same ownership premise,
benefits will be gained by temporarily transferring usage rights and
increasing the utilization rate of resources. The estimated value of
the global sharing economy forerunners like Uber, Airbnb, etc., has
been several ten billion dollars. Nevertheless, it’s just the beginning
of the sharing economy, which will account for more than 30% of
GDP in the future and become one of the national policies.

4、The current situation of the sharing economy
The rapid development of the Sharing economy also brings
problems and challenges to sharing enterprises. Specifically, the
problems and challenges faced by the sharing economy are the
following four points:
1. Environment: Although delivering civilization and building
up new spirit are advocated by the mainstream, sharing products are
still not cherished or vandalized by some people. Many useful
sharing products are no longer available and have become a burden

-3-

on the society. Consequently, the benign development of the sharing
economy is being challenged.
2. User information:
While the sharing economy penetrates into the personal sector,
enterprises find it difficult to know the user information. The cost of
large amounts of information screening is enormous. With a single
data acquisition channel, personal credit for each user can not be
judged by traditional sharing enterprises and different permissions
for different users are also impossible, which lead to significant
increasing costs of product supervision and operation.
3. Interoperable databases:Although sharing enterprises record
the user data in the APP, the new user's comprehensive credit level
can not be judged. The enterprise databases are not interoperable in
the traditional Internet domain to ensure information safety, which
leads to repeated collection of the user data by different sharing
enterprises.
4.User loyalty: The user of traditional sharing enterprises is not
reliant on the APP with integral incentive mechanism. Point value is
not the reason for the user to use APP for a long time.

5. ShareChain introduction
ShareChain gives a solution to the following four issues faced
by shared applications.
With the underlying blockchain technology, major sharing
applications access, at the same time, smart contract setting, smart
contract triggering, automatic ledger, data uploaded on the chain,
data check, value analysis, credit output and other services are
provided.

5.1 ShareChain value proposition
1) Users: The user of Super Smart Share in shared applications
will enjoy preferential price or contribute to the valuable behavior to
get rewards, without disclosing personal privacy and data.
2) Shared applications: To increase user activities and profits,
obtain real credit index of users, and reduce fraud
3) External applications: To capture high-quality data reports,
specify an optimal program at lower cost and increase profits.

5.1.3

ShareChain Value Proposition Profile

With the sharing economic credit data as its core, ShareChain
gradually accesses travel sharing,charger sharing , digital sharing,
guesthouses sharing and other sharing applications, by using
Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data and other
technologies to increase interoperability in various fields and
integrating resources more efficiently to create a first-class
decentralized credit sharing ecosystem .

-6-

5.2 Decentralized sharing ecology of ShareChain
The feature of blockchain is that after the data is uploaded on
the chain, it is open, transparent, and can not be tampered. The
data credibility is ensured.
The ShareChain will store four types of datum on the chain:
user information in shared applications, SSS transaction information,
participant's comprehensive information on ShareChain, and
third-party credit information. Related information is uploaded onto
the blockchain, and the data in the blockchain can not be changed,
fundamentally solving the problems of data stealing and tampering,
which is the most concern of the user. In addition, the user key
information,

sharing

enterprise

data

information,

are

also

desensitized by privacy processing and encrypted in safety layer to
ensure privacy safety of the user and sharing enterprises.
The development of ShareChain is to create a sharing
ecosystem, and access the sharing enterprise. With the help of
blockchain technology, accurate, credible, and quantifiable data
indicators will be shared among sharing enterprises. More
authoritative user information analysis and recommendations will be
obtained from authoritative third-party credit agencies. With the
-7-

continuous development of ShareChain ecology, the number of
sharing enterprises has been increasing. When the sharing enterprise
has information query requirements, based on the blockchain,
ShareChain provides the most accurate information required by the
sharing enterprise through dynamic analysis, reducing business
operating costs and improving the efficiency of all participants in
the ShareChain ecosystem.

5.3 ShareChain smart contract
(1) Smart contract interpretation
In a simple word, "smart contract" is a contract (contract)
agreement performed programmatically. The main objective of the
smart contract is to meet the needs of a number of common
contracts (such as payment agreements, mortgage agreements.
confidentiality agreements, and even enforcement agreements). The
smart contract minimizes the impact of accidents or the events by
implementation of the agreement, removing third-party trust
mechanism to minimize the cost of trust between the parties,
reducing fraud losses and non-conformance with the agreement,

-8-

decreasing accidents, improving the efficiency of social operation
and achieving other economic goals.

(2) ShareChain smart contract
The user chooses the relevant conditions to generate the smart
contract, such as the lease time, the payment of the deposit, the rent
and the deductible, etc.. When the smart contract obtains external
data, detected in line with the preparatory conditions, will take the
initiative to replace the enterprise and users to respond, such as
automatic delivery, automatic refund, automatic payment and so on.
The whole process is recorded in the blockchain, to ensure that all
states of correctness, integrity and non-tampering, and to reduce the
impact of accidents.

5.3.2 ShareChain smart contract case

6. ShareChain business structure
The ShareChain consists of a block network and an open
platform. The entire business ecology also includes the roles of
cross-chain exchange, sharing enterprises, credit assessment service
providers, sharing ecosystems and customers.
6.1 role composition
1) Application users
The ShareChain does not change the usage habits of the users
of the sharing enterprise, and the application users still enjoy
convenience and service in the applications of sharing enterprise .
2) Sharing business operator
Sharing enterprises access the ShareChain with API provided
by ShareChain open platform in the application to provide new
users with SSS incentive mechanism.
3) ShareChain operation team
The ShareChain open platform is operated and maintained by
the ShareChain operation team. The initial promotion of the
ShareChain, and the initial release of SSS, require ShareChain
operation team's meticulous operation, so that more sharing
- 10 -

software users realize their credit value, and get involved in the
ShareChain ecology. Through using the software accurate user
information and behavior models are obtained to predict the model,
and to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the user credit
report .
4) ShareChain open platform
As the hub of the ShareChain, and a highly reliable operation
of network services, Sharing blockchain network has automatic
ledger of smart contract, key data recorded in the chain and query ,
blockchain accounts and circulation trading capabilities.
5) Third-party credit agencies
The third-party credit agency is responsible for providing a
reliable data algorithm to get a reliable data analysis results of the
user information in sharing software in the open platform to
ultimately get credit output and other results, and obtains the
corresponding SSS as a benefit.

6.3 Value distribution
Thanks to ShareChain access into the economy, the
information value distribution in sharing industry has been a
revolutionary change. The value of each role in the ShareChain
and the benefits obtained are described as below:
1 ) APPs users
Create value: Bring information value to the sharing
enterprise chain through the use of shared applications.
Yield profit: Use shared application to get SSS as an
incentive. The ShareChain accurately analyze the information of
the share enterprise so as to bring a better application experience
for users.
2 ) Sharing enterprises
Create value: Provide shared services and upload accurate
use reports for application users, to enhance the software user
experience more effectively .
Yield profit: When a user uses a sharing product through a
sharing enterprise app / WeChat official account, or when the
product has been used for some time and has use value, the
- 15 -

automatic ledger of smart contracts will be triggered. The
corresponding proportional SSS as an incentive will be
distributed to the user by ShareChain. Sharing enterprises can
exchange SSS using software add-on services, and the
ShareChain will buy back according to SSS and the user
information of SSS.
3 ) Data analysis service provider
Create value: Analyze and upload the user's encrypted data;
Integrate accurately the user data; Has a positive influence

on

the sharing enterprise information collection and information
management.
Yield profit: Participate in the SSS sharing. The more accurate
analysis of the application user’s data, the more valuable it is and
more SSS will be obtained as an incentive.

6.4 Resource integration and advantageous ecological
construction
ShareChain user encryption information, smart contract, SSS
incentive strategy, key business data, transfer transaction
information etc., circulating in the in the system will be recorded in
the blockchain network. Based on the open, transparent,
tamper-resistant blockchain, the data mentioned above is
transparent and reliable. Encryption is used for sensitive data,
taking privacy protection into account.
The ShareChain system based on trusted data flow provides the
traditional sharing enterprise with the opportunity to share the
resources of the industry. The sharing enterprises in different
industries participating in the ShareChain, forming an ecosystem,
will benefit from two aspects:
1) Get more user resources for shared applications;
2) Cooperate with the sharing enterprises in the industry, which
can not be accomplished before. All sharing enterprises in the
ShareChain, enter the market as a whole. Through the cooperation
and advantages complementary to each other in this industry, a

- 17 -

wider range of market value will be gained, so that the sharing
economy contributes to the society in a larger scale.

7. ShareChain solves the sharing economic core issue
- credit
(1) More secure for sharing the credits of the two parities
through interconnection
The business models of sharing economy are mainly
concentrated in C2C, B2C, C2C mode with well-known applications
Uber, Airbnb, Didi, etc .; well-known applications in OFO, Mobike,
etc., in B2C mode; Either in C2C or B2C, because the transaction is
based on the Internet or mobile Internet, two sharing parties can not
check mutual information, and sharing becomes risking in some
cases that they are completely unfamiliar with each other. And then
the access to the ShareChain make the transactions more smooth
and secure, due to the uniqueness of real name, and open transparent
principles. The entire transaction can be traced to the source, so as
to ensure the interests of both parties.
(2) platform (official) data more credible
Whether it is C2C or B2C, the transaction is based on the
platform, whose interests is to facilitate sharing transactions. In
most cases, when the interests of the platform is reduced or removed,
the platform is able to tamper with the data through the backstage,
- 19 -

and the data will never be retrieved or investigated. At this moment
the access to ShareChain can better control the corporate credit. Due
to consensus mechanism and tamper-resistant principle, the entire
transaction data can not be tampered on the platform, making the
platform data more credible and more valuable.
(3)More efficient user experience
As traditional sharing applications, when new users register,
their ratings are raised at the initial level. In this mode, high-quality
user with high-credit groups can not get the best quality user
experience at the first time and the user's first impression of the
software is affected. Through data sharing mechanism in the sharing
ecosystem,each sharing enterprise in the ShareChain can get the
most authentic user credit data, and the user's real rating can be
adjusted in time based on obtained information. High credit user
groups can get the most out of the user experience in new sharing
apps at the first time.

- 20 -

8. Super Smart Share (SSS)
(1) The role of SSS
SSS on ShareChain is the currency of the system. Besides the
application of SSS in the above mentioned smart contract execute, it
can be used in related services include but are not limited to the
following scenarios:
A. Share application user incentives
B. Share application platform transaction services
C. ShareChain underlying data consumption
D. Third party consumer services
E. ShareChain smart contract consumption
In addition, the shared chain will continue to expand the use of
SSS scenarios, while continuing to allow more third parties to
access to ShareChain to add SSS value.
(2) The source of SSS value
SSS is the basis for the entire ShareChain system and Dapp
operation. While ShareChain system provides external services, it
receive a certain number of SSS as a supplement. SSS consumption,
- 21 -

exchange and other circulation can be done by the users who have
access to Dapp. Dapp Users gaining more benefits and added values
through SSS consumption, or third party of Dapp using credit data
by consuming SSS, maintain or boost SSS price. Users can also
share items and recommend friends to join in to gain SSS, so as to
propel more users to join Dapp to share items, with increasing Dapp
users and greater growth space. In consequence, the price of SSS
will be incresed. Similarly when people use Bitcoin for exchange, it
is necessary for them to go to the market to buy Bitcoin. With the
increasing number of people use Bitcoin for exchange, Bitcoin will
be appreciated.
The ShareChain system helps the zero-rent platform to better
serve the user while also providing it to other third parties to share
applications. In theory, the prevalent global sharing economy now
brings rapidly growing users and increasing awareness of SSS. With
the explosive growth of the shared application, SSS value will be
increased quickly.
