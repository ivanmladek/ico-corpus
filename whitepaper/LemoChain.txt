Executive Summary
The Founders of LemoChain (Lemo for short) are committed to developing a
decentralized data circulation ecosystem, focused on facilitating the effective open
exchange of structured business data. Built on blockchain technology, Lemo’s ‘SmartContract Value Transfer Protocol’ is able to achieve a P2P and B2B data exchange
across a DApp platform - a decentralized application platform suitable for a range of
industries (including education, social networking, gaming, recruitment, finance etc.).
Lemo’s innovative technology, comprehensive ecosystem governance and inclusive
nature will facilitate an all- encompassing platform for widespread data pioneering.
From a technical viewpoint, Lemo possesses strong research and development
capabilities. Through implementing an established technological framework, Lemo will
be the first blockchain to run on a D-PoVP (Delegated Proof of Valued Participation)
consensus mechanism. This innovative mechanism will be implemented in alignment
with varying regulatory requirements across a broad spectrum of commercial
applications.
Meanwhile, the adoption of secure multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proofs
and homomorphic encryption will ensure secure and efficient data transfer; thus
establishing the underlying trust foundations for data circulation on Lemo.
From an angle of ecosystem governance, The Lemo Foundation is designed to
drive R&D growth, governance transparency and the overall development of the
LemoChain ecosystem, so as to strive for universal security and cooperation between
all stakeholders. The Foundation regularly evaluates all aspects of the open source
community from several dimensions such as code management, team management,
financial management and public relations. Thus, the sustainability of Lemo, the
efficiency of the Foundation’s management and the security of crowdfunding can be
ensured.

In regards to mobile applications, Lemo, along with service providers, will enhance
business’ off-chain capabilities by facilitating decentralized application development
and providing smart contracts which align with real commercial logic. Eventually, not
only does Lemo strive for the broad adoption of ‘Go-Mobile’ strategies; but ultimately
aims to optimize traditional businesses using blockchain technology. Lemo maintains
the belief that by realizing blockchain’s potential for business development, companies
can bring tangible benefits to a range of stakeholders.
Within the whole ecosystem, Lemo will collaborate with third-party developers to
provide support and technical framework assistance, including:
•

LEMO Token - The encrypted Lemo token (LEMO) will be the universal medium
of exchange on Lemo. LEMO will be a stable store of value that will facilitate
data exchange, regardless of time or location.

•

Commercial data matching and trading system - Providing data distribution
services based on multi-party computation calculations; assisting different
applications in developing compliant and transparent data distribution channels.

•

Data Circulation - Sharing of data (serving for all social apps), helping different
apps to build legal and transparent data flow channels.

•

Account System - One account has access to all apps, increasing conversion
rates and expanding traffic sources.

•

Digital Asset Smart Contract - Ensuring the ownership authentication of digital
assets for developers and users; helping the circulation and liquidation of digital
assets, thus improving user’s mobilization.

•

ntegrity System - User credit system; an interest-driven system, evaluating
overall ecosystem contribution; so as to recognize and reward positive
contribution whilst discouraging negative input. This will aid developers in
selecting target users whilst increasing conversion rates.

•

Data encryption storage and transmission system - Providing a securely
encrypted system for the storage and transmission of data for B-end users and
developers .

At the same time, we will lay down a reward plan to encourage early third-party
developers to work with us on LemoChain-based mobile-end services, promoting the
efficient and synergetic development of blockchain.

Lemo's design concept
Why did we create Lemo
Since Bitcoin’s implementation of open source P2P currency in 2009, we have
witnessed a global phenomenon: an emergence of countless projects founded on
achieving socio-economic development by means of decentralization and distributed
ledger technologies. Arguably, the most notable of these projects being the Ethereum
project, which focused on proving the potential of smart contracts whilst developing
a universal platform for decentralized applications (DApps). However, despite these
advances, the blockchain world still faces a host of challenges from both technical and
industrial perspectives:

•

Many existing smart-contract platforms have struggled to connect with real
business logic due to the technological distance from everyday business, with
both Bitcoin and Ethereum architecture having limited widespread application
to the common consumer.

•

Current consensus mechanisms lack flexibility and efficiency; the exchange of
value is not centered around transferability to real commercial scenarios.

•

The compatibility problems between different blockchain platforms. For
example, UTXO-based Bitcoin ecosystem isn’t compatible with Account-based
Ethereum.

•

Existing blockchain platforms are isolated from off-chain data. At present, most
smart contracts solely accept on-chain data as the trigger condition, lacking
interchangeability within the real world.

We are committed to building a brand-new blockchain data transmission ecosystem;
Lemo, as a universal Internet data value transmission protocol for future decentralized
applications, digitizing and tokenizing data values, and promoting Blockchain
technology is applied to real-life business scenarios.
We are aiming to build a new data circulation system, based on LemoChain, which will
become the universal online data transfer protocol. This is how LemoChain will connect
blockchain technology with the real world.
At the same time, in offline and online business activities, valid data transfer and
exchange has always been the power source of their business model. Traditional
commercial activity faces the following obstacles whilst obtaining this data:

as well as:
•

Data transmission security

•

The use and attribution of data are not effectively guaranteed and the process
cannot be monitored and opaque

•

The trust costs of both sides of data transactions are generally high, which
directly leads to the liquidity of the data, the value it generates, and its limited
value.

The vision of LemoChain
LemoChain is the future data value transfer solution for applications and businesses
alike. It is an ecosystem powered by blockchain technology. The Lemo Foundation is
aiming to integrate blockchain technology into a range of industries, such as: social
networks, gaming, education and recruitment. This will be executed through building
communities of third-party developers, operating on a network that is constantly
evolving alongside the ecosystem.

The design principles of LemoChain

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

11

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

Whilst striving to facilitate the optimum operation of Lemo-based applications,
scalability must be of top priority. Slow transaction speeds inhibit the overall success
of the ecosystem and prevent the growth of future applications; essentially rendering
the underlying vision of a flourishing decentralized ecosystem on Lemo as flawed. For
example, CryptoKitties caused 20,000 transactions on the Ethereum network to be
blocked, whilst consuming 15% of the entire network. The DPoS based graphene/
EOS framework can provide 10,000 TPS with and average transaction speed of 1
second; thus, reaching Visa scale transaction processing capabilities. These are hugely
promising developments but has highlighted some clear room for development to
Lemo.
Lemo will address the following characteristics in its' technical design:
1. Universally Applicable
As a data circulation blockchain focused on a broad market, Lemo serves no specific
industry and strives for widespread integration both within and between industries.
Meanwhile, Lemo will provide development kits and tools to aid developers’ integration
into the ecosystem.
2. Easily Upgradable
Bugs are an inevitable hurdle for any project and regular optimization is key to long
term success of any organization. Bitcoin’s centralized computing power has resulted
in a mining pool with no democratic input; It’s evolution as a stable decentralized
network is arguably hindered by the conflict of interest that occurs between all
stakeholders, from users to miners and even between mining pools. Conversely,
Ethereum’s failure to reach a common consensus following the hack of the DAO led
to the hard fork into ETH and ETC, thus creating two separate forks that both require
their own regular bug fixes. Lemo will ensure full community input and decentralized
contribution, whilst ensuring all bugs and shortcomings are met with a high degree of
efficiency and transparency.
3. Security & Privacy
Lemo, from its core blockchain code to its upper application interface will coherently

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

12

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

safeguard user privacy across all aspects of data exchange within its’ ecosystem. This
will ensure sole ownership of data from the original holder, with no access available
to any third party. All code related to the data privacy and user protection will be
open-sourced entirely to accept consistent community feedback. Additionally, Lemo
will organize regular code audits to ensure the entire mechanism can withstand any
malicious attacks.
4. Transparency & Support
Lemo will develop blockchain infrastructure with a friendly user interface for true
accessibility; with this being backed up by the release of development kits for
developers wishing to operate on Lemo. Lemo will also be in regular collaboration and
idea sharing with industry partners, aiming to align with one core vision of a prosperous
open data exchange infrastructure.

In response to the current limitations and various issues with existing blockchain
technology, Lemo has proposed the following goals targeted at addressing existing
public blockchain platforms (Circa October 2017):
•

To make blockchain universally compatible with real world business;

•

To develop a flexible and comprehensive consensus mechanism;

•

To lower the transaction cost and solve the existing credit problems in current
business environments;

•

To conditionally release the smart contract based on the on-chain data,
achieving interconnection between blockchain and the real world;

•

To provide a universal account system to eliminate boundaries faced by current
applications;

•

To protect the rights and interests of all participants;

•

To aid the full circulation of participant’s digital assets;

Based on all these goals, Lemo will provide a solution which mainly includes five major
notions to improve the overall application data circulation in the future:
1. A data circulation system based on Secure Multi-party Computation, with
smart contracts to aid users effectively exchange and circulate data and

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

13

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

digital assets;
2. A high-speed decentralized data storage and transmission system based on
blockchain smart contracts and homomorphic encryption technology. This
will help developers, service providers, and users securely store data (digital
assets) to ensure that all participants rights and interests are rightfully
protected.
3. Issuing LEMO tokens as a quantitative proof of ownership and as a
distribution medium for digital assets;
4. An account system that establishes a common account for all participants in
the system and eliminates the boundaries between varying businesses and
applications on Lemo;
5. A credit system that uses smart contracts to agree on the credit impact
of 12 different community behaviors; maintaining the value system of the
community in a decentralized manner whilst rewarding quality participants
and discouraging and/or punishing negative contribution.

Whilst looking at security, the antagonistic relationship between developers and users,
combined with the competition between different developers in the same field is
hindering industry and societal progress. In Lemo’s decentralized architecture, users
and different developers are all participants with a common goal. By contributing
their own products, development and operational capabilities, they each provide to
the ecosystem: information, data, community governance, traffic, storage space,
assets, etc., to receive tokens from the community. At the same time, Lemo provides
a liquidation and circulation channel for digital assets and equity that will benefit all
participants in the system.

Components of LemoChain’s
Ecosystem
Stakeholders
The stakeholders of LemoChain represent the true operational capability of
LemoChain’s ecosystem. Defining them from various dimensions, we’ve divided
stakeholders into following categories:
1. Users
Users enter into the ecosystem via DApps; By creating accounts, inviting other users,
and by positively contributing information users obtain financial reward, ‘Lemo’. Also,
Lemo can be used on other Dapps on LemoChain to pay for services such as data
storage, or on cross-application data ownership authentication and circulation.
2. Developers/Carriers
Developers/Carriers enter into ecosystem through integrating and using Lemo API in
their applications. By building applications, acquiring users, and contributing encrypted
data, they gain Lemo reward. After ownership authentication and quotation conducted
by Lemo, data contributed will have access to the overall circulation, so as to offer
other participations the valuable information they need, through which developers can
gain Lemo. Developers can also broadcast within LemoChain for their data demands
(new user acquisition, business analytics and user behaviors). For those with limited
app developing capabilities, LemoChain will also provide fundamental user framework
so even those with less resources can reap the benefits of the Lemo ecosystem.
3. Storage nodes
Storage nodes enter into ecosystem by contributing their own storage space and
computing power. Owners of limited storage server space can represent storage nodes

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

15

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

to join the ecosystem and get Lemo tokens by providing decentralized storage and
computing power for the entire ecosystem.
4. Investors
Investors can acquire early ownership of Lemo Token in the pre-sale stage. Investors
are early supporters and visionaries of the LemoChain ecosystem. The funds raised
by investors will be used in developing LemoChain, community building, marketing
promotion, and daily operation, whilst laying the foundations for other participants’
benefits.
5. Opinion leaders
Every 12 months, Lemo Foundation LTD will nominate candidates of opinion leaders
through comprehensive evaluation based on annual community contribution. Then,
community participants vote by ballot. Opinion leaders can bring forward opinions on
ecosystem development and then after auditing, the future trend of Lemo ecosystem
will be determined by participants’ voting. At the same time, opinion leaders also
embrace voting rights in The Lemo Foundation, enabling them to work on LemoChainrelated decisions, whilst gaining Lemo from the community for their valued contribution.

The Lemo ecosystem is open and free for everyone. People will be required to pay
Lemo only when using specific storage or data. Lemo token can be acquired by
investing in Lemo Foundation LTD during early stages or making contributions to the
ecosystem including contributing their own data, creating traffic, providing storage and
computing, inviting new users, participating in community governance and more.

Consensus Mechanism
The consensus mechanism has always been a hot topic in blockchain research. The
prevailing view is that effective algorithms must comply with the Byzantine fault
tolerance principle. And it needs to be safe, clear and irreversible in the shortest
possible time, and it is easy to provide a most solid and decentralized system. In
practice, the process is divided into two aspects: selecting a unique node to generate
a block and making the transaction ledger irreversible.
The Byzantine fault-tolerance problem can be expressed as a major solution to the
problem of a general trusted communication. A group of generals want to achieve
a certain goal (consistent attack or retreat), and the individual actions cannot be
completed. A consensus must be reached through cooperation. However, due to
the presence of traitors, the generals do not know how to achieve agreement. Here
"consistency" is the main content of the discussion of General Byzantine. Currently
there are many algorithms that have solved the Byzantine General problem. Here are
some common algorithms

1. PBFT
The PBFT mechanism is represented by the IBM HyperLedger fabric. The core of
a solution it describes is the state machine replica replication algorithm. First, a
master node is responsible for block production; then, the received transaction data
is broadcast to the entire network. Eventually each node keeps a copy of the state
of the service. The total number of sets composed of all copies is denoted by N, and
each copy is represented by 0 to |N|-1, as long as the number of untrusted copies
is (analogous to the number of traitors) f ≤ (|N|-1)/3, then this system can operate
normally. Under this mechanism, all nodes eventually reach the same consensus and
therefore do not diverge. If the master node goes offline, the backup node triggers a
timeout mechanism and selects the next master node based on the node number.

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

18

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

The working premise of PBFT is that the nodes in the network are known in advance,
and therefore are only applicable to the consortium chain or private chain. Nodes
working under the PBFT mechanism need to communicate with each other. The
complexity of network communication is O (n^2). The traffic volume will grow
explosively as the number of nodes grows. In a public-chain environment, it will cause
serious broadcast storms.
2. Proof of Work (PoW)
PoW is a research report posted by Nakamoto in a secret crypto-discussion group in
2008. The report describes his new ideas on cryptocurrency and the proposed bitcoin
consensus algorithm. Each node in the entire system provides computing power for the
entire system (abbreviation referred to as computational power). Through a competition
mechanism, the nodes that have completed the most outstanding calculation work
are rewarded by the system, once the distribution of newly generated currencies is
completed. Simple and stable, it has withstood all kinds of attacks after attracting the
attention of various hackers and scientists.
3. Proof of Stake (PoS)
The POS mechanism can be described as ‘virtual mining’. Since PoW mainly depends
on the scarcity of computer hardware to prevent witch attacks, PoS relies mainly on
tokens in the blockchain itself. The holder holds the token as a deposit in the PoS
mechanism so that they become validators. The PoS algorithm randomly selects one
of these verifiers and gives them the right to generate the next block. The basis for
selection is how much they invest in tokens and how long they hold tokens. If, within a
certain period of time, the verifier does not produce a block, a verifier will be reselected
instead of generating a new block. Similar to a system that distributes interest based
on the amount and timing of token possession. The actual implementation of PoS
will also have some mechanisms for clearing currency age, currency decay, etc. The
PoS mechanism will have the advantage of not being able to carry out force attacks
because the person who launches the attack needs to hold 51% of the total currency.
After the attack causes the currency value to fall, he will be the person whose total
currency value is most damaged.

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

19

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

Under the PoS mechanism, some holders will hold large amounts of tokens for a
long period of time in order to increase voting weight. As a result, the total tokens in
circulation will be reduced and prices will be more vulnerable to fluctuations. Because
there may be a large number of big players or mine pools holding most tokens in the
entire network, the entire network may become more and more centralized as the
running time increases.
4. Delegate Proof of Stake

(DPoS)

The DPoS consensus mechanism sacrifices certain aspects of decentralization on the
basis of PoS, whilst greatly accelerating the time-consuming transaction confirmation
process. The main principle is to randomly select a Lemo limited number of agent
nodes among all nodes, and these nodes take turns accounting and take the consensus
of the agent as the consensus of the entire network. New block rewards are shared by
both agents and voters. In order to avoid adverse effects on the blockchain after the
malicious node becomes the agent, the DPoS mechanism needs to re-elect the agent
after a certain period of time. DPoS currently has the advantages of maturity and high
throughput. Only the agent node can reach a consensus to confirm the transaction, and
its transaction frequency can even reach the centralized Visa settlement scale.
5. Delegated Proof of Valuable Participation (DPoVP)
LemoChain integrated the BFT and DPoS consensus mechanism, and included the
value of user contributions into the scope of incentives to develop a new DPoVP
mechanism. The representative feature of this technology is to define multiple types,
not just to acquire tokens in the mode of renting and selling idle computer resources,
and to quantify the user's behavior through various dimensions of the scoring system,
as a user's contribution to the platform, and loyalty. The measure of degree. On the
one hand, it provides a standard for identifying high-quality users. On the other hand,
it can also be used as a platform to motivate users. The platform contributes to
the prosperity of each application ecology on LemoChain through rewards to users,
and further attracts more traffic to the platform. This virtuous circle mechanism has
become a major boost for LemoChain's rapid application development.

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

20

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

Throughput
The basis of the DPoVP consensus mechanism combines the advantages of BFT's
fast consensus and the DPoS's throughput capability. It adopts the rule of out-ofsequence. Once the block from the last witness is received by the two-thirds node, it
can be immediately confirmed. Start production of the next block. Equivalent to the
block time interval is only limited by the network transmission speed, under normal
circumstances can achieve less than 1s average verification speed and average
8000TPS data throughput.
2.1 Voting
In order to maintain the independence and scalability of functions, Lemo uses smart
contracts to implement voting. The node is registered as a candidate through the
contract and accepts user voting. Finally, the first 21 nodes are selected as witnesses
based on the voting results.
2.2 The ownership of bookkeeping rights
The bookkeeping right mainly solves the problem of whether to block oneself or when
to block. Witnesses proceed to block in the lexicographic order of the address. After
you block out or receive a new block, you need to recalculate the countdown of your
own block. After the time is zero, a new block will be generated directly.
First we define I to indicate the blocker number. Have:
•

The current node's block number;

•

The block number of the block that it produced or received and passed. Height
is +1 of the current chain height;+1；

•

The block number of the previously confirmed block before confirming the new
block;

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

21

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

Define d as the distance of the two outlier numbers:

Where C is the number of consensus nodes.
The validity of the new block needs to be verified before triggering the recalculation
countdown. The countdown formula is as follows current time;
Timestamps received in the header of the block;
The waiting time for the current node to come out of the block. This is to prevent the
block from going too fast, resulting in the early transactions being less empty;
The maximum available time for the block to come out of the block, beyond which the
next node should immediately block out;

2.3 Block risk at the same time
Assume that the communication is normal at a certain moment, A node is out of the
block, node B should be out of block at 10 seconds, and node C should be out of block
at 20 seconds.
A quickly blocks and broadcasts, but fails to synchronize to Node B and synchronizes
only to Node C. The C-node recalculated block time may be 10.3 seconds. This causes
B and C nodes to block out in a very short period of time and broadcast to other
witness nodes, resulting in a fork, unable to reach a two-thirds consensus.
According to the time calculation formula, the witness node does not recalculate
(shorten) the block-out time when it receives discontinuous blocks, and it assists in
broadcasting the confirmation information of other nodes. The nodes make decisions
after trying to collect all the blocks on all branches.
The forking selection rule is to select the longest chain preferentially, and when the
same length is selected, the lexicographic order of the block hash at the bifurcation is

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

22

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

preferentially selected to be the front chain.

All nodes select the forked chain according to the same rule. After reaching twothirds of the consensus, all the blocks in the chain enter the “final confirmation state”
and are broadcast to ordinary nodes. Since bifurcation occurs at the consensus node,
it does not have any effect on ordinary nodes that only receive access to the "final
status" block.
2.4 Consensus Network Splitting Risk
Assume that 21 consensus nodes have 11 in China and 10 in the United States. Due to
the special circumstances such as the interruption of the optical cable, the network is
split into two parts that cannot communicate with each other, each of which generates
a bifurcation chain. Here are two networks named C and A.
Each node will continue to count down and out of blocks, but it will never receive more
than two-thirds of the node consensus. The witness no longer broadcasts blocks to
ordinary nodes. Taking the C network as an example, in the case of ignoring block time
and network transmission time-consuming, the time for each node to cycle (generate
block) is linearly related to the number of A network nodes, , the average block interval is:

Obviously, at the same time witnessing more nodes will produce more blocks. After the
recovery of the optical cable, the witness network is connected and the new block can
be broadcast to all nodes. Each node pulls the complete branch chain along the parent
block hash, and selects the final chain according to the longest chain principle. Thus,
two-thirds of the consensus reached in each block of the chain began to be broadcast
to ordinary nodes. The process of confirming the block in this case will be stagnant for
a while, but there is no security risk for the transaction on the chain.

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data

Data Storage
Lemo aims to create a decentralized data rights and circulation platform; the safe
storage, encrypted transmission, and copyright attribution of participant data are
crucial to the success of such a platform. The blockchain's security largely depends on
it being mirrored by a large number of nodes and being 100% available. The storage
of large, variable files on the chain will result in very high cost. For example, there is
a high-performance blockchain application that processes 1 million transactions per
second. Each transaction generates 100 bytes of records, and the consumed storage
space will increase at more than 100MB/s. In order to maintain practicality, it is
necessary to periodically truncate transaction records on the blockchain and save a
blockchain state snapshot. However, the complete transaction record
will still be copied to each node, causing unnecessary backup overhead. Therefore, it
is a practical and nonextensible decentralized file storage solution to store large-size
data in the blockchain.
Flexible docking will support decentralized IPFS, storj file system, centralized cloud
database and other programs, therefore providing users with a more diverse choice
when it comes to data storage. In order to further simplify the application platform
interfaces, Lemo will provide: a storage system adapter SDK, a public and private key
generation package, address generation, signature verification, encryption, decryption
and other functions. These will be shielded by complex signature generation rules,
coding-conversion problems, and a variety of underlying error-code processing logic.
The user identity management module and the private key storage module can be
optionally introduced on the interface to reduce the public-private key management
burden on the service application. Overall, Lemo is providing a convenient and easy to
use interface for business developers.

Safe Transactions
In a traditional private data exchange scenario, the data of both parties in the
transaction needs to be disclosed to each other or be matched by a trusted third party.
In the current volatile and malicious business environment, this is extremely risky. The
third party's right to facilitate the transaction is too large, and there is the possibility
of leakage, tampering, and concealment of data between the two parties. As a result,
protocols that can support joint computing and protect the privacy of participants have
become increasingly more recognised. Lemo is committed to introducing Secure MultiParty Computation (SMC) to solve this problem.
Secure multi-party computation is a collaborative computing solution that solves the
problem of privacy protection among a group of non-trusted parties. SMC ensures
the independence of input and the correctness of calculation; all without disclosing
each input value to any of the participants. In general, a secure multi-party computing
problem calculates any probability function based on any input to a distribution
network. Each input party has an input on the distribution network. This distribution
network needs to ensure the independence of the input and the correctness of the
calculation. Also, in addition to their respective inputs, they do not disclose any other
non-relevant information that can be used to derive other inputs and/or outputs.
Taking marriage and love website pairing as an example, the user's conditions and
features are mapped into points in a t-dimensional space.

Let the target of the demand side be a, the data of the data provider is to satisfy:

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

The matchmaking transaction algorithm can be summarized as the nearest neighbor
algorithm NN in the t-dimensional space b , that is, the minimum distance d between a
and B is found to be minimum

In order to protect the confidentiality of the B data, the nodes in the blockchain need
to be isolated from the data a and b, and only the encrypted data can be obtained.
Therefore, Lemo introduced will introduce Fully Homomorphic Encryption to perform
data matching calculations. Fully homomorphic encryption can perform arbitrarily
complex operations on encrypted data without a decryption key to achieve secure
plaintext computations.
Let the encryption algorithm be: E(x)=cX
The decryption algorithm is: D(x)=pX
Limited by the performance of the homomorphic encryption algorithm, LemoChain
chooses the square of the Euclidean distance to calculate the matching degree. The
optimal match calculation formula is:

After calculating b′ via the above formula, the inquirer obtains the best matching
target. During the entire matching process, the proxy computing node and the inquirer
cannot access other user’s data before encryption, and the privacy of the user data is
ensured.

Smart Contract
A smart contract is a digital version of a traditional contract. Once written, it can
be trusted by all parties, without requiring trust between those parties. The terms
of the contract are final and therefore cannot be changed. This idea was proposed
back in 1994 by cryptographer Nick Szabo, but the full potential was not widely
recognized until the emergence of blockchain technology. Essentially, a smart
contract is a computer program running on a blockchain database that can be
triggered by preprogrammed conditions. Blockchain technology brings a decentralized,
unchangeable and highly reliable system for an extensive range of applications. Smart
contracts are one of the most important features of the blockchain and a key factor in
its reputation as disruptive technology that is revolutionizing our social structure.
Lemo’s smart contract supports Java, C/C++, Python and a range of other coding
languages. All smart contract source code is compiled into bytecode to run in the
virtual machine.
The use of Sandbox technology has been implemented to achieve a complete isolation
of affairs and limit access to computing resources, whilst maximizing performance and
security.
Lemo's smart contract virtual machine is built on a LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine)based compiler architecture. LLVM supports JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation)
technology, which can dynamically compile and execute the generated machine code
according to the users’ requirements, which can significantly increase the execution
speed of dynamic languages and maximize the performance of hardware. Based on
LLVM's powerful three-stage design, future Lemo smart contracts will also support
JavaScript and other more languages, and developers who are most comfortable with
different technical backgrounds will develop smart contracts. Smart contracts include

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

28

LemoChain

the four parts of contract registration, triggering, execution and cancellation:
Contract Registration
Contract registration is the process of storing the consensus in the blockchain after
processing the user-written contract security check. Users need to consume gas
according to the amount of code required to register a contract.
Contract Triggering
Contract triggering is the process of triggering contract execution through external
conditions after contract registration. It supports timing triggering, event triggering,
transaction triggering, and other contract triggering methods. Timing trigger refers to
the process of automatically triggering the contract call after the node triggers the
time consensus after meeting the preset time in the contract. Events, transactions,
and other contract calls are new requests that trigger contract execution during the
consensus process.
Contract Execution
Contract execution is the complete process of running the contract code in an external
environment, including the contract structure mirroring environment, code execution,
the implementation of state changes in the implementation of the code and exception
handling of the consensus. There is a special message call named a proxy call. Except
for the code of the target address being executed in the caller's context, everything
else is the same as the message call. This means that the contract can dynamically
load code for other addresses at runtime. Only the code is obtained from the caller,
this allows us to easily package code into libraries and reuse them in other contracts.
For example, to implement a complex data structure, reusable code can be applied to
contract storage
Contract Cancellation
Cancellation is only necessary to clean up a contract that has been executed, expired
or faces changes in business requirements that are no longer needed. The cleanup
process requires a multi-node consensus before it can be completed. The only way to

remove code from the blockchain is to have the Lemo contract perform a self-destruct
operation on its address. The remaining balance under this account will be sent to the
specified target, and the storage and code will be removed from the stack.

Lemo provides some of the standard contract implementations. Including the
consistency check of assets, automatic integration, multi-signature, automatic
settlement and other relatively simple logic of the contract. Users can invoke or
adapt these contracts to suit their own business needs. It can also be completely
implemented by itself.LemoChain

Account System
In a decentralized blockchain world, the user's possessions can only be mastered by
themselves, no one person nor organization can steal money, and there is no possibility
of it being stolen by server hackers. But in fact, most users can not properly manage
their accounts private key. According to Deloitte, at least 37% of users forget the
password when they log in and use the "retrieve password" feature. Forgetting the
private key on the blockchain will cause the property to disappear directly, and there is
no way to get this property back. The total amount of bitcoin having disappeared has
reached 4 million, accounting for nearly 20% of the total amount. Users have a very
strong demand for secure hosting of private keys.
LemoChain's account system addresses the mapping of user identities to blockchain
addresses, user privacy confidentiality, and regulatory audit traceability issues. It allows
users to use easy-to-remember usernames and passwords for access and implements
OAuth2.0 authentication mechanisms. Third-party applications that obtain user
authorization can easily obtain basic Lemo White Paper 28 user information without
the management logic of implementing and maintaining user-accounts by themselves.
This boils down to just a few lines of code in accessing the LemoChain ecosystem.
Based on the account system, LemoChain will provide some common business unit
plug-ins, which can be rapidly integrated into developers DApp applications. This

Online Safe
The online safe is a secure private key hosting service provided by Lemo. It is designed
to ease the security burden on users. First, the local client encrypts the user's private
key and uploads it to Lemo's private key coffer. When the user's private key is lost,
the encrypted private key can be retrieved by providing authentication information and
decrypted locally. The private and password in the entire process will not appear on the
Internet, nor will it appear in the Lemo server. Private key security is guaranteed. Only
users themselves can decrypt private data stored on the network.

Data Exchange Template
In order to help developers realize the potential of data transaction functions of their
respective industries faster, LemoChain has implemented a set of decentralized
data transaction system applications based on the team’s past experience in social
networking and online dating. All the matching requirements are placed on the chain
as transaction data, and the smart contract is used to automatically match the
transaction. When the match is successful, both parties send data to decrypt each
other's private key, ensuring that the user's privacy can be seen only if both parties
match. The entire transaction process is open and transparent, privacy information will
not be leaked to third parties, and exchanges cannot be concealed from fraud. This
application shows developers the smart contract of LemoChain and the use of various
services; It is the best developer learning material and can be used as a template to
derive data transaction applications in other fields.

Application Prospects Based on LemoChain
LemoChain is developed on a decentralized blockchain network with a platform capable
of supporting tens of millions of active users daily. Through adopting a standardized
and decentralized storage mechanism, LemoChain will reduce participation costs for all
concerned parties.
LemoChain’s ecosystem architecture is as follows:
•

For Developers: We open Data Exchange APIs, Statistical Analysis APIs and
Deep Learning APIs

•

For Businesses: Data Trading, Algorithmic Trading, DAPP Enterprise

•

For the Open Source community: Availability of results from LemoChain’s
blockchain R&D

Multiple industry support
Within LemoChain’s ecosystem, there will be regular adaption and introduction
of consensus mechanism developments to adhere to ever- changing industry
requirements. LemoChain will support multiple industries which have flaws in credit
and data exchange, whilst providing the corresponding technical support to ensure
businesses remain consistently in- tune with blockchain. Some industries include: social
media, education, recruitment etc. Furthermore, based on the data circulation, smart
contracts and credit system of LemoChain, we can utilize more complex business logic
support through the Turing complete programming language.
Application scenario
Lemo started socializing. As early as 2016, the Lemo team tried to exchange data
between several social products of its own to increase the reuse rate of excess traffic,
which greatly increased the earnings of various APPs. At the time, our overall payout
ratio increased from 6.5% to 11.5%. In a matter of months, turnover nearly doubled.

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

LemoChain

Only the data sharing between several APPs can achieve this effect. Assuming that
more merchants can join, the benefits for merchants can be imagined.
But when we try to invite more social APPs to participate in it, the trust issue becomes
the biggest obstacle. This made us aware of the current strong demand for data
sharing and the enormous difficulties faced by businesses. The characteristics of
blockchain decentralized storage and data rights-enforcement technologies, as well as
the underlying economic value system, perfectly solve this problem. Lemo was born to
solve these problems.

Application Scenario One: Dating
Users submit their personal data and their friends' needs through dating and dating
DApps. Individuals can encrypt and store their social data, and then digital assets can
be uploaded to the profitable platform and the tokens can be obtained. Advertisers and
their other dating partners need to pay tokens to obtain this data. They can be used
for precise matching of dating friends and precise targeting of advertisements.

37

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data

Application Scenario Two: Health and Medical Data DAPP
Through health data DAPP, personal health data can be securely protected, data
can be shared, and users can easily use it. Individuals upload their own health data
to profitable data platforms and can obtain tokens. Data providers such as medical
service providers and pharmaceutical companies can directly obtain data from
profitable data links, and there are huge application scenarios in the direction of new
drug development, testing, and precision medical care.

Application Scenario Three: Blockchain technology applied to education and human
resources
In the education and training industry, there will be various language training institutions
and quality education and training institutions. These institutions are not actually
competing with each other, and they can share resources and communicate with each
other. However, the current situation is that these organizations have each spent a
lot of manpower, financial resources, and time costs, access to market resources (of
which there are always some resources are ineffective resources). If Lemo solves the
problem of inter-agency trust and student ownership, it can share resources in the
form of co-enrollment, increase the number of students, reduce the cost of obtaining
customers, and increase profits, while creating an information platform based on
blockchain technology for education, skills, and professional experience. The nondefective modification and time stamping functions based on blockchain technology
provide employers with a certifiable source of academic, technical, and professional
experience information. This saves the company considerable human and financial
resources for background research during the recruitment process. This technical
system can also be widely used in the certification of notary, finance, banking and

other industries, and has a wide range of application prospects.

Blockchain technology fundamentally solves the trust problem of data circulation, and
then realizes decentralization on the basis of it. LemoChain Ecology will fully support
decentralized applications from the technical level, develop different modules such
as account systems, credit systems, and data distribution protocols, and provide
development platforms and interfaces for different developers and service providers,
saving development costs, which helps them to iterate quickly and increase profitability.

Lemo iterative planning
As an early application of emerging technologies, blockchain technology faces various
challenges and opportunities. LemoChain's Future Iteration Directions:
•

One is the iteration of the underlying architecture code;

•

The second is the iteration of commercial applications built on the main chain
of LemoChain.

The iteration of the LemoChain infrastructure
When the LemoChain architecture code itself is flawed, it is usually iterated through
the system upgrade. Vulnerabilities need to be analyzed, tested and reviewed by the
Code Review Committee and submitted to the Decision Committee for reporting. The
following are definitions of major vulnerabilities:
•

Affect user's asset safety

•

Major security incidents

•

System security issues

•

System operation logic does not match the design

When the Lemo Ecology cannot meet the needs of business and users of the
participants, it is usually adopted by opinion leaders to represent the interests of
the community. After the decision-making committee has passed the decision, the
developers of the organization are responsible for the development. The development
committee completes the analysis of the code committee, tests and reviews, and
reports Prepare the way for the decision committee to iterate.

Risk statement
The LemoChain development and operations team believes that there is nothing in the
development, maintenance and operation of LemoChain.
There are a number of risks, many of which exceed the control of LemoChain's current
development and operations team which need to be considered by participants, except
for those described in this white paper
In addition to other content, each pre-sale participant of LEMO tokens should also
peruse, understand, and carefully consider the following risks before making investment
decisions.
Purchasers of LEMO tokens should pay special attention to the fact that despite the
management master developed and operated by LemoChain, which was established
in Singapore; both LemoChain and Lemo tokens exist tangibly only in cyberspace and

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

58

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

are not registered to a single country. Participating in this pre-sale should be a wellthought-out decision-making action that will be considered as participants fully aware
of and agreeing to accept.
The following risks:
1）Termination of Presale Plan
The LEMO token Pre-sale Plan may be terminated prematurely, at which point the
participant may be subject to the fluctuations in price of Bitcoin/Ethereum. As a
consequence of the fluctuations in the market and the expenses of LemoChain's
development and operations team, investment amounts may only be partly refunded.
2）nsufficient information provision
As of the publication date of this white paper, LemoChain is still in the development
phase. Its philosophy, consensus mechanism, algorithm, generation codes as well
as other technical details and parameters may be updated and changed frequently.
Although this white paper contains LemoChain’s latest key information, it is not
absolutely complete, and will still be used by LemoChain's development and operations
team for specific purposes to make adjustments from time to time.
LemoChain’s development and operations team is incapable of, and has no obligation
to inform participants at any time; every necessary detail of LemoChain’s development
(including its progress and expected milestones, whether or not postponed) will be
published, so there is no need for communication.
However, the pre-sale participants will promptly and fully reach out to the information
released by LemoChain from time to time. Information disclosure is not fully
unavoidable and reasonable.
3）Regulatory Measure
Encrypted tokens are being or may be supervised by the authorities of various
countries.

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

Any risk factors disclosed in this white paper, as well as those associated with such
risk factors, resulting or consequential damage, loss, claims, liability, penalties, costs,
or other negative effects.
The team may from time to time receive enquiries, notices, warnings, orders or rulings
from one or more authorities, or even may be ordered to suspend or terminate any
action regarding this pre-sale plan, LemoChain development or LEMO tokens.
LemoChain’s development, marketing, promotion or other aspects as well as this presale program may be seriously affected blocked or terminated. Since the regulatory
policy may change at any time, the existing LemoChain project or the regulatory
approval/tolerance of pre-sale plans may only be temporary.
LEMO tokens may be defined differently at any time in different countries as virtual
goods, digital assets and even securities or currencies, so in some countries, according
to local regulatory requirements, LEMO may be prohibited from trading or holding.
4）Cryptography
Cryptography is constantly evolving and it cannot guarantee absolute security at all
times. Advances in cryptography (eg password cracking) or technological advances
(such as the invention of quantum computers) may present threats to cryptographybased systems (including LemoChain) This may result in the theft, disappearance,
destruction, or devaluation of any held LEMO token.
In a reasonable range, internally, the LemoChain development and operations team will
prepare itself to take preventive or remedial measures to upgrade the foundations of
LemoChain.
Agreeing to respond to any advances in cryptography and, where appropriate,
incorporate new and reasonable security measures for cryptography and security.
5）Development Failure or Abandonment
LemoChain is still in the development phase, and does not have the ready-to-release
finished product. With the technical complexity of an ecosystem like LemoChain, the

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

60

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

development and operations team may face unpredictable and/or insurmountable
difficulties from time to time. Therefore, the development of LemoChain may fail or
be abandoned at any time for any reason (e.g. due to lack of funding or development
failure) This will result in Lemo tokens not being delivered to any participants in this
pre-sale program.
6）Theft of Crowdfunding Funds
There may be attempts to steal the pre-sale cryptocurrency tokens received by the
LemoChain platform. Theft or stealing attempts may affect LemoChain's development
and operations team's ability to fund the development of the project. Despite
LemoChain’s development and operations team adopting cutting-edge technology
solutions to protect the security of pre-sale funds, hacking and theft of funds is never
fully preventable.
7）Source Code
No one can guarantee that LemoChain's source code is completely flawless. Code may
have certain flaws, errors, bugs, and vulnerabilities that may make it impossible for
users to use specific features, expose user information, or create other problems. If
this is the case, it will impair the usability, stability and/or security of LemoChain and
therefore have a negative impact on the value of LEMO tokens.
8）Security Weaknesses
The LemoChain block chain code is open sourced. Although the LemoChain
development and operations team works hard to maintain system security, anyone may
intentionally or unintentionally bring vulnerabilities or defects into LemoChain's core
infrastructure elements, which LemoChain’s development and operations teams cannot
implement sufficient security measures to prevent or make up. This may eventually
result in the loss of participants' Lemo tokens or other digital tokens.
9）Distributed Denial of Service Attack
Ethereum publishing their founding tokens was designed as an open and unlicensed
account. Therefore, Ethereum may suffer from time to time from "Distributed Denial

of Service" cyber attacks, which will negatively impact, stagnate, or paralyze the Lemo
token system.
As a result, transactions on top of this are delayed or written into blocks in the
Ethereum blockchain, or are even temporarily unavailable.
10） Insufficient Processing Capacity
The rapid development of LemoChain will be accompanied by a sharp increase in
trading volume and subsequent increased demand for processing capacity. If the
processing capacity demand exceeds the load that can be provided by the nodes within
the blockchain network, the LemoChain network may falsify or stagnate. Resultantly,
fraudulent or erroneous transactions such as "double spending" may occur. In the worst
cases, anyone holding LEMO Tokens may lose them potentially triggering an Ethereum
network rollback or even a hard fork. The aftermath of these events will damage the
usability, stability and security of LemoChain and the value of LEMO tokens.
11）Unauthorized Claim for Sale of Lemo Tokens
Any person who obtains the token holder's registered email or account access rights
by decrypting or cracking the LEMO token holder's password will be able to maliciously
obtain pre-acquisition from LEMO token holders. Accordingly, LEMO tokens obtained
by the holder may be mistakenly sent to anyone who claims LEMO tokens through
the holder's registered email or registered account, and such sending is irrevocable
and irreversible. Each Lemo token pre-sale participant shall take measures such as
those below to properly maintain the security of his/her registered email or registered
account:
(i)

Use high security passwords;

(ii)

Does not open or reply to any fraudulent emails;

(iii)

Strict confidentiality of or personal information.

12） Lemo Token Wallet Private Key
Loss or corruption of private keys necessary to obtain LEMO tokens is irreversible.
LEMO tokens can only be manipulated using a local or online LEMO token wallet with

White Paper v2.2 Simplified English

62

LemoChain

Decentralized Business Data
Circulation Infrastructure

a unique public and private key. Each pre-sale participant should properly protect
his/her LEMO token wallet private key. If the LEMO token holder’s private key is lost,
lost, leaked, damaged or stolen, neither the LemoChain development and operations
team nor any other person can help the holder to obtain or retrieve the relevant LEMO
tokens.
13）Popularity
The value of Lemo tokens largely depends on the popularity of the LemoChain
platform. LemoChain does not expect immense popularity, or common use within a
very short period of time after the release. In the worst case, LemoChain even may be
marginalized for a long period of time, attracting only a small group of users.
In contrast, a large part of LEMO token demand may become speculative in nature.
Lack of users may lead to an increase in price fluctuations in the Lemo token market
and thus affect LemoChain's flood season development of. When this price fluctuation
occurs, the LemoChain development and operations team will not (and take no
responsibility for) stabilize or influence the market price of LEMO tokens.
14）Price fluctuations
If you trade in the open market, encrypted tokens usually have sharp price fluctuations.
In the short term, price shocks often occur. The price may be quoted in Bitcoin,
Ethereum, U.S. Dollars, or other legal currency. This price volatility may be caused
by market forces (including speculative trading), changes in regulatory policies,
technological innovations, the availability of exchanges, and other objective factors,
which also reflect changes in the supply-demand balance. Regardless of whether or
not there is a secondary market for LEMO token trading, the LemoChain development
and operations team is not responsible for LEMO token transactions in any secondary
market. Therefore, the LemoChain development and operations team has no obligation
to stabilize the LEMO token's price fluctuations. The risk involved in the transaction
price of LEMO tokens must be borne by LEMO token holders.
