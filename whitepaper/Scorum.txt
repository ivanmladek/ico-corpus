Introduction
In their report, Nielsen notes that the sports media landscape is as fragmented
as ever, with content being consumed from a wide variety of devices. While
passionate fans are eager to engage with sports media from all angles,
established media corporations are struggling to present their content in line with
the rapid pace of technological advancement. In this respect, blockchain
technology can take the sports media industry to a new level. We are excited to
introduce an innovative sports media platform with its own internal economy
based on free market principles – Scorum.
Scorum is a blockchain powered sports media that rewards its active users.
Authors get rewarded for adding their publications, comments and photos while
readers gain by casting their votes for quality content.
Scorum’s economic model is based on principles that strive to ensure its
cryptocurrency is supported with the real economy and the beneﬁts are allocated
fairly among all the system’s participants.
The project team has already developed a working prototype of Scorum's
statistical center, and our partners and industry experts made it possible for us to
formulate an optimal product roadmap for the Scorum platform.
To ﬁnance further development of the platform and distribute tokens to future
users, Scorum offers Scorum Coins (SCR) cryptocurrency during the Token
Crowdsale.

Fundamental Principles
Our Mission
Our mission is to jump-start the sports media evolution and enable Scorum
community members to be fairly rewarded for sharing their passion for sports.
This concept stands in stark contrast with the way traditional media businesses
operate.
Scorum is the ﬁrst blockchain-powered sports media platform. We aim to ﬁrmly
establish ourselves in this niche and ensure stable development of our platform.
We estimate the potential global audience size for the Scorum platform to be 1
billion users aged 18 to 40.
To maximize audience engagement, maintain high content quality and establish
an active sports enthusiast community, Scorum offers the following beneﬁts:
1.

A fair internal economic model based on blockchain technology.

2.

Built-in instruments for authors (interactive visualization tools, photo
database, advanced sports analytics).

3.

Fully featured statistical centers for various sports.

4.

Commission-free betting exchange.

5.

In-house sports experts who ensure high quality of the sports analytics
data.

Given the platform’s unique value proposition, Scorum believes it has what it
takes to become a cutting-edge media source at the heart of which lies passion
for sports.

Functionality Overview
Functionality-wise, Scorum is a new-generation sports media source that
features:
● sports content optimised blogging platform
● statistics center with integrated services and live streams
● commission-free fantasy sports platform
● commission-free betting exchange
We’ve already developed the beta version of Scorum’s statistics center; upon
which we will base the functionality of other services within the platform,
including the betting exchange and data visualization tools for bloggers.
The fantasy sports platform prototype is almost ready. Its users will ﬁnally be
able to play for tokens.
At the moment, we are also developing special analytics tools for authors using
the BI-based services already integrated into the statistics center.
Thanks to our decision to start product development with Scorum’s statistics
center, we have already received positive feedback about our platform from both
sports enthusiasts and professionals.
In other words, our team at Scorum is well on its way to transforming these beta
features into a fully functional platform. As we develop Scorum, we will continue
focusing on the needs of the sports community as a whole as well as its speciﬁc
segments.

Reward System
By using Blockchain technology as the platform’s foundation, we were able to
create a transparent and reliable reward system for Scorum authors and active
platform members.
To implement this functionality, we issue Scorum Coins (SCR) cryptocurrency
and Scorum Power (SP) tokens.

Built-in Instruments for Authors
The Scorum blogging platform makes it easy for content creators to design
engaging and visually appealing content, which in turn allows authors to focus
their effort on writing quality publications about sports.
Aside from the simple yet feature-rich editing tools, we have developed custom
solutions for sports writers:
1.

Widgets displaying statistics center data which can be incorporated into
publications with just a few clicks.

2.

Built-in photo database where authors can get quality images for their
publications.

3.

Sports analytics tools which allow content creators to quickly create
interactive data visuals.

We are developing Scorum’s features with the focus on sports media audience
interests which allows us to preserve the platform’s ease of use while
maintaining its high level of functionality.

Statistics Center
The statistics center provides users with information about various kinds of
sports as well as match results, statistical data, player and team proﬁles, and live
match broadcasts. Users will also be able to purchase sporting goods and
services like event tickets from our partners.
For authors the statistics center offers a new generation of sports analytics
tools that enable content writers to create interactive visuals with the help of the
center’s built-in BI services. Services such as forecasting system, sports texts
analysis, sports chat bots and more will also be available within the statistics
center.
Within Scorum’s partner programs we have already integrated Microsoft’s Power
BI and are planning to add similar services from Google and IBM in the future.

Fantasy Sports Integration
The Scorum platform is excited to offer commission-free fantasy sports league
integration within the project.
As FSAT estimates that, in the US and Canada this year one in ﬁve people actively
took part in fantasy sports for a total of almost 60 million participants. This is up
from 32 million in 2010 with participation data showing consistent growth year
over year since 2003.
Of these players, over one-third were teenagers and the average age of fantasy
sports participants is 38 years old. Players over the age of 18 spend an average
of $556 dollars per year to participate in fantasy sports.
All of this interest in fantasy sports competition drives further engagement with
sports media with nearly two-thirds of fantasy players saying that they watch
more live sports and read more sports coverage as a result of their participation
in fantasy leagues.

Commission-free Betting Exchange
Scorum's commission-free sports betting exchange is fully capable of potentially
replacing traditional betting platforms. Within Scorum, users can quickly and
easily bet against each other without having to pay any commission or extra
fees.
It’s worth noting that the betting exchange is not a source of income for the
Scorum platform and acts solely as a marketing tool. Furthermore, Scorum
provides the betting exchange for entertainment value only as a game of skill for
it users. The betting exchange shall not be accessible in jurisdictions where it
may be prohibited or require further licensing under such jurisdiction’s online
gambling laws. Based on data cited by the BBC, the potential market volume for
the cryptocurrency sports betting market exceeds 1 trillion USD.
Due to the uncertain state of regulation on a global scale in the ﬁeld of virtual
token betting, we cannot guarantee the legality of Scorum betting exchange
platform or ability to structure and license our future betting exchange platform
in any given jurisdiction. However, we strive to be a responsive and compliant
company should we face any regulatory inquiry.

Basics of Scorum Economic
Model
Scorum’s economic model is based on the following principles:
1.

Cryptocurrency needs to be supported by the real economy.

2.

All the active participants must beneﬁt.

3.

Income distribution should be objective and fair and controlled by the user
community.

At the moment, there are three planned stable revenue sources:
1.

Internal pay-per-click advertising. Content authors will be able to use it to
promote the content they create.

2.

Partner programs. Within the platform, users will be able to buy various
sports products from our partners:
●

Live broadcasts of sporting events.

●

Event tickets.

●

Sports merchandise.

●

Other sporting goods.
These sporting goods and services will be sold at a discount when
purchased with Scorum Coins instead of other currencies.

19

Scorum White Paper

www.scorumcoins.com

Photo database. Authors will be able to use photos for their publications
from the large built-in photo database. 10% of the photo’s value goes to
Scorum.

To learn more about income distribution at Scorum, please read the “SCR
Distribution from Scorum Revenue” section.
The mathematical payout allocation and distribution model is available on
Google Sheets.

Scorum Tokens
To ensure proper functioning of the Scorum economy, we are issuing the Scorum
Coins (SCR) cryptocurrency and the Scorum Power (SP) internal token.
Scorum Coin (SCR) is planned to operate on the Scorum platform. It can also be
transferred to other users. These are the tokens that will be available for
purchase during the Token Crowdsale.
Scorum Power (SP) is an internal token that needed to enable technical
interactions between the system’s users. SP value is directly proportional at 1:1
ratio to SCR.

Using Scorum Coins
SCR may be used within the Scorum platform in the following ways:
1.

SCR owners can purchase partner products and services using SCR (see the
“Basics of Scorum Economic Model” section).

2.

SCR can be used to pay for in-platform ads (see the “Basics of Scorum
Economic Model” section).
20

Scorum White Paper

3.

www.scorumcoins.com

SCR can be used at the integrated commission-free sport betting exchange.
According to data cited by the BBC, the size of the ﬁat sports betting market
reached the 1 trillion USD mark 4 years ago. It is difﬁcult to obtain more
accurate data because of the large number of market players and its nontransparent economy. However large its size today, it is plausible to assume
that all the ﬁat money of the sports betting industry will migrate into
commission-free solutions which can only be implemented using blockchain
technology. Scorum is aiming to dominate this market niche.

4.

SCR can be purchased on the Scorum website. To ensure that buying SCR is
quick and easy, our platform will function as an intermediary between users
and cryptocurrency exchanges. The option to buy SCR on the Scorum
website will provide an additional revenue stream for Scorum and will have a
positive effect on SCR usability.

Using Scorum Power
SP tokens can only be used inside the Scorum platform. They are needed to
ensure technical interactions between system users and to allocate rewards to
users including the Bounty Program rewards.
Owning SP has the following advantages:
●

The more SP, the higher the probability to get the delegate status and have
an impact on Scorum’s project development.

●

The more SP, the more inﬂuence the user’s opinion has within the project
(Voting Power).

●

The more SP, the larger the share in the reward pool for owning SP.

21

Scorum White Paper

www.scorumcoins.com

Users can get Scorum Power for registering on the platform as well as creating
content, voting and signing blocks.
For more information about ways to get SP, please see the “SP Emission and
Distribution” section.
In order to prevent SP’s entering the exchanges and to protect the system’s
integrity, it will not be possible to transfer SP between users.
Therefore, only SCR tokens will be available at the exchanges (see “SCR > SP >
SCR Conversion” section)

SCR > SP > SCR Conversion
At the Scorum platform, the SCR-to-SP exchange happens immediately.
It is also possible to exchange SP into SCR in equal shares within 12 months
after conversion process activation (this time frame can later be changed by the
delegates). This measure is aimed at protecting token holders’ interests.
SP > SCR conversion will be available only after adding the internal advertising
into the platform. This measure is aimed at supporting the SCR exchange rate by
increasing the demand for the tokens from the side of advertisers.

SCR Emission and Distribution
To ﬁnance further development of the platform, Scorum is issuing Scorum Coins
(SCR) cryptocurrency and putting it up for sale to token purchasers during the
Token Crowdsale. A ﬁnite amount of SCR and SP tokens will be issued.
Scorum Coins cryptocurrency totalling 20M is created and sold as part of the
Token Crowdsale:

22

Scorum White Paper

●

www.scorumcoins.com

18.6M SCR are put on sale and used for creation and development of the
Scorum project.

●

930K SCR are distributed as part of Token Crowdsale Afﬁliate Program.

●

470K SCR are distributed on a long-term basis among Scorum team as
incentive bonuses.

Afterwards, SCR can be produced only by means of SP > SCR conversion. All the
SCR tokens unsold during Token Crowdsale will be converted into SP. Throughout
the year, all the received tokens will be converted into SCR, sold at the exchange
and used for Scorum product development.

Token Crowdsale Summary
Token distribution
20M SCR are distributed during the Token Crowdsale in the following stages:
1.

1 600 000 SCR at a rate of 1 SCR = 0.5 USD (ﬁat currency equivalents here
and throughout are provided for informational purposes only; no ﬁat
currency will be accepted in the Token Crowdsale). Total for 800K USD —
50% discount from nominal value.

2.

2 000 000 SCR at a rate of 1 SCR = 0.75 USD. Total for 1.5M USD — 25%
discount from nominal value.

3.

3 000 000 SCR at a rate of 1 SCR = 0.9 USD. Total for 2.7M USD — 10%
discount from nominal value.

4.

12 000 000 SCR at a rate of 1 SCR = 1 USD. Total for 12M USD — nominal
value.

Scorum White Paper

Funds allocation
1.

65% of the raised funds go towards the development. Most of the functions
of Scorum will be implemented within the ﬁrst year, but they will require
continued reﬁnement and development as the platform grows in popularity
and expands to cover all major sports. Much of the initial development
funds will be spent on establishing contracts with statistics providers so
that our statistics center have the latest in-depth sports data for Scorum
users to access.
Integrating and expanding Scorum as a competitor in the US sports media
industry will require signiﬁcant funds to tailor the design of the platform to
ﬁt the needs and interests of each unique fan community.

2.

20% will be dedicated to marketing. As a direct way to get connected to the
widest audience of sports fans, Scorum will use professional athlete
promotion of the project through its ambassador program.
Scorum’s blogging platform will provide a direct connection from athletes to
their supporters and the partner programs will give the fans exclusive deals
to buy merchandise endorsed by their favorite athletes.
Scorum ambassadors will make use of a variety of promotional strategies to
incentivize fan participation in Scorum including:
●

Autographed jersey and merchandise giveaways

●

Event ticket lotteries with a chance to meet and chat with Scorum
ambassadors

●

Live online chats with athletes through Scorum’s platform

●

Personal blog posts and updates on Scorum
24

Scorum White Paper

●

www.scorumcoins.com

Active users and fans will get to meet and greet ambassadors at
Scorum Fest and other regional meet-ups.

3.

15% is set aside for legal support, as the international and local regulations
around cryptocurrency based projects are in an ever state of change.
For local and European regulatory advice, we rely on Revera, a top business
law ﬁrm with 18 years of experience working with over 3000 international
clients.
We also cooperated with Velton-Zegelman PC, based in San Francisco. Their
ﬁrm has years of experience guiding tech start-ups to navigate the
international regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Julian Zegelman,
partner of the company, has also entered our advisory board.
According to the Velton-Zegelman PC resolution, Scorum’s liquid
cryptocurrency has met the requirements of a utility token according to the
Howey test (see the resolution here). So US citizens are allowed to
participate.

Scorum Team Incentive Program
470K SCR are emitted in order to motivate the employees of the company. These
tokens will be paid as bonuses in addition to salaries until the allocated sum is
fully paid out.

Token Crowdsale Afﬁliate Program
930K SCR are available for afﬁliates who help attract token purchasers for the
Token Crowdsale.
Every afﬁliate that participates in the program has its unique referral code (the
link with the code is available in users’ personal account on the Scorum Token
25

Scorum White Paper

www.scorumcoins.com

Crowdsale website) which can be used to track Scorum Coins buyers. The
afﬁliate will receive 5% SCR based on the amount of SCR their referral links
generate.
For example, an afﬁliate placed the link on social networks. A certain number of
token purchasers went via this link to buy 1000 SCR. Thus the afﬁliate will get 50
SCR.
Tokens not distributed via this program will be destroyed.

SP Emission and Distribution: 10M Bounty
Program
Scorum Power Tokens will be emitted in the course of user registration. A
maximum of 10M SP will be issued. The nominal value of 1 SP = 1 SCR = 1 USD.
Scorum Power tokens will be distributed as part of the Bounty program.
Scorum Power Distribution:
●

2.1M SP— registration bonuses

●

3.84M SP — bonuses for voting and commenting

●

3M SP — to founders

●

0.1M SP — to Steemit users

●

0.48M SP — to witnesses (users signing blocks)

●

0.48M SP — to active SP holders

As all the rewards from the bounty program are paid in SP tokens, the
conversion of which into SCR will be delayed, new SCR are expected to appear on

the market in small quantities and will be directly dependent on project’s
popularity.
The system is secured against falsiﬁed registrations and other attacks thanks to
the following mechanisms:
1.

Gradual SP burning in case of user inactivity.

2.

Delayed SP > SCR conversion.

SCR Distribution from Scorum
Revenue
SCR tokens are distributed from Scorum revenue according to the following
principles:
1.

Internal advertising.
a.

50% of revenue is distributed in SCR among users.

i.

ii.

40% goes to SCR activity reward pool.
●

30% goes toward rewarding content creators.

●

10% goes to voting users.

5% is paid out to active SP owners (i.e., SP owners, who actively
participate in voting as measured by having less than 100% VP) in
proportion to their SP account balance.

iii. 5% is distributed among witnesses (users who sign blocks).
b.

2.

50% of the revenue goes to support and develop the product, namely,
towards the company’s R&D center.

Partner programs. Scorum will offer a discount to all users who choose to
make payments within the platform using SCR. The discount amount will
depend on conditions negotiated with Scorum partners.

3.

Photo database. 80% of the photo’s value will go to its author. 10% goes to
the photographer reward pool and the remaining 10% goes to Scorum.

Scorum White Paper

SCR Activity Reward Pool
Scorum rewards its active users for creating and engaging with platform content.
40% of Scorum’s advertising revenue go to SCR activity reward pool. This amount
is distributed among authors of publications and readers who evaluate content
by voting for it. Each user can cast their vote for publications and comments on
Scorum’s blogging platform as well as vote for comments within the statistical
center.

Voting Power (VP)
Each user has a dynamic parameter Voting Power (VP) which gets spent during
voting and gets fully recovered within 120 hours (5 days). The maximum VP
value is equal to the user’s current amount of SP.
With each vote, up to 5% of the remaining Voting Power is spent. The more often
the user votes, the less power each vote has as VP does not have enough time to
recover.
The more VP a post or a comment gets, the higher the payout, which is
distributed between the post’s author, commentary creator, photographer as well
as the users who voted for it.
Reward distribution depends on the following factors:
1.

VP of the voter that is given for the post. The more VP given for a post, the
higher the payout.

2.

Sequence. Users that voted earlier get paid at a higher payout rate.

3.

Time from the moment of publication.
●

The later the voting happens, the smaller the payout.
31

Scorum White Paper

●

www.scorumcoins.com

In order to protect the system from spam voting, we implement the
following system: during the ﬁrst 30 minutes after publishing a post or
a comment, a portion of the voters’ rewards goes to the content
creator. If a vote or comment comes within the ﬁrst minute of content
publication, 100% of rewards will go to the author. This percentage will
gradually go down to 0% by the 30th minute.
For example, if a vote comes in on the 15th minute after publishing, 50%
of the rewards will go to the post’s author. If users consider the post
trendy and valuable, they should share a portion of their earnings and
cast their vote earlier in order to keep their VP high.

Publication Statuses
Scorum publications are categorized into three statuses:
1.

New. No one has voted for a publication and no more than 12 hours have
passed from the moment of its creation. Publication does not get any
rewards.

2.

Active. From the moment the ﬁrst vote has been cast, the post will remain
active for 7 days and receives payouts from the SP and SCR activity reward
pools.

3.

Archive. If a publication has not received any votes for 12 hours, OR if 7
days have passed since the moment of its activation, the publication moves
into an inactive state and does not participate in the reward distribution.

Each user gives a part of their Voting Power at the moment of voting. During its
active state, a post accrues Voting Power and participates in the reward
allocation process from the SCR activity reward pool. The tokens from pools are
distributed once per minute. The more Voting Power a post gets, the bigger its
32

Scorum White Paper

www.scorumcoins.com

reward share which gets distributed from the SCR activity reward pool. Only
active posts participate in the reward distribution process.

Activity Reward Distribution
At Scorum, users get rewarded for being active on the platform: from post
authors to commenters to users who cast their votes for posts.
The special feature in the comment reward system at Scorum is that 50% of
commenting rewards for posts goes to the original post or comment. This way
authors of interesting content get extra rewards if their post spurs lively
discussions. This commenting reward hierarchy is preserved up to the 6th level.
Scorum has developed an analogous reward system for comments left for
entities within the statistics center (players, judges, coaches, clubs, leagues
etc.). Comment authors get rewarded as well as all the veriﬁed entities within the
statistics center. It’s important to note that Scorum will administer payouts only
to veriﬁed entities in the statistics center. If an entity is not veriﬁed, the tokens are
kept on their accounts until the veriﬁcation process is complete. Such system
allows Scorum to involve sports industry professionals in the project.
Publication author gets:
●

75% from the publication payout sum.

●

50% from the payout sum allocated for all authors of comments of the 1st
level.

●

25% from the payout sum allocated for all authors of comments of the 2nd
level.

And so forth until the comments of the 6th level inclusive.

Photographers Reward Pool
The photographer reward pool is continuously replenished with SCR in
accordance with the Scorum Revenue Distribution mechanism. The pool’s
resources are distributed monthly among authors of the photographs that were
used in publications and/or comments. The success (in Voting Power) of the
publication or comment also plays a role. Authors can put their best pictures in
separate posts and participate in their promotion, thereby inﬂuencing the reward
distribution in two reward pools: for submitting a photograph and for activity as
an author of the publication.

Technical Overview
There are three technical blockchain components that make up the Scorum
sports media platform: the blockchain protocol, Web infrastructure and data
analytics services.

Blockchain Protocol
The blockchain protocol is the most essential part of the Scorum project. Any
public blockchain must contain economic stimuli aimed at rewarding those
project participants that support the protocol as well as penalties for those who
try to compromise it.
Because of the the technical complexity of modeling and development of the
unique economic system of the Scorum blockchain protocol, we have decided to
rely on ready-made solutions whenever possible. Many of the technical
components of blockchain models similar to Scorum have already been
developed and successfully used in other projects. We have picked what we
believe to be the best blockchain solutions available and applied them to the
development of Scorum.
The Graphene framework is used to develop the blockchain protocol for Scorum.
This solution has already proved itself both reliable and highly capable in such
successful blockchain projects as Bitshares, Steemit, and Golos.
The Scorum blockchain uses the DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) consensus
algorithm. The key advantage of this algorithm is its high-trafﬁc network capacity
of up to 10 000 transactions per second. Such performance is made possible
thanks to a combination of several factors:

36

Scorum White Paper

www.scorumcoins.com

1.

The schedule for the nodes signing blocks is known ahead of time.

2.

Effective transaction processing in each node.

3.

All data necessary for validating transactions is stored in the memory.

At Scorum blockchain, production of new blocks is made by delegates and takes
place according to the schedule made for the following round. The schedule for
each round is made according to the protocol. More speciﬁcally, 21 delegates are
chosen who will be signing the blocks. 20 of them are chosen according to user
votes. 1 of them is selected from the delegate queue; the delegate with the
largest number of Scorum Power tokens gets chosen for the upcoming block
signing round. Each user can participate in block signing thereby playing an
active role in the decision making process of what type of information becomes
part of the Scorum blockchain.
In order to make it to the list of 21 delegates chosen to sign blocks for the
following round, a user needs to either become one of the top 20 most popular
candidates according to user votes OR buy a sufﬁcient amount of Scorum Power
and wait for their turn in the queue among all the remaining candidates that didn’t
make it to the top-20 list.
Block production synchronization among delegates (witnesses) is carried out
according to the NTP protocol which is being used successfully in other
blockchain systems (Bitshares, Steemit and Golos).
In order to provide users with an opportunity to perform transactions within the
Scorum blockchain network without having to spend their resources, we came up
with the free transaction model for the platform which is made possible by the
system dynamically calculating bandwidth capacity of each user.
Blockchain protocol is a set of technology solutions responsible for both
development and proper execution of user interaction protocol inside a
37

Scorum White Paper

specialized p2p network. Blockchain also develops protocol rules and makes
sure they are executed by a client supporting the protocol. In this case, the client
is a cross-platform application with an open source code publicly available for
analysis and use by any interested parties.
To make the Scorum blockchain deployment process more convenient, we
provide each new protocol version as a Docker image which allows us to avoid
the peculiarities of various operating systems and environments. This in turn
allows our users to easily utilize the client, which is especially important for
delegates who need to keep the nodes active within the network in order to take
part in block production rounds. These Docker images of public nodes are also
deeply integrated into the system of continuous Web infrastructure expansion of
the Scorum platform.

Web Infrastructure
A console application is sufﬁcient for interacting with the blockchain Scorum
node. However, manual formatting and sending of the transaction in accordance
with the protocol is far from user-friendly. That’s why developing a convenient
and secure user interface is one of our key development objectives.
To allow for seamless and quick access to Scorum web interface, we will create
a cluster of various containers within the Windows Azure cloud.
●

We use Azure Container Service to expand, support and orchestrate the
Docker-container cluster with Scorum blockchain nodes. This highly reliable
solution allows us to ensure availability even during peak load times as well
as ﬂexibly scale the cluster depending on incoming request volume.

●

Azure Search allows Scorum users to effectively search through the content
found on Scorum blockchain. To do this, we keep an eye on all the notes
located in the blockchain and create indexes for them in Azure Search. Such
38

Scorum White Paper

www.scorumcoins.com

indexing allows us to provide users with the most relevant search results
considering such criteria as user language and variability of the searched
phrase.
●

We use Azure Content Delivery Network to allow users to load pages
immediately, regardless of where they are in the world.

Justiﬁcation for The Models
Used
Two fully functional products built using Blockchain technology, Steemit and
Golos, with the blogging components analogous to Scorum, have already
demonstrated their market success.
According to CoinMarketCap, as of September, 2017, Steem is one of the top 20
largest cryptocurrencies with market capitalization reaching $315M USD. While
Golos, in its turn, is a successful localized version of Steemit demonstrating
dynamic growth.
We have taken certain elements from these projects and applied them to
Scorum. Namely:
1.

The general idea of income distribution among users.

2.

A fair payout distribution model.

3.

Technical components of the platform, particularly the DPoS consensus.

At the same time, we have signiﬁcantly improved and adapted the above models
to the needs of the sports industry and have greatly enhanced the economic
component of the platform:
39

Scorum White Paper

1.

www.scorumcoins.com

Introducing advertising inside the platform. Striving to create a sustainable
ecosystem at Scorum, we have introduced an option to purchase advertising
in SCR with prices starting at lower rate than the market average. This
measure is aimed at protecting the SCR exchange rate from volatility.

2.

Additional opportunities to use SCR which is expected to help further
increase token value.

3.

Finite SCR and SP emission which increases SCR value.

4.

Economically viable existence of the R&D center which is supported by
stable sources of income (see the "Basics of Scorum Economic Model" for
details).

5.

Operating costs to support the Scorum ecosystem are substantially
decreased as the R&D center is located in Minsk, Belarus, where it is
possible to create technology products of the highest quality at low prices.

Reasons to Participate in the
Scorum Token Crowdsale
Compared to traditional sports media, the Scorum project offers sports fans a
multitude of beneﬁts. Our unique value proposition will lead to large sports
audiences choosing our platform over the established media, which is expected
to result in quick Scorum tokens distribution. In turn, the economy of the Scorum
project is based on a stable monetization system which gives SCR real value.
Here are the deﬁning factors that make SCR cryptocurrency attractive to token
purchasers:
1.

Favorable conditions to forecast SCR value and utility.
40

Scorum White Paper

●

www.scorumcoins.com

Extensive sports betting market. According to data cited by the BBC,
the ﬁat betting market is valued at 1 trillion USD. This money is
allocated among traditional sports betting platforms where
commission fees can be as high as 10%. We can assume that users
will migrate away from traditional venues and towards commissionfree projects. Thanks to blockchain technology, Scorum allows its
users to make commission-free bets.

●

After launching CPC advertising system nominal value of one click on
the Scorum platform will be 0.01 USD, whereas other trafﬁc providers
charge as much as 50 USD per click (the data can be veriﬁed via
Google Adwords). This will signiﬁcantly increase the platform’s
attractiveness for advertisers and leads to an increased demand for
SCR.

●

Discounts for our partners’ sporting goods and services offered to
those users who choose to pay for them in SCR, which further
increases the demand for SCR tokens.

2.

According to 2016 estimates by the University of Cambridge, the number of
cryptocurrency holders had reached 5.8M. However high the number may be
today, Scorum has potential to expand cryptocurrency user audience up to
1 billion people by providing inherent advantages for its users:
●

Users can easily enjoy taking part in Scorum's cryptocurrency economy
which rewards their everyday interests with tangible and
straightforward beneﬁts.

●

Minimal barriers to entry: user becomes Scorum Power owner right
after registering at Scorum.

Conclusion
Thanks to the blockchain technology and a stable internal economy, Scorum
creates a favorable system to satisfy sports enthusiasts’ and professionals’ key
needs. All this makes the project attractive for both users and token purchasers.
