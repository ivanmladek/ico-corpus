I N TRODUCT ION

EPLUS Coin is a worldwide entertainment
based cryptocurrency. It is a digital
payment system called decentralized
digital currency because it works without
a central repository or a single
administrator. EPLUS Coin was created by
EPLUS Coin Technologies Ltd. in 2017,
which is comprised of experienced
programmers and was released as an
open-source software in 2017. The system
and its transactions are on a peer-to-peer
basis.
Besides its creation as a reward for
mining, EPLUS Coin can be exchanged to
other digital currencies, in-game items
and other entertainment services in legal
markets.

EPLUS COIN ’S VALUE

With EPLUS Coin, enjoy a spike in price against
government currencies. There are a lot of talks
about this on the Internet. If you are not familiar
with it yet, here is a good EPLUS Coin introduction.
You need to read a lot more before acquiring EPLUS
Coins as it may fail. If you like EPLUS Coin and
would want to buy some, don’t go all goofy.
Research. As if you need to be constantly reminded;
be careful with your money.

EPLUS C O IN’ S
VA LUE

Much of the comments declare EPLUS Coin as a
bubble for no reason. Yes, it might be a bubble but
nobody actually knows yet. A way of guessing to compare EPLUS Coin’s qualities as both a currency
and a payment network to other alternatives. Like any other services or goods, there are various
dimensions to value storage and transfer.
You may not have captured them all because they certainly do not predict the correct price against
dollars or other currencies but it will depend on the ultimate viscosity of EPLUS Coin. EPLUS Coin
certainly has a value of its kind: it may discipline fiat currencies and states that control them.

I NDIVIDUAL S
I NTEL L I GENT
EPLUS Coin is completely internet-based; it has no entities and it provides a variety of interfaces.
Whether it is a transactional transfer, E-commerce, or just a cup of coffee in a café, EPLUS Coin
can meet most of your needs.

I N CONTR OL
EPLUS Coin is a completely distributed; open sourced virtual currency with no management
center. EPLUS Coin is self-controlled; its developers cannot freely increase or decrease the
quantity of EPLUS Coin and cannot be arbitrarily created nor confiscated by anyone.

OP EN & TR ANSPAR E NT
The developers of EPLUS Coin made the greatest effort to guarantee that the system is open and
transparent. EPLUS Coin source codes are also available to the public for checking and to ensure
that there would be no possibility of fraud.

FAST I NTER NATI ONA L PAY M E NT S
Sending EPLUS Coins across borders is as easy as sending them across the street. There are no
banks that would make you wait three business days, no extra fees for international transfers
and no sending amount limit.

CHOOSE YOUR OWN FE E S
Receiving EPLUS Coins are free. Having multiple wallets lets you control fees when spending.
Most wallets have default fees but higher fees can make transaction confirmations faster.

CH OOSE YOUR OWN FEES
Receiving EPLUS Coins are free. Having multiple wallets lets you control fees when spending.
Most wallets have default fees but higher fees can make transaction confirmations faster. The
amount being transferred is unrelated to the fees; therefore, making it possible to send 100,000
or 1 EPLUS Coins for the same fee.

P R OTECTI ON AGAI N S T FRAUD
Businesses that accept credit cards or Pay-pal as modes of payment are aware of the problem
about reversing payments later. Chargeback fraud result in limited market reach and increased
prices, which in turn, penalizes customers. EPLUS Coin payments are irreversible and secured.
The cost of fraud is no longer pushed onto the shoulders of the merchants.

the PCI standard. EPLUS Coin still requires you to secure your wallet and your payment requests.
