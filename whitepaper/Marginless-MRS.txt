IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

LUKAS JONAITIS
FOUNDER & CEO

,,IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.”

Sports betting has a long-lasting history dating back to the Olympic Games which initially
took place in Greece. The process combines a desire to win with the passion for sports.
This powerful synergy has created a multibillion dollar industry with its opportunities and
quirks. Back in the times of Roman Empire betting reached incredible popularity as
crowds gambled on the outcomes of gladiators fights as well as many other sporting
events.
Though technology has evolved beyond belief, the principles of betting remain exactly as
they were thousands of years ago. In the past, it was more common to place bets against
another person face to face. This sort of betting was perhaps a bit more intense and
fueled some emotional involvement, yet it was alive and generated huge amounts of
satisfaction in case of fortunate outcomes. Marginless will bring the good old times where
individuals will have an opportunity to place a wager against other people directly on
almost any sport or other activity. Friends, colleagues and many other sports lovers will
be able to get back the control of their bets and place them against a real person.

Cleverly developed algorithms seem to rule today‘s betting industry, however, the
decentralized approach of newly forming blockchain technology based solutions will
change the way we live - making financial transactions, buying products and… betting.

At Marginless you can not only bet on sports, but create your own bets in different kind
of niches. The whole team at Marginless is ready to introduce the market leading margins
along with an incredibly user friendly platform, where all users can share their betting
insights, place bets against their friends or oppositors without being overcharged or
simply tricked. We really appreciate your support and trust.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY
Sports betting market, in general, is massive. According to different reports, there are
over a trillion USD worth of bets placed annually. In 2016 alone, legal sports betting
profits are estimated to be at over 70 billion dollars and this figureure is set to reach 90
billion dollars this year. Different kinds of ICO s (Initial Coin Offerings) are bringing
worldwide competition to the betting market, leaving regular gambling organizations in a
fear of losing clients. We, at Marginless, believe that blockchain and cryptocurrency is
ideal for betting. Having all of that in mind, here are some of the main facts about betting

Sports betting has become the fastest growing market segment within gambling
worldwide, and now dominates, accounting for nearly half of the total online market. A
fifth of sports betting takes place via mobile, and this is expected to reach 45 percent by
2018. Also, a study, which was conducted by ESPN and the Norwalk research firm
Markitecture in 2012, found that 50% of all Americans aged 16 and older have placed a
bet within 12 month period.

Studies found nearly two-thirds of people in their 20s believe sports betting to be just
another leisure activity and “no different” than buying a lottery ticket, while 41% see online
sports betting as “perfectly harmless”.

Traditional sports betting in many locales is driven underground, leading to corruption,
unfairness, and violence. Marginless offers this untapped market an opportunity to
choose a safe, private and accessible way to bet through a decentralized blockchain
technology.
A federally funded national gambling impact study reported in 1999 just as internet sports
wagering started to take off - that estimates for the overall amount bet on sports were as
high as 380 Billion a year. The study called sports betting “the most widespread and
popular form of gambling in America”.
According to Technavio media and entertainment research analysts, one of the top
trends in the global sports betting market right now is increased availability of other cash
alternatives, like cryptocurrency.

WHY BLOCKCHAIN?

With the use of blockchain, cryptocurrency provides the speed and anonymity that has
made cryptocurrency ideal for people looking to wager safely and has given sports
gamblers an alternative to traditional online books. The speed of cryptocurrency
transactions makes using cryptocurrency sportsbooks a much safer option to
everyone than traditional sportsbooks. You can deposit, wager, withdraw, and have your
money back in an immediate control.

While using the Blockchain, your transactions are fast and cheap, it will reduce high fees
and will also ensure high levels of international liquidity. Blockchain-based system is
universal and ideal for any country, so there is no need in modifying the program for
every region or in adopting specific payment methods. Use of a decentralized system
eliminates the risk of fraud on the part of sportsbooks, the risk for an account getting
blocked and problems with withdrawing funds for regular bettors. Also, blockchain
highly reduces the costs of the infrastructure. Because of that, more funds can be used
for the project’s development.

MARGINLESS SOLUTIONS TO CURRENT
INDUSTRY PROBLEMS
PROBLEM #1 - UNFAIR ODDS
One of the biggest problems that current bettors face is unfair odds. This is one of the
main reasons why most of regular bettors are struggling to become profitable. The fear
of regularly losing against bettors while also being regulated, charged and extra taxed by
governments, forces regular sports books to charge up to 8.5% margin on all placed
bets. For example, the biggest bookmakers in the world offers odds of 1.83 (on most
markets) for selections they see as a coinflip. With these odds the bettor, in order to
become or stay profitable, has to win at least 54,64% of bets placed.

Additionally, those bettors, who manage to beat these unfair margins, are being taxed by
governments.

MARGINLESS SOLUTION
Due to the fact that Marginless is operating as a peer-to-peer betting operator and does
not require huge risk management or a full traders team, bettors will have a possibility to
place bets with an industry leading 1% that will be charged from those who won only!

For example, Golden State Warriors are playing against Cleveland Cavaliers. Player A
places a bet of 100 MRS on Golden State Warriors for their win at the odds of 2.00 and
the bettor is being matched against a Player B, who is betting 100 MRS on Cleveland
Cavaliers at the odds of 2.00. Whichever team wins, the winner gets 198 MRS in return.

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

7

HOW WOULD THE NUMBERS LOOK IF YOUR CURRENT
SPORTS BOOKS USED 1% MARGIN?
Lets say you place 500 coinflip bets per year, averaging about $100 per bet.
If you win 51% (255) of these bets at 1.83 odds, your LOSS would be exactly - $3335.
If you win 51% (255) of these bets at Marginless your PROFIT would be + $490.

MARGINLESS CAN TURN LOSERS INTO WINNERS!

AND WHAT IF YOU ARE ALREADY A WINNER?
If you win 60% (300) of these bets at 1.83 odds your PROFIT would be exactly +$4900.
If you win 60% (300) of these bets at Marginless your PROFIT would be +$9400.

PROFITS OF A WINNING BETTOR WOULD BE NEARLY
DOUBLED
Also, 10% of the generated margin fees at Marginless goes to the monthly Jackpot
raffle in which every user has the chance to win!

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

8

PROBLEM #2 - LIMITATIONS FOR WINNING PLAYERS
One of the biggest problems that comes in every profitable bettors way is betting
companies not allowing to place full stakes when they can see that player is constantly
winning. Even though most of the betting companies are claiming that winners are
welcomed there, truth is that most of the time only losing players are really welcomed.
Possibility for the bookmakers to regulate your betting can be disguised by different
terms and conditions.

MARGINLESS SOLUTION
This problem is nonexistent at Marginless. Winners are truly welcomed here. Even more
- Marginless will encourage winning players to not only reach profit for themselves, but
also share their profitable strategies and insights with other users. Bettors will be
rewarded with monthly Jackpot raffle tickets for not only being active, but for reaching
different betting goals also, such as winning streaks.

PROBLEM #3 - LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

Most of the time, bookmakers leave possibilities to change your betting selections, void
your winning bets or decline your payouts. Bookmakers can void your winning bet due
to a spelling error, incorrect odds or for various other different reasons and, in most
cases, there won’t be anything you can do to get your winnings back.

MARGINLESS SOLUTION
No more worries about the bookmakers paying out your winnings. Marginless offers the
users to bet on events and celebrate winnings exactly after the finish of the event you
have wagered on.

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

9

No more waiting! After the bet is placed and accepted by our moderating staff, your and
the opposing bettors funds will be held by a contract until the event is finished. After
that, the information about the bet outcome will be automatically taken from
independent sources and once the result is confirmed, winnings will be delivered to
participant's wallets accordingly.

All of the betting information will be stored in the blockchain, which will allow users to:
Keep track of their betting history
Review previous bets
Find ways to improve your betting with our analyzing tools

PROBLEM #4 - LONG PAYOUTS

Due to the fact that regular sportsbooks require help from 3rd party companies to
transfer funds from your betting account to your bank or wallet payouts tend to take
long time. Even if your winnings are already transferred out of your betting account, the
money might not reach your bank warrant for several days, which means you cannot use
the money in that time interval. Not only that - most of the current bookmakers have
limits for how much you can withdraw at once or per day.

MARGINLESS WALLET

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

10

MARGINLESS SOLUTION
Marginless betting platform is driven by MRS Utility Tokens, which means that in the
whole betting process Fiat currency is not used at all. The use of Tokens and AltCoins as
a reward for betting gives you a complete, secure and extremely fast reward payment in
Tokens or AltCoins. Marginless tokens and the blockcain lets you confirm payouts
immediately and payouts will be processed in a couple of minutes.
Our partner’s wallet that will be integrated into platform will let you keep your betting
assets in more than 30 different AltCoins. You will have a possibility to deposit or
withdraw AltCoins as well.

PROBLEM #5 - LONG KYC PROCEDURE

Regular bookmakers have a really strict KYC procedure which can become problematic,
especially if they requested it after the bettors wish to withdraw their winnings. In most
cases, bookmakers allow users to deposit money without any restrictions or KYC
procedures, but require to complete them before you can withdraw money. It can take
days or even months until bettor manages to gather all required documents and get
them accepted, while their winnings are stuck in bookmakers wallet. Also, all of the
personal data that was sent for identification is always at risk while using regular
bookmakers - regular cyber-attacks or bookmakers sharing your data with their
partners.

MARGINLESS SOLUTION
Marginless platform works with AltCoins. Because of that our KYC procedure is really
user-friendly and simple. Our platforms solution offers a simplified registration and will
not store any of your personal information whatsoever. The network is available using
any internet connection and is not subjected for regulatory oversight.

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

PROBLEM #6 - LIMITED OPTIONS FOR BETTING ON
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS
Most of the time bookmakers from different betting organizations offer wagering
options strictly in sports, that way forgetting other popular niches that people have big
interest in. The lack for different types of betting options creates a certain barrier that
makes betting interesting for a limited sphere of people.

MARGINLESS SOLUTION
Marginless is offering a perfect solution for this well-known problem - using our platform
absolutely ANYONE can become a bookmaker and create their own bets that people can
wager in.
Using our user-friendly interface literally anyone can create their own and unique bets
where people can wager. For example, such niches like

Political elections (or politics in general)
Cryptocurrency price changes
Different cultural events

Musical or Cinema awards
Sporting events
Product releases
eSports matches and lineup speculations
And much more

error.
19. Failure to comply with any of these rules may result in the disqualification of the entry.
Marginless reserves the right to disqualify any entry at their absolute discretion.

MARGINLESS PLATFORM
BETTING EXCHANGE PLATFORM
Marginless will operate as a betting exchange platform. Platform users will be able to
place bets on offered markets with their selected odds or oppose open bets from other
users.

After a bet is placed on offered market, Marginless tokens will be reserved from the
users wallet until the bet is accepted by another user. The bet can be accepted by several
users part-by-part or by single user for full stake, which makes the wager automatically
become a Face to Face bet. When the bet is accepted, full or part stake, the specified,
amount of tokens will be deducted from your and opposing user (-s) wallet with the help
of contracts and paid out accordingly after the official result of the match is confirmed
on the platform.

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

15

You can cancel your bet or adjust it at any time until the bet is officially accepted. If the
bet is not accepted until the start of the event -reservation of tokens will be stopped and
the tokens will become usable again just after the event has started. If only one part of
your bet is opposed, for example, let’s say you stake 100 MRS (Marginless tokens) and
someone opposes for only 10 MRS, the remaining part will come back to your wallet
when the match has officially started.

For example: Let’s say you want to place a bet worth 100 MRS on Bitcoin to reach next
all-time-high before July 2018 at odds of 2.00. All you need to do is to go to the selected
market screen, select your pick, write in your odds and the preferred amount of tokens.
The 100 MRS will be reserved from your wallet and the bet will be placed on the betting
exchange where other users will be able to see it as available to lay against. If the
opposing bet is placed for exactly 100 MRS - tokens from both users wallets will be
locked by a contract and you will be both placed in to a FACE TO FACE betting interface.

FACE TO FACE BETTING
Have you ever made a bet against your friend and heard that your handshake agreement
was official enough to get your winnings, after you clearly won the bet?

Well, you will never have to be in this same situation again. Marginless is proudly
presenting unique feature - Face to Face betting, where everyone can be challenged!
Face To Face betting allows clashing users with different opinions to bet directly against
each other. You can send a bet offer to other users with a few simple clicks and after the
bet was accepted by another user - placed bets will be locked using contracts are both
of you will be placed into a Face to Face betting interface.

In this interface you will be able to chat with each other by using our unique, betting
related material. You can also offer your opponent to increase the stake or split the pot
at any given time.

After the event is finished, Marginless platform and the blockchain will ensure that the
winner gets his/her winnings instantly.

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

HYBRID ORACLE SOLUTION
Several blockchain based projects have been trying to implement decentralized Oracles
that are triggered by public voting as a solution to possible unfairness regarding bet
resolutions. However this solution is working as intended only in theory. In order to
manipulate the outcome of a certain betting contract the decentralized Oracle could be
affected by group of people or a cartel which could deliberately provide false data to
make a profit from the incorrect execution of the contract resulting from that false data.
In this solution, in order to defend their bet against an incorrect or fraudulent report by
the public, the real winner of a bet would have to up their bet by huge amounts to trigger
re-voting, which is sometimes not possible due to insufficient amount of Tokens required
to up the bet or simply not wanting to risk extra amounts to get another incorrect report.
Not only that, public confirmations tend to take days or even weeks, which would be a big
issue for regular bettors.

While taking all things into consideration Marginless decided to use Hybrid Oracle
solution that will rather rely on official market sources instead of public voting. Each
created market will have Hybrid Oracle connected to it that will query independent feeds
for the outcomes of events.

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

17

If all queries will provide same result – Hybrid Oracle will resolve the bet accordingly. If
one or more queries will return with different results – manual check-up will be required
to avoid wrong pay-outs. As an extra security measure – bettors will be notified about
the resolutions of bets in an instant manner via web or phone application. However the
funds will be released only 15 minutes after this notification. This will allow users to report
wrong outcomes, if there were any to happen.

In very rare cases where even the extra security layers are not enough and funds would
be distributed incorrectly – actual winners would be compensated from reserves fund.

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

18

LIVE CHAT
Marginless will offer a live chatting window in every upcoming betting match page. Chat
will give the users an ability to speak with bettors live. Discuss upcoming matches or just
talk generally about any topics that comes to your mind.

This way, you can communicate with like-minded people from all around the world, get
more information about different betting strategies or even make new friends. There will
be both secret and public chat options for everyone to select.

SOCIAL NETWORK INTEGRATION
We, at Marginless, believe that betting should be fun and enjoyed in a group of people
who share the same love for sports and adrenaline. That is why we see Marginless
platform as more of a social betting network for enthusiasts rather than just a simple
betting platform. Our team has years of experience working with betting and social
networking, knowing all the needs of an everyday bettor for a platform like this.

Each registered user will have a personalized page with a wide variety of betting statistics
available. Users will be able not to only track their own information on our user-friendly
system, but also, they will be able to see which leagues, sports or betting matches are the
most pro able and where the user needs to improve in order to increase his/her overall
winnings.

All of the users will have the option to make their pro es available for the public and to
share their betting insights with the community, making the platform useful even for
those who are only interested in reading expert insights or share their own. On top of that
everyone sharing their betting insights and analysis with other Marginless users will be
rewarded with Monthly Jackpot raffle tickets that can be used to win some huge prizes!
Insights from different users will be seen at the match screen, which will also feature
extensive stats for different teams, leagues and events.

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

19

MOBILE APPLICATION
Marginless application - simplest and the
safest way to bet online. Integrated social
network and Face to Face betting interface
will allow bettors to wager against friends or
other users by only having phone. Bettors
will be able to send and receive bet offers
instantly and directly from other app users.
After the offer is sent, recipient will get a
notification and will be able to choose
whether to accept the bet or to decline it. If
the offer is accepted, both users will be
placed in a unique Face to Face interface
where they will be able to track their bet
progress, chat, increase stakes or split the
pot if both parties agree. Users will be also
allowed to follow other tipsters and receive
push notifications after a certain-followed
tipster places a public bet or writes an
analysis. Web wallet functionality will be
accessible via app too.

BECOME A BOOKMAKER
Becoming a bookmaker has never been so easy! Marginless will allow bettors and
organizations to open their own betting pages under our unique “Become a bookmaker”
system that will be run with MRS Tokens. This feature will be available only for accounts
holding 250.000 MRS Tokens or more (subject to change).

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

20

Whilst a lot of bettors have the dream of becoming a bookmaker one day – currently this
dream is reachable only for very few due to platform building and maintenance costs.
Marginless is here to change that! To finally step into bookmakers’ shoes - all you need to
do is choose your markets from provided list or even create unique ones, select market
rules where needed (inclusion/exclusion of overtimes etc.), choose between riskier or
safer plans by selecting your starting margins and you are good to go!

Marginless platform will provide full events and Hybdrid Oracles integration,
risk-management and accounting services that are needed for full system usability. All of
this while charging only up to 5% (subject to change) of monthly gross profit in MRS from
profitable betting pages. All collected fees will be allocated to further system
development and maintenance costs.

In order to bet against a betting page owner, other Marginless users will need to transfer
their MRS Tokens from main wallet into betting page wallet. This process will usually take
under a minute and there will be no transfer fees.

information to potential token holders in order for them to determine whether to

in this Whitepaper shall be deemed to constitute a prospectus of any sort or a
solicitation for investment, nor does it in any way pertain to an offering or a solicitation
of an offer to buy any securities in any jurisdiction.

2. This document is not composed in accordance with, and is not subject to, laws or
regulations of any jurisdiction, which are designed to protect contributors. The product
token is not a digital currency, security, commodity, or any other kind of financial
instrument and has not been registered under the securities laws of any country,
including the securities laws of any jurisdiction in which a potential token holder is a

communications with existing and prospective customers, partners etc. In the course of

lost, corrupted, or misrepresented. The accuracy of such alternative communications
cannot be guaranteed. In the event of any conflicts or inconsistencies between suck
translations and communications and this official English language Whitepaper, the
provisions of this English language original document shall prevail.

carefully reviewed this Whitepaper and fully understands the risks, costs and benefits
associated with the purchase of MRS.

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

28

5. No information in this Whitepaper should be considered to be business, legal, financial or
tax advice regarding Marginless, the MRS, and the Marginless ICO (each as referred to in
the Whitepaper). You should consult your own legal, financial, tax or other professional
adviser regarding Marginless and their respective businesses and operations, the MRS,

period of time.

6. The purchaser of MRS undertakes that she/he understands and has experience of
cryptocurrencies, blockchain systems and services, and that she/he fully understands
the risks associated with ICO as well as the mechanism related to the use of
cryptocurrencies (incl. storage).

7. MRS token cannot be used for any purposes other than as provided in this White Paper,
including but not limited to, any investment, speculative or other financial purposes. MRS
token confers no other rights in any form, including but not limited to any ownership,
distribution (including, but not limited to, profit), redemption, liquidation, property
(including all forms of intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights, other than
those specifically set forth below. MRS do not grant their holder ownership in the
Marginless or equity in Marginless or the right to participate in the control, direction, or
decision making of Marginless. Individuals, business and other organizations shall
carefully weigh the risks, costs and benefits of acquiring MRS.

8. According to the professional opinion of our legal advisors, based on the Howey Test our
MRS should not be deemed as securities and do not need to be registered as a security.
MRS tokens are not securities.

9. You acknowledge, understand, and agree that MRS are not securities and are not
registered with any government entity as a security, and shall not be considered as such.
You acknowledge, understand, and agree that ownership of MRS does not grant you the
right to receive profits, income, or other payments or returns arising from the acquisition,
holding, management or disposal of, the exercise of, the redemption of, or the expiry of,

Marginless property, whole or in part. MRS are not official or legally binding investments
of any kind. In case of unforeseen circumstances, the objectives stated in this document
may be changed. Despite the fact that we intend to reach all goals described in this
document, all persons and parties involved in the purchase of MRS do so at their own
risk.
10. We may not be able to pay any anticipated rewards in the future. There is no assurance
that there will be sufficient engagement in the Marginless Platform such that you will
receive any financial rewards / discounts. Marginless has performed several market
studies testing the demand for the Marginless platform with relatively positive results,
Marginless platform has not been fully developed and finalized and is subject to further
changes, updates, and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes may result in
unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected appeal to users, possibly due to the
failure to meet user’s preconceived expectations based on the beta version, and hence,
impact its success. For the foregoing or any other reason, the development of the
Marginless platform and launch Marginless future business lines may not be completed
and there is no assurance that it will be launched at all. The funds raised in the ICO are
exposed to risks of theft. The Company will make every effort to ensure that the funds
will be securely held in an blockchain wallets. Notwithstanding such security measures,
there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of
hacks, sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, in the smart
contract(s) on the Ethereum or any other blockchain, or otherwise. In such event, even
if the ICO is completed, the Company may not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies
raised and Marginless may not be able to use such funds for the development of the
Marginless platform. In such case, the launch of the Marginless platform and the
structuring and licensing of the Marginless future business lines might be temporarily or
permanently curtailed.

11. Regulatory authorities are carefully scrutinizing business and operations associated
with

cryptocurrencies throughout the world, therefore

regulatory measures,

investigations, or actions may impact Marginless business and even limit or prevent it
from developing its operations in the future. All persons must be informed that
Marginless business model, the Whitepaper, or terms and conditions may change or be

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

modified due to regulatory and compliance requirements from any applicable law in any
jurisdiction. In such a case, purchasers and anyone undertaking to acquire MRS
acknowledge and understand the neither Marginless nor any of its affiliates shall be held
liable for any direct or indirect loss or damage caused by such changes.

12. In July 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission of United States of America ruled
that some tokens can be considered as securities and are thereby subject to the agency’s
regulation. Taking into consideration this, Marginless is not offering MRS to US citizens
and residents until further clarification of the regulation by Securities and other
responsible authorities.
Moreover, citizens and residents of the People’s Republic of China and South Korea
cannot participate in the pre-sale or Marginless ICO at all.

13. All MRS token orders are deemed firm and final. Only reserved MRS Tokens may be
subsequently canceled at the Client s request. The Client acknowledges that they are
fully aware that they will not be entitled to claim any full or partial reimbursement under
any circumstances whatsoever.
14. MRS will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, any failure or malfunctioning
of the Ethereum protocol may lead to the trading network of MRS not working as
expected.
15. Additionally, in a down-cycle economic environment, Marginless may experience the
negative effects of a slowdown in trading and usage of the Marginless platform and may
delay or cancel the structuring and launch of the anticipated Marginless future business
lines.

16. To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable laws, regulations and rules,
Marginless shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other
losses of any kind, in tort, contract or otherwise (including but not limited to loss of
revenue, income or pro s, and loss of use or data), arising out of or in connection with any
acceptance of or reliance on this White paper or any part thereof by you.

IT’S TIME TO BRING POWER TO BETTORS.

part thereof, you represent and warrant to Marginless as follows:

32

g) you aware and acknowledge that you are familiar with all related regulations in the
specific jurisdiction in which they are based and that purchasing cryptographic tokens in
that jurisdiction is not prohibited, restricted or subject to additional conditions of any
kind.

18. In a scenario where less than 40.000.000 MRS Tokens are sold until the end of public
sale (May 31st) all purchases of MRS Tokens will be refunded for full sum.

19. MRS are blockchain tokens which are digital tokens created on a blockchain as part of a
decentralized software protocol. MRS are tokens issued on the Eutheruem platform on
the basis of an ERC20. MRS are utility tokens designed to support the development of
Marginless platform as well as to the measure used in the betting face to face.
Therefore, any failure or maltfunctioning of the Etheruem protocol may lead to the
trading network of MRS not working as expected.

20. Marginless pays serious attention to KYC and anti-fraud issues in order to provide it
customers with a transparent business model that is safe with minimal risk. In order to
ensure that services of Marginless are not utilized by unwanted and illegal elements to
