1. PURPOSE
Become the largest and most trusted decentralized
social network in the world.

2. PROBLEM
Your social network, your online activity, and even your online presence are a billion dollar industry curated by the very companies you trust to guard your privacy.
Don’t you think you should be entitled to a portion of the riches made off of your
data?
We do! And we believe it’s finally time to stand up to
these companies and take back the internet!
These large tech companies have created an image as friendly and gentle corporations simply wishing to provide a valuable service to people for no other reason
than altruism. However, every new day a new advancement takes place, a new device, a new feature.
How could that be possible for companies that don’t charge a dime to use their
services?
It’s simple: those companies are leveraging your data as a bargaining chip and selling it off to the highest bidder to fund their operations. And with every click of your
mouse you continue to put more and more money into their pockets.

Why should they profit off of something that was never theirs to begin with?

The truth is they shouldn’t. Sphere has the answer!
Sphere was built on the idea that privacy, company transparency, and data security
should be the fundamental building blocks of every social platform. So we believe
that the millions those corporations are making off of your data doesn’t belong to
them, it belongs to you.
We want to help you take back the control and have a say about your data.
So we’ve created a decentralized social network, separate from those corporations,
that allows exactly that. You have a say, you get compensated, and above all you
take back the power with every click and every social connection.
More than simply connecting, truly discover…

Help us break apart their greedy system and disrupt their $500+ billion
dollar industry by joining the digital revolution today!

2.1 The Current Method of Marketing Diminishes
Potential Profits and Misses the Mark
While the advertising industry boasts a rather large value considering the aforementioned facts, an estimated $550 billion by some accounts, the system is in fact
very much broken.
And there is nowhere the blame for the broken system falls more heavily than the
main advertisers that propagate the failed method while slowing advancements
and innovation. Instead, these large companies focus their efforts on ineffective
processes that have no guarantee of efficacy while still charging businesses large
sums simply to access the consumers’ data they hoard and hide.

?

This leads to the death of growth, the stifling of innovation, and
stands in the way of progress.

3. SOLUTION
Since its early inception, social media has quickly gone from a simple novelty used
only to keep friends updated and included on our daily lives to becoming a growing source of entertainment, news, and community. And as nearly three billion
people now utilize social media in some shape or form, its impact on life cannot be
denied. From those nearly billion active users, volumes upon volumes of data are
generated, saved, and often sold to the highest bidder. Essentially selling people’s
personalities, secrets, and lives to corporations that utilize that information to
create targeted ad campaigns. And this happens every moment of every day.

Sphere aims to change that and redefine how
social media interacts within our lives.
Gone is the large collection of centralized servers that are vulnerable to hacking,
storing troves of sensitive data to be used as companies see fit. In their place, a
more transparent, honest, and open blockchain format that allows every user to
hold Sphere accountable for data.
Sphere is built upon the main principles of privacy and security as an
undeniable right, giving each user
unprecedented protection and security and allowing you to connect
with everyone you know safely,
and most importantly, securely.

More than just a social network
Sphere is so much more than another simple addition
into the growing line of social media networks
available. It is the beginning of a digital revolution.

Aptly named Social Activity Tokens, or SATs for short: this brand new form of cryptocurrency can be used for a wide variety of uses and can even be utilized to fund
grass roots campaigns and movements, allowing them to reach more people and
larger audiences. To celebrate the launch and welcome the coming digital revolution, Sphere is holding an open offering to all those ready to join something special and different. This special occasion, only available now, will set the precedent
for the entire value of the SATs. And once it’s over, no more SAT tokens will ever be
produced.

So if you are ready to be a part of something special and
ready to take the power back, join us in the digital revolution.

2.1 Redefining the Way Businesses Interact with Potential
Consumers by Utilizing Innovative Block-chain Contracts
Through the advent of the internet, businesses found a more convenient and direct
way to target consumers with ad campaigns. However, as we are about to enter the
fourth decade of utilizing an interconnected system of computers to engage with
the world at large, the ways in which advertisers reach their targeted audiences
have not undergone much innovation during those long years.
As soon as email became a popular way to communicate with others,
we saw the emergence of a new phenomenon: targeted e-mail campaigns to reach and inform potential consumers.
Though even then, unsolicited email campaigns quickly garnered distaste while
quickly earning a not so endearing title of spam or junk mail. It became quite apparent that consumers treated the unsolicited messages much in the way they
treated unsolicited advertisements sent via the postal system.

www.sphere.social

Page 8 of 25

Yet despite public perception of the technique and the low performance of such
campaigns, many advertisers still utilize the method, charging unrealistic rates for
such failing procedures.
It has been estimated that nearly half of all “views, clicks,” or other indicators
of viewed campaigns never even reach a potential consumer. Yet businesses still
elect to quite frankly waste funds that could be allocated towards more effective
means of marketing instead of this outdated and unwanted form of advertisement.
The same facts and performance apply to similar methods of
advertising taking place off of the internet as well. The unfortunate truth is that many businesses are wasting precious
capital, profits, and funds attempting to reach potential clients in an inefficient manner.
The inefficiency of these methods strikes much deeper and causes many more
problems than simply lost profits and wasted efforts. The entire process undermines the experience between consumers and businesses.
We see that consumers are less likely to respond to the constant barrage of unwanted advertisements while businesses are forced to increase prices to compensate for the loss of profits. Both parties gain nothing from the entire experience
and businesses only further run the risk of alienating consumers with the higher
price points needing to recoup the money wasted on advertising.
The only party that has anything to gain from the experience is
the advertisers themselves who charge companies exorbitant
amounts for the privilege of possibly reaching consumers.
In direct response to this ever-expanding problem, Sphere has set out to reduce
the need for such intermediaries while increasing companies’ ability to directly
reach their desired target audience.

www.sphere.social

Page 9 of 25

Utilizing Sphere’s innovative method of allowing businesses to target consumers
directly, both sides stand to gain. On the consumers’ side, we see an increase in
privacy as their browsing habits are no longer sold to the highest bidder for the
potential to earn profits for the very same browsing data. Companies benefit from
truly knowing that their marketing campaigns are reaching their desired audience
more effectively, cutting down on the cost of marketing.

4. OPPORTUNITY
Consumers’ demand for better privacy and data protection has created a demand for a service that puts control, profit, and privacy back into the hands of
the consumers. We are poised for yet another great disruption in marketing
and advertising. The old and increasingly ineffective method of advertising will
come to an end. The old way will be replaced by the next waves of innovation.
At the forefront of the wave, Sphere has positioned itself ready to disrupt the old
process. We will create more transparent and open methods for conducting business in today’s global market. Sphere’s innovative technology creates a scalable,
anonymous, and secure social network utilizing large amounts of data while still
ensuring privacy.

4.1 Consumers’ Demand for Better Privacy and Data Protection Has Created a Demand for a Service that Puts Control, Profits, and Privacy Controls Back Into the Hands of
Consumers
This increase in demand for a more secure and private internet has fueled not only
consumer reactions towards services that do not respect privacy but has also become the driving force for legislation and policy making across the world regarding consumer data.
The EU itself has passed a policy that aims to control the rampant misuse of consumer data, forcing companies to move forward with consumer data protection
built into their business models.
Though the value of privacy is highly regarded, the actionable value of consumer
data has not been ignored; it simply needs a better way of being transferred between agreeing parties. This is where a block-chain distribution method comes
directly into play as it allows for the transfer of this vital, and valuable, data while
still protecting the users’ privacy.
The growing demand and emerging policies regarding consumer privacy have begun to push the need for a large scale transfer method that still respects the rights
of consumers.

4.2 History Repeated: Markets that Actively Stifle
Innovation are Subject to Major Disruption Through
Advancements in Tech
There is no way to discount how closely linked marketing and business have
been since people first began trading goods and services.
And as advancements in technology have continued to push the effectiveness of
marketing throughout the years, there has been a continuous process of innovation of new methods and the death of dated processes. Whether it was the advent
of the Yellow Pages, the creation of large scale social networks on the internet,
or today’s modern landing pages, the process of death and replacement has remained constant.
We sit poised on the cusp of yet another great disruption within marketing as the old and increasingly ineffective method of
advertising comes to an end, about to be replaced by the next
wave of innovation.
For as much innovation and progress as we have witnessed through the advent
of social media and more effective search engine algorithms, the very core of the
principles applied remain dated.
But as history has shown time and time again, that dated model is about to be replaced by a more efficient and effective
model, that model being the new and innovative block-chain
distribution method.

www.sphere.social

Page 12 of 25

At the forefront of the wave, Sphere has positioned itself ready to disrupt the
old process by introducing a new way to ensure mutually beneficial marketing to
all parties located throughout the entire consumer-buyer chain. In the process,
Sphere will create a more transparent and open method for conducting business
in today’s global market.
Positioned at the precipice of this change, Sphere’s innovative tech creates a
scalable, anonymous, and secure social network engine utilizing large amounts of
gathered data while still ensuring privacy.

4.3 Utilizing a Decentralized Social Environment, Sphere is
Able to Increase Total Value Spread Across the Entire Consumer-Seller Marketplace…
No longer are there vanguards standing in the way of innovation, charging fees for
access to data they misappropriate from consumers, a practice that not only is dated but stifles the growth of smaller companies who are unable to afford the often
unnecessarily high costs of reaching consumers.
Instead, Sphere creates a common environment in which
businesses, both big and small, can directly reach their
targeted access while ensuring funds are not wasted in the
process. IN this common marketplace, the value of data is
not determined simply by views or clicks as it is now, but
instead by the actionable effect it has on conversions.
The value of the innovative environment does not simply only extend to businesses; it also reaches consumers who are able to leverage the value of their
data for lower prices and other monetary gains without having to sacrifice
their right to privacy.

7. ESTABLISHED PRODUCT
The Sphere Social Network incorporates modern technologies that secure the
most popular features used in today’s social networks.
We have an experienced team and a product that is already built. Our team has
many years of experience designing systems that are secure and capable of managing high volumes.

The Sphere platform can currently be found on the internet, as well as on the
Google Play Store and iOS App Store.

8. STRATEGY
Through the invention of the internet, businesses found a more
convenient way of targeting consumers with ad campaigns.

As we are about to enter the fourth decade of using computer networks, the ways
in which advertisers reach their targeted audiences have not undergone much innovation.
Despite the poor results, many advertisers still use the old
methods to advertise their products. Businesses still elect
to waste funds that could be allocated towards more
effective marketing.

www.sphere.social

Page 16 of 25

The unfortunate truth is that many businesses are wasting precious funds to reach
potential clients. The entire process undermines the experience between consumers and businesses.

We see consumers who are less likely to respond to the constant barrage of unwanted
advertisement. Both parties gain nothing from the entire experience.

In direct response to this ever expanding problem, Sphere has set out to reduce
the need for such intermediaries while increasing companies’ ability to directly
reach their desired target audience.

Using Sphere’s innovative decentralized social network allows businesses to target consumers directly, and both sides stand to gain. On the consumers’ side, we
see an increase in privacy as their browsing habits are no longer sold to the highest bidder. Companies benefit from knowing that their marketing campaigns reach
their desired audience more effectively, cutting down on marketing costs

9. MARKETPLACE
The Sphere social platform contains important e-commerce features. The marketplace will allow users to create products which followers and friends can see and
purchase using their SAT.
For example:
Say you want to sell your phone; all you need to do is take photos of the
phone, and list it with a title, a description, and an asking price. Location is
optional. You can control access to the ad by listing it as either public.
Any user who wants to buy your phone can click the purchase button. When
a transaction occurs, SAT tokens are sent from that buyer’s wallet to your
wallet – with no delays or complications.

10. AD PLATFORM
Sphere has plans for creating a fully functional advertising portal. The advertising
portal will allow users to create ad pieces that will be displayed in the Sphere news
feed.

Advertising space will be paid for using SAT
tokens. There will be per-click and perimpression options, with costs deducted
automatically from the advertisers’ web
wallets.

www.sphere.social

11. TRANSPARENCY
Sphere will safeguard user privacy and avoid the misuse of community data. When
there is a need for additional development, everything will first be presented to
the community.
Sphere’s goal is to be the social platform where data is owned by the
users. The community drives the network

Picture this: a decentralized social media platform that stores multimedia and other
data on a secured blockchain rather than on traditional servers.

www.sphere.social

12. User Growth
Sphere Social’s plan is to allow our users to sell their data on their own terms, as much or as
little as they wish. We intend to make use of this system in our growth strategy; we expect to
be able to achieve rapid growth by incentivizing users to submit their data. We will work to
spur further growth with a referral program to encourage existing users to invite their friends.
Instead of aggregating data unanimously and indiscriminately, the opt-in data sharing system will allow both users and advertisers a more accurate and pleasant means of communicating market demographics, product placement, the issuance of goods and services, and etc.
For example, a user wishes to opt in to monetize their data in order to identify better crypto deals – the users who are selling crypto would have to buy the information the first user provides if they want to sell to that user’s specific demographic.
Everyone who opts in to the system would then have incentive to share their data – because they would not only be paid for their information – but will be offered (provided
there is a supply in the market) whatever goods and services the advertisers are providing.

The chart above uses data estimates that are extrapolated based on our live data collected from the 22nd October 2017 to 30th January 2018.

www.sphere.social

Page 20 of 25

Pessimistic Outlook:
We get less than 20k users in a single quarter, totaling 80k more users by the end of 2018.
Average Outlook:
We continue getting 40k users per quarter, totaling 160k users by the end of 2018.
Optimistic Outlook:
We gain at least 100k users per quarter, totaling 400k users by the end of 2018.

13. Marketplace Anticipation
We have observed many of our users testing out the shops- creating, customizing, submitting,
and deleting them. These are all positive signs of a future active marketplace.
Based on data gathered from 22 October 2017 to 30 January 2018 - we have over 45 thousand
users on the Sphere Social app. This is the amount of activity on the app up to that time:
Number of Users = 45,027
Number Blogs = 1273
Number of Photos = 27,326
Number of Videos = 606
Number of Discussion Topics = 250
Number of Groups = 384
Number of Events = 21
Number of Currently Submitted Stores = 70.
