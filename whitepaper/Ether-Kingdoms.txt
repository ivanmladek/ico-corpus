Introduction
We see great potential in crypto-technologies as they pertain to mobile and
computer gaming, as well as various other entertainment industries. We are proud
to say that we are one of the first to break ground and form the crypto-gaming
market because we’re certain that in just a few years, there will be an explosion
of various types of gaming projects incorporating this promising technology.
Meet Ether Kingdoms – a blockchain game that implements our vision of an exciting
and engrossing game that can make real money for the player. A game for the wide
audience, Ether Kingdoms is built around its own token – IMP1.
Did you think ICO as soon as you read “token”? No, not this time. We are not
holding an Initial Coin Offering, of which everyone familiar with the crypto-world
is tired by now. We wanted to release Ether Kingdoms as soon as possible, so a few
months ago we came out with the beta-version, making it possible for every player
(even those that aren’t hardcore gamers or blockchain enthusiasts) to enjoy our
game right away.
With that said, we had a detailed development plan from the get go, with updates
on mechanics and feature content coming out once-twice per month. In the secondthird quarter of 2019 we will be unveiling our global plans that will go far beyond
Ether Kingdoms itself... But it’s too soon to talk about that.

IMP token is an Ethereum based ERC20 token. The name comes from the word “Imp”, meaning “little devil”.
When you see our characters, you’ll understand why we named them that. But don’t worry, they are quite
awesome.

Overall Game
Mechanics
THE BASIC ETHER KINGDOMS GAME MECHANICS CONSISTS OF THE
FOLLOWING COMPONENTS:
1. Mining
2. PvP battles
3. Artifact equipment
4. Leaderboard participation
5. Far Realm battles
6. Fights with bosses and monsters
The game field of the main screen is a hexagonal grid that contains key game
elements – the Castle and mines. The IMP token, or imps, can be mined in the mine.
The imps are the Kingdom’s main workers and warriors. One IMP token equals one
imp under your command. Further, when we talk about tokens, imps, or IMP, please
remember that all of these are synonyms and mean the same thing.
Your imps are very useful! Send them to the mine and they’ll get you more IMP
tokens. As long as your imps are hard at work, you have constant token profit. Isn’t
it great?
The Castle is the heart of your Kingdom.You can exchange your imps for lootboxes,
which are chests that hide cool and very useful artifacts.
In addition to mining, your imps can battle the imps of other players. Click on the
icon with two crossed swords, specify the number of imps you’d like to send, and
sit tight, waiting for an opponent to accept your challenge. If you don’t want to
wait, you can call upon our highly trained bots, and enjoy watching the automated
battle. Don’t forget to turn on the sound!
The battle can either be a draw, or victory of one of the players, or the bot. In the
latter case, the loser gives up a part of his imps and the winner takes them home.
If you are fighting the bot, it becomes the mirror copy of your own imp, so your
chances of victory, defeat or draw lean towards the 40/40/20 proportion. Keep
in mind that the game keeps a commission of 10% for each battle.
Your imps have a list of characteristics, which you can see in the equipment window.
You can also use this window to equip the imps with artifacts, making them stronger
before each battle.
You may ask where do you get the artifacts? Well, there are several ways of
obtaining them via different in-game events: leaderboards (competitions among
players), fights with global, local bosses and monsters.

Architecture
and Technology
Ether Kingdoms is based on the blockchain technology, but not all of its operations
use the smart contract. You may ask why. This is due to the fact that the current
Ethereum infrastructure has a number of limitations, such as low productivity and
certain costs associated with each operation. This is logical, as the main concern
of blockchain is the safety of information, and not speedy transactions for free.
We came up with a solution to ensure that the game is fast and secure at the same
time. First, let us describe the possible approaches to a blockchain-based game.

1. COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION BASED ON THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN.

The world-famous CryptoKitties overloaded the Ethereum blockchain numerous
times during its peak popularity times, which raised the price of transactions and
slowed down their speed dramatically. It’s unlikely that any player likes when this
happens. Additionally, ERC20 token operations — and IMP is an ERC20 token —
require much more gas than Ether operations. If we were to use Ethereum for
mining and battles, each transaction would cost the player up to 210 thousand
gas. A possible solution is Plasma.io, but at the time Ether Kingdoms was released,
Plasma.io was not yet finished. This is why we stepped away from this solution—
it’s too expensive for the player, would not allow players to enjoy quick PvP
battles, and would overload the Ethereum blockchain.

2. IMPLEMENTATION BASED ON ALTERNATIVE BLOCKCHAINS.

We also looked into NEM/XEM and Stellar blockchain platforms at the early stage
of development. However, these don’t function with MetaMask and don’t support
ERC721 standard analogs, which is necessary for the artifacts. Additionally, these
blockchains don’t have a decentralized exchange and a way of giving liquidity
to the tokens in a timely manner, as well as present several issues with finding
specialists to work based on them. Thus, we scratched out this option.

3. IMPLEMENTATION BASED ON OUR OWN BLOCKCHAIN.

We looked into this solution only hypothetically, as it would be too expensive for
our players and very time-consuming for us to develop. Additionally, in order to
create a game based on our own blockchain, we would need to attract additional
investors either through an ICO or by ways of venture funds.

4. A HYBRID SOLUTION.

This worked for us and we believe is the best approach for the type of project
we are creating! With a hybrid solution, tokens are added to the balance within
the game’s wallet, much like on any exchange. MetaMask is used to log into the
game and to deposit/withdraw the tokens from the game. MetaMask is also used to
verify all key actions in the game, such as sending imps to battle. All other ingame
operations are stored on the server, which makes everything quick and free. As
such, a balance is reached between productivity, reliability and transparency. This
is why we chose this option for Ether Kingdoms.

Mines
and Mining
There are 25 mines on the game field. At the beginning of the game, only one mine
is available to the player, but with each successfully passed level, new mines open
for business. We’ll talk about player level and how to raise it a bit later. When the
player reaches level 25, all of the Kingdom’s mines become available.
Each mine has its own level – from 1 to 4 – which should not be confused with the
player’s level. All mines have level 1 when they open, which means that you can
only send 100 imps to work in it. The greater the mine level, the more imps you
can send there. The more imps you have working in the mine, the greater is the
number of IMP they can mine daily! So it’s in the player’s best interest to upgrade
the mine to its greatest level, so they can send as many imps as possible to work in
it. For example, if you send 400 imps to a level 4 mine, they will render 2 IMP per
day. The table below has detailed information on how this system works.

Before a player reaches level 25 (player level, not mine level), they will gradually
open one mine after another on the map of their Kingdom. After the player reaches
level 25, they will be able to start upgrading the mines themselves. The upgrade
happens with each mine separately and costs a small number of IMP. Between
player levels 25 and 50, the mines can be upgraded to level 2. Between player level
50 and 100, the mines are upgraded to level 3. After player reaches level 100, the
mines are upgraded to level 4.
On the main screen you will always see real-time information about how much your
miner-imps are mining. It’s obvious that the more mines you have, the more imps
mine in them, and the greater the level of the mine, the greater is your profit!
Besides, there are a number of artifacts that increase mining speed. It`s not
possible to buy these artifacts in the game anymore: their emission is finished,
and now you can only find them on OpenSea.io item exchange platform.

In November 2018 the game mining speed was decreased twofold. All of the numbers stated in the table are
relevant as of now.

Battles Against
Other Players
As we’ve mentioned before, in addition to mining, your imps can fight other players’
imps. Why would you want to send your imps to battle? Because you will receive
experience points for each fight, and experience points help you grow, increasing
the number of the mines in your Kingdom and the IMP tokens you can mine in them.

It’s very easy to send your imps to battle, just click the crossed swords icon and
specify how many imps you’d like to dedicate to the fight. The greater your level,
the more imps you can send. At the beginning levels, you can send no more than 10.
Later, this number grows to 25, then 50, etc. At the highest levels, you can send as
many as 500 imps to battle.
In the fall 2018, we introduceв battle packages against other players—you just
specify how many you are ready to spend and start searching. The number of
fights and search time are adjusted automatically depending on your bet. This
allows each player to increase their levels and take higher places in leaderboards
without wasting time waiting for an opponent.
If no opponent with similar level to yours is available , you can always fight our
bot, which is a mirror of your own imp as far as characteristics are concerned,
making your chances of victory, defeat or draw lean towards the 40/40/20 proportion. You can always check relevant statistics regarding bot fights on your
individual stats page.

Levels 121-130 will be added later.

The battle happens in an automatic mode – just sit tight and watch a video of how
imps attack each other in a funny squabble. Fights are broken into rounds, with
each round being an exchange of hits between your imps and the imps of your
opponent. If the battle ends in a draw, each player leaves with what they came.
If someone wins, the winner takes a portion of the loser’s imps (between 20% and
80%). The game withholds a commission of 10% for each battle.
The higher the player’s level, the stronger their imps become – they get more
health points (HP) and the amount of damage they can cause goes up. With that,
you can increase the characteristics of your fighters by equipping them with artifacts. But we’ll talk more about this in an upcoming section.

LET’S LOOK AT THE BATTLE’S ALGORITHM STEP BY STEP:

1. If two players send 50 imps each to a battle, the total prize pool is 100 IMP.
2. The game has a 10% commission of the total pool (10 IMP). The remainder
is 90 IMP.
3. The winner and the loser are determined, as well as the medium
of the prize pool. In our example, it’s 45 IMP (90 divided by 2)
4. The winnings and losses are determined between 20% and 80% of the medium,
which is 45 IMP in our case.
5. Let’s say that this is 60%, or 27 IMP (45*60%). In this case, the winner will get
(45+27) and the loser will come back with 18 IMP (45-27).
We admit that the battles against bots aren’t designed to make money. Due
to the even chances of winning, losing and draw as well as the game’s commission, it’s unwise to think you will make easy profit. Bots are necessary to
quickly raise the player’s experience level, which will in turn give them more
imps due to the opening of more mines and their upgrade. Since experience
points are given for each battle (1 EXP point for each imp you send to battle), it’s beneficial to go to battle even if you lose.

Equipment
and Artifacts
The equipment window (imp icon) is there for you to see what battle characteristics
your imps have and to equip them with artifacts. The main characteristics are
health, amount of damage that can be caused, protection, chances of a critical hit,
dodging and additional attack. Health and damage caused grow with your level,
while the rest of the characteristics can only be changed with the artifacts (health
and damage can, as well). The rarest and coolest artifacts can drastically change
the battle’s outcome. For example, they can lower or completely diminish your
opponent’s chances of a critical hit.
A reminder: in battles against bots your chances of winning or losing tend to
lean towards the 40/40/20 proportion, because the bot has the same characteristics as you do. The issue with PvP and other PvE elements, such as fights
with bosses and monsters is different: here, artifacts directly influence your
battle efficiency.
Artifacts can be obtained in different ways – purchased in the Castle, won in weekly
leaderboards, received during special offers (regular, but limited in time), received
as a reward for killing bosses or monsters or bought on the special exchange
OpenSea.io.
If you received the artifact in the game (for example, opened a lootbox with one),
you will see a Claim button under its image in your equipment window. When you
press the button, you will be offered to turn the artifact into an ERC721 token4.
Doing so will cost you some gas and the final price of the artifact will be reflected
in your MetaMask wallet. You will need some time after the transaction to see the
token in your MetaMask. It will still be available in the game, but the Claim button
will disappear, with the MetaMask button (head of a fox) replacing it.
After this, you can do anything you wish with the artifact token – sell it on Opensea,
give it to a friend, transfer it to another wallet, etc.

The key feature of the token of this standard is its unique and individual characteristics. We will release a
limited number of ERC721 artifact tokens, after which they will be in free circulation within the Ethereum
blockchain. You can see the history of each token (when it appeared or changed ownership, etc.) on the
blockchain itself. Practically, such tokens aren’t just beneficial to the players, but are collectible items with
unique properties within the Ethereum blockchain. They will remain on the blockchain as long as the block
chain itself exists.

You can use a limited number of artifacts on your imp, and each of them is related
to a specific slot:
• 1 slot for the helmet
• 2 slots for the weapon
• 2 slots for the defense (shield)
• 1 slot for the armor
• 5 slots for additional objects
• 1 slot for the pet (can be taken to battle)
Please note that there are different artifacts in the game. For example, there
are artifacts that can raise one parameter, but lower another. Or artifacts that
can be reloaded – these have a limited number of uses, after which they need
to be reloaded. You’ll need imps to do so and charge is used only during PvP
battles.

Tutorial Mode
and Far Realm
The game has a Tutorial Mode where you`ll receive 200 virtual tokens. The mode
starts automatically when you start playing and allows you to reach level 15. Note
that after level 15 your virtual IMPs will disappear and you will be able to start
playing using actual tokens. If you want to continue playing without investing
money, follow our Discord channel – from time to time we host special offers there,
which can help you earn some tokens to fulfil offer requirements.
At the beginning of 2019, a big update was released, called Far Realm. In this
game mode players will fight for buildings that provide valuable bonuses, including
mining bonus!
To start playing in this mode you need to use the portal. This way you can transfer
some portion of your free IMPs to a separate pool displayed on the new game
mode screen. You can return IMPs from the Far Realm at any time by pressing the
corresponding button.
All actions in the Far Realm are performed by a squad of imps. To create the squad
you have to click on any deployment tile or use the “Create Squad” button. After
the squad is created, you can see its current stamina and squad size in the status
bar in the lower portion of the screen. Using “Reinforce” button you can add imps
from the Far Realm pool, but you can do so only when the squad stands on a
deployment tile.
Imp squad can attack any building of any player as soon as it reaches it – stamina
goes down during the move. The fight shares the same principle as the common
fight, but your fighter will get stats bonus provided by the buildings you own. Damage and health of both imps is directly modified by the difference in the amount of
imps from each fighting side. Item bonuses are applied as usual.
After a building is successfully captured, you can place the garrison to secure the
building. Other players will have to defeat it to capture the building. You just have
to select a squad that stands on the nearest tile, click on the building and choose
the amount of imps you would like to garrison.
Remember that it can be very dangerous to travel in the Far Realm – you can come
across terrible monsters at any moment!
If this happens you have to choose either to run and lose all your stamina or fight
and get experience points and valuable reward if you manage to win.

Token
Distribution
We will release a total of 13 million IMP tokens. Of those, 2 million will be used
to finance the project development, 1.3 million will be used for airdrops and
leaderboards, and 9.7 million will be available for mining.
As soon as the token circulation reached 3.5 million IMP, we cut in half the speed
of token mining. All of the players’ wallets, exchanges and the game pool will be
considered when determining the total circulation, not including the IMP that are
dedicated to project development.
If players mine IMP actively, all 13 million tokens will be in circulation by September
of 2019. By this time, we will implement a mechanism to gradually burn the tokens
to minimize the supply and raise the token price.
