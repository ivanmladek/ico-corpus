SelfCoin
A platform to launch your own token
economy
1. Abstract
SelfCoin is a blockchain-based platform, providing individuals in needs of issuing
tokens with a systematic solution, including token issuance, exchanges and other
necessary supporting facilities, such as personal credit rating model and risk
evaluating model. Users can issue Individual Tokens on the platform for various
purposes.
SelfCoin takes full advantage of blockchain technology, including right confirmation,
high liquidity and high transparency, and creates an entirely new market: capital can
get rid of the limitation of traditional venture capital and invest directly in individuals.
Everyone is able to create his or her own token, as a result, the current economic
system will be optimized to a great extent.

2. Token Economy Landscape
Blockchain solves the double spending problem, enabling the Internet to not only
transmit information but also transmit value. In a decentralized blockchain network,
token incentives, rewards and penalty scheme together shape users’ behavior in this
economic system. Token economy is such a well designed economic system for the
Internet to transmit value based on blockchain technology. Token economy is an
indivisible part of blockchain technology.
For example, the intellectual property of superstars is one of the most valuable
assets in blockchain. The stars can strengthen his or her connection to the fans
through issuing tokens, reducing the intermediaries costs and increasing the
efficiency for communication. Finally the star’s token economy enhances the value of
his or her intellectual property. For another example, students can gain more
resources for his or her career development via issuing tokens, and meanwhile
investors can gain investment returns by sharing the future of the students. These

talents’s token economy shares their future value and increases their future value.
SelfCoin platform creates an economic model of individuals tokens, which is
introduced to the world for the first time.
- Each individual can issue cryptocurrency
- Cryptocurrency can be traded freely on the platform
- Platform provides supporting facilities for application scenarios of cryptocurrency
On the other hand, SelfCoin platform could apply to so many different types of
people based on above functionalists.
- Stars for sharing and increasing their personal IPs.
- Rising stars for gaining resources and creating their IPs.
- Young talents for gaining resources and caring community.

3. Technical Structure of SelfCoin Business
Digital Assets
SelfCoin platform could issue millions of tokens on SelfCoin mainnet, like ethereum
issues ERC20 tokens. While all these tokens are native digital assets instead of
contract-based digital assets. Compared with contract-based tokens, native digital
assets are more safer since there are no possible bugs, which is almost unavoidable
considering the difficulties to update smart contract. In terms of security, SelfCoin
issuance mechanism should lose partial programmable capability on digital assets,
however, later SelfCoin smart contract will describe how SelfCoin mitigate the
programmable capability.
Another advantage of native digital assets is its performance. There is no need to
load smart contract visual machine to operate tokens, so the transaction per seconds
is much faster. There is no competing in gaining hashrate among different contracts
and then more kinds of digital assets can be issued.
The abbreviation for Individuals tokens could be 3 to 16 characters, and SelfCoin
platform could support easily one token for everyone on the earth. At the same time,
all these tokens share similar transaction rate with SelfCoins.

Exchange

The exchange supports millions of digital currency transactions and has
millisecond-level transaction matching speeds. To reduce the trading barrier, our
team will develop a quantitative trading robot based on AI technology to accelerate
trading speed, increase trading volume, as well as cater to different trading habits.
The graph below presents a high-level structure of Individual Token exchange. The
most important part of the exchange technology is the high scalability of the
matching engine cluster. With the business growth, more matching engine could be
deployed automatically. The trading pairs between SelfCoins and Individuals Tokens
could also be supported easily since all Individuals Tokens follow the same interface
on SelfCoin platform. With these two key issues resolved, Individual Tokens exchange
could easily grow to support millions of different tokens.
Well-designed and intuitive GUI and API will improve user experience, and high
performance message queue working together with persistence and log capability
will provide a low latency and stable message communication and traceability. Last
but not least, the database needs well-tuning and index design to avoid becoming
the performance bottleneck.

Smart Contract
Although SelfCoin platform doesn’t use smart contract to issue cryptocurrencies,
smart contract is still important. On the one hand, SelfCoin platform plays the role of
intermediary for individuals to raise funds, and smart contract can ensure
transparency and fairness of that process. Unlike ERC20 contract, SelfCoin platform
smart contract could involve multiple Individuals Tokens. It is much easier for users to
interact a bundle of Individual Tokens within one smart contract. On the other hand,
when the issuers give back to the investors, smart contract can greatly increase the
efficiency by loading issuers’ confessed credit information or ratings and
automatically trigger the distribution of tokens to the investors.
Unlike other smart contracts, SelfCoin smart contract doesn’t need coding and
programming. On the basis of Turing Completeness, users can drag and drop all
logical models to compose a user-defined smart contract on the platform, which
substantially reduces the technological barrier for users and thus expands the
application scope of smart contract.

5. SelfCoin Business Model Analysis
As stated in section 2, SelfCoin platform could be used for different purposes. With
each Niche market, the business model could be different. Below describes 3 typical
business models to use SelfCoin Platform.

Investment in Talents
SelfSell, a sub-brand of SelfCoin platform, helps young talents who have dreams to
share their future income in a specific percentage that does not affect their future
life to investors in order to obtain raise funds, so as to achieve their ideals, or to
pursue their dreams without economic pressure. This is an optimal path to maximize
the value of talents and help them realize their dreams.
For backers, the investment in talents is an efficient way to maximize investment
returns. The financing invested in education, training, physical and mental health and
other aspects of talents will make significant changes to the invested objects. The
realization of every talent’s dream will have a huge impact on investment income.

SelfSell Platform
Smart Contract

SelfSell proposes a new revolutionary platform by merging several innovations that
are crowdfunding, crowdlending and initial coin offerings, in order to provide key
individuals with great potential (talents, rising artists, Internet celebrities and
promising individuals in general) a new disruptive way to realize their dreams and
ambitions. SelfSell gives them access to the booming market of ICOs, where they will
find backers to fund them in exchange of a personal reward, which can be future
services or advantages decided by the individuals.
The financial ecosystem has been the first system using blockchain technology to
create new innovative ways to work. Blockchain can now be used to register shares
of traditional companies, do fundraising, or develop cost-effective trusts. On the
fundraising side, since early 2016, initial coin offerings have allowed lots of
companies to get funded by private backers through this new and innovative
financing alternative. The vision of SelfSell is that this technology will spread widely
into business area and in several years, the mainstream would be getting funded
directly from investors.

SelfSell Structure Explanation
A1. Individuals (Dave & Mary) want to issue their own Individuals Tokens, they go
onto SelfSell Platform and fulfill KYC/AML forms.
A2. After verification of their KYC/AML information, they get access to SelfSell
Platform Credit Evaluation tool for personal credit rating, based on big data
regarding their personal background and credit background.
A3. SelfSell Platform publishes the credit rating scores and address it to SelfCoins
holders through the SelfSell Platform. At this stage, SelfSell Platform decides to
refuse access to SelfSell market to Dave due to poor rating scores (either
because of his credit background or because of his past experiences) in order to

protect SelfCoins holders, and drafts a smart contract with Mary, which has
passed validly through SelfSell background verification, based only on the
conditions Mary wants to offer to SelfCoins holders (the better her score is, the
better conditions she will get from the market).
A4. After collecting all information from "SelfSell Platform authority" and "Credit
Evaluation", SelfSell Platform Individuals Token Offering is ready to issue Mary
ICO, keeping SelfCoins holders informed of the results of her background scores.
B1. To become a valid backer on SelfSell Platform, backers need to pass KYC and AML
process successfully.
B2. Once whitelisted, in order to purchase Individuals Tokens, backers need to
purchase SelfCoins first on any supported cryptocurrency exchanges.
B3. Potential backers transfer SelfCoins from exchanges onto SelfSell Platform token
storage.
B4. Potential backers check the information listed at A4, and Mary ICO conditions
(rewards, duration, guarantees…) and determine if they want to invest their
SelfCoins into Mary ICO.
A5. Once Mary ICO is terminated, depending on the minimum cap is reached or not,
she will be able to collect her SelfCoins, or SelfCoins will return to initial
SelfCoins holders.
A6. SelfSell Platform Individual Token Offering issues Mary token to each investor
according to their investment.
B5. Once Mary Tokens are issued, backers can hold their tokens waiting for their
rewards or decide to trade it on SelfSell Platform Individual Token Exchange.
A7. Mary provides backers with their rewards (either services, advantages or a
portion of her income (in SelfCoins)) and thanks to SelfSell Platform Repayment
Distribution tool, a smart-contract based program allowing her to simply
redistribute rewards such as SelfCoins automatically to all Mary token holders.

Investment in Superstars
Superstars, or so called idols, are able to gain great attraction from fans by his or her
acting skills, singing skills, professional abilities, characters or even appearance.
From the perspective of fans, they need to truly express their love to the superstars,
and use star token as intermediary as the most straightforward way to interact with
superstars.
This kind of behavior can be expanded to many business areas and then a huge
industry called fan economy comes into existence. Fans will express their support and
love to the singers, actors or athletes through purchasing CDs, concert tickets, movie
tickets, sports game tickets and so on. They will also consume the commercial goods
that are recommended by the stars. Apart from that, because of the evident support
from fans, stars are able to build enormous intangible assets. For instance, stars can
bring great revenues to movies or ads in which they act, or bring great brand
recognition to entertainment programs in which they participate. All of these are

proofs of the great intangible assets in fans economy.
SelfCoin platform provides the stars with a platform to issue their tokens. The tokens
can be used for the payment in all kinds of fan-related commercial activities,
including peripheral goods, concert tickets, sports game tickets, advertised products
and so on. If possible, fans with plenty of tokens can also have the opportunity to
interact with the stars in many different ways. To sum up, token can be used for any
application scenario, which helps to increase star’s personal IP and improve the
communication between stars and fans.
Own part of your superstar！These are really exciting words for fans. Superstar token
provides a great opportunity for fans to express their love and interact with the stars
in a more straightforward way.

onto SelfCoin financial results. Therefore, SelfCoins purchasers accept and
acknowledge that these SelfCoins do not entitle their owners to participate in
any decision or vote within SelfCoin, to benefit from SelfCoin’s results, or to
derive any economic or other gain from SelfCoin;
any kind of investment in equity or debt form in any venture;
an instrument that participates in any gross or net profits;
any type of financial derivatives or interest in collective investment scheme;
any negotiable instrument (such as commercial paper);
any form of investment contract (including future contract) between the
holder and any other person or entity;
any asset or commodity that any person or entity is obliged to repurchase or
redeem;
any debenture, loan stock, fund, bond, note, warrant or other instrument
that entitles the holder to any kind of dividend, interest payment or any kind
of return from any person;
any electronic currency: SelfCoins are not accepted outside the SelfCoin
network and a SelfCoin does not have a fixed exchange value equal to the
amount delivered at the time of its issue. Therefore, within the meaning of EU
Directive 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16
September 2009 on the taking up, pursuit and prudential supervision of the
business of electronic money institutions, SelfCoin is not an electronic
currency;
any mean of payment: SelfCoin ICO does not involve the purchase, and, or,
sale of cryptocurrencies and SelfCoin’s business does not consist in receiving
currencies against the delivery of cryptocurrencies. As such, SelfCoin is not a
mean of payment within the meaning of EU Directive (2007/64/EC) of 13
November 2007 relating to payment services in the internal market, nor
within the meaning of the (EU) Directive relating to payment services 2 (DSP
2) N° 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
November 2015;
any option, right or interest in any of the above.

SelfCoins shall be considered as cryptographic tokens used by the platform. SelfCoins
are cryptographic tokens, i.e. an unregulated digital asset issued and controlled by its
developers used and accepted by the members of a given community, and has no
intrinsic value outside of this community.
Therefore SelfCoins belong the the category of utility tokens, as it only grants to its

purchasers the right to use it on the SelfCoin Platform and to have exclusive access to
the valuation and scoring services over the individuals and access to Individuals ICOs
accompaniment services offered by SelfCoin.
Prior to any contribution, all SelfCoins purchaser acknowledge and accept that
SelfCoins do not, under any circumstance, represent any form of investment or
financial investment and agree not to attempt to divert the tokens function for
speculative purposes. SelfCoins purchasers shall not obtain or use SelfCoins for any
illegal purposes wherever in the world, in particular for money laundering and/or
terrorism.

Article 4 – Refund policy
Unless otherwise stated in these T&C, contributions made by SelfCoins purchasers
are irrevocable and not refundable under any circumstances.
By purchasing SelfCoins, SelfCoins purchasers acknowledge that neither SelfCoin nor
any member of SelfCoin team or advisors are, or will be required to provide any
refund for any reason, and that SelfCoins purchaser will not be entitled to receive
money or any other compensation for any SelfCoin they hold that could not be used
onto the SelfCoin Platform.
Besides, as the SelfCoins offered for sale are deemed intangible property, having no
value or functionality other than the SelfCoin Platform service, no guarantee is
attached to them following issuance.
No final contribution confirmed on the SelfCoin Website may be subsequently
cancelled or refunded.
SelfCoins purchasers acknowledge that they are fully aware that they will not be
entitled to claim any full or partial reimbursement under any circumstances
whatsoever.

Article 5 – Risks inherent to SelfCoin ICO
1. Security and loss of private key
a. SelfCoins purchasers security
Any SelfCoins purchaser shall implement reasonable and appropriate measures
designed to secure access to (i) any device associated with his SelfCoin account, (ii)
private keys required to access any relevant blockchain address, and (iii) SelfCoins

purchaser username, password and any other login or identifying credentials, used to
login onto the Website.
The loss or destruction of a private key will permanently and irreversibly deny the
holder access to their SelfCoins. SelfCoins are controlled only by the validation of
both the relevant unique public and private keys through the local or online wallet.
While all SelfCoins holders are recommended to protect and securely store their
private keys, each holder is responsible for safeguarding the private keys applicable
to their own wallets.
SelfCoin team has noted that several ICOs have been victims from hackers and
phishing attempt for potential purchasers. Please note that the ICO will only take
place on SelfCoin Website. SelfCoin team will not solicit any subscription by email or
phone from its potential SelfCoins purchasers. In case of doubt, please contact us at
hi@selfsell.com. Please be informed that SelfCoin team will never ask SelfCoins
holders to provide by phone, email or through social media, their SelfCoins wallet
private key.
SelfCoins purchasers will assume full responsibility for the consequences of any theft,
malfunction or misuse of SelfCoin Platform or SelfCoins acquired, as a result of a lack
of security or any use by any person to whom SelfCoins purchaser has provided his
credentials, intentionally or not.
b. SelfCoin Platform and Blockchain security
Hackers, criminal groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with SelfCoin
Platform or the availability of SelfCoins in several ways including, but not limited to,
denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, malware attacks or consensus-based attacks.
Besides, SelfCoin Platform is based on open source software. There is therefore a risk
that third parties, may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs
into the SelfCoin Platform code, by interfering with the use of it or causing loss of
some or all SelfCoins.
Moreover, advancement in cryptography technologies and techniques, including but
not limited to code cracking, developments of artificial intelligence and/or quantum
computers, could be identified as risks to all cryptography-based systems including
SelfCoin blockchains and SelfCoin Platform. When such technologies and/or
techniques are applied to SelfCoin Blockchain, adverse outcomes such as theft, loss,
disappearance, destruction, devaluation or other compromises of the SelfCoins held
by any person may result.
The absolute security of SelfCoin Platform and SelfCoin Blockchain cannot be
guaranteed as the future of cryptography or security innovations is unpredictable.

SelfCoins purchasers accept and acknowledge the risk to see the SelfCoin Blockchain
compromised, causing a loss of value of SelfCoins or the loss of part or all SelfCoins
issued during SelfCoin ICO.

c. SelfCoin ICO proceeds security
There may be attempts to steal the SelfCoin ICO proceeds collected from SelfCoins
purchasers. While SelfCoin will endeavor to adopt industry best practices to keep the
proceeds safe (including but not limited to the use of cold storage), successful cyber
thefts may still occur. Any loss of SelfCoin ICO proceeds arising from such theft(s)
may impact the ability of SelfCoin to fund the development or maintenance of
SelfCoin Platform and SelfCoin Project.

2. Legal and regulatory risks
a. SelfCoin ICO legal and regulatory risks
Blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and projects financing through
cryptocurrencies have been the subject of close scrutiny by various regulatory bodies
around the world. Given the lack of cryptocurrency qualifications in most countries,
each SelfCoins purchaser is strongly advised to carry out a legal and tax analysis
concerning the purchase and ownership of SelfCoins according to their own
nationality and place of residence.
SelfCoin Project has not been registered under any jurisdiction to date. Crypto-assets
may be overseen by the regulatory authorities of a number of jurisdictions globally
which may cause SelfCoin Platform to be subject to scrutiny, which may conduct to
injunctions or sanctions over SelfCoin Project.
SelfCoin may receive notices, queries, warnings, requests or rulings from one or more
regulatory authorities upon short notices, or may even be ordered to suspend or
terminate any action in connection with the SelfCoin ICO or the SelfCoin Blockchain
as a whole without prior notices.
The planning, development, marketing, promotion, execution of SelfCoin Project or
the SelfCoin ICO may be seriously affected, hindered, postponed or terminated as a
result of regulators actions.
SelfCoins could be deemed from time to time as a virtual commodity, digital asset or
even securities or currency in various jurisdictions and therefore could be prohibited
from being traded or held in certain jurisdictions pursuant to local regulations.

There is no guarantee that SelfCoin will be able to maintain a legal status in all
jurisdictions addressed today by SelfCoin ICO at all times, SelfCoin Project may even
never come to fruition or may have to be abandoned, leaving the issued SelfCoins
issued without any use.
b. Individuals ICOs legal and regulatory risks
Please note that under several jurisdiction laws and regulations, Individuals ICOs may
be considered as regulated activity that can only be pursued by regulated or
registered entities, as it may be considered, under certain circumstances, as loans.
Therefore, SelfCoin may have to register as a credit institution or under any other
available status, allowing it to pursue the development of its activity and in order to
be able to propose Individuals ICOs onto the SelfCoin Platform.
Moreover, it has to be noted that in certain jurisdiction, such as France, only the
following structures can carry out credit transactions on a habitual basis:
o
A credit institution or a financing company licensed for such purpose by the
European Central Bank or the relevant French authorities; and
o

A credit institution having its registered office in a member state of the
European Union or in a state which is a party to the treaty on European
Economic Area if the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution has
been duly notified in advance by the European Central Bank or the relevant
authority of such state and provided that it carries out only those credit
transactions which is authorized to carry out in its own state.

Therefore, Individuals ICOs may not be available in every country where SelCoin ICO
participation is proposed, depending on their analysis by regulators. SelfCoin will
apply and make reasonable efforts to comply with all necessary regulatory
prerequisites in order to pursue its activity. Depending on the profile of the
individuals, different conditions may also apply to comply with laws and regulations.
SelfCoin intends to develop legal engineering after the SelfCoin ICO in order to
determine the legal framework under which Individuals ICOs will take place, and if
needed, to comply, if reasonably possible, with any regulatory provisions applying to
pursue its activities.
As SelfCoin provides a platform allowing individuals to get funded in exchange of
what could be assimilated to a form of repayment (even if it does not answer to
traditional loans characteristics), SelfCoin Platform may need to partner with one of
the institutions allowed to propose this kind of products, in order to be authorized to
proceed (or to obtain one of these status).
SelfCoin wants to recall potential purchasers of SelfCoins that a part of the funds
collected through SelfCoin ICO will be dedicated to the legal structure of Individuals

ICOs (structuring of the UI interface, legal study on the status of these ICOs, and
subjects to change in function of the legal analysis to be realized).
For the sake of Individuals ICO structuring, it has to be noted that SelfCoin is solely
responsible for deciding whether to provide Individuals ICOs opportunities to
SelfCoins owners, within the technical, legal, economic or other constraints imposed
by third parties or by the company itself on its operations. The SelfCoins purchaser’s
attention is therefore drawn to the fact that purchasing SelfCoins does not confer
automatic access to the Platform, and to the Individuals ICO. Some of them, notably
due to application of consumer law to individual issuers, could not be accessible to
every SelfCoins owner. SelfCoins may not be used before the effective creation of the
Platform. SelfCoins will not be reimbursed in the event that the platform is not
ultimately developed, or does not operate on a permanent basis. SelfCoins
purchasers acknowledge that this is a significant risk that they accept.
3. Technological risks
Due to the technically complex nature of SelfCoin Project, SelfCoin could face
difficulties that may be unforeseeable and/or unsolvable. Accordingly, the
development of SelfCoin Platform could fail, terminate or be delayed at any time for
any reason (including but not limited to lack of funds or legal constraints).
Development failure or termination may render SelfCoins worthless and/or obsolete.
In addition, some of the SelfCoin Platform features are currently under development.
As a consequence, SelfCoins purchasers accept that the development may not fully
succeed, that SelfCoin Platform may never be released and operational, even though
SelfCoin makes reasonable efforts to deliver SelfCoin Platform in time. The SelfCoin
Platform may be subject to software and/or technical risks, or some of the features
presented herein may never be installed on the platform.
SelfCoin team has chosen to develop its Platform on the AChain protocol and will
switch to its own proprietary protocol, with the help of AChain technologies soon
after SelfCoin ICO, for its technical support, after having audited its performances in
terms of exchange protocol and stability technologies. Therefore, Achain appears to
offer to SelfSell the best support for its platform, as it should be able to manage a
traffic correspondent to hundreds of thousands of simultaneous Individuals ICOs.
SelfCoins purchasers shall note that any malfunction, unplanned function, or
unexpected operation on the Achain protocol (and then SelfCoin protocol) may cause
the Platform or SelfCoins to malfunction or to operate in a way that is not expected.
ACT, Achain account unit, may itself lose value in a similar way to SelfCoins, or in any
other way. In such a case, or if Achain’s development does not exceeds SelfCoin
expectations, leading to a bottleneck for SelfCoin’s development, SelfCoin will
consider switching its underlying platform from Achain Blockchain to another

blockchain services supplier, in order to ensure the quality of service SelfCoin intend
to grant its clients, in terms of stability, rapidity and data security.
4. Violation of Privacy or Data Protection Laws
SelfCoin is subject to applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations.
Any violations of laws and regulations relating to the safeguarding of private
information could subject SelfCoin to injunctions and/or sanctions. Any such
violations could adversely affect the ability of SelfCoin to operate the SelfCoin
Blockchain, which could have a material adverse effect on the SelfCoin Blockchain’s
operations as well as the utility of SelfCoins.
5. Amendment or termination of the SelfCoin Project
a.

Amendment of the SelfCoin Project

At the date of these T&C, SelfCoin is still seeking legal advice on a number of matters
including but not limited to the regulatory environment of Individuals ICOs and legal
and regulatory requirements to be fulfilled by the platform to implement notably
Individuals ICOs and SelfCoin Platform exchange.
Pending such advice, some or all aspects of these T&C, the SelfCoin White Paper and
other related marketing materials may need to be amended accordingly. While
SelfCoin will aim to minimize the impact of such changes on the SelfCoin Project,
SelfCoins purchaser should be aware of the risks associated with possible changes,
which may have adverse effects on the benefits and legitimacy of SelfCoin Project.
Also, SelfCoin ICO may be terminated pursuant to the conditions mentioned in the
T&C herein.
b.

Termination of the SelfCoin Project

Without being contrary to anything contained herein, SelfCoin shall be entitled to
terminate SelfCoin ICO if any of the following events occurs:
• With or without reasons, SelfCoin elects to cease the development of the
SelfCoin Blockchain prior, during or after any step of the SelfCoin ICO by
making an announcement;
• The development of SelfCoin Blockchain is required by any applicable law or
regulations to terminate before, during or after any step of the SelfCoin ICO;
• SelfCoin being notified by any government in any jurisdiction that SelfCoin
ICO is under investigation, prohibited, banned or forced to cease; and
• The development of SelfCoin Blockchain discontinues prior to the SelfCoins
issue due to any force majeure event and SelfCoin cannot reasonably expect
resumption will take place within six (6) months.

SelfCoin shall retain its full discretion to declare termination of SelfCoin ICO upon the
occurrence of any of the above events while SelfCoins purchasers shall not be
entitled to object to or deny the decision made by SelfCoin.
Notwithstanding the termination of SelfCoin ICO:
• the representations and warranties made by each SelfCoins purchaser shall
remain true, complete, accurate and non-misleading; and
• the risk factors as set forth in the present Article 5 of the T&C shall survive.
6. Loss or inexistence of SelfCoins utility functions
Resulting of the elements mentioned above, and although we anticipate that
SelfCoins holders will benefit in the future from certain utility functions of SelfCoin
Platform, SelfCoins will have no such utility at issuance. Although SelfCoin will
endeavor to develop the SelfCoin Blockchain and apply utility functions for the
benefit of SelfCoins holders, there can be no assurance that the SelfCoins will ever
provide any functional utility.
7. Risk of capital loss
The value of SelfCoins is not guaranteed. Purchasing SelfCoins entails a significant
capital risk, which SelfCoins purchasers acknowledge and accept. These SelfCoins do
not belong to regulated financial institutions and the loss of some or all of their value
is not insured.
8. SelfCoin governance and resources
SelfCoin team will have broad discretion in the use of SelfCoin ICO proceeds and
purchasers of SelfCoins will have to rely upon their judgment. At present, the
SelfCoin ICO proceeds are expected to be used to fund the technical development,
promotion, legal structuring, marketing, ecosystem building and on-going
maintenance of the SelfCoin Platform and Individuals ICOs. While SelfCoin’s directors
endeavor to spend these funds as effectively as possible, any failure to effectively
deploy the sale proceeds could have a material adverse effect on the development of
SelfCoin Blockchain and the utility of the SelfCoins.
SelfCoin company does not have substantial resources by itself. SelfCoin does not
have any legally binding commitment from any person to contribute additional
capital or to make any loan to it. If SelfCoin was to be unable to fund its operations in
the future, or if SelfCoin was to become the subject of a bankruptcy or other
insolvency proceeding, SelfCoin might be unable to continue to operate the SelfCoin
Blockchain, the SelfCoin Project and the utility of SelfCoins could be materially
adversely affected.

9. SelfCoin Project attractiveness and effect on decentralized blockchain
technologies
The utility and benefits of SelfCoin Project depends on the popularity of the SelfCoin
Blockchain. SelfCoins may not be popular, prevalent or widely transacted soon after
the SelfCoin ICO. SelfCoins may remain marginalized in the long run, appealing to
only a minimal fraction of the general public.
The absence of active users and low level of commercial utilization may negatively
affect the long-term development and future of SelfCoin Project.
After the SelfCoin ICO, SelfCoin will not be responsible for the subsequent circulation
of SelfCoins. There will be no obligation for SelfCoin to redeem, repurchase or
acquire any SelfCoins from any SelfCoins holder.
There can be no guarantee or assurance that there will be a market or marketplace
where holders may readily buy or sell SelfCoins. Due to regulation issues, some
jurisdiction may forbid the trading of SelfCoins on exchanges on their territory or for
their nationals. SelfCoin does not control public access to SelfCoins on exchanges
where SelfCoins are or will be listed. However, all potential SelfCoins purchasers on
these exchanges shall be subject to the same prerequisites than those imposed to
SelfCoins purchasers during the SelfCoin ICO as detailed under Article 2 of the
present T&C.
These elements may conduct to large fluctuations in price over short timeframes for
SelfCoins. SelfCoins purchasers agree not to attempt to divert the SelfCoins function
for speculative purposes. SelfCoin will not be responsible for any secondary market
trading of SelfCoins, regardless whether such markets exist or not for SelfCoins.

10. Other material risks
SelfCoin and its advisors may not be held liable for any of the following:
• use of SelfCoin services that are not considered as compliant with the present
T&C;
• non-performance, failure, malfunction or unavailability of the SelfCoin
Platform for any reason;
• mismatch between the services developed and the SelfCoins purchaser’s
needs;
• suspension of access or suspension of services (in particular arising from a
request issued by an appropriate administrative or judicial authority, or
notification received from a third party);
• security incidents relating to use of the Internet, concerning in particular, the
loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure or unauthorized access to the

•
•

investor’s data or details on or via the internet; and
loss, alteration or destruction of all or part of the content (information,
personal or financial data, files or other items) hosted on SelfCoin Platform;
damages to systems, application and other items installed by the purchaser or
by any third party on the infrastructure.

11. Unforeseen risks
Cryptocurrencies and cryptographic tokens are a new, untested technology. In
addition to the risks stipulated above, there are other risks that SelfCoin cannot
predict. Risks may also occur as unanticipated combinations or as changes in the risks
stipulated herein.

Article 6 – Representations and Warranties
Except as expressly stated in these T&C, SelfCoin Platform SelfCoins and all SelfCoin
services are provided on an "as is" and/or "under development" basis, without

•

•
•

•
•

•

agent of any kind in relation to such SelfCoins purchaser’s participation in the
SelfCoin ICO;
He is of sufficient age to participate in the SelfCoin ICO and is a person with
full civil capacity of conduct under the laws of the jurisdiction where he is
domiciled or maintains citizenship;
He is acquiring SelfCoins for a future use of SelfCoin Platform and will not use
the SelfCoins for the purpose of speculative investments;
He is a sophisticated and experienced professional trader, expert, or
technician in the fields of distributed ledger technology and cryptographic
tokens and such SelfCoins purchaser is fully aware of the risks associated with
the development and use of SelfCoins, experienced enough to be fully
capable of operating, maintaining and safekeeping his SelfCoins wallet private
key out of which such SelfCoins purchaser makes any contribution for
purchasing the SelfCoins and that he is the beneficial owner of such
cryptographic token wallet and attached SelfCoins;
He has thoroughly reviewed and comprehended these T&C and the SelfCoin
White Paper in full;
All the above representations and warranties made by a SelfCoins purchaser
are true, accurate, complete and non-misleading on and from the date of
such SelfCoins purchaser making a contribution during SelfCoin ICO and
thereafter.
SelfCoin reserves the rights to deny and invalidate the contribution by, and
withhold the distribution of relevant SelfCoins from, any SelfCoins purchaser
who has made a false, incomplete or misleading representation, based on the
sole judgment of SelfCoin.

Article 7 – Protection of Personal data
Pursuant to the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) and the subsequent General
Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that will apply from 25 May 2018 that may
apply to some of the SelfCoins purchasers depending on their nationality or
residence, SelfCoin shall implement appropriate measures to prevent any
unauthorised use or disclosure of any personal data made available to and processed
by SelfCoin in connection with SelfCoin Platform and the SelfCoin ICO.
To this end, SelfCoin will implement and maintain physical and technical measures
that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, security and
availability of the SelfCoins purchaser data.
SelfCoin will not process any of the personal data collected during KYC/AML process
as provided by article 2 (d) of the present T&C, realized during the ICO. If this
situation was about to change, the processing of personal data that could be
performed on the platform would be declared in France to the National Commission

for Data Protection and Liberties if needed. In accordance with Article 32 of French
law N° 78-17 of 6 January 1978 relating to Information Technology, Files and Civil
Liberties, SelfCoin, which is responsible for processing the said data, will immediately
inform the SelfCoins purchasers by email that it is processing their personal data.
For the sake of KYC/AMF and SelfCoin activities, SelfCoin will limit the personal data
raised from SelfCoins purchasers and Talents to the minimum necessary to propose
its services with respect to KYC/AMF best practices and Individuals ICO valuation
requirements. Access to this information will be limited to SelfCoin personnel or to
any trusted third party for the sole purpose of the provision of the SelfCoin services
or KYC/AML process.
Besides, all SelfCoins purchasers acknowledge that SelfCoin may be required to
provide the Covered Data to any regulatory bodies or administrative authorities if
required by law.
SelfCoin will keep SelfCoins purchaser’s data only for as long as is it is necessary, or as
required by law.
Any SelfCoins purchaser is entitled to object to the processing of his personal data for
legitimate reasons, as well as to object to the use of such data for the purposes of
prospecting activities.
Pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation, SelfCoins purchaser shall be
entitled to request access to, rectification, erasure of his own personal data, or
restriction of processing concerning SelfCoins purchaser or to object to processing as
well as the right to data portability. However, given the immutable nature of
blockchain technology used, SelfCoins purchaser may not be able to exercise all of
these rights.
However, as far as technically possible, SelfCoin will will make its best efforts to
enable SelfCoins purchaser to exercise his rights. To do so, the SelfCoins purchaser
shall notify in writing his request to SelfCoin, with a copy of its signed ID document to
the following address: hi@selfsell.com.

Article 8 – Legislative and/or Regulatory Developments
SelfCoin ICO is drafted and circulated worldwide via the Website and has not been
registered under any law of any jurisdiction so far. SelfCoins purchasers may be from
any jurisdiction in the world except for countries where the SelfCoin ICO, the
distribution or use of the information set out in this SelfCoin White Paper or the
acquisition or ownership of crypto-tokens would be contrary to law or regulation of
such jurisdiction.

Article 9 – Force Majeure
Force majeure is deemed any event beyond the parties’ control, which they cannot
reasonably foresee or reasonably avoid or overcome, provided that its occurrence
makes it impossible for the parties to fulfill their obligations, and adversely affects
purchase execution (e.g. earthquake, storm or other element of nature, embargoes,
substantial change in the price of resources, electrical telecommunications,
hardware, software or other utility failures, armed conflicts, labor disputes or other
industrial disturbances, changes in laws or regulations, changes in blockchain
technologies, etc.). The most diligent Party shall promptly notify the other Party by
any means, and the Parties will then agree to negotiate in good faith any changes
required to ensure the continuity of contract obligations. If, however, such
impossibility exceeds three (3) months, the most diligent Party may terminate the
contract in writing without incurring its liability and without entitling the other party
to claim any right of compensation, with SelfCoin retaining previously collected
amounts, which are irrevocably acquired.

Article 10 – Miscellaneous
1. No representation or warranty
SelfCoin disclaims and makes no representation or warranty with respect to SelfCoin
ICO, SelfCoin Blockchain or SelfCoins (including but not limited to its merchantability
or fitness for any particular purpose), except those expressly specified herein. Each
SelfCoins purchaser’s decision to participate in SelfCoin ICO and purchase any
SelfCoin shall be made based on such SelfCoins purchaser’s own knowledge of
SelfCoin, SelfSell Project, SelfCoins and the information disclosed herein or in the
SelfCoin White Paper. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, each
SelfCoins purchaser will, upon SelfCoin ICO, accept SelfCoins and the purchased
SelfCoins on an "as is" basis, irrespective of its technical specifications, parameters,
performance or function.
2. No liability
SelfCoin expressly disclaims any liability, and shall under no circumstances be liable
to any person, in connection with or arising out of:

associated with, caused by, in connection with, consequential to or incidental
to that particular risk factor.

3. Tax
Each SelfCoins purchaser shall take full responsibilities to declare, bear and pay all
taxes, duties, imposts, levies, tariffs and surcharges that might be imposed by the
laws and regulations of any jurisdiction as a result of or in connection with the
receipt, holding, use, purchase, appreciation, trading, remittance or disposal of

And each SelfCoins purchaser shall be solely liable for all such penal consequences,
claims, fines, penalties, liabilities or otherwise arising from his underpayment, undue
payment, belated payment or non-payment of any relevant tax. SelfCoin does not
give any advice on tax related matters and makes no representation as to the tax
implication, if any, of any SelfCoins purchaser’s participation in SelfCoin ICO. It is the
responsibility of each SelfCoins purchaser to consult his tax advisors before
purchasing SelfCoins during and after SelfCoin ICO.
4. No Waiver
From time to time, SelfCoin may fail to require, or strictly enforce a SelfCoins
purchaser’s compliance in relation to any provision in this SelfCoin White Paper.
SelfCoin may also fail to exercise any or all of its rights empowered herein. Such
failure shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of SelfCoin's right to
assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. If
applicable, an express waiver given by SelfCoin of any condition, provision, or
requirement of the SelfCoin White Paper shall not constitute a waiver of any future
obligation to comply with such condition, provision or requirement.

5. Severability
If any portion of this SelfCoin White Paper is held to be illegal, unenforceable or
invalid, whether in whole or part, under the laws of any jurisdiction, such illegality,
unenforceability or invalidity shall not affect the legality, enforceability or validity of
the rest of the SelfCoin White Paper in that jurisdiction, nor the legality,
enforceability or validity of the SelfCoin White Paper in any other jurisdiction.
