1. INTRODUCTION
“Cash, after millennia as one of mankind’s most versatile and enduring technologies, looks setover thenext15 years
or sofinally to melt away into an electronic stream of ones and zeros.”
---The Economist (2007)

In the world of today's mobile electronic banking, money is changing from a visible and touchable stuff to a string of
beating numbers on the Internet. In this context, a new form of currency, known as "cryptocurrency", exists in encrypted
string codes are invented . The digital currency revolution began in 2008 when the unknown Satoshi Nakamoto published
the Bitcoin white paper.

Now, almost every day new cryptocurrencies are born, and they all have one thing in common: the underlying
technology architecture is all - block chain.
The block chain itself is a shared public ledger that records and maintains all transaction records on the system from the first block to the moment. This book, named as block chain, consists of linked blocks, each of which contains
a certain number of transactions that have been verified by the network at a particular time.

The Internet of Things is an important part of the new generation information technology. Its English name is: "Internet
of things." As the name implies, the Internet of Things is the Internet that connects objects. This has two meanings:
First, the core and foundation of the Internet of Things is still the Internet. It is an expanded network based on the
Internet.
Second, its client extends from the computer's mobile phone to any items for information exchange and
communication. The Internet of Things is the "Internet of Things Connected."
The Internet of Things is changing our lives. It can also be seen that its true potential is still not being exploited on
a large scale. However, there are still many problems such as the security technology and other issues that limit the
development of the industry.
The blockchain is regarded as the most promising and most imaginative technological innovation in the world. It has
the basic attributes of decentralization, non-repudiation, non-discrimination, safety and irreversibility. How will we
integrate block chain technology into the Internet of Things?

This project will introduce a new IoT block chain technology called TOS, full name is ThingsOpreatingSystem, which
aims to solve some of the difficulties faced by existing blockchain technologies. This white paper highlights the issues
that TOS needs to address, the goals of the project itself, how TOS overcomes the limitations of existing block chains,
and the TOS technical specifications.

TOS is a decentralized hierarchical block network technology based on SDAG for the Internet of Things (IoT) industry.
This technology has good scalability ,it combines the technologies of blockchain book and the technologies of directed
acyclic graph to realize automatic distribution of massive transaction data to hierarchical block network to reduce data
redundancy of the entire network block and solve the massive data storage problem of the Internet of Things industry;
Users can decide to use free or paid transactions according to the value of the data,which reaches the balance of
password economics; the open source and decentralized network protocols reduce the economic barrier to join the smart
IoT network protocol (blockchain + IoT), they create a Cross-category、Cross-region smart-connected network protocol
ecosystem.

3. DISCUSSION OF EXISTING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES
For the sake of discussion, we will focus on the representative of the most widely used and studied block chain
technology applications so far - Bitcoin and Ethereum.
The research results of Yli-Huomo etc can be used as an important reference for the verification of blockchain
technology. It summarizes the progress of the recent block chain technology and points out the inherent limitations of
the block chain system. Although their research is entirely focused on documentsthat discuss Bitcoin , this finding applies
in our discussion as well. Some key indicators come from Swan.
Research points out seven limitations of current block chain systems:
- Throughput
- Latency
- Size and Bandwidth
- Security
- Usability
- Wasted Resources
-Versioning, Hard Forks, and Multiple Chains

Throughput
A typical blockchain (such as Bitcoin) takes 10 minutes or less to confirm the transaction. The average transaction
rate is about 4 transactions per second and up to 7 transactions per second. Ethereum can process 10 or more
transactions per second, and the validation time is 10 times faster than on the Bitcoin network. However, comparing with
the VISA transaction network, the limitations of the current blockchain transaction throughput can be clearly seen: VISA
can confirm the transaction in a few seconds, processing an average of 2000 transactions per second, and the highest
transaction volume per second is up to 65,000. From these indicators, it can be seen that there is still a large gap between
the transaction throughput of the most used blockchain networks at present compared to traditional centralized payment
networks (such as VISA). The main factor limiting the throughput of blockchain network transactions is the delay between
nodes. Although people have made some positive attempts and tried to solve this problem, such as the Lightning Network
adopted by Bitcoin, and the lightning grid that has been operated as a micro-version on the Ethereum blockchain.
Networking, etc., but no consensus has been reached on a feasible solution for the long terms.

Latency
As it is mentioned above, since the maximum transaction throughput of the network is limited by the delay between
nodes, the delay becomes a limiting factor of the blockchain. If there is a high delay between nodes, miners are more
likely to mine on old blocks. On the bitcoin network, the average time for one block to synchronize to 50% of the nodes

is less than 2 seconds, and synchronization to 90% of the nodes takes about 13 seconds (as of April 2017). In Ethereum,
the average time for synchronizing to 50% of the nodes is less than 1 second, and the time for synchronizing to 90% of
the nodes is about 10 seconds. For Bitcoin, the ratio of block-out time to network-synchronization time is large, indicating
that the delay between nodes does not yet constitute a large limiting factor, while Ethereum's block-out interval is short
it will be more problematic to spend too much time in synchronization. Ethereum, however, uses an algorithm based on
the GHOST protocol to motivate miners to mine on the longest chains, rather than attempting to generate the branching
chains by using the high delays and low time intervals.

Size and Bandwidth
When discussing size and bandwidth, two issues must be considered: the size of the physical data of the entire
blockchain, and the size of a single block sent througt the network. According to the requirements, as a complete node
that can dig out new blocks and interact with the blockchain network, a local copy of the complete blockchain must be
kept. Obviously, the storage space requirement for retaining this copy is proportional to the number of blocks on the
chain, which may lead to centralization, because if the blockchain becomes large enough, there will be only a few nodes
that has the ability to perform block operations. In addition, when the transaction volume begins to break through the
limit of available bandwidth, and the block size limit, the miner’s fee will increase significantly. In order to achieve greater
throughput, it may be necessary to modify the core agreement to obtain larger block capacity or shorter block
confirmation time. Faced with this situation, the core protocol must be modified, but the resulting hard fork is often
difficult to be accepted.

Security
The biggest selling point of proof of work (PoW) blockchain is that it is technically difficult to crack. If an attacker
wants to modify blocks that are already on the blockchain, they need to redo the workload proof for the block and all
subsequent blocks. In order to implement such an attack, at least 51% of the hash power of the entire network is needed,
and therefore it is also referred to as "51% attack." This is obviously unlikely to happen because the mining revenue
generated by having 51% of the computing power is far greater than the gain from the attack.

Usability
In the Bitcoin block chain, transactions are released approximately every ten minutes, but afterwards it usually takes
50 minutes or more to confirm subsequent transactions. This is similar to buying real estate in the real world, and wait
for an hour to pay in line. For a program that wants to be applied in real time in the real world, this is obviously
unacceptable.

Wasted Resources
Bitcoin has a considerable impact on electricity and the environment. According to current estimates, to verify a
transaction requires 249 kWh of electricity, the miners on the Bitcoin blockchain consume 32 TWh of electricity each
year to continuously mine new blocks. Although Ethereum is relatively low in power consumption, its energy consumption
and environmental impact are still large. In fact, if you add up the power to keep Bitcoin and Ethereum working, it will be
enough to supply the electricity needs of Newzealand for one year. At present, some people have tried to change the
PoW blockchain and replaced it with the PoS. Ethereum is its most prominent supporter.

Versioning, Hard Forks, and Multiple Chains
The main problem with blockchain forking is the lack of consensus mechanisms and security. To give two
exaggerating examples, one side is a blockchain that is heavily inflated, occupies 100% of the available computing power
on Earth, and the other is 100 competing chains, each with 1% available power. Hard bifurcation is usually another
unwelcome result due to the destruction of the consensus mechanism. Blockchains will split or split into branch chain
due to the different ideologies of different people in their ecosystem. Well-known example includes the inability of Bitcoin
to expand into a convenient and cheap e-cash, resulting in the splitting of Bit Cash (BCH), and Ethereum Classic (ETC)
is also resulted from the inconsistency of various ideologies in the Ethereum blockchain. However, the hard bifurcation
is not always due to ideological fragmentation, it comes from changes in the core protocols of the blockchain system
many times, such as Ethereum's metropolitan upgrade in 2017. After the hard branches are formed, the hashing power
on the original chain still exists. However, in the hard fork that consensus cannot be achieved, hashing power is divided
into two competing chains, making the blockchain security level lower and vulnerable.

4. TOS DESIGN BACKGROUND
we have discussed above about some limitations of the existing blockchain technology. For these situations, the
original intention of the TOS is to build a highly available blockchain technology and use blockchain technology to solve
the difficult points such as massive data storage in the Internet of Things industry, high-concurrency, transaction costs,
and the difficulties of mining the data’s value.

First of all, in TOS technical design, the analysis of existing blockchain technology achievements, such as PoW
consensus is a very large waste of resources,it is not our ideal model that to maintain the stability of the Bitcoin network
by consuming large amounts of electricity,and the concurrent amount of its transactions is relatively low ;the problems
such as the high concurrent volume of the Internet of Things, the big transaction cost cannot be solved by bitcoin
technology . However, we have enlightened by entangling the block network structure with the existing DAG technology.
The consensus built by using DAG technology can achieve high concurrency and free transactions;moreover the current
existing mature PoS rights proof consensus form the combination of free and paid transaction, on the basis of free and
paid type, and traded miner's fees, it is better to separate the data according to the value tag to dig the value of the
data.

Then, although using existing DAG technology can achieve high concurrent volume and free transactions, it is
impossible to solve the problems of massive data storage, the time of the ransaction data cannot be determined and
data value classification in the Internet of Things. These issues are crucial and cannot be ignored.

Finally, the existing public-chain technology is only applied to the digital currency's transaction and circulation, but
it has not really reached the enterprise-level commercial application. Technically, highly available commercial-level public
chain technologies need to be secure, scalable, and decentralized. Because in the blockchain technology world there is
an iron-triangle relationship that checks and balances each other. It is safe, scalable, and decentralized. Based on this
contradiction, a large amount of analysis is performed on the existing blockchain technology. We design some new
technical index models, such as the economic value of the block network and the adjustment of smart miner's fees.
Finally, to re-architecture the existing blockchain technology, there is TOS's core SDAG layered block network technology.

In the hierarchical block design of the TOS, all the blocks in the blockchain are first formed into a DAG block network
structure by a chain topology, and then the DAG block network is layered into a number of DAG block network layers,
each of the DAG block network is linked by the "parent network hash" value inside the block. First, the block is entangled
into a DAG block network. different levels of the DAG block network form a chain relationship, and each unit in the chain
can be seen as a DAG block network; then, a combination of free and fee-based transactions is added to separate the
transaction data according to the value tag. The more important the data is, the higher layer the data will be stored in

the block network.In the hierarchical block design of the TOS, all the blocks in the blockchain are first formed into a DAG

higher layer the data will be stored in the block network; ultimately, the crypto economy Balancing mechanism ensures
the high availability of commercial activities, plus the TVM virtual machine for smart contracts creates a decentralized
hierarchical block network technology based on SDAG.

The technology of layered blocks, the combination free and fee-transation to solve the block data redundancy,
transaction performance and transaction costs, and data value classification of TOS is just the beginning of a
commercially available public-chain technology solution. In this ecosystem, in the future of our strategic plan , more will
be included such as the full data type of the upper chain, block data storage incentives, data banks and other roles to
build a complete and highly available commercial-level public chain ecosystem.

5. INTRODUCTION OF TOS
Introduction of TOS chain,a decentralization layered block network technology based on SDAG .

Super directed acyclic graph,it is based on existing DAG technology, PoS Rights are added on the basis of the
Transaction consensus,and they are combined into TPoS Consensus.It constructs a hierarchical block entanglement
network by using the S-mechanisms (Smart miner) functions and B-algorithm (Block chain network economic algorithm)
algorithms. Block chain networks at each layer stores the corresponding data, similar to the administrative division such
as province > city > county > district, each administrative center manages its own data. The block data of the whole
network are separated,so that there is no need for one province to care the data of the other province ,same among the
countries . Each block network is only concerned with the block data that is needed, so that a large amount of data can
be reduced.It increase TVM virtual machine and Transaction and PoS management contract,to build SDAG smart contract.
Ultimately SDAG can do the followings: users can decide to use free or paid transactions based on the value of the data.
It is a special decentralized system,it combines two technologies, block chain book and directed acyclic graph. Therefore,
two different consensuses are included. They are divided and ordered and data are kept in sync,all are indispensable.

Block information
We define that all blocks in a network system contain a block head, which includes an effective JSON data format.

{
"parentblockhash": "00000000c937983704a73af28acdec37b049d214adbda81d7e2a3dd146f6ed09",

"transactioncost": "0",
"totalweight": "12",
"weight": "1"
}

Among them, there are the hash value of the parent block, the hash value of the previous block, the hash value of
the current block, the hash value of the MerkleRoot, Transaction cost, the total weight of the block, and the weight of
the transaction in the block.

Weights and related concepts
We define that each block has its own weight, total weight of the block and its related concepts. The weight of the
block is in proportion to the amount of work that has been put to the transaction node. Each transaction that has been
sent, will be automatically marked as an unauthenticated transaction in the network system, attached with an initial weight
value. When a trader himself participates in the network using Transaction work proof, if the proof is verified, the total
weight of the new block is the total weight of the verified direct indirect node plus the latest weight of the block.The
design of block chain nodes ensures that the data in decentralized global databases is secure, trusted, and can not be
tampered with. Adding new nodes in the block chain requires block chain node auditing in the network. The system will
tuck the DAG data structure so that it will not continue to diverge. Through the TPoS consensus verification algorithm,
the TOS node reached a consensus to achieve rapid transactions. It solves the problem of double payment and data
tampering between fragmented blocks generated in the traditional block chain structure, and solves the problem that the
large number of transactions may eventually become invalid result from the unsuccessful fragmentation.

TPoS-Transaction
We define, by verifying the terminal blocks that have not been verified,each trader itself can generate new blocks
and concatenate any two terminal blocks to prove the effectiveness of the transaction. Based on the fact that the honest
node will not directly or indirectly verify the block with conflicts, then as the number of transactions increases, the current
block will be more and more new block directly or indirectly transaction verification, the system will It tends to be safe
and stable. In other words, it is extremely difficult for a transaction to be paid by twice.. Transaction certificate is verified
by traders themselves, which does not need to pay in the process, so the new block transactioncost generated by
Transaction verification is 0.Through the TOS node to receive the transaction, and record the transaction data to the
block chain, so that the block chain produces new blocks. When the TOS node conducts transaction verification, it first
monitors the economic value of the block network through the B-algorithm algorithm, then selects the Transaction or
PoS for preliminary verification based on the S-mechanisms mechanism, and completes the transaction quickly. After
reaching consensus on the entire network, it extends TOS block network.

TPoS-PoS
We define, nodes can guaranteed by digital currency , consensus algorithm in virtual mining is used to verify the
transaction data and to generate new blocks. Cost is required in this process, so the transactioncost of the new block
generated by validation is more than 0. Because the miners pay out the labor costs, the profits are allocated by the
miners in proportion to the labor costs.
we have an algorithm mechanism to monitor the total number of nodes and data in the entire network to estimate
the economic value of the block network. The value includes the total economic values of the current block network and
all sub blocks. When the economic value of the current network reaches a threshold, costs will be required to auto-trigger
the next block verification. Certainly , users can also set transaction costs without reaching the threshold of the whole
network. When the transaction is successful, transaction costs will be written in the new block. We will have a checking
algorithm to verify the amount of such personal behavior. If amount of behavior is too small , it will not affect the costfree Transaction authentication mechanism. When the economic value reaches the agreed value of the system, interest
drives some people to use the PoS verification in the network. The miners complete the verification and get paid and
also the cost will be written to the transactioncost value of the block, which means the block network entry into the
period of cost-needed in advance.
At this point, the user has two options,1.continue to generates transaction data in this block network but need to pay
a certain amount of transaction costs;2. choose the cost-free transaction if they do not want to pay , then the network
system will automatically generate a new sub block network from the current block and the new transaction will be written
into sub blocks network. The automatic branch function of the block network is achieved. These phenomenon are the
result of the interaction of the participants in the network. When the number of nodes is large enough, the TOS block

networks with different layers are automatically formed as time goes on. Each block network has only the data access
rights to the current block and all sub block network . The same layer block network data can not interact directly, but
can communicate data through the parent block network. In this way, the mass data of the Internet of things will
spontaneously form different sub block networks based on different regions. Massive data is cut into numerous blocks.
The whole network data of the original block chain share one account book originally and now it changes to be one
parent block network with numerous small account books. There are numerous small accounts. The sub block network is
only responsible for managing its own small account book. This is the slimming of the TOS block chain, and can also
better manage the large data.

6. CORE GOALS TOS
Working mode of the SDAG , the core technology of the TOS.

In the case of network work, TOS runs as follows. It is a tree structure consisting of several different layers of DAG
(directed acyclic graph), also known as the SDAG (super directed acyclic graph). All blocks sent through the node
constitute the set of this super acyclic graph DAG, and there is no global block chain in SDAG. Each time when a new
transaction occurs, a new block is generated and the new block must verify the previous two blocks. We define that when
the new node verifies the old node, the the new node is called output and the old node is called input. The total number
of input and output of nodes in the same layer network can not exceed 2. Each node is similar to the quadruple link of
carbon ions, but the two keys as input and two keys as output. These validation relationships are represented by a
directional edge, as shown in Figure 1 (in the graph, the time always goes from the left to the right). If there are at least
two paths with directed edges between the block of transaction A and transaction B, we say that the block of transaction
A verifies the block of transaction B directly ,and verifies the block of transaction E indirectly. We believe that the honest
node will check whether there is a conflict in the verification transaction and will not directly or indirectly verify the block
with the conflicting transaction. In the previous mechanism, as the new block generated by the transaction will directly
or indirectly verify the block in the block network, the number of verified blocks increases, and the entire block is accepted
by the block network. In other words, to forge a double deal is extremely difficult (or at least in practice is almost
impossible).

The working mode of the hierarchical network based on SADG is as follows:

1) The block is set to record the transaction records in the block genesisprocess. DAG technology is used to connect
the blocks,multiple blocks are interconnected to form a block network. The economic value of the block network includes
the parametric models such asthe number of nodes in the block network,the number of transactions recorded, the
transaction amount, and the miner’s fees for transactions.The B-algorithm algorithm (Block-chain network economic
algorithm) is used to calculate the economic value of the corresponding hierarchical block network . The mathematical
formula of the B-algorithm algorithm is a complicated curve function, and the function value can reach a threshold
(evolveValue) over time. The function value E(t) in the future must be a fluctuation curve that is greater than the threshold
value (evolveValue).
2) Set the economic value function of the block network to E, define α, β, γ and δ as constant coefficients, and
the current network node number is N; among them, the total number of transactions in the block network is T, and the
total transaction amount in the block network is M, The total miner’s fee for the transaction in the block network is F,
and the mathematical model for the economic value of the block network E(t) is as follows:

𝐸 𝑡 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝 𝛼𝑁) +

𝑒𝑥𝑝 𝛽𝑇./ + 𝛾𝑀)/ + 𝛿𝐹)/
):)→)/

3) A threshold value (evolveValue) is set as the critical value of the economic value of the block network, and the
intelligent miner fees adjustment mechanism of the S-mechanisms mechanism (Smart miner fees regulatory mechanisms)
is set to realize the block network generation and stratification system. In the working principle of the S-mechanisms
mechanism, when the economic value of a block network is less than the critical value, the new block is verified and
written into the end of the block network through the Transaction consensus verification; when the economic value of a
block network is greater than the critical value the new block is verified by the PoS consensus miner to write to the end
of the block network; or, the new block is verified by the Transaction consensus verification to generate the next block
network of the block network, thereby realizing the layering of the block network.
4) Different levels of block networks correspond to different trading rules. The corresponding trading rules are
excuted for the new transaction according to the choice of the users . Blocks at different levels meet the needs that the
earlier block generated , the higher the block network layer is , the transaction rules specifically include the following
steps:
- If a new block is written in the lowest level block network, perform the Transaction verification;
- If a new block is written in others level block network ,perform the POS miner verification.
In the Transaction verification method, any two blocks are verified, and the verification result is recorded together
with the transaction in a new block. In the PoS miner verification method, the miner pays a deposit and places a bet on
what he thinks is the next block that can be written into the block network. IN the block that is written into the block

network,the mining contacts will decides that parts of the miners who participate in bet wins and is responsible for
packing the transaction. If the bet wins, all miners who have been correctly guessed will get back the deposit and collect
transaction fees, and verify any two blocks; if the miners on the network deal without packaging the data and wait for a
consensus on the block generated by the next round of miners, some of the deposits will be deducted, when the miners'
behavior violates the relevant regulations in the system, the deposits will be forfeited and they will also be disqualified
from participating in the genesis of the block.
Transaction verification and PoS miner transaction verification also calculate the cumulative total weight value for
this block during the process of verification. The cumulative total weight value is the sum of the block transaction weight
values from the genesisblock to all blocks in the longest path of the current block.Genesisblock is the first generated
block.
The greater the absolute value of the difference between the cumulative total weight of the block in the block network
and the cumulative total weight of the block at the end of the network, the more times the block is verified and the higher
the security of the block is. The cumulative total weight value is the sum of the block transaction weight values all the
blocks in the longest path from the genesisblock to the current block. The path refers to all the blocks that has been
passed from the current block along the block verification direction (ie, the direction of the arrow) to the genesis block.
The higher level of the block network the transaction is written into , the more transaction fee is required to pay. And
the block can only verify and deal with the block of the current block network, the parent block network and the Subblock network, and the parent block network is the last block of the current block,the sub-block network is the next layer
network of the current block.
When each transaction that needs to be recorded is sent in the system, the system will mark it as an unverified
transaction with an initial weight value. When the trader participates in the transaction certificate in the network, if the
verification is completed, the cumulative total weight of the new block is the sum of the maximum total weight of the two
blocks verified and the weight of the current block.
When the number of nodes and traders in the network are sufficient, the block of the TOS network forms a plurality
of different-level block networks. As shown in the following figure, the earlier the block network is formed, the higher the
level of the block network is. The higher; the block in the A-block network is the earliest block network and it is the
highest-level block network, B1~B4 is the sub-block network of the A-block network, and the A-block network is the
parent block network of B1~B4 block.The C1~C2 block networks are at the bottom of the current block network, which is
the lowest layer of the current layer block network; The higher level block networks gradually derive into multiple lower
levels in the transaction. and so on, eventually it formed a block network structure similar to oceans, rivers, and streams.

Each block network only stores the transaction book in the hierarchical block network. When the node synchronizes
data in the blockchain network, it only needs to synchronize the data in the node network and the higher-level block
network, not necessary to synchronize all the blocks, which can save a lot of storage space for a single node's ledger,
also greatly reduces the node storage load. The system automatically determines which level of the block network the
transaction is recorded in according to the transaction fees that the users are willing to pay. The more transaction fees
the user pays, the higher the level of the block network the transaction can be written to , and the more securer the
transaction data will be . Meanwhile , the higher the security level of the blocks is , the greater the value of the data is,
which is more conducive to later data management and data mining.
When the user selects the transaction fee as 0, the Transaction verification method is executed. If the economic
value of the current block network is greater than the threshold, a new sub-block will be generated from the end of the
current block network and the transaction will be recorded in the new block. Otherwise,the transaction will be recorded
in the current block network. When the user chooses the transaction fee to be greater than 0, the POS miner transaction
verification method is executed, and the system automatically determines the corresponding hierarchical block network
according to the miner fee. The higher the user is willing to pay, the higher the block level is written.
SDAG is a kind of hierarchical block network technology with high concurrency, fast transaction speed, and it can
support for different hierarchical block networks to use different transaction types. The Transaction certification method
adopted by the lowest level block network has a simple block generation mechanism and large concurrent transaction
volume. The PoS miner transaction verification method adopted by the high level network is slow but the transaction
security is high. With the organic combination of the high layer block network transaction method and low level block
network transaction methods, the shortcomings of small concurrency, slow speed, and equal status of all transactions
have been overcame.

7. SDAG NETWORK FEATURES
Good augmentability
As we all know, due to the hierarchical block mechanism of the SDAG network, the network can have an infinitely
hierarchical sub-block function, which is like an infinite extension of the root. In the TPoS consensus block network, the
PoS is responsible for verifying the data with transaction costs，It is characterized by higher security, and the more
important the information is, the the higher layer network it can be written to by paying high transaction fees. The
Transaction verifies itself, and the transaction data is written to the terminal block network, which is relatively lower in
security than the PoS, but it can achieve high transaction volume and high throughput. In summary, SDAG has good
extensibility.

Support cost-free transaction
The Transaction certification itself can be cost-free, which is very convenient for many users. For example, the
demand of the equipment data of integrated mill in big Internet is : to be able to communicate with other devices, and
can access the third party authorized device data in the entire Internet of things. If the equipment belongs to the high
frequency data generator, it is unacceptable for each transaction data to be written to the block, which requires high
cost for the factory. At that time, the advantage of Transaction sharing mechanism is reflected. The factory can branch
itself into a terminal network (terminal sub net is the most end network in sub network). Transaction consensus validation
is used to record transaction data. Of course, someone will challenge the security because when the node of the terminal
network is small, it is possible to tamper with the data if paying enough for it. This security phenomenon is inevitable in
the current Internet. The motive of any perpetrator to attack is for the benefit. If it is some worthless or small amount of
data, the perpetrator will not have enough power to do such a loss. But if it's valuable data, you don't have to record it
in the terminal network. In other words, the user can determine the layer of the block network that records the data on
the basis of the value of its own data. The risk is the user's consideration, and the higher the security of the data, the
higher the cost you have to pay. This is also in line with economic phenomena, security needs the cost.

Block data stratified isolation
As it is mentioned above, the block network has infinite sub network function. The block network at each layer
stores the corresponding data and separates the block data of the whole network. The whole network block is divided
into branching blocks. There is no communication between the branch blocks. It can be understood as the Yangtze River

and its branches, the head stream of Yangtze river is the original region of the block. The main block network is as the
main road of the Yangtze River. There are numerous branch block network just as the numerous tributaries in the Yangtze
River. The writing of new transaction data in the sub block chain is like the flowing of water into the small streams.
Different sub blocks cannot change data directly just as those small streams cannot flow directly among each other. But
the reflection function can be used to check the corresponding sub block network data through the parent block network.
Such data are layered isolated. Therefore, the amount of data of each sub block of the network include the parent branch
network (minor groove > small stream > river > Yangtze river). The block data isolation mechanism in the network system
can greatly reduce the data redundancy of the whole network block. Further, as the data pressure of the node decreases,
the load of the system is lighter. It can be predicted that after the system runs a certain time, with the system mechanism,
the more important data will be stored in the upper block network. Therefore, SDAG can better support large data
management and high value data mining.

8. TECHNOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE & INNOVATION
TOS technology architecture

TOS technology innovation
1) SDAG support free transaction and charge transaction
Through the TPoS combined with the consensus mechanism, free transactions allow users to record common data
without transaction costs, which fits in with the massive data scenarios generated by IoT devices. Charge transactions
are applicable to the transfer of high value data transactions in the Internet of Things.The data is recorded in high-level
block network, with better circulation and higher security.

2) SDAG has unlimited hierarchical block network capabilities
SDAG uses the S-mechanisms mechanism and B-algorithm algorithm to realize block network layering. The Balgorithm algorithm monitors the economic value of the block network. When the economic value of the network reaches
a threshold, the S-mechanisms mechanism will automatically trigger the next new block verification cost. At this point,
the user is faced with two choices, and the transaction data of the network in this block needs a fee. If the users want

to continue to use free transactions, the network system will layer a new sub-block network from the current block
network and write new transaction-generated blocks to the sub-block network，and achieve unlimited hierarchical block
network capabilities.

3) SDAG cryptographic economic balance mechanism.
The combination of free trade and fee trade can form checks and balances.Through the charge and free , a hierarchy
of data distribution can be formed . The free transaction data is only stored in the lower or final layer blocks while the
fee transaction is stored in the hierarchical block, and the higher the transaction fee is paid , the more you can store it.
In this way, it is possible to avoid the blockage of garbage data and reduce the amount of data in the hierarchy block.
Separate the data at different levels in block network,and store them in different layers according to the data value, it is
more suitable for data mining and the combination with human intelligent in the future.

4) Extended smart contract of SDAG

The blocks in the SDAG contain signature, block information, and parent block network information. Blocks are hashrelated and are the combination of blockchain ledger and directed acyclic graphs. However, the extension of SDAG is
based on the DAG technology. As far as the original DAG technology architecture itself is concerned, there is a big hidden
danger which is it cannot fully guarantee the atomic unity of the transaction status. In terms of time,it may be possible
that the time the specific nodes (such as remote nodes)confirm the transaction cannot be estimated. From the point of
node, there might be one node that unable to update the transaction information of a certain time, that is, the node has
not been broadcast to the transaction information at a certain time. These conditions for many commercial pattern is
extremely a hidden trouble. In order to solve this problem, the original DAG technology architecture has been improved,
and the virtual machine (TVM) was added to realize the intelligent contract in SDAG.

5) A hierarchical structure of internet of things
According to the hierarchical architectureof the Internet of Things, TOS designes corresponding standards protocols
for the perceptual layer, transport layer, and application layer to ensure that every step and level of the Internet of Things
is protected, managed, and controlled,and it eventually ensures data security and information disclosure and transparency.

5.1) Perceptual layer
The sensory layer use electronic tags, RFID, radio frequency or near-field technologies to identify, and then use
sensor networks to perceive in all aspects. Therefore, in terms of security protection, it is necessary to protect RFIDrelated physical devices, protect sensor nodes, and periodically perform security verification and authentication; it is also
necessary to establish information security transmission mechanisms between sensor nodes to ensure transmission，so
that the data cannot be captured by unauthorized nodes or it cannot be deciphered even it is captured.

5.2) Transport layer
The information sensed by the sensor is processed through the transmission layer to the application layer through
the preliminary processing and filtering,and then accesses the TOS network node. Therefore, end-to-end data encryption,
node security verification, and network access security must be guaranteed at the transport layer. The end-to-end
transmission security is ensured by technologies such as validation, authentication, and keys; in addition, data integrity
and security are ensured by relevant data encryption algorithms.

5.3) application layer
The amount of data transmitted to the application layer through the transport layer is large, and the data is
heterogeneous. Therefore, massive heterogeneous data needs to be processed at the application layer and converted
into TOS standard protocol format to access the uplink data in the network node. It is also necessary to establish a
unified standard system and security mechanism for data access rights, authorization management and other security
protection measures to strengthen the protection of personal privacy and various types of application data. First, each
smart device passes through the perceptual layer, the transport layer to the application layer, and the application layer
runs the compatible packet of each manufacturer. Then, the data converted by the compatible packet is accessed to the
TOS network node. The TOS decentralized block chain technology interconnects all intelligent devices.For manufacturers,
there is no need to change the existing equipment protocol standards, and after equipment data is put to the TOS chain ,
the manufacturer does not have a centralized data operating cost, and only needs a protocol compatibility package to
achieve Win-win. As the Internet of Things continues to infiltrate all walks of life and people's daily lives, there will be
certain security risks both in perception, transmission, and application processing phases. while the Internet of Things

data presents those characters such as large amount of data, heterogeneous, burstiness. Therefore, when adopting
relevant security measures for the Internet of Things, it is more necessary to carry out different management and control
in different stages and phases. The TOS adopts a layered security architecture for the Internet of Things. This structure
provides comprehensive protection for data awareness, data transmission, and data processing at the sensing, transport,
and application layers in order to comprehensively improve the security of the Internet of Things.

6) Decentralized IoT Operating System
The Internet of ThingsOpreatingSystem is a public business development platform with a rich and comprehensive
basic functional components and application development environment for the Internet of Things. It can greatly reduce
the development time and development cost of Internet of Things applications. The unified IoT operating system has
consistent data storage and data access methods, providing possibilities for data sharing between different industries.
The IoT operating system can break down industry barriers, enhance data sharing capabilities between different industries,
and even provide services “above the service industry “ such as data mining; the Internet of Things is very wide in general,
all the operating system can be applied in the field of the Internet of Things, the operating system is the strategic
commanding point in the era of the Internet of Things. Today, the operating system overlord of the PC and mobile phone
era may not be able to continue its legend in the Internet of Things. The law of the operating system industry is: When
the monopoly has been formed, the latecomers will find it difficult to subvert and can only wait for the next industrial
wave. Today, TOS is opening a new, decentralized operating system which is full of imagination.

9. TOS TECHNOLOGY ADVANTAGES IN IOT APPLICATIONS
The core technology of TOS, SDAG, solves the three pain points of the Internet of things:massive data storage, high
concurrency and large transaction costs.
For existing block chain technology, DAG technology can solve the problem of high concurrency and high transaction
cost. But the problems such as huge amount of data redundancy, the huge amount of network data transmission and the
inability to determine the time’s length of the transaction are not solved, and they are the problems that must be solved
in the Internet of things.

For SDAG, the core technology of TOS, the four features of it can solve the above problems:

Hierarchical block network
It reduces the large amount of data redundancy in the Internet of things, the data capacity of single node is smaller,
and the storage cost of equipment is reduced. Each node only needs to verify the current block network transaction data,
and improve transaction efficiency. Let us make a bold imagination, if there are 10, 000 hierarchical block networks, the
TPS in each layer is 7 per second, same as the bit coins, and the total TPS of TOS is 70,000. If the TPS performance of
a single layer of TOS is 1,000, then the total TPS of TOS is 10 million. In fact, SDAG is fully equipped with high TPS on
DAG technology, and can achieve a performance that thousand times as much as the bit coins. That is, the more the
block network is stratified, the higher the total TPS is, it can even reach tens of millions of levels or even more than one
billion.

TPoS consensus
Through the combination of TPoS (Transaction+PoS), users can choose to use free or paid Transaction according to
the importance of data. Free and paid mode coexist, the data store in different layers according to the transaction cost.

The virtual machine
TVM virtual machine can realize intelligent contract, in the Internet business applications, it has the event-driven
state, and the intelligence contacts stored and operated in the block chain contracts bring the security for both parties
and ensure the trusting trade in the absence of a third party, reduce unnecessary losses.

Reduce redundant transactions
In the TPoS (Transaction+PoS) consensus mechanism of the SDAG ,the hierarchical block network, a large number
of transactions can be collected within a block verified by PoS miners. If there is a double-flowering(double transaction)
problem, redundant transactions can be eliminated and the problem of redundant transactions or influence to the
verification efficiency of the transaction will not occur.

Because the Transaction consensus generates redundant transactions, the PoS consensus does not generate
redundant transactions. Therefore, before SDAG's current layered block network stratifies out of the sublayer block
network, Transaction consensus mechanism is used. When the economic value of the hierarchical block network reaches
the threshold, the PoS charging verification mechanism is automatically activated to avoid redundant transactions. so all
redundant transactions in the SDAG will only appear in the lowest-level economic value block network, and only at the
stage when the economic value of this layer network does not reach the threshold. It can be seen that the greater the
development of the hierarchical block network is , the lower the proportion of redundant transactions will be, in this way,
it will reduce a large number of redundant transactions.

According to the four characteristics of SDAG, in the TOS chain, first, the data redundancy of the nodes is very small,
and the storage space requirement for the equipment is very low; secondly, the network transmission data is reduced,
and the requirement for the network bandwidth is reduced; thirdly, Users can choose the transaction payment type so
that they can reduce transaction costs. Fourth, SDAG's hierarchical block network can achieve rapid transactions and
high TPS. Data is filtered by the S-mechanisms mechanism and then distributed to non-hierarchical block networks for
data mining. Fifth, reducing a large number of redundant transactions; Finally, intelligent contracts in the DApp commercial
application can compulsory perform the both parties' contracts and economic security. In summary, the TOS technical
solution is suitable for the Internet of Things industry.

10. APPLICATION SCENE
Enterprise-class intelligent hardware platform
The enterprise-class intelligent hardware platform is the basis of the TOS chain and the core application platform.
Based on smart contracts, devices, objects, data, logical methods, vouchers, etc., can be perfectly organized and
executed on the TOS chain, and provide operating environments and execution systems for other TOS applications. TOS's
intelligent hardware platform includes a wide range of application types and is optimized for applications in different
Internet of Things and different corporate environment scenarios. The types of smart contracts currently set are:

1) master class contact
Blockchain-based smart contracts include affairs processing and preservation mechanisms, as well as a complete
state machine for accepting and processing various smart contracts; and the state processing and saving of the affairs
are done on the block chain. Affairs mainly contain data that needs to be sent; events are descriptions of these data.
After the affairs and events information are passed to the smart contract, the resource status in the contract resource
will be updated, and trigger the smart contract to enter the storage statues judgment mechanism. If the trigger condition
of one or more actions in the automatic state machine is satisfied, the contract is automatically executed by the state
machine according to the preset information.
- Features:
• The world’s first block chain platform puts IoT device smart contracts into practical scenarios
- For example: Decentralized Smart Rental Case, A high-end apartment adopt a TOS decentralized rental program,
it replaces the yoke with a yoke that supports the TOS smart contract, and launch rental information in a block chain
mode rental website to formulate a rental agreement. Reservation and appointment will be made online. Once the
appointment is made, it will be temporarily deducted for a one-month rental guarantee and the passwords will be sent
to the tenants’ mobile phone and it will be valid for one hour. The tenant checks the room within one hour with the
password. If it is not satisfied, the tenant will go directly. After one hour, the password will be reset and the rent guarantee
will be refunded; if the tenants are satisfied with the apartment , the rental smart contract will become effective, rental
deposit free,and it will deduct rent DAPP TOKEN per month, and set the lock password for the tenant only. If the rent is
overdue, the lock will automatically change the password.. In the entire rental process, no sales escort is required, no
credit approval is required, and a great deal of manpower and material resources are saved.

2) Data settlement contract
The data settlement contract is used on the Internet of Things (IoT) device or other products that can provide data.
The owner of the device studies out data content that can be shared openly and provides data interfaces. The data
requesting party can follow the agreed price and method acquire data according to data interface at a fix time and
automatically complete settlement.
- Features:
• Supports a variety of different data types, as well as diverse data collection for IoT devices
• Support ultra-small payments ，ultra-low commission transactions and facilitate small payments to meet data
fragmentation trading needs
- For example: Users use driving data for transaction, User A has just bought car with transaction data \and intelligent
contacts, and drive it everyday. According to the content of the intelligent contract, as long as A agrees to share the data
anonymously including the driving habits, geographical trajectory, and information of the car, these data will be used to
analyze the driving habits of the driver, to complete the portrait analysis of the driver, to help merchant' Driverless AI to
improve Driving Model, and advertisers can also analyze the positioning user's preference based on the data, and perform
accurate advertisement placement on the device. In return, A won the DAPP TOKEN to offset the maintenance fees in
the 4S store, or to pay the petrol in the gas station.

3) TPoS consensus contacts
The TPoS consensus protocol is the core operating mechanism of the TOS. Through the Transaction consensus
based on the original DAG technology and the PoS consensus based on the Casper protocol, every IoT device connected
to the network can become a TOS miner . Smart devices can receive commissions by “virtual mining” through the PoS
Margin Economic Incentive Management Contract and ensure network security by verifying the previous two transaction
blocks and the mechanism of direct or indirect verification of transaction blocks. Due to the adoption of the TPoS
consensus of Transaction + PoS, in the TOS system, only a small amount of power is required to trade the Self-verification
Transaction consensus algorithm and the PoS Consensus Calculation Based on Margin Economic Incentive Agreement,
thereby avoiding wasteful calculations.
- Features
• Transaction consensus based on DAG technology, self-verification and indirect verification of transactions based
on a small amount of computational power
• Support PoS verification consensus to gain fees to provide continuous operating costs for miners
• Basic computing power to support IoT devices and embedded operation in the TOS environment
- For example: The XIAO MI sweeping robot becomes a central node, When XIAO MI sweeping robots were used in
homes, each of them became a TOS network node, and data reporting realized the functions of transaction verification
and data storage . By connecting more IoT device nodes and more transaction data, each smart device becomes part of

the TPoS consensus. As a result, the sweeping robot can provide its owner with PoS consensus to obtain TOS COIN by
"virtual mining" and to continue to create wealth.

4) Ledger type contract
TOS's blockchain technology can also use decentralized book functions to create, confirm, and transfer various types
of products and private placement, crowdfunding, and bond contracts. These forms can be used as TOS intelligent
hardware incubator platform for smart hardware distribution of crowd funding projects based on TOS, and use TOS's
complete block chain technology and data system to achieve richer types Smart Book Contracts.
- Features:
• Designed specifically for smart hardware companies to help their products on the chain
• Provides a wealth of contractual contents ranging from digital equity, digital items to digital bonds
• Providing a variety of upstream and downstream resources such as users, data, and APIs to intelligent hardware
companies who participate in the incubation .
- For example: There is not too much relation between a smart hardware company's products, and the block chain ,
and it is not convenient to issue token directly in the form of Ethereum. Using TOS's smart hardware contracts, crowd
funding can be directly based on hardware products. All participating users can use smart contracts to enjoy the future
sales share of hardware products after successful sales. Because every smart hardware is on the TOS chain,
manufacturers cannot falsify and must use smart contracts to make token settlements for users participating in crowd
funding to ensure that participants gain revenue.

Internet of Things Big Data Trading Platform
The TOS data exchange platform serves as the DApp application party in the TOS ecosystem, its DAPP TOKEN is
an important basis for the transaction in the TOS system. On this platform, equipment manufacturers can establish
channels for collecting data and sales data, and increase the benefits of the equipment to attract more users; equipment
users can provide personal data through this channel to obtain revenue; data buyers, such as advertisers, can also use
this platform to accurately locate users, perceive the user’s portrait data, and effectively achieve the purpose of
dissemination at a lower price.

For advertisers, a core concept of target users is “personal profile”: it refers to the individual’s age, gender, behavior,
personality, trend, etc. In short, it is what kind of person is the user? This is a key criterion for the “differentiated audience”
of advertising. Before the advent of the Internet, personal users were very slow to portray. With the rise of the Internet,
especially the mobile Internet, personal data suddenly entered the global internet in a way that could be easily shared and

copied. Network. Personal portraits become a growing ocean of data and are used by many people. The prospect of
advertising technology should have created a more efficient and transparent market that matches advertising with target
consumers. Digital technology should also make it easier to track the flow of transactions between advertisers and target
markets, and ensure that information reaches the target consumer groups. However, the advertising technology
ecosystem formed after 20 years of development is still full of all kinds of intermediary and complex transactions, which
is confusing. Advertisers have lost billions of dollars in revenue due to false data and inaccurate data, and fraud has been
rampant. Advertisers also suffer from poor feedback and insufficient accuracy. There is no doubt that all this requires a
good solution. TOS's data exchange platform currently includes the following two core modules: Smart Advertising
Communication and Data Trading Center.

1) The smart Advertising Communication
a breakthrough service model based on the Internet of Things and AI era. It focuses on solving various problems in
the dissemination and delivery of centralized advertising. First of all, advertisers can directly place advertisements in front
of users without the middlemen. Internet of Things TVs, refrigerators, cars, etc., can all become media, accurate and
efficient. Second, advertisers’ screening of target users has also become very efficient. Because the TOS platform can
collect and analyze various data related to personal life that involved in data transactions, it is far more than a single
dimension such as mobile phones and browser search keywords. The accuracy of the user's portrait is greatly increased,
and it can even be recommended by the AI robot when the user drinks beer. On the one hand it meets the user's precise
needs, on the other hand it allows advertisers to deliver and spread more efficiently.

2) Data Trading Center
As a data sharing and trading platform, the data security and consumer privacy of data transaction center is
particularly important. The decentralization technology of TOS itself is unmodifiable. Public Transaction Information and
the Transaction verification and PoS verification of SDAG (Super Directive Acyclic Graph) Transaction ensure that the
user's transaction is deterministic and secure. In the TOS network, the uniqueness and certainty of its transactions will
be guaranteed and cannot be tampered with. In addition, if users want to apply stored data on the chain, they will be free
to choose the encryption method. The security of encryption depends on the algorithm and strength of the selected
encryption. Similarly, its uniqueness and certainty will be guaranteed, and once the application transaction is successfully
written, it will not be tampered with. Consumer privacy is also a top priority for TOS decentralized platforms, in addition
to using distributed storage to reduce the risk of a single device being invaded and using harsh data encryption
methods,all externally shared data can be set by the consumers to share permissions, or it can be completely closed. In
addition, the shared data also closely protects consumers’ personal privacy information, including IDs, names, and
detailed addresses, and does not share them externally, nor can they associate with existing data. The data that ensures

the transaction is based solely on the portrait of the public behavior rather than the specific information of a specific
consumer.

Intelligent Financial Service Platform
TOS's financial services platform includes digital stocks, private equity, crowdfunding, bonds and other types of
financial derivatives. TOS's Intelligent financial services, smart contract system, and data exchange platform are three
major segments. Along with the smart hardware portal, the 3+1 model is integrated, providing the AI and intelligent
hardware companies with the benefits of the ecological value chain. A solution to private placement, product development,
product online, product distribution, product benefits, etc., helps traditional hardware and home appliance companies to
to quickly online, quickly acquire users and improve user experience through decentralized networking mode. These three
major systems and one core product are also the key to distinguish TOS from other public chain platforms. TOS pays
more attention to landing, pays more attention to applications, and pays more attention to the feedback of users' actual
application of block chain technology. We have reason to believe that TOS will lead the block chain technology to a more
practical future.
- features:
• Solving financial services issues for smart hardware companies
• Provide smart contract content such as digital equity, digital products, digital bonds, etc.
- For Examples: A smart hardware company's products require a lot of research and development expenses, the
traditional financial services cost is high. Using TOS's smart hardware contract, it can be digitized directly based on the
hardware product, and its digital product can be use as a payment medium to obtain the corresponding TOS COIN,
which ultimately helps the company to obtain R&D expenses. After successful product development, the company
obtained TOS COIN by selling the product, and then used TOS COIN to repurchase the hardware product through smart
contracts.

Smart Logistics Platform
In the future, TOS will use bar code, radio frequency identification technology, sensors, global positioning system
and other advanced Internet of Things technologies to be widely used in logistics industry transportation, warehousing,
distribution, packaging, loading and unloading, etc. through information processing and network communication
technology platforms. It will realize the automated operation of the cargo transportation process and the efficient
optimization of management, improve the service level of the logistics industry, reduce costs, and reduce the consumption
of natural resources and social resources. The Internet of Things provides a good platform for the logistics industry to
combine the traditional logistics technology with the intelligent system operation and management, so that it can better
and faster realize the informatization, intelligence, automation, and transparency of the smart logistics. The use of
integrated intelligent technology enables the logistics system to imitate human intelligence and has the ability to think,

perceive, learn, reason and judge and solve some problems in logistics. That is, to acquire information and to analyze
information and make decisions during the circulation process, so that the goods can be tracked and managed from the
source. You can make the shipment automate, informatize, and networking with RFID, sensors, and mobile communication
technologies, and technically it will realize: item identification, location tracking, item tracking, item monitoring, and realtime response.
- features:
• Provide digital business circulation for smart logistics
• Solve the combination problems of logistics, gold flow and information flow in smart logistics
- For example: A transportation company can use digital logistics platform DApp for digital logistics. First of all, the
transportation company needs to pay a certain amount of TOS COIN as a credit guarantee in the TOS intelligent logistics
platform;then, the transportation company can undertake the transportation of the logistics link. When the transportation
company receives the specified goods at the specified location, the non-quality DAPP TOKEN in the TOS system is
automatically transferred to the transportation company's account. The non-identical DAPP TOKEN records the
information of the goods for inspection of the goods and guarantees that the goods can be traced back without being
transferred. The delivery company will receive the corresponding TOS COIN as a service fee after the delivery of the
goods. The entire logistics process can be open, transparent, and secure. It can also improve efficiency and the cost of
both parties can be greatly reduced.

11. TOS ECOSYSTEM AND VALUE
The application scenarios of the TOS mentioned above can be divided into four blocks: enterprise-level intelligent
hardware platform, Internet of Things big data transaction platform, intelligent financial service platform, and intelligent
logistics platform. Through these four blocks, the TOS ecosystem is constructed.

1) For example, in an enterprise-class intelligent hardware platform, a master-class smart contract can be applied
to the consensus economy of house leasing. According to the market demand of the renter, a corresponding rental DApp
application can be developed in the TOS system, and the DAPP TOKEN in the DApp application can be used as rents,
the user's needs and settlement in the TOS application can form a closed loop, which can indirectly increase the flow of
TOS COIN.

Smart devices are data producers that can get TOS COIN through data sales, and there are a large number of full node devices in the TOS system, which are connected to the TOS network for 24 hours. Because of the "virtual mining"
mechanism of PoS in TOS, some equipment with strong computing power and strong storage capacity can carry out PoS
mining. In the ecosystem, early equipment can produce data, sell TOS COIN, and use TOS COIN for PoS mining. The work
of these devices can bring stability to the TOS network. At the same time, the self-hematopoietic ability of the equipment
can also stimulate more intelligent equipment in the whole ecology to participate in its ecological environment, forming
mutual benefits .

TOS's intelligent contract can create equipment digitalization, stock digitalization, private equity, public funding,
bonds and other derivatives. For example, an intelligent device vendor can issue non homogeneous DAPP TOKEN (the
values of each Token is different and inalienable) for each of the different types of devices,which is also known as digital
goods. In chain transactions, users buy non qualitative DAPP TOKEN from vendors, their real devices are hosted by
vendors, they are responsible for their security. When users pick up the intelligent devices, they need to provide the
private key to generate digital summary of the device and non homogeneous DAPP TOKEN in the chain. After the device
vendor verifies the actual effectiveness of the digital summary of the device, the corresponding non homogeneous DAPP
TOKEN will be destroyed. In this way, each device can be digitalized into a digital commodity, which can be traded
through the DAPP TOKEN, and the sale of smart devices can correspond to the digitized commodity DAPP TOKEN
through transactions. The tamper-resistant and secure characteristics of blockchain technology, can ensure the
uniqueness of the digital commodity, and the market circulation of intelligent equipment, the ownership of the digital
goods can be traded also. TOS is a decentralization technology platform that can realize the value exchange , and it is
also the cornerstone of the Internet.

2) For example, in the Internet of Things big data transaction platform, TOS data transaction is the basis for TOS
COIN circulation. Massive data exists in the TOS network. Equipment manufacturers can establish channels for collecting
data and sales data, through the preparation of data transaction contracts ,the data that produced by these devices, can
realizes the value exchanges and can complete the settlement automatically, at the same time, the settled DAPP TOKEN
is transferred to the seller’s account. Users can be accurately positioned according to the user's data image, and the
advertising and target consumers can be more efficiently and transparently matched to achieve the promotion effect. For
example, intelligent advertising applications in the TOS network such as televisions, refrigerators, steam trains, and so
on, are all part of their ecosystem. Smart advertising applications can collect and analyze users' personal transaction
data in the TOS network. Of course, the personal privacy information of the user, including ID, name, and detailed address,
etc., will also be closely protected by TOS. In the end, the advertiser can accurately screen the target user on various
smart devices and improve the promotion efficiency. Similarly, the uniqueness and certainty of its data are also
guaranteed, and once the data transaction in the application is successful, it will not be tampered with.

TOS provides a good business environment for a large number of equipment producers, and for the entire Internet
of things industry, there is a real place to deal with the large amount of data’s equipment. The data transaction of TOS
system can provide liquidity, combine its downstream analysis to analyze data, and finally become the data commercial
value application of data production, processing, selling, and so on. That is to say, TOS has great value in data exchange
and intelligent equipment industry.

3) For example, in the intelligent financial service platform, intelligent hardware companies are provided with
solutions such as product digitalization, product development, and online access. Through the enterprise-class intelligent
hardware platform, data transaction platform, and financial service platform, the company has been integrated with
intelligent hardware as its entrance to help traditional hardware and household appliance companies in the ecological
system and solve financial problems. Hardware companies can digitize hardware products in the TOS system, obtain
corresponding DAPP TOKEN by using digital goods as a payment medium, bind DAPP TOKEN to hardware devices, and
hardware devices themselves have value, so the corresponding DAPP TOKEN have values. Since the circulation between
DAPP TOKEN can only use TOS COIN as the transaction fee, the TOS COIN's circulation is driven, and the value of TOS
COIN also increases with the corresponding demand.

4) for example, in the intelligent logistics platform, each link from warehousing to distribution is tedious and involves
a large number of people. In view of these features, the goods are digitalized as corresponding non qualitative DAPP
TOKEN in TOS, and for the goods to be transferred in every commercial link of the Internet of things, it is necessary to
use non qualitative DAPP TOKEN transactions in the TOS network, and also TOS COIN should be used for payment and
real-time settlement in each logistics process. For example, cross-border logistics, the use of TOS COIN can realize
automatic customs declaration, tax calculation and the rapid settlement of the whole supply chain, and there will have
the problems of the cost of exchange rates among countries. The circulation records of TOS COIN in the whole logistics
supply chain will be recorded in the blockchain to realize the digital management of three flows, such as information flow,
logistics, capital flow and so on. With the development of the platform, the demand for TOS COIN will continue to increase,
and the value of TOS COIN will also increase.

12. TOS FOUNDATION

14. BUDGET ALLOCATION
TOS TOKEN and TOS COIN are the original encrypted digital certificates officially issued by the TOS Foundation.
The first phase will generate TOS TOKEN based on smart contracts at Ethereum, and the second phase will generate
TOS COIN based on the TOS public chain and serve as the TOS Foundation's only payment medium for community
rewards, forum points, settlement, transaction, and the use of IoT smart contracts. After the success of the TOS public
chain, the TOS TOKEN in the first phase will be replaced with the TOS COIN in the second phase at a ratio of 1:1. A total
of 1 billion pieces of digital certificates were issued for the TOS program, which was created by the TOS Foundation in
the form of TOS TOKEN in the first stage. The total amount has been set, and cannot be changed or added . The digital
passport of the TOS program is assigned to different holders according to certain rules and proportions.

50% of the digital assets obtained through private placement are used for blockchain construction, R&D of product
modules, application of ecological layout, and overall operation and maintenance of TOS public chains. 5% of Token will
be reserved for early cornerstone investors, 15% will be reserved for founding team members, and 20% will be reserved
for foundations for later R&D of public-linked, marketing and operations, and blockchain research, 10% It will be used to
invest in TOS community construction.

Team lock-in period: The team holds 15% Token, of which 10% is used for the incentive of the existing team members,
and 5% is used for the incentives of new team memberin the later period，to ensure the team's development and operation
strength. The team holds a lock-in period of three years for Token. It is unlocked once every six months from the fourth
year. The amount of Token unlocked in one single session does not exceed 30% of the total amount of the remaining
token that can be used for team incentives in the current period.

The TOS TOKEN private offering is divided into two rounds: Cornerstone and Private Place. Private placement targets
only specific institutions or qualified investors. The type of the currency raised is Ethereum (ETH), and the cornerstone
stage: 1 ETH = 9308 TOS TOKEN，the private placement stage：1 ETH = 5225 TOS TOKEN, the average price: 1 ETH =
6483 TOS TOKEN.

TOS lock-in mechanism: During the private placement, the corresponding TOS TOKEN is locked by the smart contract
lock reward, and the time for unlocking is 2018-12-15.

Liquidity Pool (32%): Pre-funded liquidity pool used
to maintain the TOS blockchain.
