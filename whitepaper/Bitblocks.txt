INTRODUCTION
CRYPTO CURRENCY
A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work
as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure
financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify
the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies are a kind of alternative currency
and digital currency (of which virtual currency is a subset).
Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized
digital currency and central banking systems. The decentralized control
of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology,
typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction
database.

BLOCKCHAIN
Blockchain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using
cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous
block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle
tree root hash).

By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an
open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties
efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed
ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network
collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and
validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot
be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which
requires consensus of the network majority.

INTRODUCTION
BITBLOCKS
BITBLOCKS is a business-oriented cryptocurrency directed towards
entertainment, especially in video games and other areas that revolve
around this current industry, such as championships, events, fairs,
conferences, and game development among others. We know that this
business is in rapid expansion worldwide and that video games have not
ceased to be something exclusively marketed to target age groups. The
climbing value of the gamer world has reached such a point of
professionalism that there are currently athletes and video game teams,
tournament achievements that are transmitted in real time on the
internet and even on television.

MARKET OVERVIEW
This market produces billions of dollars annually and presents an
unquestionable expansion trend. According to Forbes Magazine, this
industry is forecast to move around $128 billion in 2018 through sales of
games, accessories, consoles, new technologies, fairs and events around
the world. In the US alone, gross sales for 2017 were $36 billion. According
to the report prepared by Consulting NPD Group and the Entertainment
Software Association this number represents an increase of 18% when
compared to the previous years’ scores. The BBK has its field of activity in
this billion dollar market, contributing in the promotion of the
commercialization and development of new technologies, strengthening
this area and effectively raising its own value as a digital asset.

TECHNOLOGIES
ZERO FEES
The Bitblocks network has been built to reword its network supporters via
block rewards (Staking / Masternode reward). By utilizing this Proof of
Works Network BitBlocks is able to provide nearly zero transaction fees for
each transaction. This means when using BitBlocks more of your actual
investment is kept in your pocket instead of it being spent through the
sending of coins from one wallet to the next.

PRIVATE SEND
Bitblocks has a privacy feature which makes it possible to send
anonymous transactions. This means a user can choose traceable or
anonymous. Bitblocks is a fork of PIVX which is built and improved from
Dash code. Dash, also is a fork of bitcoin core with privacy feature
implemented. In essence, Bitblocks can be spent public or private. This
privacy feature is reached by using joint payments. This is basically by
merging transactions together and splitting them up again, thus, making
it difficult or near impossible to trace transactions from specific wallet
address to another.

INSTANT TRANSACTIONS
Bitblocks transactions are instant like PIVX and Dash. That is; the person
receiving the transaction is able to see from the sender the moment the
funds are sent. This makes Bitblocks an excellent means of making
transactions. Thanks to its fast speeds this allows numerous transactions to
be sent over long distances without the worry of waiting for your funds to
be available or even waiting for confirmations to go through as needed
with a lot of cryptocurrencies.

FUNCTIONALITY
ADVANCED ADDRESS
An advanced mark is a grouping of bits, used to recognize whether
somebody is who they claim to be. BitBlocks validation is taken care of by
awry encryption (1) of all messages amongst clients and administrators.

Each mineworker or administrator has their own match of keys - an open
key and a private key. The user's open key is the thing that the whole
system knows (i.e. it's freely accessible), and the private key is the thing
that only the mineworker/administrator know (i.e. it's totally private).
Amid introductory enlistment of the key combine, the client picks a
secret key which is private. That private secret key is then used to produce
a 160-piece open key, which fills in as their street number and personality
in the BitBlocks economy. Information encoded with the client's open key
must be unscrambled with a similar client's private key, which only they
will know. Along these lines a system peer who starts correspondence
with another associate dependably encodes active messages utilizing the
beneficiary's open key (i.e. postage information) and will get every
approaching message scrambled utilizing their own open key.

FUNCTIONALITY
EXCHANGING
Exchanging the BitBlocks economy depends on possession asserts as
opposed to dynamic exchanges. No record of exchanges exists anyplace in
the system. The procedure can be depicted in a couple of summed up
steps: 1. Current proprietor gives BitBlocks units to the new proprietor. This
could be as computerized content (twofold record, email), or physical
frame (paper note, document stockpiling gadget). Units are encoded with
the new proprietor's open key. 2. Current proprietor puts a claim for new
possession to the administrator who handles the specific BitBlocks unit
utilized as a part of the exchange, giving the hash of the unit. 3. New
proprietor checks the BitBlock, and furthermore puts a claim for new
possession to the administrator of the BitBlocks, giving the hash of the
provided unit. 4. Administrator confirms the legitimacy of the unit, and the
two claims, and stores it in its private database with the address of the new
proprietor as the enrolled proprietor of the DICE which gave the hash.5.
Administrator sends a reaction message to the two gatherings educating
them about the difference in responsibility for unit. This is rehashed for
each BitBlocks unit engaged with the exchange. The procedure for one unit
can be envisioned in the accompanying graph: It can be seen that an
effective exchange of possession can just happen when the accompanying
conditions are met:

01
02
03
04
05

The current and the new proprietor both have the real
BitBlocks unit in its crude frame.
The unit is a substantial BitBlocks unit.
The unit is known to the administrator.
The administrator perceives the present proprietor as the
lawful proprietor of the unit.
The current and the new proprietor have both educated the
administrator about the up and coming difference in
responsibility for BitBlock unit giving and coordinating hash
created from the BitBlocks.

It is imperative to take note of that between exchanging parties BitBlock
units are traded in their crude frame, while claims put to the administrator
are just made utilizing the hash of those units.

What Is A Masternode?
Masternode is simply a cryptocurrency full node or computer wallet that
keeps the full copy of the blockchain in real-time. Some of the special
functions that these nodes perform are:
Increasing privacy of transactions
Doing instant transactions
Participating in governance and voting
Enable budgeting and treasury system in cryptos
These masternodes are not standalone but they are always
communicating with other such nodes to make a decentralized network
and are often referred in short form as MN.

What Does It Take To Run A Masternode?
Just like full nodes in a cryptocurrency, masternodes can be run by anyone.
However, there is an entry barrier in place to ensure that the system doesn’t get
malicious. The entry barrier is what one needs to commit or collateralize certain
units of that particular cryptocurrency to run a masternode.

Now that you have understood the concept of masternode, let us see what all
things are required to set it up:
One needs a minimum amount of coins of that particular crypto.
One needs a VPS or server to host that wallet for 24 x 7
One needs a dedicated IP address for that
One needs some storage space to save the blockchain

TOURNAMENTS
AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIPS
BITBLOCKS is going to organize online amateur championship, making
wide scattering of the brand in the virtual condition, granting the winners
with BBK.
BITBLOCKS will elevate face-to-face championships in many different
places, with the point of drawing in intrigued gatherings of people in esports, advertising BBK-paid enrollments and offering items with the
coin logo, for example, caps, shirts, key chains, stickers, mousepads,
and so forth. There will be stands of various organizations connected to
the advanced innovation and amusement segment that will offer
items, for example, cell phones, diversions and extras when all is said in
done, with rebates for members and accepting in BBK. These titles will
be called BBK AMATEUR CUPS.

PROFESSIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS
BITBLOCKS is going to participate in existing e-sports championships
around the world sponsoring these events, publicizing the currency brand,
and suggesting the prize winners of the BBK tournaments.
BITBLOCKS tournaments will be looking for teams of professional players
to sponsor the most important competitions using as a source the BBK
currency itself, making its mark on the athletes' uniforms and other
products linked to the team.
BITBLOCKS in the promotion of professional face-to-face
championships in different regions with the aim of attracting the
interested public in e-sports, commercializing paid registrations in BBK
and selling products with the coin logo as hats, t-shirts, key chains,
stickers, mousepads, etc. There will be stands of global organizations
linked to the digital technology and entertainment sector that will
offer products such as smartphones, games and accessories in general
with discounts for participants and receiving in BBK. These
championships will be called BBK PROFESSIONAL CUPS.

SALE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IN PHYSICAL AND
VIRTUAL SHOPS
DEVELOPMENT OF STORES AND PRODUCTS
BITBLOCKS is going to assemble physical and virtual stores around the
world and propose partnerships so that products such as games, consoles,
computers, headphones and miscellaneous accessories can be marketed in
BBK. For example, a player from one country can buy equipment and
games in another country, without necessarily having to use a credit card,
for that, using the blockchain technology of the currency to make the
purchase. This would greatly increase audience of any store targeted to this
segment across the globe and would relieve a consumer interested in
necessarily having a credit card to get what they want.

PAYMENT STRUCTURE
One of the great benefits of using blockchain is to provide freedom among
people when it comes to payments without the existence of centralized
structures like banks or credit card operators. We can send resources to
anywhere on the planet in a few seconds without having to use the banking
sector and pay increasingly abusive fees for this service. Once a physical or
virtual store accepts the payment in BBK, it will automatically profit as it
would not have to pay a single penny to the credit card companies. As we all
know, in all sales the trader pays a percentage to them. In short, more profit
and independence for those who sell.

"WE DON´T WANT TO REVOLVE IN TECHNOLOGY, WE WANT A
REVOLUTION IN THE LIFE OF PEOPLE."

DEVELOPMENT OF GAMES
BITBLOCKS will be developing interactive video games when partnered
with other game systems, where rewards (point) acquired during the
games can be exchanged for BBK, therefore, the gamer can use them in
real life. The same way BBK will be able to be used to purchase items in
the game itself. For example, during a warfare game the gamer will be
able to upgrade their weapons (which are the in game-purchases), buying
with BBK is simple and practical.

SUMMARY
Bitblocks (BBK) is cryptocurrency oriented to business related to
entertainment technology, primarily digital and e-sports games.
Organizing amateur and professional tournaments with prizes from
competitors are two of BBK's objectives. In addition to these, BBK's
proposal is also to be used to market equipment aimed at this segment
worldwide and develop interactive games with the use of BBK as a
means of empowering the characters. With this, the tripod sets up
business-games-technology, which are the pillars of its use. Its
maximum supply is 584 million and it counts on technology Pos,
Masternodes, zero Transaction fee, 346 transactions per second and, in
the future, will have system of governance.
