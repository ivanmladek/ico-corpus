GIVEN THAT GOVERNMENTS’ REGULATORY ATTITUDE TOWARDS BLOCKCHAIN-RELATED
BUSINESSES AND/OR CRYPTOCURRENCIES IS STILL UNCERTAIN IN MANY
JURISDICTIONS, THE RISKS INHERENT IN ESTABLISHING A BLOCKCHAIN-RELATED
NETWORK OR APPLICATION MAY BE HIGHER THAN ESTABLISHING ANY OTHER TYPE OF
BUSINESS. MOREOVER, BECAUSE THE BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRY IS AT THE VERY EARLY
STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, THERE ARE STILL MANY UNKNOWN AND UNCERTAIN RISKS.
ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE OF THE WAY CRYPTOCURRENCIES ARE STORED, THERE IS
ALWAYS THE RISK OF HUMAN ERROR IN TRANSACTING WITH CRYPTOCURRENCIES
(SUCH AS A TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR WHEN SENDING TOKENS TO AN ADDRESS). IN
RESPONSE TO FUND RISKS, ALL LARGE-VALUE CRYPTOCURRENCIES ARE STORED BY
MULTIPLE WALLETS AS WELL AS COLD STORAGE IN JOINT ADMINISTRATION BY
MEMBERS OF THE FOUNDATION. UNDER THE 3/5 MULTI-SIGNATURE-METHOD, THE RISK
OF THEFT AND EMBEZZLEMENT OF FUNDS CAN BE EFFECTIVELY REDUCED; HOWEVER,
THESE RISKS STILL EXIST AND MAY LEAD TO THE FINAL FAILURE OF THE PROJECT.

1. BANCA: DECENTRALIZED, INTELLIGENT
BLOCKCHAIN-BASED COMMUNITY
We define Banca as a decentralized, intelligent blockchain-based community platform
powered by artificial intelligence (“AI”) and big data analytics, connecting people with
various needs and skillsets. The digital utility tokens used on the Banca platform are called
Banca Tokens, allowing Banca Token holders to purchase Banca Products and Services for
consumption offered by other members. The Banca Product and Services include a wide array
of products and services, including but not limited to: rating services, strategies, and even tax
and legal products and services. Members can generally be classified into two categories: (i)
product and service providers (“Provider-Members”), and (ii) end users (“End UserMembers,” and collectively, “Members”). Provider-Members will receive Banca Tokens
from End-User Members in exchange for providing Banca Products and Services to End
Users-Members.

The technical implementation of Banca is based on three main lines: (i) blockchain
technology, (ii) AI and expert systems, and (iii) big data analytics.

1.1

Blockchain Technology

At the core of the Banca project is blockchain technology. With the growing popularity
of cryptocurrencies in the past few years, the exposure has allowed global technology
entrepreneurs and coders to constantly improve and update the capabilities that
blockchain technology can bring to the world community. Because of these constant
improvements and advancements, blockchain technology is increasingly being applied
to industries other than cryptocurrency-related industries, which will bring a new
vitality to all aspects of the real economy. Blockchain technology is synonymous with
transparency and decentralization; thus, it can effectively prevent many of the moral
hazards caused by the centralized management of traditional investment banks, all
while improving operational efficiency through collective wisdom and concerted
efforts. With the further maturation of other supporting technologies, a subversive
reform is imperative.

7

1.2

AI and Expert Systems

We use AI and expert systems to achieve the dynamic, efficient automated management
of the Banca ecological chain. Automation can overcome human weaknesses, and
greatly reduce the probability of errors in data collection, integration, and/or
processing. It allows the Banca platform to mirror the advantages of large investment
banks in terms of information and talent resources, yet overcome any efficiency loss
caused by excessive vertical and horizontal levels in the management of large
institutions. AI has begun to successfully replace humans with respect to activities
related to Internet usage, including, but not limited to, security-monitoring, trading
and gathering and analyzing data, but also other traditional manual tasks such as
operating motor vehicles, visual identification, and countless other areas. We believe AI
will eventually be widely used in the financial field.

1.3

Big Data Analytics

Our team will integrate big data analytics into the Banca Products and Services. This will
in turn result in more useful data for all Members and which will result in more effective
interfacing with vendors, and further promote the service efficiency of Banca. This
process can be continuously improved upon data gathered in combination with AI
technology. In addition, we have created a project database and initial coin offering
(“ICO”) review database based upon the tamper proof data system of blockchain
technology by means of community audit. We have created the community platform to
provide further ensure the highest quality of project interfacing, as well as enabling the
community platform to provide the best Banca Products and Services possible.

2. BANCA COMMUNITY
2.1

Community Divisions

Banca’s decentralized community will cover almost every product and service
provided in these three main areas: (i) primary market, (ii) secondary market, and (iii)
basic services. These three aspects will be divided into three separate divisions wherein
both participating members and end-user Banca Token holders will interact.

8

2.2 Primary Market Division
The Primary Market Division provides Banca Products and Services relating to listing
and underwriting of all kinds of digital currencies and/or to make a larger number of
digital token holders more apt to hold digital assets by improving liquidity. In this
process, Banca Members are free to participate in project evaluation to point out the
merits and/or demerits of the project based upon their respective expertise. In addition,
the Banca platform uses Internet resources to obtain information on the project side.
Finally, AI dynamically integrates all the data, and forms the overall risk rating and
classification of the project. After analyzing the final project classification and risk
rating, the platform identifies the most appropriate investor profile type, thus achieving
linkage between actors.
2.3 Secondary Market Division
The Secondary Market Division is responsible for research and digital asset ratings.
The Banca Products and Services offered within this division are based on the
decentralized decision-making system of the community groups. Provider-Members
analyze research, decentralized ratings, and CoinAI. In trading, End User-Members can
choose Provider-Members they trust based on their needs, or simply adopt the
comprehensive analyses provided by the platform from big data analytics to assist in the
trading of digital assets.
2.4 Basic Services Division
Financial products and services are not the only services that will be hosted on the
Banca platform. Community members will have access to basic services, including, but
not limited to, legal consulting, accounting, auditing, and compliance for their potential
projects. This will create a marketplace for professionals who can assist Members in all
aspects of their projects, thereby creating a truly one-stop shop for anyone wishing to
launch a blockchain or digital currency-related project.
The performance of all projects will be continuously tracked on the platform, and
kept in the database of digital assets as the basis for evaluating the performance of
Provider-Members. This performance evaluation system is intelligent and dynamic,
affecting the platform’s rating for Provider-Members, as well as the distribution of
revenue.

BANCA TOKEN APPLICATIONS

3.1
Primary Market
Members having the skillset in project management and financial consultancy would recommend
different projects to those End User-Members who are looking for such opportunities. Once the
recommended projects have been adopted or executed by the End User-Members who have used
particular Provider-Members, such service Provider-Members will receive Banca Tokens from
the End User-Members as compensation.
3.2
Secondary Market
Some Provider-Members having expertise in investment research may offer their services to other
Members. Provider-Members having such skillset would receive Banca Tokens from the End
User-Members for research services, such as preparing an Investment Research Report. Similarly,
those having skillset in big data collection and analytics industry, would be able to sell market data
to Members in exchange for Banca Tokens. Likewise consultancy Provider-Members would be
able to offer their consultancy services for Banca Tokens.
Basic Services
3.3
In this particular market, End User-Providers may freely exchange their Banca Tokens for
professional legal, financial, account, marketing and other types of services. In this sense, Banca is
truly unique as it creates an environment where Members may obtain, in exchange for Banca
Tokens, all the necessary assistance needed.
In sum, Banca Tokens are pure utility tokens, allowing Members of the Banca Community who
have some expertise in particular fields/skills to provide their services to the other Members in
exchange for Banca Tokens. The Banca Tokens are not meant to be held or traded for purposes
of gaining a pecuniary profit or avoiding a pecuniary loss. The Banca Tokens are consumptive,
and should not be construed in any other way, shape or form.

INTELLIGENT MANAGEMENT

Intelligent management is the foundation of the Banca community, and as such, with
our team’s extensive experience in big data processing and AI, we have been able to achieve
efficient platform management, effectively analyzing and processing information offered by
Members, project sides and from other sources to provide intelligent services for clients.
This intelligent management is reflected in the following five aspects:
(1)
Intelligent search allows users to quickly find accurate, relevant information
and services;
(2)
Big data analysis provides ratings for each member's business level, professional
skills and reliability;
(3)
Using intelligent agreements to automatically determine business terms; and
(4)
Recording business data, generating reports automatically, open and
transparent, fraud-resistant; and
(5)
Continuous dynamic optimization of business processes via AI.
At the same time, all the project performance data will be continuously tracked and
entered into the database by the Company, becoming important material for continued AI
learning. As the first platform intelligent community using big data analytics by and
through AI, Banca is at the forefront of the industry, and as time goes on, first-mover
advantages will become more apparent.

5. TECHNICAL INFORMATION OF THE PLATFORM

5.1
Technical Advantages
Compared with other projects, our team has unique technical advantages, including:
A.
Blockchain technology-based big data framework;
B.
Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) and blockchain-as-a-service (“BaaS”);
C.
Risk control-based in-dept learning and recurrent neural network;
D.
Smart, effective search engines; and
E.
Targeted advertising services.
The Banca platform will also introduce a licensing mechanism based on the
crowdfunding chain of consortium blockchain. The chain has the following technical
features, among others:
A.
Distributed fault tolerance: the network is particularly robust, with fault tolerance
at exception status of around 1/4 node;
B.
Lack of Tampering – the data after being submitted will be always available and it
cannot be tampered, destroyed, defrauded or modified; and
C.
Privacy protection – cryptography guarantees unauthorized access to data, but
the data cannot be parsed.
Regarding processing performance and scalability, every core node involved in
maintaining the network must maintain a complete storage and process an intelligent
agreement; thus, the total storage and computing power of the entire network may, if
needed, depend on a single node. The Banca system adopts Kafka stream processing and
the Hadoop decentralized computing system, and other big data technologies to ensure
the throughput, low latency and high performance of transactions. Further, regarding the
database and storage system, the network uses a new, more specialized NoSQL key-value
database, in which each record contains a complete block’s information that is
naturally associated with its historical information. Once entered, data cannot be
modified, thus guaranteeing data transmission quality.

5.6 Blockchain system of the Banca community

Blockchain has adopted the concept of Proof of Work to evade any malicious
damage on the data, and use probabilistic models to ensure the longest legitimate
chains. In addition, there are also pledges based on rights, such as PoS, DPoS and
Casper. Theoretically speaking, these algorithms are based on the Game Theory,
and ensure the incorporation of the majority by incurring a monetary loss on those
malicious participants. The technical support for blockchain has entailed a
distributed consensus mechanism, including the classic Byzantine Algorithm.
In addition, we have a concise and sophisticated blockchain-based smart contracts,
which provide pre-edited digital language record terms. Once triggered, the smart
contract to implement the corresponding terms or record terms are executed. In
simple terms, smart contracts are intelligent contracts that record specific terms in
computer languages rather than in legal languages.
From a user's point of view, a smart contract is usually considered an automatic
guarantee account. A traditional contract means that two or more parties agree to
do something in exchange for consideration or promises to perform something.
Each party must trust each other to fulfill their obligations. Alternatively, when
deploying a smart contract the parties do not need to trust each other because the
14

smart contract is defined by code to be mandatory, completely uninterrupted and
automatic as soon as the coded conditions are triggered. When the trigger condition is
satisfied, the smart contract automatically sends out a preset data resource and an event
including the trigger condition. The existence of a smart contract is intended to allow a
complex set of digitized promises with triggering conditions to be properly implemented
in accordance with the will of the participants. On one hand, in practice, a software
agent performs certain obligations and may have control over certain assets in the shared
ledger. Data, such as stored information in the blockchain, validation and
implementation of the code, is defined as smart contract code. On the other hand, it
refers to the interpretation of how legal contracts are expressed and enforced in software,
and therefore covers areas of operation such as how to draft legal contracts and how to
interpret them. This has been defined as a smart legal contract.
Contracts are expressed and enforced in software, and therefore covers areas of
operation such as how to draft legal contracts and how to interpret them. This has been
defined as a smart legal contract.
From a technical point of view, smart contracts are considered web servers, except that
instead of using internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to set up on the Internet, these
servers are set up on the blockchain so that specific contract programs can run on them.
Smart contracts are deployed on shared, replicated books that maintain their status,
control their own assets and respond to received outside information or assets. It is a
computer program that runs on a replicable, shared book that processes information,
receives, stores, and sends values. Smart contracts are collections of codes and data that
are stored at the blockchain's specific address. Smart contracts are more like automated
proxies (or robots or non-player characters) in the blockchain that have their own
account that automatically performs functions driven by time or events, such as the
ability to pass information between themselves, modify the state of the blockchain
(account information, etc.), and Turing complete calculation. The creation of Turing
complete blockchain and Internet of Things has enabled smart contracts to safely and
quickly transfer assets and interact with physical entities.
In essence, the working principle of smart contracts is similar to the program statements
of other computer programs interacting with real-world assets through the execution of
programs. Fraud-proof features based on blockchain, as well as automatic execution of
smart contracts when conditions trigger, greatly ensure the credibility of smart contracts
and reduce implementation costs and compliance costs. A smart contract is a set of
promises that are numerically defined and include agreements on which contractual
parties can implement those promises. The basic idea of a smart contract is that many
contract terms can be embedded in hardware and software.

5.7 AI system
In technical terms, AI includes two aspects: (i) Deep Learning and (ii) Recurrent
Neural Network-Based Prediction Models. In a practical sense, the system predicts
accurate future movements of digital tokens by mining hidden information from
historical transaction data and from deep behavioral records. The main goal of deep
learning is to learn multi-level features and to create more abstract high-level
representations by combining low-level features to discover the distributed
representation of the data. By building a multi-layered Neural Network to simulate
human brain learning process, we hope to use the human brain's multi-layer abstraction
mechanism to achieve the abstract expression of the real object or data, and to integrate
the feature extraction and classifier into a learning framework. Deep learning structure
feature is a multi-layer perceptrons with multiple hidden layers, forming more abstract
high-level representation attribute categories or features by combining low-level
features to find the data distributed feature representation. Multi-level abstraction is
formed through bottom-up learning, and multi-level feature learning is a process that
automatically intervenes without human intervention. According to the learned
network structure, the system maps the input sample data to various levels of features
and classifies the output units of the top level by using a classifier or a matching
algorithm.
For some low-level algorithms, such as neural networks with single hidden layer,
support vector machines, etc., given a limited number of samples and computational
elements, it is difficult for low-level structures to effectively represent complex
functions, and for complex classification problems, performance and the
generalization ability of the needle has obvious deficiencies, especially when the target
object has a wealth of meaning. Deep learning through a network of a large number of
simple neurons, the use of non-linear relationship between input and output, the
complexity of the function approximation of the observed sample fitting, and in the
learning of the nature of the input sample extract reflects the strong power.
The simplest neural network contains only one neuron, as follows:

17

and an intercept of +1 as input, and
This neuron consist of
as output, where the function
is the activation function. In BANCA, we use
sigmoid as the activation function

A Neural Network is a connected set of multiple single neurons, where the output of
one neuron could be the input of another, as follow:

18

As above, the leftmost layer is called the input layer, while the rightmost layer is the
output player. All the middle nodes are called the hidden layer, as we cannot see their
values during training.
, out Neural Network can be computed using function
Given the parameter set
. In this example, it is:

We use

to denote the weighted sum of the th level and the th unit, for example,
then
。
If we put all the parameters in a matrix, and use matrix-vector computation methods,
we can quickly solve these equations using linear algebra.
A Neural Network can have multiple output units. For example, in the Network below,
there are 2 hidden layers: and , and there are 2 output units in the output layer
.

To solve Networks like this, we would need sample set
, where
. This would
be suitable if the
number of outputs to be predicted is more than one.
The first step is to define similarity:
SVD is one of the matrix factorization algorithms and baseline predictor is one type of
optimization. The simplest SVD is to optimize the following loss function:

19

And then use random gradient descent to optimize:

timeSVD++ is to use the time dimension as one additional parameter:

The smart rewarding system of BANCA is based on Neural Networks and Pagerank
models and we call it AIbased Contribution Metric (ACM):
In PageRank:

R = q × P * R + ( 1 一 q) * e/N （e is the unit vector）0
In a context sensitive PageRank:

22

As below, every node in the hidden and output layers is obtained from the nodes in the
previous layer with weighted sum and the nodes with “+1” are intercept b. For every
node not in the input layer: Y=w0*x0+w1*x1+…+wn*xn+b, and Neural Network is
equivalent to a multi-level logistic regression structure.

Generally speaking, Neural Networks consist of 3 steps: initialization, feed forwarding,
and back propagation.
1.Initialization: Since this is a n-layer Neural Network, we use a 2-dimensional array
to record the values, where the first dimension is the layer number and the second
dimension is the location of the node, and the value is the array value. The error values
of all the nodes are recorded in the same way. We also use a 3-dimensional array to
keep the weights of all the nodes, where the first dimension is the layer number, the
second dimension is the node location, the third dimension is the location of the node
in the next layer, and the value is the weight value from the current node to the next
node (a random value initialized between 0 and 1). To optimize for convergence, we
use the momentum method for adjustment, and keep them int the 3-dimensional array.
We directly set the intercept to be 1 so that we only need to compute the corresponding
weight.
2.Feed Forwarding: Use S function 1/(1+Math.exp(-z)) to normalize the value of every
node into [0, 1], and then forward compute until the output layer, while we would not
need the S function for the output layers.
3.Back Propagation: We usually use the sum of squares as the error function:

23

In fact, it is the same as logistic function and we would not discuss the mathematic
reasoning of this function. We would need to minimize this E function and thus would
need to take the derivative:

The error array keeps the minimized error of the weights, and then we can adjust the
weights using the array. We use the momentum method for the adjustment to avoid any
local minimum:
Δw(k+1) = mobp*Δw(k)+rate*Err*Layer where k is the number of recursions, mobp
is the momentum term and rate is the learning step size.
We can also use the following formula:
Δw(k+1) = mobp*Δw(k)+(1-mobp)rate*Err*Layer
