NaPoleonX
NAPOLEONX Whitepaper
Introduction
The Satoshi’s whitepaper and the creation of Bitcoin have been one of
the most significant events since the creation of internet. By giving access
to cryptocurrencies to anybody, lowering the fees of any transaction and
freeing the protocol from the “old” banking system, the blockchain protocol
is undoubtedly leading us to a disruptive evolution.
Yet, the expected massive adoption is still on its way. We do believe that this
is due to the fact that one core brick is missing: the investment brick. Today,
even the most enthusiastic cryptocurrency holders are stuck within the classic
banking system to manage their own savings! To reach global adoption,
ETH, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, need a large spectrum of
listed assets that coin holders could invest in, including classical assets such
as ETFs, stocks, fixed income, currencies, commodities, etc.

NaPoleonX

We think that two concomitant elements are creating a new paradigm
that will completely redefine the investment industry, to the benefit of the
community, while giving anyone access to the best investment strategies.
On the one hand, we assist to the emergence of new governance schemes
enabled by smart contracts (and the corresponding DAOs, DACs, etc) and
on the other hand, we observe the omnipresence of the investing quant
strategies and bots in the best hedge funds and banks. Combining these two
growing elements allows people to get their complete freedom back on their
investments, far from the current investment scheme controlled by the (old)
banking system. Thus, instead of being advised by a banker, maybe more
interested in selling its own products, investors would have direct access to a
set of Decentralized Autonomous Funds to optimize their risk/return profile.
Indeed, they will decide on the investment strategy (financial leverage and
trading bots choice) within a growing selection over time to best fit their own
needs.

Besides this revolution per se, we think that creating seamless access to
a large set of tangible performing asset classes will also accelerate the
massive use of cryptocurrencies in general. If any cryptocurrency holder
could seamlessly manage one’s savings to invest in crypto assets, real assets
or financial markets, it would be a game changer, for both the cryptoworld
ICO powered
by
and the traditional asset management
industry!

SMART COLLABORATIVE INVESTING
The first 100% algorithmic crypto asset manager surfing on two exponential
trends: the quantitative management wave and the crypto currency universe’s
expansion. Founded by ex-multi-billions asset managers in tier 1 banks, it
will propose all-weather performing investment solutions for crypto holders,
through Decentralized Autonomous Funds (DAFs).

Abstract: Investment solutions are still limited within the blockchain ecosystem,
restricting investors to manage most of their savings outside the cryptocurrency
environment. We believe that the feasibility to invest in a large spectrum of
performing assets, through tokenization of the financial markets, would be
the game changer for the massive adoption of cryptocurrencies. Indeed, so
far cryptocurrencies have mostly been contained as a mean of payment. It is
now time to accelerate the “store of value” beyond the simple appreciation
against fiat currencies.
We propose the first solution of smart collaborative investing dedicated to
cryptocurrencies holders, through the creation of Decentralized Autonomous
Funds (DAFs). Each DAF will be a crypto-fund whose investment strategy
shall be governed by a blend of trading bots. At first, each DAFs will be
created for a unique underlying assets. In a second stage combination of
underlying assets might be allowed in the DAFs.
The NaPoleonX token (NPX) holders, by participating to the selection of
the trading bots, will benefit from (i) the rights to use for their own personal
account the trading signals provided by the first trading bots and (ii) a revenue
share from the Rental Fees (referred to as “Botons” in this Whitepaper) paid
by the DAFs for the use of the trading bots. Botons will be equal to 25% of
gross performance. The NPX token holders will get 85% of these Botons for
the 10 first DAFs that Napoleon Crypto will create.

OUR VISION

1.

Tokenization opens the door to DAFs

Our vision is that, within a few years, most of today’s real assets
will be tokenized implying that most of the Stock Exchanges will authorize
the issuance of shares in crypto-currencies. Consequently, it will be possible,
for instance, to buy Coca-Cola company’s or Apple’s shares directly in
crypto-currencies. At such point, the crypto-ecosystem will become the new
normality, leading to a mainstream status. From this vision, we have created
the DAF (Decentralized Autonomous Fund) concept to give investors access
to robust investing strategies on any real or crypto assets diversifying their
investment returns.
Once any investment will be accessible to the crypto world, it
will be possible to embed quantitative investment strategies
(i.e. trading bots) within smart contracts, creating the ultimate
investment vehicle.

2.

Bypassing the traditional asset management system

The asset management industry has been dominated, in an
oligopolistic manner, by large banks or financial institutions for ages. They
have collected huge amounts of fees while delivering poor performance. This

6

NaPoleonX
has been done on the back of investors, whom are the real risk takers, and it
is even more true in a very low rates environment typical of the last decade.
Consequently, they have started being challenged by trading bots which are
very cost effective. Over the years, algorithms will become smarter and more
efficient. They will reduce all these undue expensive management fees down
to more acceptable levels.
From a broader perspective, quantitative strategies have gained exponential
interests for the last years. As an example, the graph below shows the
growth in assets under management for systematic strategies called Smart
Beta (black plain line), which are strategies of relative low intelligence, yet
exponential interest by traditional investors:

3.

Extending the investment universe to real assets
enables to transfer value and liquidity from the
“real” world to the crypto ecosystem
To trade crypto-assets is very convenient since it may benefit from the full
power of smart contracts with a completely seamless structure within the
crypto environment. However, we are convinced that restricting investments
to these assets only would be a mistake, for the following several reasons:

7

NaPoleonX
• Volume
Even with the recent market capitalization records, BTC and ETH
are still a fraction of the largest asset markets (equities, fixed income
…). Giving the possibility to invest in real assets would allow to
manage larger amounts of funds from day one than simply trading
altcoins and bitcoin.
• Value Transfer
With efficient trading strategies, lots of value can be seized from the
real world and transfer back to the crypto ecosystem. Such value
transfer shall fuel the growth of the crypto world and accelerate its
journey towards general acceptance (virtuous cycle).
• Diversification
Portfolio management intrinsically relies on diversification.
Creating numerous DAFs will offer this possibility.
The NaPoleonX project has been launched because we believe we should
contribute to the tokenization of real assets happen rather than wait for it.
The way we are seeing the crypto-market universe of investment solutions:

Boosting exponential rise in crypto market
capitalization

Total market capitalization for all crypto currencies has experienced an
exponential rise due to the beginning of democratization among fiat holders.
To develop further there will need to be several conditions including some
kind of regulatory framework and the development of investment solutions.

Our vision is that in a few years time, large institutional investors will start
diversifying their investment portfolio in order to incorporate these new assets
in their allocation. Before that, Family Offices, Private Bank and Wealth
Management Bank clients will also start allocating some of their portfolios
into crypto assets.

NAPOLEONX
- THE FIRST 100% ALGORITHMIC
CRYPTO ASSET MANAGER

1.

The project

NaPoleonX will be the first 100% algorithmic crypto asset manager.
The project is founded by ex-multi-billions asset managers in Tier 1 banks,
who have already designed, created and traded performing trading bots for
the past 15 years.
The NaPoleonX smartcontract will be deployed by Napoleon Crypto SAS,
a French company. This company will hold or benefit from the intellectual
property over the trading bots for the first 10 DAFs that are proposed in
this project. This intellectual property will be shared with NPX token holders
according to two modalities: the diffusion of trading signals used by the
DAFs and a revenue share over the DAFs bots’ rental fees
Napoleon Crypto SAS or a fully owned subsidiary may apply for an asset
management license in a EU country as soon as the ICO has been completed.
At this stage, France and Luxembourg are strongly considered as potential
candidates as both Stéphane Ifrah and Jean-Charles Dudek have managed
French and Luxembourg funds during their previous job at BNP Paribas Asset
Management and Natixis Asset Management.
As of today, more than 20 performing trading bots are available. A first
batch of 10 DAFs will be launched at predefined conditions and only based
on Napoleon Crypto intellectual property. After that, a negotiation will be
set up between NPX token holders, Napoleon Crypto and potential external
strategy provider for each new DAF.

2.

The NPX token

As participant to the NaPoleonX ICO, each subscriber will be
attributed some NPX tokens. Essentially, the NPX token is a token giving
right to:
• the personal usage of the trading bots signals of the trading bots that
will be implemented in the 10 first DAFs. Corresponding signals will
be transmitted to the NPX token holders through a mechanism that
shall ensure that NPX tokens are needed to access this information. In

10

NaPoleonX
addition, there will be a mechanism so that the more tokens are hold,
the soonest the information is delivered. The usage will be at the sole
discretion of the NPX token holders.
• access to rental fees (“Botons”), for the first 10 DAFs . These Botons,
which represent a rental fee over the proposed bots, will be payable
on a monthly basis and equal to 25% of the positive performance.
NPX token holders will be granted 85% of these Botons and Napoleon
Crypto SAS 15%. Last but not least, these Botons will be payable in
new DAF tokens issuance for the corresponding value.
Besides, the NPX token holders shall have access to a Platform enabling
them to access their own account and reporting on DAF tokens received as
Botons. This Platform shall also enable anyone:
• to access the updated audits of the several trading bots, to check the
latest performances of bots
• to monitor the token events and performance of each DAF,
• and to have access to relevant documentation on trading bots.

3.

DAF concept (see Appendix for more details)

DAFs are the ultimate investment vehicles since they intrinsically
give access to the latest trading techniques and algorithms (bots). Napoleon
Crypto SAS will make available its existing library but will also give access to
any future development. Each DAF will use one or a combination of trading
bots.
From a legal point of view, DAF may take the form of discretionary
mandates, funds or other adequate legal form. From a conservative point of
view, Napoleon Crypto SAS (or a subsidiary) may candidate for an asset
management license in a EU Country, that shall be preferably France or
Luxembourg, mainly due to the asset management experience of the founders
in both countries.
Due to their underlying legal structuring (as mandate or fund for instance),
DAFs may be restricted to some specific categories of investors, such as
qualified investors. However, even if DAFs may be very interesting for
retail investors, the main target of investor is qualified investors with large
investment capacities (and needs). It is reminded that, so far and to the
founder’s knowledge, NaPoleonX will be the first entity to offer very scalable
investment solutions, i.e. able to handle very large amounts of investments
(> 100 m€).

11

NaPoleonX
New DAFs may be regularly proposed by Napoleon Crypto SAS or any
other Strategy Provider (as defined further) to the NPX token holders. In
order to be attractive to a large range of investors, DAF may be created
with different governance models, Botons’ consumptions or even underlying
blockchains (including BTC).
Any Strategy Provider proposing a DAF, shall present the set of eligible
trading bots and the governance model enabling to select the trading bots
that shall be used together with the financial leverage. It shall also indicate
the Botons’ consumption, and the portion of the Botons collected that shall be
ultimately affected to the NPX token holders.
Botons shall be paid by each DAF on a monthly basis, by the issuance of
new DAF tokens, matching the value of the Botons consumed on the previous
month. At payment dates, the Net Asset Value of a DAF token is computed
(the NAV price), and the amount of the Botons consumed is issued at the
NAV price to the benefice of the NPX token holders, the Strategy Provider
and Napoleon Crypto SAS.

NaPoleonX
THE INITIAL COIN OFFERING
AND THE FOLLOWING STEPS

1.

NaPoleonX ICO

Any crypto-investor will have the opportunity to participate in the
NaPoleonX project through an ICO to be launched on 4th December 2017
on the Ethereum blockchain.

NaPoleonX will launch its ICO by issuing NPX tokens and is aiming to collect
40 000 ETH that will be sold by Napoleon Crypto SAS, in order to:
• Acquire or rent the required asset management licenses to launch DAFs
• Develop a Platform:
to publish indices based on proposed strategies for performance
monitoring
for NPX token holders to get access to the trading signals of the
DAFs
for NPX token holders to manage their private account (including
collected DAF tokens as payments of Botons) and vote on collective
decisions,
for future DAF subscribers to manage their portfolio of assets,
for DAFs to manage ICO and successive SCOs
• Promote the NPX tokens,
• Promote the DAFs’ creation and performances,
• Finance the R&D to create new performing trading bots
There is no minimum amount below which (once the BTC- and EURdenominated purchases have been converted to ETH using the appropriate
daily conversion rate based on the closing values provided at coinmarketcap.
com), the Company undertakes to repay each purchaser for the amount
received for the purchase of NPX. However, the Company may decide at
it sole discretion to repay each purchaser for the amount received for the
purchase of NPX (provided that the Company shall not indemnify purchasers
for the gas and fees spend for their purchase and repayment). If repayment
is not decided, the Company shall issue and deliver NPX to each purchaser.

17

NaPoleonX
Hardware wallet and multi-sig:
A hardware wallet will be set up so that all raised amount will be transferred
to it after the successful ICO. Solutions proposed by Ledger will be preferred.
The aim will be to transfer all amount to a multi-sig smart-contract that will
be controlled only from hardware wallets. Such multi-sig contract will be a
4/6 multi-sig, so that the validation of 4 private keys among 6 is necessary
to transfer funds from it, except for a small amount per day (20 ETH) as
conceived by Consensys on its multi-sig template contract.

2.

ICO Mechanism and Issue of NPX tokens

ICO Mechanism
The ICO smart-contract will be used to track all the contributions made by
the several subscribers. Due to (i) the founders’ past experience, (ii) to the
ambition of the NaPoleonX project, (iii) to the early investors considerations,
(iv) to the several alerts made by diverse regulators around the world and
(v) to the numerous risks of being too borderline, a strong emphasis on the
compliance of the ICO process with the local regulation (France) has been
decided.
As such, advised by Chaineum and Hubert de Vauplane from Kramer Levin
Naftalis & Frankel LLP, it has been decided to follow the following process:
• Contributions will be accepted in ETH, but also in EUR and BTC. For
each subscription in fiat or BTC, a daily conversion rate will be applied,
ex-post, through the closing values given by coinmarketcap.com.
• Contributions will be received through three (ETH, BTC and EUR) escrow
accounts
For ETH and BTC contributions, each participant will receive a
customized address to send its contribution to, once a KYC/AML
process has been cleared, as more detailed below.
For EUR contributions, a payment by credit card will be available
on top of the regular fund transfers.
• Contributions will be subject to:
A minimal amount of 1 ETH or 0,1 BTC or 1000 EUR

Not being from the following countries:
• USA (for citizenship or residency)
• North Korea
• Iran
• Iraq
• Lybia
• Syria
• South Sudan

Pre-ICO and Green List

As several ICOs have experienced a tremendous interest, the
Ethereum Blockchain have suffered high peaks of transactions demand,
putting at risk the network itself and jeopardizing subscribers’ opportunity to
participate in the project.
To cope with this risk, it has been decided to organize a Pre-ICO. To access
the Pre-ICO with a 30% bonus, potential subscribers shall have registered

21

NaPoleonX
on the Green List (at: http://bonus.napoleonx.ai), and notably indicate their
Minimal Contribution Intention (in ETH or equivalent) and their email.
For the Pre-ICO, bonus will only be available to people having registered on
the Green List. Contribution and access to a 30% Bonus Program are fully
granted to these subscribers subject to total Pre-ICO bonus limited to the first
40,000 ETH or equivalent.
This will be specified on our crowdsale.napoleonx.ai payment website.
Please, check the following website: https://www.napoleonx.ai, for updates

LEGAL DISCLAIMER
Any buyer purchasing the Company’s products or services expressly
acknowledges technical and market uncertainties which are inherent in any
business development project as presented in this White Paper (see below
for risk factors) and that this project may therefore never come to fruition or
may have to be abandoned, without the NPX being used. In such a case,
the buyer expressly acknowledges and accepts that it will not be entitled
to sue or bring any direct or indirect legal action before the courts, the
arbitration bodies or any alternative dispute settlement body, either in France
or abroad, against the Company, its directors, shareholders, employees or
subcontractors in the event of the non-performance, non-deployment or nonimplementation of the project, even in cases where its NPX have lost some
or all of their value.
In addition, the Company may not be held liable for any of the following:
i.

use of services that are not compliant with the applicable terms;

ii.

non-performance, failure, malfunction or unavailability of the services
due to a third party, the buyer, a third-party product, or the buyer’s
breach of its obligations;

iii. indirect damages such as business loss or disturbance, loss of orders,
operating loss, infringement of the trade mark, loss of profits or clients
(e.g. improper disclosure of confidential information concerning said
clients due to failure or piracy of the Platform, third-party proceedings
against the client, etc.);
iv.

loss, disclosure or unlawful or fraudulent use of user sign ons by the
buyers or third parties;

v.

suspension of access or temporary or permanent suspension of
services (in particular, arising from a request issued by an appropriate
administrative or judicial authority, or notification received from a
third party);

vi. loss, alteration or destruction of all or part of the content (information,
data, applications, files or other items) hosted on the infrastructure,
insofar as the Company is not responsible for managing the continuity
of buyersbuyers’ activities, and data backups in particular;
vii. mismatch between the services and the buyer’s needs (in particular,
with regard to the sensitivity of the relevant data);

23

NaPoleonX
viii. security incidents relating to use of the Internet, concerning in particular
the loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure or unauthorized access to
the buyer’s data or details on or via the Internet; and
ix. damages to systems, applications and other items installed by the
buyer on the infrastructure.

securities or rights belonging to the Company or any related or associated
company.
None of the information or analyses in this White Paper is intended to provide a
basis for an investment decision, and no specific investment recommendation
is made. Accordingly, this White Paper does not constitute investment advice
or an invitation to invest in any security or financial instrument of any nature
whatsoever.
This White Paper does not constitute or form part of, and should not be
construed as, an offer for a sale or subscription, or an invitation to buy or
subscribe securities or financial instruments. This White Paper, or any of its
component parts, does not constitute the basis for, or should not be used
as a basis for, or in connection with, a contract for the sale of securities or
financial instruments or a commitment to sell securities or financial instruments
of any kind.
The Company expressly disclaims any liability for any direct or indirect loss
or damage of any kind arising directly or indirectly from:
i.

any reliance on the information contained in this White Paper;

ii.

any error, omission or inaccuracy in said information; or

iii. any resulting action that may be brought.
This White Paper has been constructed in accordance with the applicable
EU regulations.

A NPX does not represent an investment
in a security or a financial instrument within the meaning of EU Directive
2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May
2014 relating to markets in financial instruments: NPX confer no direct or
indirect right to the Company’s capital or income, nor does it confer any
governance right within the Company;

24

NaPoleonX
A NPX is not proof of ownership or a right of control
Control over a NPX does not grant the controlling individual any asset or
share in the Company, or in the Platform. A NPX does not grant any right to
participate in control over the Company’s management or decision-making
set-up, or over Platform.

A NPX is not an electronic currency
within the meaning of EU Directive 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 16 September 2009 relating to access to and pursuit of
the business of electronic currency institutions: NPX are not accepted outside
the Platform and do not have a fixed exchange value equal to the amount
delivered at the time of its issue;

A NPX is not a payment service
within the meaning of EU Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 13 November 2007 relating to payment services in the
internal market, nor within the meaning of EU Directive N° 2015/2366 of
the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 relating
to payment service 2 (DSP 2): the ICO does not involve the purchase and/
or sale of NPX and the Company’s business does not consist in receiving
currencies against the delivery of NPX; as such, a NPX is not a means of
payment either.

A NPX is a cryptographic token used by the Platform.
A NPX is a crypto-currency, i.e. an unregulated digital asset issued and
controlled by its developers and used and accepted by the members of a
given community.

Sales restrictions
Participation in the ICO is restricted to natural or legal persons acting within
the scope of their professional activities. Any private individual acting on
a non-professional basis as a simple consumer, within the meaning of EU
Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
October 2011 on consumer rights, is excluded from the ICO.
Documents linked to the ICO may not be transmitted or distributed to a
“U.S. citizen” or to mail or email addresses in the United States of America.
It is prohibited to transmit, distribute or reproduce documents linked to the

25

NaPoleonX
ICO to or for a “U.S. citizen” or within the territories of the United States of
America, in whole or in part.
To ensure their eligibility for the purchase of NPX, buyers expressly declare
that they are not a “U.S. citizen” (within the meaning of “Regulation S” of
the Securities Act 1933 under U.S. law), i.e.:
i.

any private individual resident in the United States of America;

ii.

any partnership or business organized or established under U.S. law;

iii. any property of which the executor or administrator is a U.S. citizen;
iv.

any trust of which a proxy is an American citizen;

v.

any agency or branch of a foreign entity located in the United States
of America;

vi. any non-discretionary account or similar account (other than a trust
or property) held by a trader or other trustee for the benefit of or on
behalf of a U.S. citizen;
vii. any discretionary account or similar account (other than a trust or trust)
held by a trader or other trustee, that is organized, established or (if a
private individual) resident in the United States of America; and
viii. any partnership or company if:
a. it is organized or established under the law of a foreign jurisdiction;
and
b. it is formed by a U.S. citizen primarily for the purpose of investing
in securities not listed under the U.S. Securities Act, unless it is
organized or established, and owned, by accredited investors
who are not private individuals, trusts or properties.

Warnings on the risks inherent to the ICO
Risk of loss of access to a NPX due to loss of credentials
Until it is distributed to the buyer, the said buyer’s NPX may be linked to a
Company account. You can only access the Company account using the
credentials selected by the buyer. The loss of these credentials will result in
the loss of the NPX. Good practices advise buyers to store their credentials
securely in one or more backup locations that are geographically separated
from the work location.

26

NaPoleonX
Risks Associated With the Ethereum Protocol
Both NPX and the Platform are based on the Ethereum protocol. Therefore,
any malfunction, unplanned function or unexpected operation of the Ethereum
protocol may cause the Platform or NPX to malfunction or operate in a way
that is not expected. Ether, the native Ethereum Protocol account unit, may
itself lose value in a similar way to NPX, and also in other ways.
For more information on the Ethereum protocol, see
> http://www.ethereum.org/

Risks associated with the buyer’s credentials
Any third party that obtains access to the buyer’s credentials or private keys
may be able to use the buyer’s NPX. To minimize this risk, buyers must protect
themselves against people gaining unauthorized access to their electronic
devices.

Legal risk and risk of adverse regulatory intervention in one or more
jurisdictions
Blockchain technologies have been reviewed by various regulatory bodies
around the world, including within the European Union. The ICO has been
structured to comply with EU law applicable at the time of the offer.
The operation of the Platform and of NPX may be impacted by the passing of
restrictive laws, the publication of restrictive or negative opinions, the issuing
of injunctions by national regulators, the initiation of regulatory actions or
investigations, including but not limited to restrictions on the use or ownership
of digital tokens such as NPX, which may prevent or limit development of the
Platform.
Given the lack of crypto-currency qualifications in most countries, each buyer
is strongly advised to carry out a legal and tax analysis concerning the
purchase and ownership of NPX according to their nationality and place of
residence.

Risk of an alternative, unofficial Platform
Following presales and development of the original version of the Platform,
there is a possibility that alternative platforms may have been established
using the same open-source code and open source protocol that underlies
the Platform. The official Platform may find itself in competition with these
alternatives, unofficial platforms based on NPX, which could potentially
adversely impact the Platform and NPX.

27

NaPoleonX
Risk of a lack of interest in the Platform or distributed applications
There is a possibility that the Platform may not be used by a large number
of companies, individuals and other organizations, and that there may
be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed
applications. Such a lack of interest could impact on the development of the
Platform and, therefore, on the uses or potential value of NPX.

Risk that the Platform is not developed
The main right associated with NPX is the right to receive the Botons from,
and to use the trading bot signals of, the 10 first DAFs implemented on
the Platform. The value of the NPX is therefore heavily correlated with the
existence of such Platform and/or such DAFs, which have not yet been
implemented. NPX may lose part or all of their value if the Platform and/or
DAFs are never fully developed.

Risk of non-performance of the DAFs
The main right associated with NPX is the right to receive the Botons from,
and to use the trading bot signals of, the 10 first DAFs implemented on
the Platform. The value of the NPX is therefore heavily correlated with the
performance of such DAFs. Such performance is not guaranteed, and NPX
may lose part or all of their value if the DAFs do not perform as expected.

Risk that the Platform, as developed, does not meet buyer expectations
The Platform is currently under development and may undergo significant
redesign prior to its launch. For a number of reasons, not all buyer expectations
concerning the Platform or NPX’s form and function may be met on the
launch date, including changes in design, implementation and execution of
the Platform.

Risk of theft and piracy
Hackers or other malicious or criminal groups or organizations may
attempt to interfere with the Platform or the availability of NPX in several
ways including, but not limited to, denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks,
mystification, surfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks.

28

NaPoleonX
Risk of error in the source code
The distribution of NPX to each purchaser may be by adversely affected by
various human and technical errors in the source code of the Smart Contract
System or in the source code of the escrow accounts mentioned above.

Risk of security weaknesses in the Platform’s core infrastructure software
The Platform‘s core software is based on open source software. There is
a risk that the Company team, or other third parties, may intentionally or
unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructure
elements of the Platform, by interfering with the use of, or causing loss of,
NPX.

Risk of weakness or exploitable breakthrough in the field of cryptography
Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of
quantum computers, may present risks for crypto-currencies and the Platform,
which could result in the theft or loss of NPX.

Risk of a NPX mining attack
As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and crypto-currencies, the
blockchain used for the Platform is vulnerable to mining attacks, including
but not limited to, dual-expense attacks, powerful mining attacks, selfish
mining attacks, and critical competition attacks. Any successful attack poses
a risk to the Platform, the expected performance and sequencing of the
Company’s markets, and the expected performance and sequencing of
Ethereum contract calculations. Despite the best efforts of the Company’s
team, the risk of known or new mining attacks exists.

Risk of the Platform failing to be used or adopted
While NPX should not be considered an investment, their value is bound to
change over time. This value may be limited if the Platform is not sufficiently
used and adopted. In such a case, there could be few or no markets at the
Platform launch, which would limit the value of NPX.

Risk of a tight market for NPX
There are currently no exchanges or trading facilities on which NPX can be
traded. If such exchanges or trading facilities do develop, they will probably
be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They
may therefore be more vulnerable to fraud and default than the established

29

NaPoleonX
and regulated exchanges that exist for other products. Should exchanges or
trading facilities that represent a substantial part of the NPX trading volume
be involved in fraud, security failures or other operational problems, the
failures of such exchanges or trading facilities may limit the NPX value or
liquidity.

Risk of an uninsured loss
Unlike bank accounts or accounts in other regulated financial institutions, funds
held through the Company or Ethereum network are generally uninsured. At
present, there are no public or private insurance agents providing buyers
with coverage against a loss of NPX or a loss of value.

Risk of winding-up of the Company’s project
For a number of reasons including, but not limited to, an unfavorable
fluctuation in Bitcoin value, an unfavorable fluctuation in NPX value, the
failure of business relationships or competing intellectual property claims, the
Company project may no longer be a viable activity and may be dissolved
or simply not launched.

Risk of malfunction in the Platform
The Platform may be impacted by an adverse malfunction including, but not
limited to, a malfunction that results in the loss of NPX or market information.

Unforeseen risks
Crypto-currencies and cryptographic tokens are a new, untested technology.
In addition to the risks stipulated above, there are other risks that the
Company’s team cannot predict. Risks may also occur as unanticipated
combinations or as changes in the risks stipulated herein.

Recent regulatory actions
As mentioned above, operations of the Platform, the DAFs and the NPX
may be impacted by future restrictive laws, regulations, opinions, decisions,
injunctions, actions or investigations by national regulators and lawmakers.
Some regulators have already initiated formal or informal proceedings related
to the regulation of ICOs and tokens, some of which are listed hereunder.
This list is provided for information purpose only and do not constitute legal

DAF: THE FUTURE OF INVESTING

1.

Implementation of the 10 first DAFs by Napoleon
Crypto

Napoleon Crypto SAS has decided to propose its first DAFs according to
the features described below. However, from a global point of view, a DAF
may be created with less constraints and any smart-contract able to handle
trading bots and to pay Botons shall be eligible as DAF to be proposed to the
NPX token holders. As such, the NPX token holders may benefit from a wide
range of investment vehicles.
The 10 first DAFs to be created by Napoleon Crypto SAS, shall consist in
a smart contract characterized by a predefined feature and a set of global
variables.
Global variables correspond to the investment philosophy behind the initial
DAF concept, and consists in the following:
• Strategy Provider: the legal entity aimed at proposing quantitative
strategies to the DAF
• Underlying Asset: the underlying asset the strategy should invest in
• Currency: the currency on which the investors want to be exposed
• Min Size: the minimal size of the funds at inception

34

NaPoleonX
• Max Size: the maximal size of the funds
• Redemption Threshold: 75% of the DAF tokens
• Botons’ consumption: 25% of Performance
• Voting Period: from 10 calendar days to 3 calendar days before SCO
Day
• SCO Days: every six months, the subscription may be opened to
additional investors through dedicated Secondary Coin Offerings
(SCOs).
Besides, a redemption feature corresponding to the possibility to terminate
the DAF if the percentage of DAF tokens voting such redemption is above the
Redemption Threshold, will be implemented.

2.

Global variables

Strategy Provider
The Strategy Provider is any legal entity able to:
• propose a set of performing trading strategies corresponding to the
Underlying Asset,
• implement such strategies for the account of the DAF and its subscribers.
For this, an asset management license may be required.
Napoleon Crypto SAS will be the initial candidate for the first 10 DAFs. It
has already access to a strong portfolio of performing quantitative strategies.
More details on these strategies are disclosed in the Blackpaper.

Underlying Asset
Possible Underlying Assets include:
• Equity Index underlying such as: SPXT, SX5E, HSI, NKY, SMI, MXEF,
EPRA, etc
• Forex underlying such as: EURUSD, EURGBP, JPYUSD, GBPUSD etc
• Commodities underlying such as: Gold, Silver, etc
• Fixed income underlying such as: TBONDS, BUND, OAT, BTP, etc.
• Cryptocurrencies such as: ETH, BTC, etc.

35

NaPoleonX
Each Underlying Asset is anchored to a specific currency, which may be
different from the one the investors want their performance to be expressed
in.

Currency
As most DAFs should only accept ETH (or BTC) as subscription proceeds, the
invariant Currency of the DAF will be chosen between ETH (or BTC) and the
currency anchored to the Underlying Asset (referred to as BaseCurr below).
If the chosen Currency was the BaseCurr, it means that the investors could be
exposed to the variation between ETH and BaseCurr. In particular, if ETH/
BaseCurr earns 20% during a given period, a performance of 10% of the
Blend on this period would produce a loss of 12% when viewed as a ETH
investment (-12% = 1-(1+10%)*(1-20%)).
That is why we have decided to denominate the DAFs in ETH with a hedging
strategy that will be implemented as follows:

Natural hedging
Strategies developed by Napoleon Crypto use financial instruments (Futures)
designed to allow for a substantial leverage (up to c. 8,0x for equities).
To get the target exposure on the Underlying Asset, it may not be necessary
to use 100% of the fund cash. An Initial Margin will be calculated by an
Exchange that will depend on its nature and underlying volatility. For example,
if only 20% of the funds would be required as Initial Margin to achieve a
target exposure, 80% of this DAF’s fund would remain “unused”. They would
be kept in ETH. Therefore, part of the DAFs will have a natural currency
hedge. To calculate the accurate level of fund required, we will use Initial
Margin levels from Exchanges together with some headroom management
buffers to minimize unnecessary trading between ETH and BaseCurr.
The higher the Financial Leverage is, the lower the natural hedging will be.

Initial Margin hedging
According to the Financial Leverage, part of the investment is not naturally
hedged (as described above). However, this remaining part may also be
hedged through derivatives listed on some Crypto Exchanges, when such
derivatives exist if expressly mentioned within the smart contract.
For instance, with a Financial Leverage of 1, if 20% of the invested amount
is not naturally hedged. A derivative hedging such 20% may be bought,

36

NaPoleonX
when available, to reduce this currency risk. This will bear costs that should
be covered by the performance of the trading bots.

Performance hedging
Even with the best strategies, performance may not be forecasted with
precision. The future remains uncertain.
As a consequence, hedging performance against currency risk will be a little
bit trickier as performance can come and go. This will induce additional
hedging cost but given the volatility in ETH vs BaseCurr this risk may be
worth being hedged.

Net Asset Value (NAV)
At any time after its creation, it is very easy to compute the net asset value
of the DAF and then of each DAF tokens, since all the assets of the DAF are
very liquid and composed of:
• some ETH
• some financial instruments to be exposed to the Underlying Asset
• some derivatives instruments to hedge the BaseCurr
All instruments have at least a daily market value, so that a calculation of a
Net Asset Value of the DAF may easily be diffused on a daily basis. The NAV
of a DAF token is then computed by dividing the Net Asset Value of the DAF
by the number of DAF tokens.

Min Size and Max Size
A minimal size is necessary to preserve the generated performance from
execution and fixed costs impacts. Although it may be appreciated on a
case-by-case basis, 20 000 ETH is a minimal amount to launch a DAF.
The size of the fund is limited by the capacity of the selected Blend of
strategies to generate the same performance when the size is growing. It is
most fundamentally linked to the liquidity of the Underlying Asset, but also on
the market intervention frequency. Napoleon Crypto will provide strategies
(mostly low frequency on equity indices) that may accommodate several
hundred million of Euros of investment without affecting their performances.
On the contrary, for less liquid underlying assets (crypto-currencies) or
specific trading styles (high frequency), maximum sizes may be very low
(less than 50m Euros).

Redemption Threshold
A redemption option is to be offered to let them the opportunity to close
a DAF if a sufficient number of subscribers want to. Such option gives an
ultimate liquidity to any subscriber whatever the second market may be. The
Redemption Threshold is set at 75%.

Botons
To use the trading bots provided by the Strategy Provider, a DAF has to
pay some Botons. The amount of Botons is computed from the Performance
generated by the blend of trading bots used by the DAF.
Such Performance is computed at the end of each month and paid by
the DAF through the issuance of DAF tokens at the NAV of the DAF token
calculated on the day before the issuance. For the first 10 DAFs, 85% of such
issued tokens will be granted to NPX token holders, whereas 15% will be
granted to Napoleon Crypto SAS. Any other Strategy Provider may decide
on a different Botons sharing, but the NPX token holders would be the ones
deciding at the end to launch or not the DAF proposed by such Strategy
Provider.
Net Performance is defined to be the (gross) Performance minus the Botons
consumed and any execution costs. Over a given period of time, the Net
Performance corresponds to the increase of the Net Asset Value of the DAF
tokens.
Botons’ consumption is set at the DAF creation and will be 25% of Performance
for the 10 first DAFs.
As an example, if, at the beginning of a month, one of the 10 first DAFs has
a Net Asset Value of 100’000 ETH, and if there are 100’000 DAF tokens,
then the NAV of the DAF token amounts to 1 ETH. If the Performance is
10% at the end of such month, then the gross performance (execution costs
excluded) is of 10’000 ETH, of which 2’500 ETH represents the BBotons’
consumption (25% of 10’000 ETH). As a consequence, at the end of the
month, the Net Asset Value of a DAF token equals 1 x (1 + 10% x (1-25%)) =
1.075 ETH. Then, 2’325.5814 DAF tokens (2’500/1.075) shall be issued
among which 1’976.74419 (85% x 2’325.5814) shall be allocated to the
NPX token holders having participated to the voting sessions involving the
eligibility of the trading bots used by the DAF.

High Watermark
Even with the most performing strategies, returns may be negative from time
to time. If a given strategy or blend of strategies experienced a negative
monthly return followed by a positive monthly return, no Botons may be
collected before the highest past net performance is reached. Such level
corresponds to a High Watermark below which no Botons are collected.
The table below shows some example, with a Botons’ consumption level set
at 25%:

Voting Period
After the ICO creating the DAF, voting sessions shall be organized every 6
months for the DAF token holders. The Voting Period is defined as the 10th
calendar day up to the 3rd calendar day after the SCO Day.
DAF token holders may decide to terminate the DAF and redeem it. To occur,
the number of voting rights deciding such redemption shall be above 75%.
If redemption is decided, then all non crypto-assets in which the DAF is
invested shall be liquidated within 5 days. After such liquidation, the
corresponding smart contract shall terminate: DAF tokens are redeemed and
all crypto-assets are transferred to the DAF token holders in proportion of
their share in the DAF.

SCO Day
Each SCO, as defined above, will be proposed at a specific date every 6
months. Such day is defined as the SCO Day. The subscription period will
last 7 calendar days starting from the SCO Day.

Extension

As detailed above, DAFs are structured to use strategies based on
one given Underlying Asset. As such, DAFs may be viewed as elementary
investment bricks aimed at being selected to build investment allocation
strategies of higher level.
When sufficient DAFs will be created, any asset manager may develop
investment strategies using DAFs. Doing so, the volume of invested amounts
and the level of performance shall increase so that Botons paid back to NPX
token holders shall also increase with time.
DAF may be created on various blockchains, BTC included, as soon as a
framework for smart-contract exists (RSK is coming soon on BTC).
