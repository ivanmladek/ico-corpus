Abstract. One of the descendants of Bitcoin, Fluttercoin sets itself apart as the first
crypto-currency to provide transactions as a proof of participation. Proof-oftransaction adds an additional layer of blockchain and transactional security by allowing
economic participants to prove they were involved in a transaction. This system verifies
the coinbase of every proof-of-work block, and validity of a proof-of-transaction reward
or lack thereof. The result, secures the blockchain as all unmodified nodes will reject
invalid blocks that should or shouldn’t have included a proof-of-transaction rewards.

Introduction
Since the inception of Bitcoin, mining reward has been reserved for the miner. Miners as of this writing
range from individuals to corporate operations, and require specialized hardware and energy
consumption to solve proof-of-work blocks. This system effectively eliminates most individuals from
participating in mining, and instead forces them to participate through investment, gifting, or payment
acceptance.
Another issue with the current model is the possibility that an attacker can modify transaction order or
data via 51% attacks or similar. While there have been improvements to Bitcoin’s system, most notably
Proof-of-Stake minting, it does not go far enough.
Proof-of-transaction sets out to solve both issues.
Proof-of-Transaction
Proof-of-work, introduced with Bitcoin provides the initial catalyst for mining and spending coins, and it
is later replaced to an extent by Proof-of-stake, which provides rewards for securing the network
through proof of coin ownership.
With the advent of Proof-of-transaction, we now allow adopters the network to generate partial proofof-work mining rewards in return for verifying their participation in the previous block’s transaction
record.
In addition, proof-of-transaction adds a layer of security by eliminating the possibility to re-order or
modify large chains of block transactions because doing so would possibly cause a block to be rejected
by all other behaving nodes, resulting in the attacker effectively forking onto their own incompatible
blockchain.
Proof-of-Transaction Reward Generation
Proof-of-transaction rewards are decided essentially on acceptance of a new block by the network. On
each block, the previous block’s transactions, and each address contained in said transactions, within the
system parameters, are evaluated for a reward by comparing each address to the previous block’s hash.
Take for example a block with 2 addresses included in a transaction that sent 1000 Fluttercoins from
one Jack to Jill:
Previous block hash:

0000001ca505f2ebf7417a2be81b027c2f6fb6bee300c82e06c4b393d312b0ef
Jack’s Address
FH2DRtWHQ5FfP2LeCWEteqvZKbunSfVqS1
Jill’s Address
FRwNpW6e59SVhJqmZXFyPLRGFkwihBJvfB
We first start by converting each address we evaluate into a hex format, until either all addresses have been evaluated, or a
match is found:
Jack’s Hex Address:
6d74453438706a724d375378396b4a6163756971754d3546676977714a3147526179
Jill’s Hex Address:
7s098a37636f9a878076336b4a8760737d18378737673a73126f763707b8262c376c2f
If the above example, the search term for each above address is as follows:
Jack’s Search Term:
179
Jill’s Search Term:
c2f
Each exact term is used to search for a match in the above previous block’s hash:
Jack’s Search for 179 in 0000001ca505f2ebf7417a2be81b027c2f6fb6bee300c82e06c4b393d312b0ef
Result: false
Jill’s Search for c2f in 0000001ca505f2ebf7417a2be81b027c2f6fb6bee300c82e06c4b393d312b0ef
Result: true

The result is a match for Jill’s search term, resulting in Jill’s address
FRwNpW6e59SVhJqmZXFyPLRGFkwihBJvfB being rewarded 50% (2500 Fluttercoins) of the next
block’s proof-of-work reward of 5000 Fluttercoins.
In order for the above block to be accepted by the network, the search is done on each node
accepting the block, looking particularly for the coinbase size, coinbase reward, and address
involved in the coinbase. If there is any deviation, which would happen through re-ordering of
transactions or modification of transactions, the block is rejected by the network.
Additional Consideration of Proof-of-Transaction
One of the considerations in implementing something like proof-of-transaction is the fact that there
are those who would seek to exploit this system for their gain. Measures were put in place to
prevent such automated spamming of the blockchain for this purpose. They include parameters
which as of this writing set a transaction value greater than 500 Fluttercoins, maximum transactions
of 10 per block, and a maximum number outputs per transaction of 10. In the case of transaction
outputs, if the limit of 10 is exceeded, only the first 5 outputs are considered. These measure and
all future measures with regard to proof-of-transaction seek to eliminate the possibility of simply
flooding a block with transactions sending to many addresses in the hopes of mining a proof-oftransaction reward.
Conclusion

It is my hope that proof-of-transaction will provide an additional layer of security, while also
allowing participants in the economy to unknowingly participate in securing and being rewarded for
their adoption of Fluttercoin as an electronic currency.

I would like to thank all the adopters and supporters of Fluttercoin, as well as those without whose
brilliant work this project wouldn’t be possible, including but not limited to the developers of all
crypto-currencies before Fluttercoin.
