AIRPORTS OVERVIEW
Over the past few decades airports have evolved from mere infrastructure providers
to hubs of commercial activities.
The continuous growth in passenger traffic and coverage of destinations, coming
from the hub strategy of legacy airlines as well as from the rise of low-cost airlines,
has transformed the airport landscape.
Many airports have therefore extended their service offerings, focusing increasingly
on providing a holistic customer experience with the passenger central to both
strategic and commercial decisions.
Airbus’ Global Market Forecast (GMF) for 2017-2036 offers a forward-looking view of
the air transport sector’s evolution, the drivers :strong & resilient passenger traffic
growth ss air transport develops, new drivers become more significant Middle-class
to almost double by 2036.
Traffic forecast Air traffic (RPK) doubles every 15 years.

NOTE: Current and forecasted access modal split is calculated for a relevant selection of 26 European cities and 26 Asian
cities under a "PTx2 scenario" implying a doubling of the worldwide public transport modal share in 2025 compared to
2005

ParkinGO | GOTOKEN WHITE PAPER

1 | The airport-parking sector
Proper management of airport parking activities has a defining impact on the
customer experience, as the parking premises form the first physical point of
contact at the airport for point to point passengers. Moreover, airport parking
activities represent one of the more important shares in the commercial revenue
streams of airports.
Typically, revenues from airport parking represent between 5% and 15% of total
airport revenue and up to 30% of non-aeronautical revenues, depending on the
size of the airport, the proximity to the city center and the availability of public
transport alternatives.
Many airports have witnessed continuous growth of parking activities, despite
development of public transport alternatives.
These alternatives are often supported by national and local mobility policies that
have been adopted to shift the access modal split of airport passengers towards
public transport. However, absolute growth in airport passenger traffic often offsets
the impact of these policies.

2 | History of ParkinGO: from 1995 to 2018
Summary
Established in 1995 as a response to the need for parking areas at Milano Malpensa
airport, ParkinGO has grown its network in the European marketplace through a
consolidation of affiliated off-airport locations offering a range of services that
assure a positive and well-organized travel experience.
By 2006 ParkinGO had become a leading provider in key locations in Italy,
including Linate, Bergamo, and Fiumicino. Followed by new franchises in Verona
and Turin. These ParkinGO sites fueled business growth for ParkinGO extending its
presence nationwide over the next 9 years.

In 2014, ParkinGO Group acquired Park in LAB Sagl, a Swiss technology start-up
specializing in the development of ad hoc software for the parking and mobility
sector. To date, Park in LAB has developed the most important scalable off-airport
parking platform at a global level that makes it possible to aggregate the market
under a single brand.
During the same year, ParkinGO transforms and evolves with the integration of
ParkinGO Green Power an innovative e-mobility project, and ParkinGO Scanner, a
Full HD camera system that guarantees the state of the car. The goal is to become a
mobility platform that offers 360-degree services in the automotive and airport
world.

GENERAL INFORMATIONS
a.a
In order to fund the development of ParkinGO International SA (“ParkinGO” or the “Company”), ParkinGO
tokens (["GOTokens"]) will be created on the Ethereum blockchain and will be sold to the public (the "ICO
Placement").
a.b
GOTokens will be issued by a technical process that uses the «Blockchain» technology. This is an open
source IT protocol over which the Company has no rights, control or liability in terms of its development and
operation. The GOToken distribution mechanism will be controlled by a Smart Contract; this involves a computer
program that can be executed on the Ethereum network or on a blockchain network that is compatible with Smart
Contract programming language.
a.c
GOToken is a token that will allow the user to access the service provided by the ParkinGO Platform (“Utility
Token”).
a.d
The sale of GOToken is final: The GOToken is non-refundable and not redeemable.
a.e
As of the day of the ICO Placement, GOToken does not have the legal qualification of a security pursuant to
Swiss Law and is therefore not qualified as an Asset Token pursuant to the Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) issued on
February 16, 2018 by Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority ("FINMA").
a.f
GOToken does not have a performance or a particular value outside the ParkinGO Platform. GOToken shall
therefore not be purchased or used for speculative or investment purposes.
a.g
As of the day of the ICO Placement, the GOToken sale is currently not subject to the Federal Act on Stock
Exchanges and Securities Trading Law and the Financial Market Infrastructure Act, which ensure that the sale of
certain products or assets is subject to regulatory scrutiny for the investors' protection and may only be sold to
investors provided that, inter alia, the respective documentation include all the proper disclosures and that the sale
of investments.

TOKEN DOCUMENTATION
b.a
This white paper (the “White Paper”) together with the GOToken Terms and Conditions (the “Terms &
Conditions”, see https://parkingo.io/en/terms), as amended from time to time, shall form the entire documentation
for the GOToken sale (the "Token Documentation").

C

KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED
c.a
Any purchaser of GOToken (the "Purchaser") shall understand and have significant experience of
cryptocurrencies, blockchain systems and services, and understand the risks associated with the crowdsale as well as
the mechanisms related to the use of cryptocurrencies (including the storage).
c.b
The Purchaser shall carefully review the Token Documentation so to understand the risks, costs and benefits
associated with the purchase, storage and use of GOTokens.

D

RISKS
d.a
Acquiring GOToken and storing them involves various risks, in particular (but not limited to) the risk that
ParkinGO may not be able to launch its platform and/or its operations, to develop or exploit its blockchain and/or to
provide the services to which the GOToken relates or is forced (in particular due to changes in the legal environment
and/or issuance of new laws or regulations and/or new leading interpretation of current legal framework and/or case
law, which might also have a retroactive effect) to stop its operations or change its business model.
Therefore, and prior to acquiring GOToken, any user should carefully consider the risks, costs and benefits of
acquiring GOToken in the context of the crowdsale and, if necessary, obtain independent legal and tax
advice in this regard.
Any interested person who is not in the position to accept or to understand the risks associated with the activity
(including the risks related to the non-development of the ParkinGO platform) or any other risks as indicated herein
or in the Token Documentation) shall not acquire the GOTokens.

g.a
The ICO Placement and the purchase of GOTokens is taking place within a legal environment that is still

from performing or developing its operations.
g.c

laws in any jurisdictions, even with retroactive effect. In such a case, Purchasers and anyone acquiring GOToken
acknowledge and accept that neither ParkinGO nor any of its affiliates shall be held liable for any direct or indirect
loss or damage caused by such changes.
g.d
ParkinGO is, as of the date of issue of this White Paper, not a financial intermediary according to Swiss Law
and is not required to obtain any authorization for Anti-Money Laundering purpose. This qualification may change at
any time if the services offered by ParkinGO will be considered as a financial intermediation activity pursuant to
applicable law. In this event, the use of ParkinGO services will require the positive conclusion of an AML/KYC

warranty as to the accuracy and completeness of the information included in the White Paper.
h.c

carry out a legal and tax analysis concerning the purchase and ownership of GOToken according to his/her/its
nationality and place of residence.

I

misconduct or gross negligence directly attributable to the Company.
i.c

operation of the Ethereum protocol may cause the ParkinGO network or GOToken to malfunction or operate in a way
that is not expected. Moreover, the native Ethereum Protocol account unit may itself lose value in a similar way to
GOTokens, and also in other ways. ParkinGO assumes no liability or responsibility in this respect except in case of
