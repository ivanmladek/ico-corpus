Decentralized reputation and
payments for peer-to-peer
marketplaces
Listia Inc.
Ink Protocol Whitepaper, Public Draft v8 - February 1, 2018
https://paywithink.com

1

Summary
Ink Protocol is developed by Listia, a P2P marketplace
for buying and selling used goods online. Launched in
2009, the marketplace now has over 10 million
registered users who have exchanged 100 million
items. The company has raised $11MM in venture
capital from prominent investors.
Listia will be introducing a new decentralized
reputation and payment system called Ink Protocol
(“Ink”), which is powered by the Ethereum blockchain
and XNK, an ERC20 compatible token. Ink helps users
safely send and receive payments in P2P marketplaces while earning public reputation for every
completed transaction. It greatly enhances the buying/selling process with decentralized
reputation and feedback ratings, decentralized escrow for secure payments, third party dispute
resolution, and very low transaction costs.
Ink can be integrated into new or existing marketplaces and can also be used in marketplaces
that don't directly handle payments (eg, Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace). For sellers,
accepting Ink builds up their public reputation, which allows them to start selling quickly on new
marketplaces without needing to build reputation from scratch. Buyers can view any seller's
reputation across multiple marketplaces and confidently pay using either automated or
human-mediated escrow contracts. Payments can be made and received natively using the Ink
Protocol Token (XNK) or converted easily to and from fiat currencies like USD.
Ink will also become the new reputation and payment system within the Listia marketplace.
Listia currently uses a centralized virtual currency called Listia Credits for all transactions.
Existing users with Listia Credits will have their balances converted to XNK, providing Ink with a
tremendous boost for initial usage, stability, and network effects on day one. Additionally, Listia
will create a standalone payments app so users of local marketplaces such as Craigslist and
Facebook Marketplace can build reputation and start using Ink right away. With large scale
adoption and apps that can be used in multiple marketplaces at launch, Ink is well situated to
become the preferred reputation and payment system in all P2P marketplace transactions.

1. History & Vision
About Listia
The Listia marketplace (https://www.listia.com) was founded
and launched in 2009 as a “Marketplace for Free Stuff”​1​.
Listia’s vision is to create a safe, easy, and rewarding way for
people to get rid of the unused stuff lying around their homes.
Today, the community consists of 10 million registered users
who have exchanged 100 million items through the Listia
mobile apps and website. Listia has raised over $11M in
venture capital from prominent Silicon Valley VCs and investors including ​General Catalyst,
A16Z, Y Combinator, SV Angel, Founder Collective, Max Levchin, Naval Ravikant and others.
Listia is unique in that users of the marketplace buy and sell goods exclusively using a
centralized virtual currency the company created called “Listia Credits” which have been in
circulation since launch. Users earn Credits by selling things in the marketplace and then spend
those Credits to buy other things in the marketplace. Credits can also be earned through various
activities such as interacting with listings or other users, inviting friends, completing special
offers and goals, or they can be purchased directly from Listia.

Today’s Listia Credits
As it works today, there are a couple key reasons why the Listia marketplace works better with
the Credit system than it would with real money. For example:

● Used goods are hard to value
When Listia was created, marketplaces like Craigslist and eBay were already huge, yet
people in the U.S. still have over $3,100​2​ of unused goods in their homes. It seemed that
unless an item was worth a lot of money, people had little incentive to price and list
those items for sale. Listia invented new ways to motivate people to start selling these
types of items by creating a marketplace that is fun, easy to use and rewarding in
non-monetary ways. Price was no longer something that held people back, and users
love buying and selling their used items using Credits.

● No or low transaction fees

3

People who sell items in some of the most popular marketplaces generally pay
upwards of 10-20% in transaction fees. A portion of the fee is simply how the
business makes money, but a large part of the fee is there because transferring real
money between people is an expensive process due to credit card and bank fees, escrow
services, chargebacks, fraud, etc. Listia's Credit system allows users to trade items
fee-free and thus extract more value than existing marketplaces. This is especially
important with lower priced items where fees effectively kill any incentive to sell in the
first place.
These two reasons alone have been enough to support over 100 million items exchanged since
2009. However, with technology constantly evolving, and the advent of smart contracts and
decentralized currencies, Listia now has a chance to revolutionize not only the Listia
marketplace, but all third party marketplaces by establishing a decentralized payment system
specifically designed to handle trustless transactions, reputation, and feedback.

Introducing a new decentralized reputation and payment system
Listia Credits have worked exceptionally well over
the past 8 years, albeit with plenty of ups and downs
along the way. Now, learning from years of running a
marketplace and virtual currency, Listia is
introducing a new decentralized cryptocurrency and
reputation system called Ink Protocol (“Ink”), which
is powered by the Ethereum blockchain and XNK, an
ERC20 compatible token. Ink is designed specifically
for P2P marketplace transactions where trust
between the buyer and seller may be limited.
Ink will not only be useful on Listia, but will also serve as a fully decentralized reputation and
payment system for potentially any P2P transaction, independent of marketplace. Ink has the
power to create, disrupt, and adapt to the world’s largest online marketplaces by publicly
sharing reputation information on the Ethereum blockchain.
Due to its decentralized nature, sellers can bring their reputation with them to sell on multiple
marketplaces at the same time or move from one to another without having to rebuild their
reputation. Buyers can also view any seller’s reputation and confidently pay using escrow
contracts with optional third party mediation. Payments can be made directly using XNK or
converted to and from fiat currencies like USD.

4

To support these use cases, Ink will natively solve some of the most common and difficult
issues with transacting on a pure P2P marketplace. With these features, Ink has a big
advantage over not only Listia Credits, but also traditional forms of payment:

● Decentralized Reputation and Feedback
● Decentralized Escrow
● Third Party Dispute Resolution
● Very Low Transaction Costs
It’s important to note that most current marketplaces such as Listia were never built to be 100%
decentralized. So, while Ink supports all of these features, individual marketplaces have the
freedom to customize their integration to fit their community. For example, Ink still allows
Listia’s customer support team to provide an extra layer of security and trust by mediating every
dispute as the third party. Each marketplace that uses Ink can establish their own rules and
implement dispute resolution as they see fit, and users who use Ink for transactions on
unmanaged marketplaces like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace are free to choose their
own third party mediator, an automated contract, or none at all.

Immediate value, growth and network effects
Unlike other recently launched cryptocurrencies, Listia has a large community of users who
have already generated millions of dollars in revenue using an existing virtual currency called
Listia Credits. Ink will be fully integrated into the Listia marketplace and replace Listia Credits,
resulting in widespread adoption and immediate usage of Ink at launch. With the current install
base, that will mean millions of real user wallets can go live and there will be enough transaction
liquidity to start using Ink as intended from day one.
At launch, the Listia marketplace will be able to jumpstart Ink via millions of buyers with XNK
balances, sellers with feedback and reputation, and also kick off the network effects in a way
that most new cryptocurrencies could never do.

Ink Pay app and Ink Protocol on other marketplaces
On top of integrating with the Listia
marketplace, Listia will also create a
standalone payments app, called Ink Pay,
so users of other marketplaces such as
Craigslist can build reputation and start
using Ink immediately without having to
wait for those marketplaces to integrate.
The app is designed to obscure
everything related to blockchain and
cryptocurrencies, so anyone can start
using it. Buyers and sellers would simply
meet up and send payment instantly,
while generating publicly accessible
reputation for each other.
As more people start using Ink, their
reputation and transaction history start to

6

grow and each additional completed transaction adds to their trustworthiness. This public
history, stored on the Ethereum blockchain, is incredibly useful in person-to-person
transactions to establish trust and credibility. Being able to move around and carry your
reputation with you to any other marketplace will be a huge benefit, so any marketplace that
supports Ink natively can easily improve the trust and success rate of their communities.
Ink also has the power to disrupt marketplaces that choose not to share reputation and
feedback on the blockchain and attempt to monopolize the data. New marketplaces can quickly
launch with instant trust and feedback in place, while adding to the rapidly growing public
feedback and transaction history. Eventually, trusted users will begin to see every completed
transaction online as something that they should be rewarded and credited for, and
marketplaces that refuse to give them public credit on the blockchain for their activity will be
viewed as incomplete or unsatisfying experiences. Users will migrate to marketplaces that give
them public recognition, so they can get better user experiences across every marketplace at
once.

2. The Ink Protocol Token (XNK) and Features
Purpose
Ink is a decentralized reputation and payment system powered by the Ethereum blockchain and
a native ERC20 utility token called Ink Protocol Token (XNK). It is designed specifically for P2P
marketplace transactions where trust between the buyer and seller may be limited. Ink greatly
enhances the buying/selling process by helping users safely send and receive payments in P2P
marketplaces while earning publicly viewable reputation. Payments within Ink are sent using
XNK, but users can also convert to and from other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies such as
USD.

Token implementation
Ink is implemented on Ethereum as a Smart Contract and includes an
ERC20 compatible utility token, called XNK, which is used for
payments. XNK is a general purpose cryptocurrency that is:

●
●
●
●

Fixed supply
Fractionally divisible
Non-inflationary
Fungible and transferable

Smart Contract features
Ink solves some of the most common and difficult issues with buying and selling on a P2P
marketplace through the following features:

● Decentralized feedback
After every completed Ink transaction, the buyer can leave feedback for the seller about
that transaction. Ink does not support leaving feedback for a buyer, as this is typically
not useful nor is it actionable since sellers usually cannot choose their buyers.
Feedback consists of a rating and a comment about the transaction, which are stored as
data on the Ethereum blockchain. The feedback entry references the id of the
transaction that the seller was involved in and can be seen by anyone with access to the

8

public Ethereum blockchain and Ink Smart Contract. Any person or marketplace will
then be able to look up the feedback
history for a specific seller to
determine their trustworthiness
before choosing to buy from that
seller.

● Decentralized reputation
Reputation refers to the aggregate of
all the seller’s feedback and
transaction history. The feedback
and transaction history for an
individual seller can be read from the
public data within the Smart
Contract and used by anyone to
assign a reputation score based on
those signals. Ink does not include a specific algorithm or calculation method to
compute this score, as it should be marketplace or app-specific.
However, not all information should be treated equally. Ink transactions will include
information about the parties involved, who mediated the transaction, what happened
with the transaction (confirmed or refunded), the feedback rating and comment, and
optionally what the transaction was for. Each individual marketplace has access to all of
this information and should filter what is important to them when displaying a reputation
score. For example, as more third party marketplaces start using Ink, it is possible that
certain marketplaces may be untrustworthy and transactions recorded through them
may hold little to no value when scoring reputation within another marketplace.
Additionally, transactions where users simply transfer XNK to each other without context
should not be used in a reputation score to prevent gaming the system.

● Decentralized escrow with third party dispute resolution
Ink supports decentralized escrow natively to create a safe way for buyers and sellers to
transact. When a buyer pays, the Ink Tokens are held by the contract until the buyer
indicates that the items have been received. At that point, the tokens are released to the
seller and the transaction is finalized. This also serves as a staking function within the
protocol. The seller must stake their reputation against the tokens until the buyer
receives their item.

9

However, sometimes the transaction in a P2P marketplace does not go as planned.
For example, the item may arrive damaged, the seller may lie about shipping an item
out, or the item may not be as described. In this case, most centralized marketplaces will
help resolve your dispute by having a customer support team member look at the
evidence and decide whether a refund is
necessary.
Ink supports this in a decentralized way by
allowing users to assign a human or
automated mediator to every transaction.
The mediator of a transaction exists as a
third party Smart Contract that anybody
can create. For example, marketplaces will
create their own mediation contract to be
used by their customer support staff, and
individuals may set up their own contracts
and provide mediation services to others.

● Mediation and Transaction Fees
To create incentives for marketplaces, apps, and users, Ink allows mediators in a
transaction to take a transaction and/or mediation fee in the form of Ink Protocol
Tokens. The fee structure is defined by the mediator’s Smart Contract and can be setup
as either a flat fee or a percentage fee. The mediator has the option of taking both a
transaction fee on every transaction and/or a mediation fee on transactions where the
buyer and seller actually need the mediator to step in.
Marketplaces that incorporate Ink will likely set themselves as the mediator of every
transaction within the marketplace and take transaction fees and/or mediation fees as
part of their business model. It is also possible that individuals may set up mediation
services where they can get rewarded to help mediate disputes on marketplaces such as
Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. It will be up to the buyers, sellers, and the
community at large to vet these third party mediators by auditing their public Smart
Contracts and mediation histories, all of which will be viewable on the Ethereum
blockchain.

● Linked Addresses
Buyers and sellers within Ink are designated by their Ethereum addresses, which is how
you uniquely identify a specific user and pay that user. Over time, users may accumulate

10

multiple addresses that they use on different marketplaces or apps. These
addresses would all have their own transaction and feedback history and thus
differing reputations. Ink allows users to link addresses they own to merge their
feedback and transaction histories and create a single reputation. Linked addresses
cannot be unlinked.

● Owners
Ink Protocol allows a transaction to be associated with an owner (which is usually an
app or marketplace). The owner contract has to authorize the buyer to create the
transaction. This gives reputation services the ability to know which transaction belongs
to which marketplace. With that knowledge, reputation can be heavily influenced by the
credibility of that marketplace.

Transaction States
Ink distills a typical marketplace transaction into a series of states defined below. This flow was
developed based on the team’s many years of experience running Listia and dealing with all
sorts of outcomes and edge cases that can occur during a marketplace transaction. A full
diagram of the states is included below as well.
●

Initiating a Transaction
All transactions are created by the buyer. The buyer specifies:
1. Who the seller is (represented by an Ethereum address)
2. The price of the item in tokens
3. The metadata of the transaction (this is a hashed representation of the
metadata)
4. Optionally, the mediator, policy, and owner addresses
It may seem strange at first that the buyer is the one initiating the transaction, but this is
to prevent an extra call to the Ethereum blockchain. In practice, apps supporting the Ink
Protocol will wrap the entire process for buyers and sellers such that either the buyer or
seller can create a transaction. Additionally, even though a buyer initiates the
transaction, it does not mean that the seller is automatically held accountable for the
transaction. The seller must approve the transaction before it is considered legitimate.
The seller can also just ignore it completely. Meanwhile, the buyer’s funds are held in
escrow by the transaction.

11

●

Revoking a Transaction
If the buyer and seller do not agree on the terms of the transaction, the seller simply
ignores the transaction. The buyer however, has to revoke the transaction to get her
tokens back from escrow.

●

Accepting a Transaction
The seller specified on the transaction can accept the transaction if he agrees to the
terms specified by the buyer. Accepting the transaction means that the seller can
confidently begin to process and ship the purchased item since the payment is secured
in escrow.

●

Transaction in Progress
Upon accepting, the transaction is now in progress, and the seller is now on a fulfillment
timer to deliver the goods as promised. The length of time allowed for fulfillment (e.g. 2
weeks) is defined in the Policy specified in the transaction. At this point, one of four
things can happen:
1. If the item is not delivered within the fulfillment time, the buyer has the option to
dispute the transaction.
2. If the buyer receives the item and all is well, she would confirm the transaction
and the payment will be moved to the seller’s address from escrow.
3. The seller can refund the transaction if something went wrong and the seller
accepts fault.
4. Enough time (defined in the Policy as the “transaction time”) has gone by and the
buyer has neither confirmed nor disputed the transaction. The seller is now able
to confirm the transaction himself and receive payment.

●

Transaction is Disputed
After the buyer disputes the transaction, the seller has a chance to respond. One of four
things can happen:
1. The seller can escalate the dispute to the mediator to determine the outcome of
the transaction.
2. The seller can refund the transaction.
3. The buyer can confirm the transaction.

12

4. The buyer can force a refund on the transaction after a time (defined in the
Policy as the “escalation time”) has passed.
●

Transaction in Mediation
After escalation, the mediator chosen by the buyer and seller should begin the process
of collecting information to make an informed decision on the outcome of the
transaction. The mediator is granted a period of time, defined by “mediation time” in the
Policy of the transaction, to complete this work. During this period, neither buyer nor
seller can act on the transaction.
In the rare case that the mediator is non-responsive or late in their response (the
“mediation time” has passed), the buyer and seller each have two options available to
them. The buyer can choose to confirm the transaction, thus transferring the payment to
the seller. The seller on the other hand can choose to refund the transaction.
Alternatively, both the buyer and seller can unilaterally settle the transaction, causing a
50/50 split in the payment going to buyer and seller. For all three of these outcomes, no
mediation fee may be taken by the mediator.
After the “mediation time”, and until the buyer or seller have taken action, the mediator
can still respond to the dispute.

●

Transaction is Mediated
The assigned mediator is responsible for making a decision after collecting enough
information from both buyer and seller. The mediator can do one of the follow:
1. Refund the transaction — payment goes back to the buyer, less the mediator’s
fee.
2. Confirm the transaction — payment goes to the seller, less the mediator’s fee.
3. Settle the transaction — the payment is divided between the buyer and seller at
the mediator’s discretion. The mediator can also take a mediation fee at this
point as well.

3. Integration with the Listia Marketplace
Replacing Listia Credits
XNK will fully replace Listia Credits as the main
currency, and Ink will become the main reputation
system within the marketplace. Users will buy and
sell items using XNK and initially will be able to
earn additional XNK for engaging with users,
listings, and advertisers in the marketplace. It will
be a seamless transition for current Listia users
who are already accustomed to using a virtual
currency to buy and sell.
Existing Listia users will need to login and verify
their accounts, if they haven’t already, before
exchanging their current Listia Credits for XNK.
This exchange of Credits for XNK will be available
at launch and for at least 6 months after launch. At
launch, new listings and prices in the marketplace will be converted from Credits to XNK, so
each user’s buying power remains exactly the same to start. This will serve as an initial anchor
and stabilizer for the market price of XNK.
After launch, users will also start to earn XNK in all the places where they used to earn Listia
Credits, such as certain goals and incentivized engagement, referring other users, and
completing tasks and offers. The amounts of these rewards will change and the requirements
may become more strict as the incentives and potential value of XNK changes. Users will still be
able to buy XNK to spend or make up the difference when they don’t have enough to buy an
item. In this case, Listia may sell directly from its own supply of XNK or help users buy from a
third party exchange.

Millions of consumer wallets
Listia will integrate virtual XNK wallets for each Listia user account. The wallets will be created
and maintained by Listia for the purposes of transactions within the Listia marketplace, but will
also support withdrawals and deposits to and from external addresses via the public Ethereum
network. Within the Listia marketplace, Listia will manage the transactions for each user and
hide the complexities of dealing with public/private keys, Smart Contracts, etc. In the beginning,

15

Listia will maintain its own centralized off-chain transaction history to speed up transactions
and avoid fees, while separately settling fully completed transactions on the Ethereum
blockchain as needed to publicly record reputation and feedback. However, the long term plan is
for all Ink transactions on Listia to settle directly on the Ethereum blockchain. Listia users will
not need any Ethereum or cryptocurrency knowledge to start and continue buying and selling in
the marketplace.

4. Token Distribution & Economics
Token distribution
XNK will be distributed as widely as possible during a token distribution event at launch. The
distribution will consist of exchanging existing Listia Credits for XNK, and also a private and
public capped sale of tokens.

5. Team
The team first came together in 2009 to build Listia into a community where over 100 million
items have been traded. With over 8 years of experience building a peer-to-peer marketplace,
the team is now focused on applying what they have learned and creating the foundation for
decentralized marketplaces of the future.

6. FAQ
“For Listia, what is the benefit of switching from Credits to XNK?”
-

XNK provide more value to the end user because they are fungible and can be
exchanged for fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies.

-

Listia no longer needs to act as a central bank to print and regulate the credits, which
has led to inflation issues in the past.

-

Listia can eventually replace its centralized reputation, feedback, and escrow systems
with Ink’s decentralized system.

“Why create Ink and not use existing tokens or cryptocurrencies?”
-

From a technology standpoint, you could certainly use other cryptocurrencies purely for
payment, but Ink is more than just a payment system. Ink is all about decentralizing
reputation and helping buyers and sellers connect and pay safely no matter which

17

marketplace platform they choose to use. The Ink Protocol Token is required to write
to this new reputation network and is the best way to guarantee that payment is
made to the right person.
-

The price of XNK should also be decoupled from the price of ETH and other
purpose-built cryptocurrencies, as Ink’s market cap should be tied to the GMV of the
goods and services being traded in peer to peer markets and not the price of running
contracts in Ethereum or influenced by Ethereum policies that may affect ETH in
significant ways.

-

Most importantly, creating a native token helps to create strong incentives for users and
build very powerful network effects. The problem with current cryptocurrencies is that
there isn’t any consumer usage and no reason for users to start using it. Ink has the
power to change that, as it is designed from the ground up specifically for P2P
marketplace transactions. Users who use it will have an ownership stake in the system
and be more incentivized to spread its usage as they can directly benefit from its
success.

-

To truly jumpstart these network effects, Listia will be able to distribute XNK to millions
of users in the existing marketplace. These are power users who are already buying and
selling using a virtual currency. Each of these users can directly benefit by spreading the
usage of Ink. It is not possible to do this with an existing cryptocurrency such as ETH or
BTC.

“What incentive is there to use XNK? Will the velocity be too high to support the token economy?”
-

XNK is designed to function as a cryptocurrency, so selling and buying with XNK will
typically be cheaper than converting back and forth between fiat currency each time, due
to credit card and/or bank fees. So, for users that are buying and selling frequently within
either the Listia marketplace or other marketplaces, it makes sense to use XNK so they
can purchase goods or services through the token at a later time.

-

Managed marketplaces like Listia will also incentivize using XNK by giving lower service
and transaction fees when transacting using the cryptocurrency vs. fiat.

-

Ink has a staking function built directly into the protocol in the form of the escrow
feature, which naturally reduces velocity of the token. During this time, the seller
prepares and ships the item while staking their reputation against the tokens in escrow
until the buyer receives the item.

18

“What unique functionality will Ink provide that is not already present in other tokens and
cryptocurrencies?”
-

Ink is built specifically for a typical transaction within a P2P marketplace and thus
includes all of these features built-in: decentralized reputation and feedback,
decentralized escrow, and third party dispute resolution.

“Why would other companies use Ink over starting their own coin or token?”
-

Any app can certainly start their own token for transactions within their own ecosystem,
but by creating a purpose-built token for P2P marketplace reputation and payments,
getting it into the hands of millions of people on day one and being the first of its kind,
Ink can generate the network effects necessary to become the d
​ e facto​ standard way
that people buy and sell with each other.

-

Once enough users have built up their public reputation within Ink, it will be difficult to
incentivize them to move to a new system.

“Will companies be willing to share proprietary data from users?”
-

Ink is designed to capture the fundamental details about a transaction, so it does not
require other companies to actively share any proprietary or sensitive data about their
users. The data within the Ink ecosystem will be built organically one transaction at a
time, with a big boost from the Listia marketplace integration.

“Why would other marketplaces use Ink instead of only fiat currency like USD?”
-

Listia will also be building a simple payments app so users of huge marketplaces such
as Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, Letgo, etc. can start using Ink right away,
without needing any integration or support from those marketplaces.

-

Companies like Airbnb rely heavily on user reputation and feedback, which is why they
have insurance for home renters and require deposits for guests. If users came on board
with existing transaction histories, things like insurance rates could go down and there
would be lower fees for home renters that accept Ink. Guests would not need to place
deposits each time, and then get them refunded, as they could use the Ink escrow
feature, which would automatically settle funds as needed.

-

Marketplaces that exchange money for services like Angie’s List or Upwork try to control
feedback scoring and reputation within their marketplace. However, for the service

19

provider that is providing great quality service, they still have to ask you to leave
positive feedback. The decentralized reputation and feedback built into Ink rewards
service providers with a better payment option and automated way to earn reputation
and get feedback. Marketplaces working together on one blockchain have more power
to root out bad service providers while making it more efficient and rewarding for good
providers.
