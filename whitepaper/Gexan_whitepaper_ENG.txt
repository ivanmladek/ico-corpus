Introduction
It happens so that people like to risk a little in order to get more. They are
attracted with the probability of big winnings – sports betting, gambling,
poker, "one-armed bandits" and of course the lottery. This is a stable market
which has existed for a long time and will grow and develop further. The
global lottery market is steadily increasing from $ 187 billion in 2004, up to $
294.3 billion in 2016, showing an average growth of 4.3% per year.

At the same time, the growing number of Internet and mobile users
contributes to the rapid growth of online lotteries. The total revenue of
lotteries on mobile devices in 2013 is estimated at 34 billion dollars, of which
44% - in Europe and North America. The pace of mobile technology adoption
may be even faster in developing markets.
.

Our mission.
Our mission is to create an autonomous decentralized lottery platform. We
want to make fair lotteries with high level of participants’ gains, as well as to
minimize losses receiving the prizes.

Lottery

The problem and the solution
In the world of lotteries – one of the most popular games in the world –
there exist many questions and doubts about the honesty of the prizes
distribution, as well as the whole process of drawings:
- Is the winner random?
- Is it fair to dispose of less than 40-60% of the ticket sales by lottery?
- What is the managers’ fee and is such a remuneration justified?
Moreover, these problems are getting worth due to the difficulty of
obtaining a prize, high commissions and taxation. With the introduction of
blockchain technology, these problems have become quite solvable.
On the Gexan platform, all stages of the draws, including the purchase of
tickets, random numbers generation, distribution of the fund prize,
verification of the winners are based on the technology of the distributed
register. Moreover, everything is built on open source code, which will be
published on Github.

What do we offer?
Our team will develop an ecosystem consisting of its own blockchain with
masternode functions, hybrid POW+POS consensus algorithm, GEX coins,
lottery platform, smart contracts, participant wallets, Fiat site gateways and
mobile applications. Thus, we will get the following advantages over
traditional online lotteries:
-The blockchain technology makes the movement of funds transparent: so it
is possible to track whether, when and to what extent the payments were
made.
- Smart contracts regulate the lottery system. Open source is available for
anyone willing and can’t be adjusted, so the winnings can not be tampered
with.
- Costs for sales outlets, staff, distributors, printing, lottery ticket verification
and more are reduced. All these costs become part of the participants '
winnings, not the profits of third parties.
- A reasonable developers’ fee, only 5% of the sold tickets amount, which are
possible budget for additional promotion of the project.
- Blockchain lottery blurs the boundaries and allows you to choose the
optimal tax regime: with low or no tax rates on winnings and there are the
agreements on avoidance of double taxation with most countries of the
world.

All the above-mentioned advantages will be implemented on the Gexan
platform. It is an ecosystem at the interface of the most advanced
technologies:
- Blockchain
- Smartcontracts
- Masternodes+hybrid POW+POS algorithm
- Fiat gateways on the website and in the mobile application
- internal exchange ( any currency<==GEX==>any currency)

The Gexan Lottery will be international and anonymous platform. The main
differences are set out in table format for ease:

Traditional lottery

Open source code of the
random number generator

A closed system of the

Transparent system of awards
distribution, tickets sold, etc.

The organizing companies
do not disclose this information

The chances of winning the
jackpot are 50 times higher

Average jackpot chances
are 1 to 70'000'000

Even if desired, no one can
affect the payment of winnings

Anonymity, no need to
disclose personal information

Nominees winners are possible

The winners’ names become public

Minimum costs for the lottery operation

Huge expenses on network
distribution, offices, sales points.

Payments of winnings are carried out
instantly, without the participation
of third parties.

A personal appearance in the head offices
is needed for large payments.
Often there is a time limit of
six months to a year.

Blockchain
Lottery

There are many kinds of lotteries that we are going to implement:

5/36.
First of all, the lottery code will be written - some kind of Powerball game.
The participant must "guess" the five main balls (choices are from 1 to 36), as
well as one ball is additional one. Just it is called the ball "Powerball". In total,
this gambling game has nine prize categories. The minimum prize will be
obtained if you guess the ball "Powerball" (values from 1 to 10). You just have
to choose 5 numbers in the purchased ticket. The draw will take place every
day, and the fall of balls with numbers in the system is calculated according
the random number generator. Thus, no one can predict the fallen numbers
in advance, and the these numbers are completely random. The source code
of the algorithm for calculating the dropped numbers will be available on
Github.

Pool.
The next type of lottery will have guaranteed winners. The draw will be held
in the following way: all participants send the desired number of tickets to
the common pool, to the smart contract that records incoming transactions.
Then there is a probabilities calculation of each participant according to the
number of tickets sent to them. The more tickets the player has sent, the
higher chances he/she has to take prizes. After that, there is a "mixing" of all
tickets and randomly the winners is determined. The first three places take
most of the pool. Also, several dozen of players who receive small prizes in
the amount of two or three ticket prices are randomly determined. All
calculations and payments are made in THE Gex coin. Then the winning
players decide whether to sell them on the stock exchange or participate in
the next draw again. 5% of the total pool goes to the development team, the
remaining amount is distributed among the players.

Promo Lottery.
A few weeks after the completion of the Presale stage, the promo lottery
with large prizes in the form of BTC will be held. To participate in such
lotteries, a relatively expensive entrance threshold is provided, but the main
prize will be drawn among the lottery participants 100%. Details of each of
them will be announced in advance through social channels.
We are not going to stop there in the future and we will introduce new types
of lotteries to attract more players. Our goal is to present all the best and
popular traditional lotteries on the Gexan blockchain platform.

Purchasing a certain amount of GEX at the IEO stage, you will receive new
GEX every day after withdraw to your wallet. Really it is a unique opportunity
for the blockchain lottery.
And the sooner you take part in the purchase of coins, the sooner you will
begin to generate new GEX in your wallet.
The installation guide is published on the site Gexan.io to install Masternode.
To get GEX through the hybrid POW+POS algorithm, you only need to store
coins in your wallet, they will be credited to you automatically.

In addition to the high ROI, investors will be able to use their tickets to
participate in daily lotteries. This is a double benefit only for the earliest
investors.
According to the table of block generation, the maximum profitability falls
on the first 3 months of the project. Over the next 6 months, ROI gradually
decreases and stops at a small level. Along with this process, the
development team will "burn" coins after each lottery draw. This is done in
order to balance the primary strong inflation. After 9 months, in accordance
with the specified parameters, inflation and the level of burning coins reach
parity.

Why us?
The differences from the competitors.
We have a clear understanding that we are entering a new, promising and
competitive market. According to the roadmap, our immediate goal is to
create an MVP, to build a base of players and the community, and then to find
a strategic investor who will help us to scale quickly. This is the essential
requirement.
We have identified three major advantages over other blockchain lotteries:

1.Fast and secure blockchain, which has proven itself for several months. It
will introduce smartcontract and masternode will provide fast transaction
speed.

2. 85% of the sold tickets are players ' winnings! This is a key success factor,
other projects have a rate of no more than 70%. The more and more people
win, the more new participants will be.

3. Participants will collect Masternodes or POS stacks for daily generation of
new tickets. It is profitable and convenient. Why buy a ticket every time, if
you can buy them once in the right amount and get them free. This is a
unique feature of the Gexan lottery.

Road map
According to our mission, we plan to create and distribute around the world
a new type of fair, transparent lotteries, where each participant will be able
to check the rewards fairness and payments speed. We understand that to
develop a product to such a level, we need serious investments in
advertising and promotion of the product, so our first task is to create a
working product that corresponds to the key parameters:

1. The lottery pays itself and does not require finances to maintain the work.

2. Stimulating marketing system is built in such a way that provides an influx
of new players due to the activity of existing participants.

3. The presence of the initial base of loyal players.

4. The key KPIs indicators (jackpot size, daily turnover, number of
participants, etc.) have been achieved.
When the planned results are achieved, we reach out to strategic investors
(venture funds, business angels, etc.) for the purpose of product scaling.
Next, the new structure of the roadmap will be determined based on the
company's selling share and the amount of investments received.

Marketing strategy.
We understand that marketing is the key to the success of any lottery.
Without it, even the most interesting and original ideas will fail. Therefore, in
our work we will pay special attention to the platform promotion. The main
emphasis will be placed not on expensive paid resources, but on the referral
system and viral marketing. Participants themselves will be rewarded with
lottery tickets for attracting new players to our ecosystem.

Referral system and structure of invites will be built in such a way as to
maximize financial interest to invite friends and acquaintances. As a result,
we will be able to achieve exponential growth of the players community in a
relatively short period of time. The influx of new players will increase the
amount of draws and jackpots. An honest and transparent system of
distribution of awards will reveal the winners.

We plan to publish constantly "stories of success " of the drawings
participants, who were lucky to win big prizes. These publications will also be
one of the foundations of the marketing and promotion of our lotteries. The
dissemination of the information about the lottery will be carried out
through social networks and messengers, specialized groups and channels,
for example bitcointalk.com (iGaming section), Askgamblers,
OnlineCasinoReports, IGamingforums, Casinomeister, Casinolistings, etc.

Later, we will prepare a program for partners, providing a reward as a part of
the profits of our affiliates. This program will be a powerful marketing tool
that will influence the development of our platform.
Additionally, players will be divided according to their activity:
1. Low activity - 1 time a week the offer to play on increased probabilities
(+1-2 fields in the ticket).
2. Average activity - lottery limited in time (24 hours) with increased chances.
3. High activity-every 6 tickets is free.
Referral system:
- free GEX for invited new member
- free GEX to new invitee
- 5% of the Jackpot size is received by the invited participant
Additional bonuses will also be introduced during the draws. Later there will
be a rating and status of participants to form a full-fledged gaming
community.

Initial exchange offering (IEO).
Coin name - Gexan
Ticker - GEX.
Premine-1’480’000 GEX.
Total for sale is 1’000’000 GEX.
Price for 1 GEX - 0.0001175 BTC.
Max supply – 21 '000 '000 GEX-will be generated within 20 years.
Inflation per year (starting from the second year) is 918000 GEX.
Burning per year (starting from the second year) is 438000 GEX.
Generate new GEX-immediately after installing the masternode/wallet.
IEO will take place in one step (no private sales), until the soft cap will not be
collected. When soft cap is reached, the IEO stage cannot last longer than a
month.
Not sold GEX will be used for marketing purposes/jackpot, or in the reserve
of the project.

23

gexan.io

Soft cap and Hard Cap.
Summing up all the above-mentioned items we get a total budget of 13.45
BTC.
This is the minimum amount that we need to collect for the implementation
of all plans. With a lack of funding to start the project will not make sense.
Thus, according to the results of the IEO stage, we make decisions:
1. In case of not reaching the minimum investment level (Soft cap) of 13.45
BTC - we return the funds to investors.
2. The maximum amount of the required investment (Hard cap) is 117.5 BTC.
Funds received from investors in total, more than soft cap will be spent on
marketing, attracting new users and on the development of functionality,
types of lotteries.
The following types of packages will be sold at the IEO stage:
1. Masternode – 5000Gex (Collateral)

2. POS packages for stacking

Accepted cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, USD.
The number of the dispensed coins:
First IEO - 400’000 GEX
Second IEO - 600’000 GEX (if held, otherwise these coin will locked or burn)

Project risks:
1. Legislative risks of the blockchain industry.
The wide audience has known Blockchain technology recently, so only now
in different countries the laws which has to regulate this area are written and
published. We cannot assume what restrictions may be imposed on this
industry in different countries.

2. Risks of the hacker attacks.
Scammers are constantly searching for vulnerabilities of smart contracts,
websites, user wallets. We can't exclude hackers attempt to attack our
ecosystem.

3. Legislative risks of the lottery market.
Despite the fact that the legislation of most countries concerning lotteries is
written and applied, we do not exclude the fact that there may be any
changes in certain countries and jurisdictions that will impose certain
restrictions on our users.

4. Financial risks of the project.
The market of gambling in general and lotteries in particular is highly
competitive. We do not guarantee the achievement of the planned results.
The GEX coin is intended only for payment of lottery tickets on our platform
(Utility). Its price can vary greatly depending on external conditions. The
investor may suffer significant losses. Invest only the part of the funds you
are ready to risk.

Conclusion
In present Whitepaper we reviewed the strong and weak points of the Gexan
lottery, showed the distinctive features that, in our opinion, will lead to
success and help to take a leading position among such projects.

We recall that those investors who are willing to finance the project Gexan at
the IEO stage, receive obvious advantages:
1. By purchasing a masternode or share for POS stacking you will get a huge
ROI in the form of new GEX. (table above)
2. Regardless of the prices on the exchanges, investors will be able to use
GEX for its intended purpose, that is, to participate in daily lotteries and have
a chance to win big prizes.

Additionally, we have a fast and secure blockchain, which has proven itself
for several months. We are also sure that the maximum payout rate of 85% is
a key success factor.

The Gexan lottery blockchain does not need to assume the cost of
maintaining a network of distributors to sell lottery tickets. As a result, all
operating expenses of the team are reduced to the development of new
lotteries, legal issues and functional development. This will contribute to the
rapid project development and take a leading position in the new market of
blockchain lotteries.
