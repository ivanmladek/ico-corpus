Why CasinoCoin?

Built
For Gambling

For Users

For Operators

CasinoCoin has been developed
with the regulated gaming
industry in mind, with KYC (Know
Your Customer) and AML (AntiMoney Laundering) features built
in at the base level.

CasinoCoin offers users
unmatched transaction cost,
speed and security, with
near-instant deposits and
withdrawals costing a small
fraction of other methods.

CasinoCoin gives regulated
gaming operators access to
a largely untapped source of
players who have been KYC
verified from the moment they
arrive. Incremental revenue
with full visibility and security
before a single bet is placed.
Transaction and processing
fees are a tiny fraction of
other payment methods.

For Regulators

The CasinoCoin blockchain is
originally based on Ripple’s
XRP technology; the functional
blockchain of choice for the
financial services industry.
Proprietary AML tools offer
regulators unprecedented
access to transactional history,
including verified identities and
complete coin flow.

XRP Ledger Technology

12

The XRP Ledger is a decentralized cryptographic ledger powered by
a network of peer-to-peer servers. The network is the home to the
digital asset XRP, and contains features that allow it to serve as a
mechanism to settle payments in real-time, worldwide.
The XRP Ledger is built for enterprise use, and its digital asset XRP
offers banks and payment providers a reliable, on-demand option to
source liquidity for cross-border payments. *
Multiple financial institutions take advantage of the XRP Ledger
technology, including Banco Santander, American Express and
Standard Chartered.
The CasinoCoin blockchain takes advantage of XRP’s superior speed,
scale and efficiency, allowing it access to many of the bank-friendly
features it has to offer, while still being able to further develop the
technology for use cases in the regulated gaming space.

Although CasinoCoin uses the XRP code, it operates on its own separate blockchain. This means CSC will
never be susceptible to network outages that are common on Ethereum due to the amount of applications
built on top of the protocol, and that all share the same infrastructure.

Custom Tokens

CasinoCoin Custom Tokens are digital assets built atop the CasinoCoin blockchain.
Token transactions require CSC as a network validation fee, which is currently
set at 0.25 CSC per transaction. The technology is maintained by the CasinoCoin
Foundation, with metrics and deployment set and handled by the client.

Custom Tokens
Benefits of creating a Custom Token

15

Rewards programmes

Creating a custom token on the CasinoCoin blockchain allows gaming
operators and suppliers the ability to maintain control of their token
economy while still enjoying all the benefits of CasinoCoin, including
lightning fast, scalable transactions and low fees.

A custom token can replace existing loyalty programmes, introduce a gamification layer and
make it easier for operators to track the distribution of rewards.
Reward tokens can be both closed or open loop depending on the desired environment.

Data verification

The creator of the custom token can choose a token name and brand,
determine the total supply, value and distribution method, all while still
taking advantage of CasinoCoin’s best-in-class desktop and mobile
wallets.

The CasinoCoin blockchain can act as a powerful tool for the transmission of large volumes
of data in an immutable and secure manner.

Potential Use Cases

It is an ideal way to help monetise data which has not previously been collected, with
the usage of a token equating to the cost of a service, creating a similar effect as a SaaS
product.

While CSC has been designed and developed specifically as a digital
currency for the regulated gaming industry, the sky’s the limit for how
a custom token can be utilised.

Recording data on the blockchain can also validate the data that is being stored on
a database within an audit.

Additional payment method
Operators are facing payments challenges in markets across the world. A bespoke token
can help on-board players who may not otherwise be in a position to deposit.
CasinoCoin’s strong KYC and AML protocols ensure peace of mind for operators, players
and regulators.

Regulated operators are required to work under greater regulatory scrutiny
– KYC and AML are critical functions of that. CasinoCoin offers access
to an untapped market of regulated players with a solution that can
manage those components, at a more economical price than today’s fiat
competitors. Disruption at its best.

A central KYC point provides users with a superior gaming experience and
access to multiple regulated gaming sites via a single KYC procedure.
Less admin, more gaming.

CSC Tracker: Removing pseudo-anonymity to
tackle the blockchain AML problem
The transparent nature of blockchain means there’s a publicly accessible
record of every single transaction that’s ever taken place on the network in
a pseudo-anonymous way. As all CasinoCoin customers using the Bankroll
Manager application have had their identity verified by an industry-leading
KYC provider, we’ve taken transaction records a step further by developing
an AML tool, the CSC Tracker, that removes pseudo-anonymity and matches
every transaction with a verified customer profile. The tool will not be
publicly accessible, but only available to operating partners, regulators and
law enforcement on an as-needed basis. Restricted access will follow all
applicable privacy laws, including GDPR.

Managing a volatile cryptocurrency is really no different than handling
smaller national currencies such as the Turkish Lira, Swedish Krona or even
post-Brexit GBP. Operators who have dealt with such currencies will find
CSC fairly standard.
If an online gaming platform accepts deposits, bets and withdrawals with
CSC, that aspect of volatility bears no risk for the operator, and crypto
enthusiasts are already aware of, and understand their exposure.
Operators that offer bets in CSC will be required to maintain a supply of
CSC to payout winning bets and jackpots. The CasinoCoin Foundation can
advise on strategies to mitigate the exposure, which includes frequent
draw downs of CSC into fiat via an approved third party.

with the recognition that prudent approach in this area is sensible and
needed.”

The UKGC do not have a specific framework for managing crypto like the
MGA and IOM GSC have, however they do advise the following:
“If you want to accept digital currency as a means of payment
(either directly or through a payment processor which accepts digital
currencies) you must satisfy yourself and us that you can meet your
obligations in relation to anti-money laundering and that you are acting
in a socially responsible way.”

“It is now possible to open an account with an Isle of Man gambling

This includes convertible and non-convertible virtual currencies (CVCs

Convertible virtual currencies include items such as bitcoins which can
