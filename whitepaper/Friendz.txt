WHO
WE ARE
How many times have you purchased
online just following the hint of a
picture you saw on the internet?
Many, for sure.
And has it ever occured to you that every time you
publish branded content on social media, you are
supporting the values of a particular brand?
It’s something powerful, that’s why we created Friendz.

Friendz for brands: advertising
campaigns
Friendz is an already operating product that is providing
services through the support of a community of over
200,000 users, continuously engaged in the activities
running in the app. The community is always ready and
willing to participate in the campaigns organised by
Friendz, in exchange for rewards. The reward is issued
in order to motivate and appreciate the users for their
participation in content creation and validation.

Friendz is a digital marketing company whose main goal
is to connect brands to their target audience, taking
advantage of the most powerful marketing tool ever,
“word of mouth”. Friendz is proud to have introduced
a new way of doing digital advertising, based on
communication among peers.

Next steps for the future
Friendz is integrating its platform with blockchain, with the aim of decentralizing the digital advertising system.
With the future developments of the platform, it will be possible to enhance trust towards users and client
companies and to increase the products and services offered. In addition, our community will become larger
and multinational.

VISION
Friendz aims to become the perfect tool to activate
communities all over the world
Companies will have the possibility to engage directly
with a highly interactive community of users that create
contents and perform other marketing activities on
demand, following the guidelines provided. In addition,
thanks to the blockchain mechanism, all the contents
created, will be checked by the community itself through
a decentralized validation system that guarantees top
quality results and secure transactions.

Friendz wants to develop a global
ecosystem where companies can
freely and directly interact with an
active community that creates and
validates contents published on their
social media profiles. Our service can
be used by every kind of business in
need of creative contents for social
media.

“Our service can be used
by every kind of business”

We believe that the adoption of the
blockchain technology can greatly
improve our business model, making
it possible for our app to achieve
unprecedented
results
with
a
centralized system.
For the very first time, Friendz will
enable companies to call users to
action directly, asking them to create
contents or perform other promotional
activities depending on their needs
at any particular point in time. After
the results our model has achieved
off-chain for the last two years, we
now look forward to decentralising the
Friendz platform in order to offer our
services to B2B and B2C clients and
to new clients coming from the crypto
world.

FUTURE PLANS:

FRIENDZ &
THE BLOCKCHAIN

We plan to use blockchain technology to provide an
even safer and reliable experience to our clients and
It is through the use of a decentralized blockchain technology that the safe transfer
of funds and the completion of services will be certified. Friendz platform will
become even safer and more advanced technologically thereby protecting the
interest of our community and clients worldwide.

We plan to decentralize the digital advertising business,
creating a traceable single tool that can be adopted globally to
activate users and involve them in the creation of advertising
campaigns
We are planning to introduce a transparent system that will track the flow of
marketing spending on Friendz platform, in a totally revolutional way to digital
advertising. The use of Friendz Coins will in fact provide brands with the
opportunity to spread their advertising messages and to reach the friends of
Friendz users in a genuine and creative way. Users will be rewarded for being
active and will use the reward to purchase other services from Friendz.

In the long term we want to provide every online
activity-as-a-service, in and beyond the world of digital
marketing. The idea is to develop a platform where
companies can activate large communities of users to
perform various activities that will enhance their brands
Our plan is to maintain a focus on digital advertising but with an open eye on new
markets and opportunities. Friendz platform will be available to any company
that requires services such as validation systems, quick content generation,
bug testing, market research and app review. Our clients will not only be B2C
companies, but also B2B, and those coming from the blockchain industry, all
with the common goal of reaching the final users. The automation of all activities
will ensure that Friendz’s role becomes that of merely guaranteeing community
participation and engagement in the activities proposed.

DIGITAL
ADVERTISING
According to eMarketer predictions, global ad
spending is projected to rise faster than previously
expected, growing by 8.8% in 2018 to $642.9
billion. The growth is largely due to increased digital
advertising activities.
Total media ad spending is expected
to rise to $724.1 billion in 2020,
represented by digital ad spending
for 46%. Strong demand for digital
advertising, particularly mobile, will
be the main driver for spending
increase. The top five advertising
markets worldwide; the US, China,
Japan, UK and Germany - will
continue to dominate in 2018 and
the succeeding forecast years.
Display advertising, or banners,
is without doubt the mostly used
marketing channel. These are
images
containing
advertising
content positioned in several spots
in the web pages. Given their
traceability characteristic, these ads
enable the companies to analyse the
performance of their campaigns and
to track their marketing spending.

INFLUENCER
MARKETING
More than one in three marketers said they expected their
influencer marketing budgets to increase, and 84% expected to
run at least one influencer campaign in 2016. (source: Nielsen)
Following the downturn of traditional
advertising
tools,
companies
oriented their marketing activities
to Influencer marketing, a form of
marketing based on the influence
that famous people have on their
network, sometimes made up of
millions of followers. The objective of
the companies is to reach targeted
people that are interested in what
the influencer they follow shows,
rather than targeting the market as
a whole.

“Influencer marketing is
based on the assumption
that people like more
products used and proposed
by people they know and
trust”
Although
influencer
marketing
seems to have become popular
overnight, many brand-influencer
advertising sponsorships started as
early as 10 years ago. What started
with popular bloggers and blog
advertising has now spread into
other influencer channels including
Snapchat, Instagram, and YouTube.

Here are the main trends affecting growth in the
global influencer marketing sector:

Rapid decline in TV viewership demographics: according
to Adweek, 500% more than other demographics
combined. Conversely, 2015 marked the first time that
time spent on mobile apps exceeded time spent on TV,
by nearly 198 minutes. (source: Bloomberg)

The increase in digital ad spending was forecasted
to overtake TV ad spending in 2016. (source: WSJ)
Although some sources pointed to a later overtake, the
US TV advertising market currently represents roughly
$70 billion. (source: PWC)

Ad-blocking in 2015 was projected to have cost
advertisers $22 billion dollars. In 2016, that amount was
forecasted to be $42 billion. (source: PageFair)

THIS IS
FRIENDZ MARKETING
As of today, users spend most of their time online on social
networks, nearly 5.4 hours watching contents created and shared
by people they know. (source: Ipsos)
Friendz takes advantage of the long tail of the digital
marketing sector, as well as the knowledge and
understanding of the potential and the rapid growth
of the segment. We analysed Nielsen’s studies about
the effectiveness of the online word of mouth (WOM).

According to the annual report “Global Trust in
Advertising”, 84% of respondents base their purchase
decisions on the advice given by people they know and
trust, versus a mere 42% who do so based on online
banner ads.

Friendz understands the power of
WOM and applies it effectively on
social media, we propose it as valid
alternative to other existing digital
marketing tools which are slowly
becoming ineffective.

Friendz has revolutionised the way publishers relate with their audience. Our marketing communication system is not the typical top down (where brands target the market
as a whole), but rather one based on communication among peers. The reference target of the contents posted by a Friendz is therefore a community of peers composed
of people that either know or are acquainted to each other directly.

We are not influencers,
we are just Friendz.
The market analysis shows that the
broader the number of followers,
the lower the engagement rate
between the influencer and his or
her audience. Companies look for
well-known influencers in order to
reach as many people as possible,
consequently creating a distant
relationship between them and their
audience.
Friendz users are not celebrities
or famous influencers. They do
not use their social media profiles
for advertising, but for fun. Their
network on social media goes from
500 to 2,000 followers and usually
the contents they post reach an
heterogeneous audience composed
mainly of friends, relatives and close
connections. Every person who
shares contents on social media
transmits a message ready to be
processed by his or her peers, who
share the same interest and habits
as them. Sharing ideas and contents
in this way generates a high level of
involvement both online and offline.
It is thanks to this mechanism of
involvement that our community
is always active and ready to
participate in our campaigns.

HOW FRIENDZ
WORKS
Friendz is a community based application created with
the idea of connecting people with the brands they love.
The main actors involved are:

Clients
They buy campaigns for advertising
purposes and experience the result
of Friendz magic (word of mouth on
social media)

Users
They participate in the campaigns,
creating contents in exchange for
rewards.

Approvers
A community of qualified users that
check and validate contents manually
and are rewarded for it.

Social Media
The platforms on which contents
are published. We track the figures
in terms of the number of likes,
interactions and comments.

16

3. H O W F R I E N D Z W O R K S / / 3 .1 H O W F R I E N D Z W O R K S

Community side
Friendz is a community of actively engaged
and profiled users.
People can choose to participate in the campaigns available
on the mobile and web app, by creating and posting
contents based on specific guidelines. In exchange, they
receive a reward that can be used to unlock in-app special
features.

What makes Friendz special
Friendz not only proposes Brand campaigns with
advertising messages, but it engages users on a
daily basis through the so called Fun campaigns.
Fun campaigns are designed to keep a high level of
engagement within our community while also providing
our users with the opportunity of being rewarded as
they have “fun” taking pictures. The contents of these
campaigns are, in fact, created by our team with the
aim of involving and entertaining our community. The
greatest advantage of taking part in the fun campaigns
is that it makes the social media profiles of users
look more genuine and populated with creative and
diversified contents. The participation in the Fun and
Brand campaigns is regulated by a first-come first-served
mechanism, since the number of users involved in the
activity is limited. Following a meritocratic logic, users
with excellent abilities of creating contents will receive
the campaigns first, while other users with average
photographic skills receive them later.

The profile quality is determined by both the rating of
the approvers in the approval process and the users’
who have access to a dedicated wall inside the app
where everyone can see and rate the pictures. The
rating system is based on a “1 to 5 stars” scale;

The worst quality content receives 1 star while the best
quality receives 5. This score defines user’s overall
performance.

The order of assignation is determined by an algorithm
						
that takes into consideration three parameters:

USER PROFILE QUALITY

Clients can set up a campaign using Friendz platform through
the selection of specific parameters. In particular, they can express their preference on:

Through Friendz dashboard, clients
can monitor the campaign progress
in real time and analyse the results
through specific KPIs. Our success is
driven by the possibility of adapting
the services provided by Friendz to
achieve different goals. We know
that every client is unique and has
different needs and expectations.
For this reason, we have designed
specific solutions to meet those
needs and expectations. Our
platform has been used for:

- Brand awareness campaigns
- Product placement
- Activity boost (sharing contents)
- Market research
- Lead generation
- Offline activities with our
community

Approval System
We have developed a systematic approach for
checking every single content before it is published
online.
Everyday, highly qualified users, that we call approvers,
screen contents manually to check whether the users
have complied with the rules set for the particular
campaign they are participating in. If one or more of
the rules have not been respected, then the content
is rejected and the user invited to upload a new one
on the app in order to take part in the campaign. If a
sufficient number of approvers accepts it, the content
is automatically published on the user’s personal social
profile through Facebook or Instagram API.
The approval mechanism is essential for maintaining a
high quality of service.
While evaluating contents, the approvers pay particular
attention to the content quality, the copy of the caption,
the compliance with the requirements, and also
the accuracy of the hashtags that accompany each
content. Approvers receive a reward in exchange for
their participation, based on the number of contents
approved.

The approval process is automatically distributed .
The approvers can start their validation work on a
dashboard which displays all the ongoing campaigns
and the contents uploaded. To ensure a rapid approval
process, the system works on a first-come first-served
basis. Therefore the first approvers who correctly check
and approve a particular content are rewarded.
Approvers are ranked on the basis of the accuracy
of their approvals, to guarantee their alignment
with Friendz guidelines. The higher the accuracy in
classifying contents, the higher the ranking. A content
is classified correctly when an approver’s choice is
consistent with the choice of all the other approvers
that checked that same content. After a high number of
mistakes, the approver falls below a minimum threshold
and is automatically disqualified and removed from the
approval system.

Any user can become an approver and be rewarded
for content validation, but only after having taken part
in a sufficient number of campaigns, achieving a high
profile quality and having passed an initial approval test.

VALUE
PROPOSITION
Friendz is an innovative marketing platform that offers a new way
of doing digital marketing, taking advantage of the potential that
private profiles and the content distributed on social media have.
The idea was derived from the synthesis of some upward
trends populating internet and social networks:
Firstly, companies are faced with the problem of
gaining the interest of the audience on social media and
involving final users in brand communication campaigns.
Users don’t identify with communication campaigns run
by companies, since their perception of the contents
is unnatural. Consequently, brands get poor results
in terms of quality and engagement in their marketing
strategies.

We highly encourage the creative attitude of the targeted
users and do all we can to boost their persuasive power
on social community. We ask our Friendz to produce
and share funny and creative contents with powerful
storytelling capable of describing the brand’s product.
In addition, thanks to the gamification system, we can
guarantee that the contents provided are top-quality.
Friendz guides individual creativity in the conception of
user generated contents (UGCs) containing advertising
messages which creates high engagement rate in brand
communication projects.

Secondly, people create and publish millions of
contents on their social media profiles everyday, such as
photos, audio, texts, videos, that often contain unwitting
advertising messages. Through these activities people
seek personal gratification from comments and
interactions with their posts, but most of them don’t
know how to boost their profiles and thus end up posting
unappealing contents.
This can be resolved by leveraging on the trust people
have with each other, especially those they know and
whose advice they can listen to.

Friendz contents
spontaneously and creatively
catch the audience attention.
Moreover, presenting the product or service in an
environment where people trust each other and share
the same set of values, empowers the communication
messages of the companies, making it more effective
than the usual impersonal advertising campaigns.

BLOCKCHAIN
ADVANTAGES
Using the lean approach, we started
testing our product in order to
validate the business proposition
and the market interest. Now that the
business model has been validated,
we believe that blockchain is the
right platform on which we can
further develop and strengthen our
model to its full potential.
All the operations that are currently
done manually will be done
automatically with the support of
blockchain technology. Thanks to
the numerous milestones, Friendz
will soon be able to apply this system,
hence becoming the market leader
in the provision of peer-to-peer
marketing services.

Main advantages of basing the
model on a blockchain:
Increasing transparency and
trust towards our clients
The advertising spending will
be registered on the blockchain
in complete transparency. The
decentralization of the platform will
make the check of contents even
more more safe for brands.

Community involvement
Clients can automatically activate
thousands of people that will create contents and perform actions
following the rules provided in the
campaign (for example publishing a
picture, a video or creating a special
advertising content)

Decentralised
validation system
We can provide a service of content validation where the platform
automatically shows contents to
experience users as soon as they
are uploaded. These are real people that check contents manually
following specific rules.

ADVANTAGES
OF FRIENDZ COINS
Friendz Coins are tokens that give access to Friendz application
and services.

Brands

Users

Having a dedicated coin makes the
brand identifiable. Everyone will
know that Friendz Coins is the tool
used to activate communities in the
digital marketing world.

The use of Friendz Coins will enrich
user experience in the app: the
community will be able to unlock
new features and services in the app
using the coins. The new features
will be designed to increase the
degree of online user interaction.

In the future, brands will be able to
perform marketing campaigns all
over the world with a single tool.
They will no longer need to interact
with many marketing agencies to
activate communities, but could rely
on Friendz to get these services.

Some of these items will be games,
others will increase the interaction
among the users, some of them will
boost the user profile and some
others will influence their social
activity.

Friendz will be able to increase its
offer to several businesses, also
the newcomers from the blockchain
industry.

WHY AN
ICO?
Friendz purpose is to decentralize the advertising process and
the system of content creation and validation on social media.
The ICO process has several advantages for our business:

Expand our business
worldwide

The funds raised during the ICO process will be used to expand our
business worldwide and to consolidate our presence in the countries
where we already operate. We will open new offices starting from
European countries and then expanding to other areas with great
potential for digital advertising around the world.

Broad international
community

We will start to run an international user acquisition strategy with the
purpose of creating multiple local communities that will be part of the
big Friendz family. The expansion of Friendz abroad will make more
and more people using the platform.

Winning new clients

Going abroad means winning new clients and providing local
services to our existing clients. Clients will have the possibility to
target their campaigns internationally using a single tool without the
need of asking for marketing services to different agencies anymore.

Technological system

Thanks to the ICO, we will be able to develop a technological system
that will enhance the capacity of our business.

Increase our offer

In the long term, we want to expand the business to other sectors
beyond digital advertising, extending our offer of products and
services in order to meet the needs of B2B companies and of
those coming from the crypto world. We will involve users not only
in advertising campaigns, but also in different kinds of activities

INTRODUCING FRIENDZ
CREDITS
Credits are a scoring system that tracks users’ degree of
participation in the campaigns.

When brands want to access Friendz marketing services,
Friendz provides them with an amount of Friendz
credits. Credits are a useful tool for the clients to define
a campaign size and level of participation.
The number of Credits provided is related to the
campaign size, that depends on the the budget allocated
by the client. Credits will be used to reward users and
approvers.
Users accumulate credits while having fun taking
pictures, creating contents and participating to the
activities and campaigns proposed in the app. Approvers
accumulated credits while checking the contents
uploaded in the app.

Credits also facilitate the
contact with the community
They are part of Friendz gamification system and let
users keep track of how much their are active in the app.
Users and approvers can use their credits to get gift
cards, vouchers and coupons of various online stores.
We provide those coupons in the special section of our
app, for example Amazon, Ebay, Zara, Gamestop and
many more.
After reaching a determined threshold, users can
transform their credits into Friendz tokens and use them
inside Friendz platform or transfer them into personal
wallets.

CAMPAIGN
CREATION
The number of Credits will be determined by the campaign size and will be
used to reward users and approvers.

Brands buy Friendz advertising
campaigns using either fiat money
or Friendz Coins. Friendz stores
the Friendz Coins received in a
designated internal wallet giving
brands an equivalent amount of
Credits in exchange.
The Friendz Coins will be given to the
community to access features inside
the app transforming their Credits.
Friendz will consider to repurchase
some tokens from existing holders in
case the ones stored in the reserve
will not be sufficient to cover the
community needs.

The community is involved in
three steps of the campaign
creation process:

1

Campaign setup: a group of
skilled approvers validate the
campaign’s creativity making
sure that it is consistent with the
community’s policy.

2

Content creation: users create
advertising contents following the
rules provided by the campaign.

3

Content validation: a group
of skilled approvers validates
the quality of contents created
making sure that they respect the
guidelines before the publication
on social profiles.
Users and approvers receive
credits for this activity and can
see the total amount of credits

that they get in their profile on the
app. The community can use their
credits to get discount coupons for
products and services online.
In order to access special features
that increase their engagement and
boost their profiles in the app, users
first have to transform a sufficient
number of Credits into Friendz
Coins. It is possible to do this in a
special section inside the app. Users
and approvers can always find their
Friendz Coins inside their Coin
Wallet.
Friendz coins can be taken out
from the platform and deposited in
personal external wallets.

The brands
Clients can buy Friendz marketing services from the platform
and they can set up their campaign using a special Client
Dashboard.
Clients have the possibility to assign a concept and a
brief and then to select specific parameters such as: the
budget; the size (number of users involved); the target
users (the people they want to interact with); the social
network (Facebook, Instagram or Twitter); the creativity
(product or concept placement). Through Friendz
dashboard, clients can monitor in real time the campaign
progress and analyse the results with specific KPIs.

HAS HTAG

Once the service has been purchased, the platform
computes the Credits necessary to complete the
campaign.
The system creates three stacks of Credits that measure
the number of participants and the reward:
1

STACK 1: Credits that reward creativity approvers
for their validation activity

2

STACK 2: Credits that reward users’ activity of
content creation

3

STACK 3: Credits that reward content approvers’
activity of content screening

#

Once the processes of creativity and contents creation
and validation are finished, the contents that have
successfully passed the validation stage are published
on the user’s private social profile. From this point on,
the contents are visible to the audience of all user’s
peers and online connections.
This great exposure will make the campaign reach their
goal and the advertising message spread online.

The users
Users download the app, login with their Facebook
profiles and find a list of the active campaigns.
Users can take part in the campaigns both from Android
and iOs devices and also from the desktop version. They
can choose the campaign they want to join, and have
to read the rules provided before posting any content.
The users are then given time to create the content and
upload it in the app. If the content successfully passes the
validation process, it is automatically posted on user’s social
media profile, Facebook or Instagram, depending on the
campaign chosen, through the respective API. If, instead, it
is rejected, the user is invited to create and upload a new
content.

After the publication, users receive a commensurate
amount of Credits as established in the campaign rules.
Credits are collected in the user’s Credits wallet inside
Friendz platform. After collecting a sufficient amount of
Credits, users can decide to use them to get coupons
and vouchers for online stores or to convert them into
Friendz Coins in a specific section within the app. It will
be possible for the users to see two different wallets in
the app, one containing Credits and the other containing
Friendz Coins.

There is a minimum threshold set for how many Credits
a user has to collect in order to be able to transform

Friendz Coins can be spent to buy special and premium
features inside the app. Alternatively, users can withdraw
Friendz Coins from the app and store them in a personal
external wallet. A more detailed description of the
Friendz Coins utility is presented in a specific paragraph
dedicated just for that.

The approvers
Friendz will provide top quality services thanks to the
collaboration of two groups of approvers that will be
rewarded for their activity of creativity and contents
validation.

Creativity approvers

Contents approvers

There are highly skilled users with professional
backgrounds that will validate the campaign setup
by the client. Their duty will be to check that the
client has provided all the information needed to
design the campaign.

There are highly skilled users that have previously
taken part in several other campaigns, and have
obtained high quality scores. Their task will be
to check every single content uploaded in the
app, making sure that it complies with Friendz
rules, the campaign guidelines and brand
safety requirements. The screening process will
specifically examine the quality of the content, the
caption that accompanies it and the presence of
campaign hashtags.

In addition, creativity approvers will check that the
new campaigns are in line with Friendz terms and
conditions and that they respect the company’s
policies in terms of numbers, difficulty, appeal,
legality and decorum. The approvers will not
be responsible for the results delivered by the
campaign after it has been approved.

The content approval process is distributed and
automatic. Content approvers have access to a special
dashboard where they have an overview of all the
campaigns and contents uploaded. The system works on
a first-come- first-served basis, indeed the first approvers
who correctly check a content will be rewarded.
Creativity and Contents approvers will be ranked on the
base of the accuracy of their work. We added a ranking
system to guarantee approvers’ alignment with Friendz
guidelines and to hasten the speed of their operations. The
higher the accuracy in classifying contents, the higher the

ranking. A content is correctly classified when it receives
the approval of a sufficient number of approvers. If an
approver repeatedly makes mistakes in judging contents,
he will be automatically disqualified and removed from the
approval system.
Users and approvers can spend Friendz Coins to access
in-app special and premium features. Alternatively, they
can transfer Friendz Coins from the app, storing them in a
personal external wallet. A more detailed description of the
Friendz Coins utility is presented in a specific paragraph
dedicated just for that.

Friendz side
Friendz offers a variety of digital advertising services,
some of which are brand awareness campaigns,
product placement campaigns, sharing contents, market
researches and lead generation activities. Our core
business is to design advertising campaigns with the aim
of involving as many people as possible in our activities.
If brands purchase Friendz services in fiat money, Friendz
will consider to use part of it to repurchase Friendz Coins
from existing holders and give them to the community
when they need to transform their credits.

Friendz Coins can be used
to access special features
inside the app
The Friendz Coins Wallet collects all the coins that will
be assigned to users and approvers whenever they will
decide to convert their Credits. Users can send tokens
to other wallets. In order to transfer the tokens, users
will be provided with the tool to register its destination
wallet within the app.

Here are some examples of how
Friendz coins can be used:

Services and
campaigns

Clients will receive a special discount on the final price of products
or services if they use Friendz Coins to access Friendz marketing
services and campaigns.

In-app
features

Friendz works as a real social network. Users can have access to special
in-app features that will improve their online experience, increasing
the degree of amusement through the gamification process. Inside this
mechanism users are allowed to increase their visibility and exposure
within the app, create more interaction with other users and boost their
profiles. The smart contract will provide a maximum boost per day for
the users, over and above which requests will be rejected.
Examples of possible features are:
Appear in the “most popular users”
section inside the app for 1 week

Take part in more than one Facebook
campaign a day for 5 days

Increase the profile quality by 1 star for
1 week

Change the profile colour/ Level up

See who voted you in the past

Participate in token campaigns
corresponding to your profile colour

See who rates you for 1 week

Blockchain
based games

Users will be able to use the tokens to participate in gamified contests
organized by Friendz. The game rules will be set in the chain, so that
it will be possible to leverage on the power of full transparency of the
network in order to create a totally fair system.

5. I N T R O D U C I N G F R I E N D Z C O I N S / / 5 .6 F R I E N D Z T O K E N S U T I L I T Y

We plan to fully integrate Friendz with the blockchain, by
putting all our efforts in the development of the token, since
we believe it is an important asset that will help unlock
advanced features in the App.
The first phase of integration is already available in our
demo: it is the implementation of a virtual wallet inside the
app where one can not only transform Credits into Friendz
Coins but also send tokens to external addresses.
In addition, users who desire to send out tokens, will have
the opportunity to register the desired destination wallet
within the app.
For the time being, blockchain is not able to support
numerous and frequent transactions, but if there will be
a blockchain be able to process a greater throughput
of operations per seconds, it could be an interesting
implementation to substitute Credits with tokens, thus fully
basing Friendz platform on the blockchain.
Friendz retains the right to exchange or convert one to one
Friendz tokens for equivalent value on the same blockchain
or different blockchains.

COMMUNITY
GROWTH
Friendz community is made of engaged people that
love to accept new challenges on the app.
As our community grows, we will create targeted
clusters of users. We believe our community will grow
structurally, based on our expansion objectives. As the
community expands, more and more people will enjoy
using the app and feeling involved.

In order to provide users with tokens when they want to
transform their Credits, we can allocate between 15% and
30% of revenues for repurchasing tokens from existing
holders, and then provide them to the community.

Users and approvers can decide to use their tokens to access
special and premium features in the app or to keep their tokens.

In-app purchase
The community can spend
tokens inside the app.
These coins will be given
to the community when users and approvers need to
access premium features in
the app or to finance other
future expansion.

Tokens stored in
the reserve fund
Users will be able to unlock
premium functions by spending
their tokens on specific smart
contracts that will lock tokens for
a fixed amount of time. After the
deadline, tokens will be returned
to their owners. Through a special
explorer, the system will detect the
amount of tokens stored and will
enable special functions according
to the level of the deposit.

Seed stage projects vs existing companies

While analysing a portion of the
projects funded in the past, we
noticed that the majority of them
were new business ideas or rather
startups whose main objective was to
collect enough money through ICO
to develop the prototype or the alpha
version of their service and to hire
members of the future team. These
projects can be referred to as “seed
projects”, characterized by a high
degree of risk and probability to fail.
We believe it is in the interest of users
and client companies to look for real
companies and projects, sustained
by sound business proposals, a super
skilled team and a compelling vision.

IN THE
LONG TERM
Friendz core business will become the creation and
validation of contents processed by a huge and
multinational community.
In the long term, we want to provide every online-activity-as-a-service,
developing a platform where companies looking for mass interactivity
on social media can find large communities to involve in their marketing
activities.		
Users’ activity won’t be limited to participation in digital
advertising campaigns only, but will be extended to
every kind of online activity. This is why in this part of the
paper we will be focusing on Activities.
The model described above is absolutely valid and
adaptable to other market segments in the process of
business expansion.
From the user’s side, Friendz platform won’t be
subjected to particular changes: users will still receive
an invitation to join the Activities and, if they follow the
rules and complete the task required by the companies,
they will be rewarded. Users will be asked to take part
in different activities such as: taking a picture, recording
a video, answering questions, participating in surveys,
sharing links, translating articles.

the activity respects Friendz terms and conditions and
the community policy in terms of size, difficulty, legality
and decorum. The Approvers will be rewarded for their
activity and won’t be held responsible for the results
delivered by the Activity after it has been approved.
Contents Approvers will validate the provided contents
following the same method used for the campaigns,
without any alteration. We will maintain the adoption
of the ranking system in order to always guarantee
top-quality services.

The Activity Approvers will validate the Activity setup,
making sure it is in line with the client’s requirements.
They will check that all the details needed to realize
the Activity have been provided, so that any misunderstandings are avoided. In addition, they will check that

WHAT’S
NEW?
There are few differences in the long term model if compared
to the existing one, mainly in the following areas:

Clients

Services

We will offer our services not only to B2C brands in their attempt to
reach final users, but also to B2B companies which will adopt Friendz
platform for internal operations or for outsourcing services on the behalf of other companies. We will also gain the interest of clients coming
from the cryptosphere.

Friendz will offer content creation and validation services based on a
decentralized system which can easily be adapted to businesses of
different nature.
Examples of possible use of the service are
UX testing
App review
Bug testing
Market research

Activity setup

ICO Marketing
Campaigns
Big Data
Stores

Recruiting
Contest creation
Lead generation

Clients will have the possibility to set up an activity entirely from the
beginning to the end, and provide the guidelines for its realisation. In
addition to the options already listed in the model for digital advertising
campaigns, while creating the new activities they can also:
Name their activity and specify the kind of content required e.g.
Market Research - carry out a survey
Select the target on the basis of their skills
Specify if the content will be visible
Establish the campaign costs and the size of users and approvers’ reward

Not all the contents
are visible online

Not all the contents are visible online - In the activity setup, clients
can specify if they want the content created to be visible or not e.g.
in the case of advertising campaigns it will be, for app review or bug
testing activities it will not.

USE OF
PROCEEDS
The funds collected in the ICO process will be used
for three main purposes:

To expand our business abroad
To create an multinational community
To develop technical improvements
Currently, Friendz is active in Italy and Spain. We intend
to expand our business in other countries around the
world, starting from the most relevant markets in the
European Union and extending to all the European
countries outside the European Union that are investing
actively in the Digital Marketing, by the end of 2020.
In the long term, our efforts will be focused on the
creation of a business suitable for the delivery of the new
services we intend to provide. We will not only offer digital
advertising services, but a number of other products that
will involve a huge multinational community.
In order to do this, we need to achieve key technical
and strategic improvements, including the acquisition
of assets and licences, mergers, acquisitions and other
extraordinary finance operations with other companies
necessary to the international development.

THE
FOUNDERS
Friendz has three co-founders: Alessandro Cadoni,
Daniele Scaglia and Cecilia Nostro.
All young and determined, they are passionate
entrepreneurs with the dream of revolutionising the
world of Digital Marketing. They love the project and
have never missed on an opportunity to demonstrate
their commitment, having left their full time jobs and
dedicated their hearts and souls fully to the company.

is the perfect synergy in the founders’ personalities:
one pragmatic, one thoughtful and another extrovert,
together they combined their unique skills in order to
achieve success.

Giulio Corno
Strategic Support
President @ TRIBOO Group

Our Team is definitely our most
valuable asset: it is extremely
important for us, that every new
member of the team is passionate
about what he is doing, wants
to be disruptive in his initiatives
and is conscious that his work is
unique and fundamental. We hired
the first team members taking into
consideration
their
personality
and motivation rather than specific
technical competences.
More importantly we have never

shied away from welcoming people
without any work experience in
our company. On the contrary, we
believe that the attitude, energy and
determination typical of a newcomer,
could provide that added value we
are always looking for to make our
projects special. Over time we have
also teamed up with technicians and
competent advisors who have made
a great contribution in developing
and continually improving our
services.

FRIENDZ COIN LEGAL
AND CROWDSALE
General Informations
The Friendz Coin does not have the legal
qualification of a security, since it does not
give any rights to dividends or interests. FDZ
Token does not have the legal qualification
as a payment token, since it is not intended
to be used as a means of payment to acquire
goods or services by third parties, or a means
of money or value transfer. The sale of FDZs is
final and non-refundable. FDZs are not shares
and do not give any right to participate to the
general meeting of FRIENDZ. FDZ cannot have
a performance or a particular value outside
the FRIENDZ SA network. FDZ shall therefore

not be used or purchased for speculative or
investment purposes. The purchaser of FDZ
is aware that national securities laws, which
ensure that investors are sold investments
that include all the proper disclosures and are
subject to regulatory scrutiny for the investors’
protection, are not applicable.
Anyone
purchasing
FDZ
expressly
acknowledges and represents that she/he
has carefully reviewed this white paper and
fully understands the risks, costs and benefits
associated with the purchase of FDZ.

Knowledge Required
The purchaser of FDZ undertakes that she/he understands and has significant experience of
cryptocurrencies, blockchain systems and services, and that she/he fully understands the risks
associated with the crowdsale as well as the mechanism related to the use of cryptocurrencies
(incl. storage).
FRIENDZ SA shall not be responsible for any loss of FDZ or situations making it impossible
to access FDZs, which may result from any actions or omissions of the user or any person
undertaking to acquire FDZs, as well as in case of hacker attacks.

Risks
Acquiring FDZ and storing them involves various risks, in particular the risk that FRIENDZ
may not be able to further develop its operations and develop its blockchain and provide the
services promised. Therefore, and prior to acquiring FDZs, any user should carefully consider
the risks, costs and benefits of acquiring FDZ in the context of the crowdsale and, if necessary,
obtain any independent advice in this regard. Any interested person who is not in the position
to accept or to understand the risks associated with the activity or any other risks as indicated
in the Terms & Conditions of the crowdsale should not acquire FDZs.

Important disclaimer
This white paper shall not and cannot be considered as an invitation to enter into an
investment. It does not constitute or relate in any way nor should be considered as an offering
of securities in any jurisdiction. The white paper does not include nor contain any information
or indication that might be considered as a recommendation or that might be use to base any
investment decision. This document does not constitute an offer or an invitation to sell shares,
securities or rights belonging to FRIENDZ or any related or associated company. The FDZ is
just a utility token which can be used only on the FRIENDZ platform and is not intended to be
used as an investment.
The offering of FDZ on a trading platform is done in order to allow the use of the FRIENDZ
platform and not for speculative purposes. The offering of FDZ on a trading platform is not
changing the legal qualification of the token, which remains a simple means for the use of the
FRIENDZ platform and is not a security.
FRIENDZ is not to be considered as advisor in any legal, tax or financial matters. Any
information in the white paper is given for general information purpose only and FRIENDZ does
not provide with any warranty as to the accuracy and completeness of this information. Given
the lack of crypto-token qualifications in most countries, each buyer is strongly advised to carry
out a legal and tax analysis concerning the purchase and ownership of FRIENDZ’s according to
their nationality and place of residence.
FRIENDZ today is not a financial intermediary according to Swiss Law and is not required to
obtain any authorization for Anti-Money Laundering purpose. This qualification may change
in case FRIENDZ will offers services which are to be considered as qualifying a financial
intermediation activity. In this case, the use of FRIENDZ services may require the positive
conclusion of an AML/KYC identification process.
FDZs confer no direct or indirect right to FRIENDZ’s capital or income, nor does it confer any
governance right within FRIENDZ; an FDZ is not proof of ownership or a right of control over
FRIENDZ and does not grant the controlling individual any asset or share in FRIENDZ, or in the
FRIENDZ network. An FDZ does not grant any right to participate in control over FRIENDZ’s
management or decision-making set-up, or over the FRIENDZ network and governance to the
Purchasers.
Regulatory authorities are carefully scrutinizing businesses and operations associated to cryptocurrencies in the world. In that respect, regulatory measures, investigations or actions may
impact FRIENDZ’s business and even limit or prevent it from developing its operations in the
future. Any person undertaking to acquire FDZ must be aware of the FRIENDZ business model,
the white paper or terms and conditions may change or need to be modified because of new
regulatory and compliance requirements from any applicable laws in any jurisdictions. In such
a case, purchasers and anyone undertaking to acquire FDZ acknowledge and understand that
neither FRIENDZ nor any of its affiliates shall be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or
damage caused by such changes.
FRIENDZ will do its utmost to launch its operations and develop the FRIENDZ platform. Anyone
undertaking to acquire FDZ acknowledges and understands that FRIENDZ will launch its first
services by the start of the Crowdsale. Other services available to the FDZ Token purchasers
may be offered at a later stage, according to the Whitepaper. On concluding the Commercial
Operation, these tokens will be issued by a technical process referred to as a «Blockchain».

12. F R I E N D Z C O I N L E G A L A N D C R O W D S A L E

This is an open source IT protocol over which the Company has no rights or liability in terms of
its development and operation. The token distribution mechanism will be controlled by a Smart
Contract; this involves a computer program that can be executed on the Ethereum network or
on a blockchain network that is compatible with Smart Contract programming language. They
acknowledge and understand therefore that FRIENDZ (incl. its bodies and employees) assumes
no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage that would result from or relate to the
incapacity to use FDZ s, except in case of intentional misconduct or gross negligence.
FDZ s is based on the Ethereum protocol. Therefore, any malfunction, unplanned function or
unexpected operation of the Ethereum protocol may cause the FRIENDZ network or FRIENDZs
to malfunction or operate in a way that is not expected. Ether, the native Ethereum Protocol
account unit may itself lose value in a similar way to FDZs, and also in other ways.
