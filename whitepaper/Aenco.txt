PRIMARY JURISDICTIONS AND
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS OF FOCUS

2.1

The regulatory framework around token offering (or initial coin offering “ICO”) is undergoing major transformation
especially in this year 2018. There has been a rapidly increasing variety of blockchain based token types that
are being launched across the world on a daily basis, ranging from utility based tokens to security based
tokens. Regulators around the world, though may have adopted different attitudes towards ICOs, have all
generally moved towards increasing clarity of the necessary regulatory framework governing the requirements
of token issuers with the view to provide greater protection to market participants and better disclosures.
We believe that it is a matter of time that ICO will be adopted as a mainstream alternative financing tool for
growth companies and that global regulatory framework will rise to meet the new challenges generated from
such. Therefore, in order to build a long term and sustainable financial solutions platform, Aenco and its group
is dedicated towards building a global infrastructure that will synergise and support the regulatory framework
requirements around major jurisdictions of interest in order to fully deliver our services and vision.

2.2

As Aenco believes in building a sustainable servicing platform for emerging growth companies and
entrepreneurs, the group is establishing a global regulated platform within major continents and markets.
To address the regulatory aspects, Aenco is expanding into new markets, while building upon long-standing
traditional business infrastructure, to set up regulated presence across several major jurisdictions.

2.3

Aenco is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Aeneas Group Limited (“Aeneas”), which is a multi-disciplinary
financial institution with a number of subsidiaries to deliver its objectives. A group chart is included below.

Aenco believes that through the regulated presence and banking licenses of its ecosystem entities in the above
jurisdictions, we can identify emerging healthcare and growth companies globally, and service them with our
HealthTech Financial Solutions platform more effectively within the necessary regulatory frameworks, and
significantly disrupt traditional finance landscapes.

THE OPPORTUNITIES: A PRESSING NEED
FOR SUSTAINABLE MEDICAL INNOVATION

3.1

While it may be cliché to paraphrase the common proverb: “The world is your oyster”, Aenco is actively
identifying companies and projects in areas of high impact potential in the healthcare sector. More specifically,
we focus on empowering entrepreneurs and emerging growth companies where their principal product and
service outcomes have potential to address important societal issues, create deep impact solutions globally,
and thoughtfully drive human innovation.

3.2

An industry area we have identified to possess the aforementioned attributes is in the area of HealthTech
and medical innovation. With global ageing demographics, the world and society currently faces a plethora
of genuine unmet health care needs. The global demand for improved patient care and stress to the medical

1

10

system is constantly on the rise. Pressure to tackle both rising number of patients facing common and rare
diseases, as well as the lagging growth in research funding in certain medical indications versus the skyrocketing
costs of patient care, has not only created a surplus of opportunities for medical entrepreneurialism, but also
an urgent need for such players to act.

Example 1 – Medical Supply Chain Security and Big Data
3.3

There are already a number of initiatives that pharmaceutical companies are launching to utilize blockchain
technology and its security framework to help drive, for example, supply chain related security processes
(e.g. the MediLedger Project2 , to trace prescription drugs). Several major pharmaceutical companies are also
adopting blockchain technology privately for its clinical development processes where there are huge amount
of clinical drug data that are often required to be securely stored and processed. In addition, several private
companies and medical clinics are exploring blockchain based technologies to securely capture patient data.

Example 2 – Therapeutics
An example of such a global unmet medical need is in the field of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s
Disease (“AD”): where patients experience progressive mental deterioration that can occur in middle or old
age, due to generalized degeneration of the brain. It is the commonest cause of premature senility. According
the Alzheimer’s Study Group in the U.S., approximately 4.5 million Americans were living with AD in 2015, and
this number is projected to increase to more than 14 million by 2050. Furthermore, for each person afflicted
with AD, a greater multiple number of care givers including loved ones and medical professionals are materially
impacted. The cost of care for AD patients is projected to rise from approximately US$170 billion per year in
2015 to over US$750 billion per year by 2050. Varying sources predict even higher costs but the numbers are
staggering regardless! Conversely, the growth in research funding focusing on the same medical indication is
by far lagging. About US$1.4 billion was allocated globally to the research of AD treatment. While this may grow
to over US$6 billion by 2050, the dispersion with the rising cost of care is ballooning, and the absolute dollar of
funds is insufficient 3.

3.5

Aenco has identified a huge market demand for blockchain based solutions in the Healthcare technology
sector. Furthermore, Aenco is able to position itself as the one-stop-shop in bringing these blockchain based
solution companies to the community, with the support of innovative financial solutions and rapid ecosystem
growth to help accelerate these ideas that can truly transform our world.

3.6

Aenco is well equipped through the combination of its ecosystem’s regulatory framework and Aenco’s developing
technology applications, to empower such medical innovation and entrepreneurialism through catalyzing related
medical research, HealthTech development, and product commercialization. AD is an example of a severe unmet
medical need Aenco has identified and already has pipeline projects in the neurodegenerative space. In addition
to neurodegenerative diseases, Aenco also has related pipeline HealthTech partners focusing on projects within
the areas of infectious diseases (influenza and “superbugs”), gastroenterology, genetics, oncology, and robotic
devices for minimally invasive surgery. With the targeted roll out of services and technologies under the Global
HealthTech Blockchain Financial Solutions platform, the Aenco ecosystem has a portfolio of clients to service
from the get go; We can use such networks as a springboard to further connect with and empower even more
HealthTech emerging growth companies!

THE LANDSCAPE AND THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES
TO MEDICAL INNOVATION
In the landscape of HealthTech based start-up companies and medical innovations, the successful pairing of
sound science and robust financing is paramount for potential growth and discovery. However, due to the
capital intensive nature of the business, the ability to capture steady and impactful sources of funding for
emerging biotechnology and medical technology companies are intrinsically difficult. For illustration, if we take
research and development (“R&D”) for a therapeutic drug candidate as an example for medical innovation
and entrepreneurialism, for development through pre-clinical and U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”)
accredited clinical trials, R&D financial costs per program can fall in the following ranges depending on the field
of study and medical indication:
• Preclinical:5

US$700,000 - $20,000,000

• Phase 1 trials:6 US$1,400,000 - $6,600,000
• Phase 2 trials: US$7,000,000 - $19,600,000
• Phase 3 trials: US$11,500,000 - $52,900,000
4.2

In today’s landscape, capital raising channels are traditionally dominated only by the largest players such as global
investment banks and venture capital. Therefore, high entry-barriers and hurdles can prove to be burdensome
for fledgling companies seeking funding in the form of significantly high fees and access. Young companies
requiring institutional grade, one-stop-shop investment banking services such as financing, underwriting,
settlement, custodial, research, and trading services, have little options if they fail to “join the club”.

4.3

When considering earlier stages of financing along the capital raising spectrum for start-up companies,
entrepreneurs, and emerging growth companies face a plethora of other challenges. While in the U.S., venture
capital funding can reach say US$10 billion per year, to tap venture capital (“VC”) funding, entrepreneurs are
often subjected to material dilution impact in equity ownership of their companies. Management may also be
pressured to create relatively short-term investment exit opportunities for VC investors (e.g. premature initial
public offerings or transactions), or they may need to cater to non-trivial VC expectations, such as obligations
to generate sales in the near term, or having to demonstrate multibillion dollar market sizes for their principal
product outcomes.

4.4

Angel investments with little institutional financing support and relatively smaller ticket sizes (US$150KUS$1.5M), fail to be a sufficient and sustainable source of funding for capital intensive initiatives such as medical
research funding. Constant pressure to source from numerous smaller investors can also create insurmountable
administrative burden, and detract from actual research and development activities of entrepreneurs.

THE LANDSCAPE FOR DIGITAL FINANCE
AND ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES
Undoubtedly, there is new age development undergoing in digital finance, blockchain applications, and growth
in circulation of digital assets, which are creating innovative financing channels for businesses via mechanisms
such as initial coin offerings. Based on 2017 available figures, the cumulative size of ICOs and similar blockchain
based financing activities since 2014 amounts to US$2.4 billion, whereby more than US$2.0 billion was raised
in 2017 alone7!

5.2

In comparison, data for 2017 with respect to the size of capital raised via traditional capital markets activity
such as initial public offerings (“IPO”) has come in at around US$189 billion globally8 (1,624 IPOs). Therefore,
ICO based financing represents c. 1.1% of capital markets and public financing activities globally, and is still a
hugely untapped form of funding for a broad range of innovative growth companies requiring capital to develop
and roll out impactful technological solutions.

5.3

The key challenge is that society continues to lack a credible, globally accredited “standard” for ICO best
practice. Emergence of fraudulent issuers or financing scams, coupled with general unfamiliarity to new
trends, has often cultivated skepticism towards this financing channel that possesses utmost potential and
impact. We believe with increasing institutional involvement both in terms of institutions seeking new financing
opportunities, and alternative investors open to deploying across new asset classes (such as ICOs), coupled
with increasing clarity and robustness across global regulatory frameworks, ICOs will develop into a mainstream
channel funding.

5.4

Therefore, Aenco’s platform seeks to be at the forefront of this sensational technological and societal
development, while also capitalizing on its long standing track record of regulated activities and dedication
towards adoption of both digital assets, and blockchain based applications as applied to evolving financial
services. Aenco believes that digital financing such as ICO is fast becoming “mainstream” and in association of
this development, many aspects of traditional banking can be adopted, evolved and applied for the blockchain
community. Aenco will be the FIRST to embrace such digital financial integration for servicing the HealthTech
sector and its significant community.

Aenco’s goal is to establish a global full-service blockchain based financial solutions platform, while operating
within a globally accredited regulatory framework in preemption of increasing regulatory requirements,
through employing a decentralized blockchain based financial ecosystem that amalgamates traditional and
modern methods of capital market services. Such services are to be powered and capitalized upon the inhouse developed core utility token “AEN” as a medium of exchange that is exchangeable with accepted major
crypto (BTC, ETH); Proof of stake holders of AEN shall be eligible to enjoy pre-defined utility benefits across the
Aenco ecosystem.

required, our multi-jurisdictional regulated infrastructure under the gold standard of best practice.

6.4

Our ICO Integrity Program: To be a beacon of quality and credibility by setting a gold standard of ICO bestpractice. Through our regulatory expertise and infrastructure of across key global jurisdictions, coupled with
teams and network to legal, financial, and business professionals, we are equipped to identify high potential
HealthTech projects based on in-depth due diligence with the objective of validating only the top quality emerging

a transparent and pre-emptive contribution subscription process for our AEN token community supporters
and for our sponsored HealthTech partners to efficiently and rapidly collaborate and access our ever enlarging
ecosystem and promote its growth. Under the launcher platform, it will include a due diligence and research
platform that provides insightful analysis and ongoing coverage of the issuer and an escrow account services
to better protect contributors and to ensure integrity standards of the token issuer and consistent and reliable
subscription process.

6.6

ICO Syndicated Sponsorship Service and Providing Secondary Market Liquidity for Client Tokens.
As a central service within our launcher platform, we shall sponsor (and in syndicated basis with our community)
high potential HealthTech token issuers that have undergone legal, financial, and business due diligence across
our expert network and one-stop-shop program. The systematic vetting process seeks to credibly validate the
potential value of each sponsored issuers business by understanding probability of success of their targeted
development milestones, current and projected financial health, technological advancements, and naturally to
assess whether the principal product and service outcomes of the issuer can address important societal issues
via deep impact solutions.
Depending on the deal based strategy, Aenco would, together with its AEN token community, engage in preemptive subscription and sponsorship of issuer tokens prior to the subsequent public market promotion and
sale. Upon successful token sales of sponsored issuers, Aenco will have the ability to provide secondary market
liquidity and price stabilization functions for sponsored tokens across our own AENX digital asset exchange as
well other centralized and decentralized exchanges.

AEN Connect and Decentralized Custodial and Escrow Services for Digital Assets:
As part of enhancing the integrity of the subscription process for sponsored token sales, Aenco IB Solutions
shall also provide custodial and escrow services for digital assets deployed by global token subscribers that
have successfully been screened by Aenco’s know-your-client (“KYC”) assessment protocols and deemed
eligible (“Eligible Subscribers”).
AEN Connect: is our evolving point of engagement for users, encompassing a secure smart wallet, safekeeping infrastructure, and conditional fund release mechanisms; Combined with Value added “Wealth App”
functionalities that enable user friendly viewing, sorting, and transacting capabilities by the smart wallet across
multi-currency / multi-crypto denominations. The conditional fund release mechanisms enable Aenco to act as a
temporary third-party custodian between token buyers and token issuers, and only deposit digital subscription
proceeds denominated in AEN tokens to the original token buyers, to further be employed in the subscription
process, upon the satisfactory completion of pre-set conditions by the issuer identified through the vetting
process of each sponsored token sale. Examples of key questions to address for the said conditional fund
release mechanisms to be activated include, but not limited to:
i. Time: Is the timing of the token issuance in-line with the issuer’s communicated timeline?
ii. Development: Is the issuer meeting underlying technological milestones as communicated by its roadmap?
iii. Subscription Attributes: Is the token sale generating a minimum interest level as measured by a predetermined
sales or volume amount?

Subscription proceeds shall only be successfully deployed into the issuer’s token wallets upon the predetermined
conditions being met satisfactorily as governed by smart contracts. Prior to ICO conditions being met, AEN
token deposits are withheld by Aenco, yet full transparency is maintained with unique smart wallet addresses
provided to the Eligible Subscribers. Should for any reason a sponsored ICO deal fail to materialize or critical
conditions fail to be met along the way, digital subscription proceeds are safely returned to the original Eligible
Subscribers giving maximum protection to token buyers and ensuring integrity to the process.
The following infographic summarizes the key ecosystem, activities and transactions in relation to products and
services provided under the Aenco IB Solutions platform.

AEN Connect: ICO Gateway and Platform
To catalyze the token sales of Aenco sponsored tokens, an ICO Gateway and Platform shall be designed to
deliver a convenient and informative UX/UI (user experience and user interface) for global token subscribers
seeking to participate within the ecosystem of different HealthTech token sellers. Such features shall be added
to AEN Connect throughout the evolution of the engagement application. The Gateway and Platform serves as
both a digital marketing and distribution platform for Aenco sponsored token sales, as well as a one-stop-shop
portal initially interfacing token subscribers and token seller, ultimately following a sequence of technology rollouts, is to evolve into a unifying UX/UI application for access to all of the Aenco ecosystem utility benefits.
The ICO Gateway and Platform will be accessed via the online domain www.aencoin.com following its launch.
A user friendly and aesthetically enticing landing page shall be designed, coupled with informative issuer
analytics of all past, present, and upcoming ecosystem sponsored HealthTech token offerings, shall collectively
be utilized to attract and sustain viewing traffic. Essential information on token offerings will be provided,
including but not limited to, offering details, timeline, and development roadmap of underlying issuers.
The potential subscribers shall be able to “window-shop” or proactively subscribe to selected token offerings.
The subscriber, depending on whether the token buyer is subscribing as a natural individual or a corporate
entity, shall be seamlessly prompted to undergo Aenco’s outsourced know-your-client (“KYC”) assessment,
designed to conveniently capture required photo identification documentation and virtually verified (for all
natural individuals including major shareholders and directors of corporate subscribers). The KYC is customized
and able to target accredited and professional investors in select jurisdictions, while geofencing subscribers
from sanctioned countries and identifying politically exposed persons (“PEP”), in accordance to international
World-check9 screening standards.
The ICO Gateway and Platform shall enable the subscription process to be an invaluable data collection point to
contribute to its non-identity specific big-data analytics platform for future use of platform HealthTech issuers,
AEN proof-of-stake token holders, and ecosystem participants. Such data can help a client token seller better
streamline its positioning strategies as well as understand the demographics and jurisdictions in which token
participants are originated. With this said, Aenco has already taken steps to ensure that handling of ecosystem
data be “GDPR Compliant”, as described by General Data Protection Regulation proposed by the European
Commission; where the compliance deadline for GDPR has been set for May 2018.

6.9

AENX:
Within Aenco IB Solutions, we will also establish AENX throughout the development cycle: A healthcare
technology centric token exchange that will facilitate the listing and trading of AEN Tokens and our sponsored
tokens. This enables Aenco to better provide secondary market liquidity with AEN Token and other major crypto
currencies as the major trading pairs, supported by our liquidity management capabilities and clearing services.
AENX would also equip Aenco the tools to deliver secondary market liquidity services to sponsored tokens of
healthcare technology partners, and enable the clearing of AEN pairs with major crypto and fiat currencies and
sponsored tokens. A thematic or industry focused exchange further strengthens our ability brand and attract
specialized exchange participants to Aenco’s HealthTech ecosystem.

https://risk.thomsonreuters.com/en/products/world-check-know-your-customer.html

25

AENX would be accessible to registered users of Aenco’s platform through our customized UI/UX via AEN
Connect. Transactions taking place on AENX would encompass exchange participants interested in trading in
AEN tokens and HealthTech centric tokens. A user would request a transaction (Buy / Sell order) through the
engagement portal, which would be broadcasted to our network consisting of ecosystem computer nodes.
Network nodes would validate the transactions and user’s status. Once verified the transaction is combined
with other transactions to create a new block of data for the ledger. New blocks will then be added to the
existing block chain, completing the original transaction.
Naturally, proof-of-stake holders in AEN Tokens will enjoy utility benefits when transacting on AENX in the
form of reduced platform fees, and greater flexibility on deposit and withdrawal thresholds. This is described in
greater detail in Section 8.
AENCO PRIME SOLUTIONS:
6.10 Decentralized Prime Brokerage Platform:
Traditional prime brokerage services offered by banks have already begun, and will continue to face new
challenges in adopting new technological and regulatory measures. In particular, on the technological side, a
number of governing bodies and centralized clearing parties around the world are in the process of applying
distributed ledger technology to dramatically alter existing execution and settlement infrastructures. For
example, the Australia stock exchange is currently implementing blockchain based settlement systems and the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) also developing a blockchain based approach to OTC
derivatives.
6.11 The Aenco Prime Solutions platform will provide a peer-to-peer facility to automatically match and connect
lenders and borrowers directly, providing or receiving liquidity against alternative assets as collateral (assets
that are not available for financing in the typical institutional market) such as cryptocurrencies or receivable
assets mined on blockchains or collateral leasing pools; the AEN token and our sponsored tokens will also be
included as eligible collateral classes amongst others;
6.12 The platform will be supporting the clearing of both eligible cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, operated
through the eventual regulated credit institution within the group; built within the platform is the ability to (a)
Calculate margin requirements and the automated calling/draw down of margin for the lender and borrowers,
(b) Decentralized clearing facility and escrow account operated by our platform that facilitates the holding
of margin and collateral on behalf of lenders and borrowers, (c) Relevant reporting protocols for current
and anticipated positional movements and (d) Integration with the Aenco IB Solutions Platform’s exchange to
provide seamless execution of transfer and the trading out of the collateral.
6.13 The platform will extend its support to create a peer-to-peer direct “over-the-counter” products, whose
parameters can be flexibly designed by the users and counterparties over underlying alternative asset classes
such as cryptocurrencies; the OTC product platform will be supported by the margining, clearing, and escrow
account functions as well as ongoing reporting of performance of current and anticipated positions.
6.14 Aenco’s Decentralized Prime Brokerage Platform can be categorized into the following modules:
• Asset classes: digital assets and cryptocurrency based leasing, collateralized financing, structured products,
and derivatives.

26

The platform will be developed to manage ultimately digital asset execution, financing, and settlements. In
particular, the platform is to include cross collateral financing services. For Example, cryptocurrencies margined
borrow and lending governed under the Global Masters Securities Lending Agreement (“GMSLA”) or the
International Securities Lending Association (“ISLA”) framework.
• Client account, contracts and execution interface
Our platform will have an easy to use interface to help manage large portfolio execution and settlements and
ongoing risk monitoring of positions. For example, API will be implemented to facilitate excel based transaction
input and orders. Alternatively, if the participant chooses to, can also utilize our developed UX/UI to remit and
monitor order flow.
• Decentralized crowd financing and single client institutional financing pool
The platform will be able to both source and provide financing through the decentralized pool by aggregation
of positions and risks. Both borrowers and providers will have transparent access to collateral pools and raise /
provide financing using fiat as well as major cryptocurrencies.
• OTC and on exchange settlements
The platform provides access to both OTC and on exchange settlement capabilities for both traditional asset
classes as well as cryptocurrencies.
• Distributed ledger technology driven regulatory reporting protocols
Regulatory reporting is extremely important especially where there is both on exchange as well as OTC
reporting requirements. Our platform will provide automated reporting on these standards and will manage
such for its clients and participants. The expertise of our regulation technology team and legal advisors enables
us to ensure that there is ongoing compliance of all applicable regulatory matters.
• Blockchain based client custody and client assets segregation
The platform will also provide typical prime brokerage services through its blockchain environment such as
custody services for client assets. Client assets will comply with segregation of assets regulations, and will
also automatically interface with our prime execution and settlement modules, so that it’s a one-stop-shop for
all positions.
• Blockchain based daily margining and clearing
Aenco Prime will be the first platform to create a blockchain based margining and clearing system. The system
will handle intraday and daily margin monitoring and margining of both single and aggregated positions.

AENCO SMARTCAP SOLUTIONS:
6.15 Aenco is currently working with an EU/EEA based regulator to obtain a full banking license. This is expected to
be accomplished over the course of 2019, subsequently which the AEN token will be fully integrated into the
core banking system and bridge the Aenco ecosystem with the banking market. Traditional financial services
shall be provided for fiat transactions. However, the virtual smart capital platform will form an important
component of the overall ecosystem offering utility benefits to eligible AEN proof-of-stake token holders.
6.16 The AEN token will be integrated as major payment currency and transaction support and also a “proof of
stake” basis for account holding, for the conducting of financial services, which shall include: (i) Fiat deposit
taking; (ii) Domestic and cross-border fund remittances; (iii) Foreign exchange transactions; (iv) Trade services;
and (v) Investment product distribution and asset management. Additionally, SmartCap Solutions will include
alternative financing solutions primarily focused on (a) Receivables financing; (b) Bridge financing; and (c)
Collateralized lending.
6.17 Ecosystem utility benefits for eligible AEN token holders shall be explained more fully in sections 8 to 10.
However, key utility benefits shall include favourable lending rates relative to prevailing market rates, and
reduced fees and tariffs across financial services relative to standard market rates.

PLATFORMS

To deploy a user friendly one-stop-shop UX/UI for all HealthTech Financial
Solutions within ecosystem.

•

Enhanced security with AEN Connect smart wallet / “vault”.

•

Embed secure and seamless custodial and escrow functionalities
such as conditional locks and pre-programed token release
mechanisms; to service ICO sponsorship and subscription process.

3RD GENERATION

AENCO DECENTRALIZED
PRIME BROKERAGE
PLATFORM (“AENCO
PRIME SOLUTIONS”)

To provide core services and technologies described in section 6.10 to
6.14.

7.2

For the 1st generation roll-out of core technologies is expected to take place after the ICO phase of the
development cycle. Branded under “AEN Connect”, Aenco will roll out its smart wallet for storage of
cryptocurrencies. The wallet will be enhanced by embedding our “Wealth App” functionalities that enables
user friendly viewing, sorting, and transacting capabilities by the smart wallet across multi-currency / multicrypto denominations. AEN Token will be listed on a number of global decentralized and centralized exchanges
in which Aenco is a participant so that our AEN token community can transact from day one. This strategy
ensures speedy proof of concept, and form the basis of our IB Solutions platform for our pipeline projects.

7.3

As part of the 2nd generation roll out, through AEN Connect, Aenco will launch an in-house developed ICO
gateway and platform as described in section 6.8, where additional features are added to AEN Connect. Through
this roll-out AEN token holders can view, research, and subscribe to other pipeline sponsored token sales
and opportunities where healthcare technology partners are featured within Aenco’s HealthTech ecosystem.
Potential subscribers will be able to navigate a user-friendly interface, search and view a broad range of big-data
analytics accumulated across the platform throughout our vetting and due diligence processes covering our
featured emerging growth companies and entrepreneurs. Conversely, users and the community will be able
to ascertain from the Aenco ICO platform non-identity specific information on subscriber interests, regional
jurisdictions and demographics of subscribers considering a range of ICO opportunities.

7.4

Additionally, as part of the 2nd generation ramp-up phase in technology, the company plans to roll-out an
enhanced smart wallet, or “vault”, where conditional locks (e.g. time lock) and pre-programed token release
mechanisms can be implemented. Such functionalities enables the platform to provide secure and seamless
custodial / escrow services throughout the ICO sponsorship and subscription process. Subscriber funds
are maintained in a high security setting, and in segregation to the token issuer at the initial stages of the
subscription process. Token release mechanisms are activated only when conditional locks are unlocked as
governed by smart contracts, and crypto proceeds are released to credible sponsored issuers based upon
their achievement of pre-defined ICO subscription milestones, providing an added level of comfort to the token
purchasing community.

Another key feature to be added to the ecosystem over the same development phase is AENX, a full scale
in-house developed digital asset trading exchange. This enables Aenco not only to be a participant within a
number of external exchanges as described in the 1st generation technology roll-out phase, but instead will be
even better positioned to provide liquidity management services for all client tokens. The exchange will also
play an important role in facilitating the circulation and exchangeability of our AEN token, furthering enhancing
its utility for existing, and new potential token holders.

7.6

The planned 3rd generation roll-out shall be Aenco’s Decentralized Prime Brokerage Platform (“Aenco Prime”) as
described in sections 6.10 to 6.14. The decentralized features of this development empowers clients and token
holders to access functionalities interfacing digital assets, fiat currencies, structured products, and traditional
financial assets, to transact via execution, financing, settlement, and custodial services.

ECOSYSTEM
8.

THE AENCO ECOSYSTEM AND AEN TOKEN

Aenco Ecosystem
8.1

The AEN Token ecosystem is generated through three major pillars of activities of Aenco:
i. The ecosystem created through the core IB and Prime Solutions Platform activities;
ii. The integration of the AEN token into the technology framework of the traditional financial services operated
by the planned regulated infrastructure globally within the group; For example, through operations driving
financial deposits mechanisms, payment clearing and escrow services, active management and segregation
of client assets;
iii. The cross collaboration of all the ecosystems developed through our sponsored token issuances and research
collaboration opportunities with our sponsored healthcare technology companies under our umbrella. For
example, the sharing of medical utilities across areas including, but not limited to, (i) therapeutics; (ii) medical
infrastructure such as labs, clinics, and equipment; and (iii) data analytics.

8.2

Through the three service pillars across Aenco’s Global HealthTech Blockchain Financial Solutions Platform:
Aenco’s ecosystem will attract a broad range of participants including institutional grade participants, all with
interest and focus towards healthcare technology oriented opportunities, counter-parties, and projects. We
foresee the ecosystem to attract institutional parties including:
• HealthTech partners
• Healthcare / HealthTech / MedTech corporates and emerging growth companies
• Healthcare focused and generalist hedge funds
• Other “mid to small cap” prime brokerage firms around the world
• Individual HealthTech centric traders and trading firms
• Centralized counterparties
• Syndicates of financial institutions
• Public crowdfunding parties
• Regulatory reporting counterparties

What are the Ecosystem Benefits for AEN Token Holders?
8.3

The AEN ecosystem is broadly supported by two major utilities: (a) Financial Utility and (b) Medical Utility.
FINANCIAL UTILITY: See Exhibit 20 for indicative financial utility examples.

8.4

The following section seeks to illustrate the indicative utility and membership benefits within the Aenco
Ecosystem to all participants who are eligible AEN Token proof-of-stake holders, as well as AEN velocity
enhancers using our token as a medium of exchange throughout the platform. All fees and rates are indicative
and subject to prevailing market rates during the course of normal business operations; AEN benefits are
reasonably estimated with reference to standard fees and rates offered. All figures quoted in this section are
indicative only and for illustration purposes only, and will be subject to change during implementation and roll
out.

8.5

Aenco IB Solutions benefits:
IB Solutions focuses on providing one-stop-shop solution to client token sales seeking institutional grade
sponsorship and liquidity services of their own tokens. Complimentarily, all issuers having successfully
progressed through our ICO Integrity Program shall contribute to a melting-pot of HealthTech centric and fully
vetted opportunities for community subscribers. Eligible AEN Token holders and users of AEN Connect shall
enjoy priority access to all Aenco vetted and sponsored token offerings; which becomes particularly attractive
for future “hot” and oversubscribed token offerings. A pre-defined quota among the total supply structured
for such offerings shall by design through the distribution process, be allocated to eligible AEN Token holders.
Additionally, AEN Token holders can enjoy significant discount to such opportunities during the Pre-ICO private
offering stages and early sponsorship stages.
AEN Token holders shall also be granted free access to ongoing research in relation to the platform’s ICO issuer
coverage universe. Such research can be accessed, viewed, and downloaded from the Aencoin research portal
that is to be integrated with the ICO Gateway and Platform within AEN Connect.
Furthermore, the same platform shall offer data analytics encompassing information derived throughout the
KYC and KYB processes interfacing token buyers and sellers across the Aenco ICO Integrity Program. Such
information will depict, among other factual information, non-identity specific subscriber data and demographics
to potential token sellers, as well as ICO/issuer data to potential subscribers.

8.6

Aenco Exchange Solutions (“AENX”) benefits:
Primary benefits to be enjoyed by eligible AEN Token holders are (i) Reduced platform fees; (ii) Free “airdrops”
on Aenco sponsored ICO tokens; and (iii) Enhanced flexibility to deposit and withdrawal thresholds.
Platform fees for proof-of-stake holders are expected to be lower in the form of exchange or transaction fees on
trading activity. As an indication, should market fees for maker and taker trades be 0.10% and 0.25% of trade
size respectively, AEN Token holders are eligible to enjoy, for example, between 15% discount of standard fees
to 100% fee waivers.
As AENX is anticipated to be an integral component of Aenco IB Solutions in streamlining liquidity management
services for Aenco sponsored ICO tokens, it becomes extremely beneficial for AENX participants to adopt and
utilize AEN in the exchange environment.

Aenco Prime and SmartCap Solutions benefits:
Our decentralized prime brokerage platform and online smart capital platforms offer a rich range of membership
benefits to AEN Token holders, across a tiered proof-of-stake schedule, in the form of reduced fees and tariffs
on financial services. This ranges from reduced deposit account opening fees, domestic and cross-border
remittance costs, foreign exchange transaction fees, trade servicing fees, and investment products and asset
management fees. AEN Token holders are eligible to enjoy, for example, between 15% discount of standard
fees to 100% fee waivers for top-tier proof-of-stake holders of AEN.
AEN Token holders shall enjoy other membership benefits such as decreased spreads on borrowing and
lending.
Token holders will also enjoy preferential terms on collateralized lending services, where for example, borrowers
requiring liquidity or lenders providing liquidity, may borrow or lend AEN against other major cryptocurrencies
(BTC, ETH). If loan-to-value ratios (“LTV”) for crypto backed collateralized lending ranges between 20% - 60%,
depending on a tiered proof-of-stake schedule, AEN Token holders will be able to enjoy, for example, 30% 80% LTV ratios and extract greater amounts of liquidity for less asset value.
Another key service area for Aenco Prime and SmartCap Solutions includes (i) Account receivables financing;
(ii) Bridge financing; and (iii) Collateralized financing of major crypto and securities. Entitled AEN Token holders
can earn significant premium on standard financing rates.

10. AEN TOKEN VALUE DRIVERS
10.1 Aenco is scheduled to launch its own token – the AEN Token (“AEN”) – an ERC223 based token with the aim to
execute the launch of Aenco’s own token sale and establish an early opportunity for global participants to join
and enjoy the benefits of being part of the Aenco’s ecosystem.
10.2 AEN token shall be the “exclusive membership” and utility token designed to fuel the activities of the
Aenco ecosystem, applications, and its HealthTech network. It will be the building block in which community
participants use to carry out ongoing transactions taking place on the platform and on new projects which
are promoted and listed there. AEN will act as incentives from the network itself, driving ongoing rewards to
our community and also allowing broader holders and users to access our Aenco solutions platform on a preemptive basis prior to public, sharing of medical utility by our HealthTech partners, and generally being part of
the Aenco ecosystem and all its future transactions supported.
10.3 AEN Token is designed to reward our community over the long term for their loyalty, support and ongoing
contribution. Some of the key AEN Token value drivers have been included below (but not limited to), these will
continue to be broadened as our community and project pipeline grows:
• Automated Platform membership to all of Aenco’s “HealthTech” Blockchain Financial Solutions: (i) Aenco
IB Solutions; (ii) Aenco Prime Solutions; and (iii) Aenco SmartCap Solutions;
• Priority and pre-emptive membership exclusive access to syndicated sponsorship opportunities (e.g.
Private Pre-ICO allocations) and high-quality, diligently screened token offerings, based on AEN stake by
existing holder and associated research coverage;
• “Lease” AEN tokens and sponsored tokens into the Aenco solutions network to support ongoing
transactions;
• Community rewards and bounty programs for our holders, administrators, partners to help drive the
growth of our AEN ecosystem, including the continuous contribution of exciting research and content
through AEN Connect;
• Automated access to collaboration opportunities with other sponsored health care technology and
blockchain projects and reward programs for the support of the growth of the ecosystem for such projects;

partners to facilitate the continuous adoption and dominance of AEN token as the major trading pair in the
market.

from all of Aenco sponsored HealthTech deals which will be deposited to the wallets of AEN holders.

39

10.4 More examples of benefits under the Aenco Prime platform:
Access to crowdfund opportunities in the decentralized financing pool;
• Holders of AEN will have membership access to provide financing to the funding pool or “lease” AEN tokens
(or sponsored tokens) where it can earn ongoing gas on a collateralized basis. The funding can be provided in
the form of fiat currencies or in the form of major cryptocurrencies. Our platform will manage the collateral
levels providing security to our holders and finance providers on an ongoing basis, including the automated
calling and allocation of margin on a daily basis from the borrowers. This will provide ongoing managed credit
risk services to our participants as well; as elevated income streams.
• Access to Aenco Prime’s Decentralized prime brokerage execution, custody, financing and settlements
platform;
• Holders of AEN will have membership to access our prime brokerage platform and access state of the art
decentralized systems to help execute transactions and custody the client assets. In addition, Aenco Prime
will manage external blockchain connections by the centralized counterparties and derivatives;
• Holders of AEN will also be able to create OTC derivatives through our blockchain technologies with other
participants, under which Aenco Prime will manage margin calls, automated settlements, monitoring and
reporting of ongoing prices of the positions and risk reporting. Derivatives that we anticipate that can be
created through our platform will include, but not limited to forwards, swaps and options. The framework
of these derivative positions will be based on the ISDA framework, and as and when the ISDA blockchain
technologies are implemented, our platform will provide compatible access to such external frameworks.

TOKEN ECONOMY PAPER
WHITEPAPER APPENDIX A

APPENDIX A: TOKEN ECONOMY PAPER
The Aenco Ecosystem and The AEN Token
1.

THE TOKEN

1.1

The AEN Token is an Ethereum based token under the ERC223 standard. The premise of the digital token
AEN is to be the “exclusive membership” and utility based token designed to fuel the activities of the Aenco
ecosystem, applications, and its HealthTech network. It will be the currency in which community participants
use to carry out ongoing transactions taking place on the platform and on new projects which are promoted
and listed there. AEN will act as incentives from the network itself, driving ongoing rewards to our community
and also allowing broader holders and users to access our Aenco solutions platform, sharing of medical utility
with its HealthTech partners, and generally being part of the Aenco ecosystem and all its future transactions
supported.

1.2

The total token supply for AEN will be 4,000,000,000. A total of 600,000,000 tokens shall be offered in the
upcoming sale. AEN shall be listed on at least two (2) exchanges shortly following its initial token sale, and
will become available to the public for exchange and trading. Any unsold tokens shall be retained by Aenco
and allocated to Reserves to fuel the development and growth of the Aenco ecosystem, its community and
partners (See Exhibit C).

2.
2.1

THE TOKEN SALE
The offering of AEN Tokens is being conducted over one private session and two public sessions with varying
bonus schemes as follows. All tokens (Private, Pre-ICO or ICO) will be allocated to the token holder wallet upon
the later of (i) the official token allocation date at completion of ICO, and (ii) expiry date of the lock up period in
respect of the relevant portion. Details of the allocation dates will be released through Aenco website at www.
aencoin.com and all our community channels:
(i) Private Sale: June/July 2018
Aenco is conducting a Private Sale of AEN Tokens through the month of June. Please stay tuned for updates
and announcements on our website. If you are interested to learn more details on how to participate in this
phase, please visit our website, register your details and contact us directly.
(ii) Pre-ICO Sale: July/August 2018
Each AEN Token is valued at USD $0.10. To kick start a robust Pre-ICO sale token buyers in this phase shall be
rewarded with an attractive bonus calculated on the number of AEN Tokens they subscribe to and based on
their SIZE of participation. Participants contributing more than 15 ETH will be granted +50% bonus tokens on
top of their contribution; those contributing less than 15 ETH but more than 5 ETH will be granted +40% and
those contributing between 1 ETH and 5 ETH shall be granted a +30% bonus. The ETH equivalent shall be
calculated for BTC contributions for the purpose of bonus token allocations as based on the exchange rate at
time of subscription. A minimum of 1 ETH is accepted for this Pre-ICO Sale while smaller contributions will only
be accepted in the Crowd Sale.

49

Additionally, as a special “FOMO Offering”, we will offer efficient participants who contribute within the first
24 HOURS of the commencement of the Pre-ICO Sale an additional +5% bonus on top of the aforementioned
bonus scheme. Therefore, contribute more than 15 ETH within the first 24 hours, and receive up to a

TOKEN DISTRIBUTION

3.1

The total supply of tokens is intended to be distributed over a number of areas where 15% shall be allocated to
this initial token sale, along with an additional 4% in bonus scheme allocations. Other uses include tokens to be
deployed to support the liquidity of Aenco’s growing ecosystem, tokens to be allocated to ecosystem partners
and backers, tokens reserved for incentive programs such as bounty programs, as well as tokens to cover the
costs of the initial token sale and those retained by the Company and team.

3.2

Among the tokens that are retained by Aenco’s team, total tokens allocated to the management team are
subjected to an overall lock-up period of between 6 to 24 months from the initial token offering, where 25% of
tokens are released and tradable only every 6-months. Therefore 25% of allocated tokens to management are
tradable after 6-months, 50% tokens after 12-months, 75% after 18-months, and 100% only after 24-months.
The primary goal is to demonstrate that the management team is committed throughout the duration of the
underlying development and technology roll-out. Tokens allocated to non-management staff are locked up for a
period between 6 to 12 months.

3.3

See Exhibit C for greater details on the intended use and lock-up information for total token distribution.

4.2. Sponsorship and Financial Solutions Platform for HealthTech Partners (40% - Soft Cap)
Among the proceeds raised from Aenco’s initial token sale (targeting 15% of total token supply excluding
bonus allocations), the largest segment is to be allocated to the sponsorship and financial solutions platform
for HealthTech partners in order to ensure that their respective token offerings of such partners will be a
community success. 40% of the proceeds raised are projected for such purpose as it fuels the primary services
to be offered within Aenco’s IB Solutions over the period of 1st generation technology and services roll-out. This
shall entail the syndicated sponsorship, listing, and post offering secondary market liquidity providing services
Aenco will use to service its existing pipeline of HealthTech partners, as well as new prospects continue to be
on boarded to expand the ecosystem and growing medical utility.
4.3. Research, Technology Development and Roll Out, and Collaboration Research (30% - Soft Cap)
30% is being earmarked for ongoing research, development, and roll-out of scheduled underlying technologies
associated to 2nd and 3rd generation application development that will continue to evolve and improve the
functionalities of AEN Connect. This includes adding our ICO gateway and associated research portal to
systematically interface the broader global community with our HealthTech partners. This would also support
the development AENX, our HealthTech centric digital asset exchange, further equipping Aenco’s ability to
provide secondary market liquidity to its sponsored tokens as well as enhancing use cases for AEN Token.
It would also contribute to the mechanics of the decentralized prime brokerage platform to be developed
in the third phase, but creating an environment in which borrowers and lenders of digital assets will have a
streamlined location to interchangeably trade and exchange such assets.
4.4

General Working Capital and Infrastructure Setup Capital Requirements (24% - Soft Cap)
24% shall be allocated to the general operations of Aenco and to support infrastructure setup. This is to ensure
the company is able to support the basic operational needs to further develop applications and provide its
services throughout the ecosystem, as well as capital expenditures into business infrastructure to drive future
growth.

4.5

Marketing and Distribution (3% - Soft Cap) and Legal and Compliance (3% - )
Remaining funds are planned to support marketing and distribution of AEN tokens and its sponsored tokens, and
costs associated to satisfying and enhancing our legal / compliance obligations within a regulatory framework.

55

5.
5.1

CONVERSION OF SUBSCRIPTION PROCEEDS TO AEN TOKENS
The conversion price between AEN Token against BTC or ETH will be fixed on a daily basis upon the date of
receipt of the subscription consideration. The fixing will be determined based on the method of payment opted
by the token buyer. We currently offer two methods of payment.
Option 1: Direct deposit of ETH or BTC to our designated wallet addresses.
In which case, the U.S. Dollar (USD) daily average price as calcuated being the average of the OPEN and
CLOSE prices as shown on “coinmarketcap.com” for BTC or ETH where relevant (“USD Daily Average”)
Option 2: Payment through our adopted payment gateway “Coin Payments”.
In which case the USD Daily Average will be at the default exchange quote at the time.

Aenco retailns full discretion and right to determine or change the terms of the fixing at any time.
5.2

Your entitlement to the final number of AEN Tokens will be calculated by:
i The number of BTC or ETH received during the UTC time zone multiplied by the applicable USD Daily
Average (“USD Equivalent”);
ii The USD Equivalent is divided by USD 0.1 in determining the subscribed number of AEN tokens (“AEN Token
Base”); Plus
iii The AEN Token Base multiplied by bonus percentage applicable at the time of subscription as pursuant to
Exhibit A.

5.3

Example (Direct deposit of ETH or BTC to our designated wallet addresses):
A token buyer subscribes to AEN Tokens during the Pre-ICO sale with an amount of 10 BTC on 1 May 2018. As
depicted on the website coinmarketcap.com, the OPEN/CLOSE prices for BTC in UTC time are 9,251.47 USD/
BTC and 9,119.01 USD/BTC respectively. This would result in a USD Daily Average exchange rate of (9,251.47
+ 9,119.01)/2 = 9,185.24 USD/BTC.
The USD Equivalent = 10 BTC x 9,185.24 USD/BTC = USD 91,852.4.
AEN Token Base = USD 91,852.4 / USD 0.1 = 918,524 tokens.
If we assume the subscriber is entitled to a 50% bonus scheme during this phase, the final number of AEN
Tokens the subscriber is entitled to including the relevant bonus scheme = 918,524 x (1+50%) = 1,377,786
AEN Tokens.

6.1

TOKEN ISSUANCE PROCEDURE
Upon successfully registering for the subscription of AEN Tokens and fulfilling conditions of our know-yourclient (“KYC”) verification requirements (See Exhibit E), token buyers are eligible to make payment in the form
of ETH or BTC for the token purchase. Subsequently, token buyers shall be able to view their allocation on
