Nexus: A Peer-to-Peer Network

July 4, 2017

Abstract
“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change
something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete”
R. Buckminster Fuller
Throughout history we have witnessed many changes in our culture,
technology, and governance. These changes are fueled by a necessity for
the further evolution of mankind. Now humanity approaches another
one of these times in history, where the way everything has been done
must be changed; this is why we built Nexus. Peer-to-Peer technology
fuels the backbone of a global blockchain-based cryptocurrency represented by the ticker: NXS which is traded world-wide as an alternative
currency with the capacity to rival world economies. The framework,
Nexus, utilizes new distributed database designs, mathematical trust,
community governance, ground-based mesh networks, and a Low Earth
Orbit Satellite Constellation. We are Nexus, a connection of people,
ideas, and computers providing greater choice and therefore greater
evolution with an aim towards our freedom. Welcome to the Future.

Introduction

Peer-to-peer networks are forming the foundations of digital industries worldwide. This ecosystem continues to evolve as innovators advance the growing body of open-source protocols, including Bitcoin, BitTorrent, TOR, and
IPFS. The utility of these networks has increasingly affected people throughout the world. For the first time in history, the transmission of value can
occur without the need for intermediaries. Now, almost ten years from the
release of Satshosi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System [1] debuted on a Cypher Punk e-mail list in a time of economic crisis,
many benefits have been realized including but not limited to: viz. enhanced financial security, emancipation from centralized banking systems,
and the possibilities of future applications of blockchains. However, many
challenges have also been identified such as scaling, consensus updates, and
considerations for the post-quantum era that is almost upon us. By resolving some of these identified issues, Nexus has enhanced the blockchain
protocol, thereby providing a solid foundation for the digital economies of
the future.

1.1

What is Nexus?

Nexus is a connection, or series of connections, of computers, businesses, and
people with a focus on establishing new applications of finance, technology,
service, and sovereignty.

1.2

What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a decentralized and immutable public database of transactions. The database is organized by connecting a chain of blocks together.
Each block contains a group of transactions. The blocks are ordered in time
5

and ”chained” together using cryptographic hashes.12 Large quantities of
computational resources must be expended to create each block hash,3 and
each block contains the previous block’s hash: this is how they are chained.

The blocks are produced in intervals, forming a chain of verifiable blocks that
contain the transaction history providing data a form that cannot be altered
without redoing the work of the previous blocks or confirmations. The end
result is a single, immutable journal of transactions grouped through timeordered blocks distributed and verified by all of the nodes on the network.

1.3

How are Blocks Created?

Blocks are created by a distributed network of miners (users operating special
hardware to solve the proof of work puzzles) in a process called mining. As
an analogy for mining, imagine many people are sitting in a room out of
motivation to win a prize if they solve their Rubik’s Cube first. The tiles of
the Rubik’s Cube can be thought of as the transactions, with one of these
tiles representing the prize (mint) the winner is allowed to claim if they
solve the cube. However, they are only allowed to make one random change
per iteration and they are limited by the speed of their hands (some may be
faster than others). Eventually one player will end up with a solved cube.
When one finds the solution, they show it to the other players in the room.
If the other players independently verify that the cube is solved properly,
the winner is rewarded with the prize and a new round begins.
1
”A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which takes an input (or ’message’)
and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string. The string is called the ’hash value’...” [10]
2
The concept of a cryptographic chain of blocks dates back to Ehrsam, Meyer, Smith
and Tuchman’s invention of Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) in 1976 [3]. NB: this is distinct
from blockchain as discussed here in many ways, notably because it does not include a
proof-of-work.
3
This is generically called Proof-of-Work but also includes Sunny King’s innovation:
Proof-of-Stake [11].

1.4

Are Blockchains the Answer?

Blockchains have become more necessary as we become aware of the challenges we are facing in our current progression as a society. By maintaining
open minds to recognize the challenges we face, we become aware of the
limitations that legacy monetary systems cannot solve. As is seen that
blockchains do solve many monetary challenges, such as uncontrolled inflation, central banking, and many others, they are only a part of the solution
to our current economic circumstances.
quantitative easing:
unconventional monetary policy
in which a central bank
purchases government securities
or other securities from the
market in order to lower interest
rates and increase the money
supply
Investopedia

The term blockchain should not be confused with any encrypted database.
The dollar is essentially an online virtual currency encrypted between banks
that is redeemable for federal reserve notes Paper Money. This does not
make the dollar a blockchain. What makes a blockchain is a decentralized
public journal with no central authority. By owning a particular portion of
a cryptocurrency, you prove partial ownership in the financial system.

1.5

Challenges of Money

The application and implementation of the world’s monetary systems has
become the source of one of the biggest challenges we face today. This is due
to the many global policies designed for empowering central banks to create
currencies as debt with interest associated. Central Banks have the ability
to influence world economies by changing interest rates, printing massive
sums of money (otherwise known as inflation / hyperinflation), quantitative easing, or through various other forms of credit creation. There are
many historical examples of central authorities who have misused this enormous power, knowingly or unknowingly, to the detriment of the people that
these institutions exist to serve. These include post-World War I Germany
with a hyperinflation of up to 30,000% per month, Zimbabwe during the
Great Recession of the last decade with nearly 79 billion percent per month
7

inflation, and post-World War II Hungary, with inflation rates of nearly
13,000,000,000,000% per year. 4 .

Nexus

Multiple components need to be considered when providing the fundamental
basis for change and freedom. The following is a brief outline of the core
components that comprise the foundation of Nexus.

2.1

Hardware

Nexus is researching and developing three types of networks that will work
together to form a new telecommunications system. These are outlined in
the sections below.
2.1.1

Mesh Networks
A mesh network is a network topology
in which each node relays data for the
network. All mesh nodes cooperate in
the distribution of data in the network
[4].
This allows for the growth of groundbased networks to handle data exchange
in localized areas.

Ground-based mesh networks will solve
many telecommunication issues. Specialized antennas can be produced for
people to purchase and operate, thereby
forming networks owned by the individuals who built it.
2.1.2

Cube Satellites

As mesh networks grow, they will need to overcome the problem with line
of sight and transcontinental communication. This issue can be solved with
the deployment of a satellite constellation designed to focus towards orbital
4
The estimated 200% per day inflation equates to about thirteen quadrillion percent
per year [2]

8

cache layers and mesh network relays. This will provide caching of data and
relaying of data between ground-based mesh networks.
2.1.3

Ground Stations

Ground stations will provide the satellite uplink/downlink operations. These
stations will be responsible for ground-based caching, the running of a nexus
daemon, and the defining of a route to relay data to the addressed endpoint.

2.2

Software

There are many types of software applications that are integral parts of the
functionality and efficiency of Nexus. The software systems are constantly
being developed and improved upon as Nexus continues to mature.
• Daemon
Nexus operates on a lower-level software application called the ”Nexus
Daemon”. Instances of this software application communicate with
one another, forming a peer-to-peer network. They exchange data in
the form of transactions and secure them into a distributed database
called a blockchain.
• Wallet
A command line and graphical Qt version of the Nexus wallet is currently available for download [5] [9]. A new version of the Nexus
wallet will be a higher-level graphical application written in the Electron Framework. This will allow access to the functions of the “Nexus
Daemon” through a HTML/JS interface with native Windows, Linux,
and Mac OS X installers.5
• Library
The lower-level library includes three parts, namely Crypto, Database,
and Protocol. They form a lower-level set of programming base templates that can be used to create more complex class structures on top
of them.
5

This is under active development at the time of this writing.

Specifications

This section provides details on the specifications of the main software component of Nexus, the ”Nexus Daemon”. This software component is the
foundation of the Nexus Network and takes into account Precise Emission,
Mining, Trust, and other components of security and efficiency.

3.1

Hashing

Hashing is a critical part of any cryptocurrency. The recent SHA-1 collision
computation by Google underscores the need for more secure hashes [19].
One of the innovations of Nexus is the use of newer hashing functions with
the goal of enhanced security.
3.1.1

SHA-2

SHA-256 is a member of the SHA-2 set of cryptographic hash functions.6
It was designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published in
2001 [15]. SHA-256 is used in Bitcoin mining and in the creation of Bitcoin
addresses [53].
3.1.2

SHA-3

Nexus uses a newer, more secure hashing algorithm than that of Bitcoin.
The SHA-3 [54] standard was the result of a competition [20] with the goal
of producing an alternative to SHA-2. This competition was organized by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The winner of
this competition was selected in 2012. The new SHA-3 standard algorithm
is a subset of the cryptographic primitive family, Keccak [55].
3.1.3

Skein

The Skein algorithm was the runner up in the NIST hash function competition [56]. It is also used in Nexus, in combination with SHA-3. The
advantage of this approach is greater diversity in the secure hashing functions used in Nexus.
6

SHA stands for Secure Hashing Algorithm.

10

3.1.4

Skein-Keccak

Nexus hashing is built from two secure hashing algorithms: Skein and
Keccak [17]. These two algorithms Figure 1: Four of the 72 rounds of
are combined to form a single SK- the Threefish-512 block cipher used in
1024 (Skein-Keccak 1024 bit) hash. Skein [16].
There are three types of output
lengths in Nexus hashing: SK-256,
SK-512, and SK-1024. Public keys
are hashed with SK-256 to secure
them from public knowledge until
spent. Transactions are hashed with
SK-512 while SK-1024 is used for
the proof-of-work hash.
3.1.5 Comparison of 256 bit
and 1024 bit
The following example illustrates
the difference in size between a
Nexus block hash and a Bitcoin
block hash:

3.2

Emission

In Bitcoin, a fixed amount of BTC is available as a reward for miners in every block. This amount halves every four years, thereby reducing Bitcoin’s
inflation. However, this sudden change in the block reward is a shock to the
market. Miners spend large sums of money on equipment and personnel.
When the block reward halves, their profits are cut in half overnight. 7 Such
uncertainty could possibly have a negative effect on network security [24].
Nexus improves upon this model by adjusting the reward with every block.
Using the equations for exponential decay (with carefully chosen constant
k), (e−kt ), a deposit is made into reserves every minute. The reserve determines the available reward for miners.
The supply is locked to time and not the block production rate. Inconsistent
block times have no effect on the exact supply. This allows the projected
supply to be accurately calculated at any second past the network time lock.
3.2.1

Reserves

A traditional water reservoir holds water that can be drawn upon by a town.
The total amount of water the town can draw is limited based on how much
is in the reservoir. In a similar way, the Nexus reserve system controls how
much NXS is available to miners at a given time.
There are three reserves. The amount of NXS deposited into each reserve is
mathematically determined by the decay equations.

Vd = 1 · e−0.00000059·Tm
Va = 10 · e−0.00000055·Tm
Vm = 50 · e−0.0000011·Tm

+0.032
+1
+1

(1)

Where Tm is the time in minutes and Vd , Va , Vm are the reserve deposit
amounts for miner, ambassador, and developer reserves.
7

Theoretically because this reduction in profits can be foreseen, miners can prepare for
it ahead of time. Realistically, it’s difficult for miners to account for this in a fast-changing
system.

12

3.2.2

Rewards

The rewards are calculated based on the reserve value. This prevents surplus emission beyond the target level. These three equations describe the
intervals in which the block reward Vb changes based on reserve values Vm
at Tm by compounding the Tm value from equations 1.


Ta

 60 · Vr , Tm ≤ 2.5
Vb = 2.5 · Vr , 2.5 < Tm < 20


3.0 · Vr , Tm ≥ 20

(2)

Where Ta is the actual time, To is the offset time, and Tt is the target time.
3.2.3

Minting

Peer-to-peer networks, such as Bitcoin and Nexus, require the support of many nodes around the
world. If there aren’t enough nodes,
network stability, decentralization,
speed, and security suffer. Bitcoin
suffers from a tragedy of the commons8 issue wherein everyone wants
more people to run the peer-to-peer
wallet, but there is little incentive to
do so. Nexus solves this problem by
Figure 2: Interest Rate Graph.
rewarding people with newly minted
coins for holding Nexus and keeping their wallet up and running 24/7. To
put it simply, if someone installs the Nexus wallet on their computer and
deposits enough NXS, then they will occasionally find a block and earn extra
NXS.9
This minting system operates to give people larger rewards for greater contribution to the network. As one produces blocks by using this method in a
8

The tragedy of the commons is an economic problem in which every individual tries to
reap the greatest benefit from a given resource. As the demand for the resource overwhelms
the supply, every individual who consumes an additional unit directly harms others who
can no longer enjoy the benefits [35].
9
This is a way to support the network and earn Nexus without costly and difficult-tooperate mining hardware and software.

timely manner, one’s trust grows. With a higher trust score comes a higher
minting rate. The minting rate Rm ranges from 0.5 % - 3 %.

Where at is the age of your trust key (the number seconds since the trust
key’s genesis transaction).

3.3

Block Validation

There are three ways to produce a valid Nexus block and mint new NXS.
There are two proof-of-work channels and one proof-of-holdings channel.
The proof-of-work channels are the Prime Channel and the Hashing Channel. In the Prime Channel, miners search for Dense Prime Clusters of 308
digits in size. In the hash channel, standard Hashcash [18] style work is
computed using the SK-1024 hashing algorithm. The two proof-of-work
channels prevent each other from producing too many blocks in a row, thus
forcing a 51% attacker across both channels.10
3.3.1

Dense Prime Clusters

The work done by miners in the Prime channel is a search for dense prime
clusters [42].11 Finding these dense prime clusters is a trial-and-error process. Miners must try many numbers to successfully find one that is the
beginning of a dense prime cluster [41, 36].
The count of prime numbers in a dense prime cluster is called its chain
length. 12 A dense prime cluster with a longer chain length is more difficult
to find than one with a shorter chain length. The first prime number in
the chain is required to be higher than the block hash and less than the
block hash plus 264 .13 If the first prime in the cluster fits these criteria, it
10

Reserves between Prime and Hash are split evenly at 50 %
The numbers found in these searches are actually probable primes [38]. They pass the
Fermat primality test [39] at base 2.
12
The “chain” here should not be confused with the chain in blockchain.
13
The block hash can’t be determined a priori for future blocks because it’s based on
previous block information. Therefore, a miner must start their prime cluster search over
again after each new block is found.

is considered a valid solution.
One benefit to searching for dense prime clusters is that it is thought to be
more resistant to GPU, FPGA, and ASIC mining than hashing. Another
is that the data produced by the miner is useful for mathematical research
into prime numbers [40] [37]. The applications of prime number research
may extend beyond mathematics and into quantum physics [43]. This is
one of the ways that Nexus provides value back to the scientific community
and the world.
3.3.2

Hashing

The hashing channel uses a Hashcash [18] style proof-of-work. Miners run
code [6, 7] on GPUs in an attempt to find a hash that meets a given difficulty.
If they are lucky, they will find a hash with at least a certain number of
leading 0 bits. This means that the hash is preceded by a number of 0’s
and is a smaller integer. This is called a ”partial collision”. This is similar
to the proof-of-work scheme that Bitcoin uses. Bitcoin uses SHA-256 while
Nexus uses the newer SHA-3 in combination with Skein.
3.3.3

Holdings

Proof-of-Holdings (POH) provides a third channel of security. An attacker
would need to gain 51 percent of the NXS supply to attack this channel in
conjunction with the hash and prime channels. The incentive for this proof
system is newly minted coins which are rewarded to participants for actively
“holding” their coins. This means the network incentives users to contribute
to the security of the system. This provides a natural growth in the coin
supply over time that will be highly beneficial to the network, economy, and
users.
Unlike current Central Bank models, this new supply of coins goes directly
into the users hands rather than being filtered through a fractional reserve
system. Furthermore, these newly minted coins have zero debt associated
with their issuance and, therefore, never need to be paid back to the system
with associated interest, as is the case with many current fiat currencies.
The minting rate was determined to be a variable rate between .5% and 3%
to provide a small natural growth to the coin supply allowing for increased
economic opportunity.

Difficulty

The difficulty of finding a block is adjusted with every new block. The
Nexus difficulty algorithm combines weighted averages for the last n blocks.
A weighted average time, Ta is calculated as follows:

Ta =

Pn

i=1

w·i[Tb (H−n+i)−Tb (H−n+i−1)
n

(4)

Where H is the current block height, Tb is the block time stamp at a given
height, n is the blockchain depth, and w is a weight constant (currently set
to 3).
M odd is the factor used to modify the difficulty

(
[1 − (M ind · To )] · Tt , if Ta ≥ Tt
M odd =
[1 + (M axd · To )] · Tt , otherwise

(5)

Where Tt is the target time, To is the offset time, M ind is the minimum
difficulty decrease and M axd is the maximum difficulty increase.
It’s a vice to trust everyone, and
equally a vice to trust no one.

3.5

Trust

Trust is a core component of Nexus. Nodes which have a vested interest in
and are acting to benefit the whole network by participating honestly and
consistently are considered more trustworthy. Currently, trust is earned by
holding Nexus in a wallet and producing valid blocks on a regular basis.
This earned trust is recorded in the Nexus blockchain and is associated with
a trust key.
Future areas of research and development in Nexus are focusing on using
the concept of trust in many ways. Using trust, a new security model can
be developed around time. The strength of the Nexus economy and its reliability will be reinforced by promoting truthfulness between the voluntary
interactions with individuals and groups of individuals.
3.5.1

Weight

Weight governs the speed in which one can search for new trust blocks. It
comes in the form of two different weight variables: Block Weight (Wb ) and
Trust Weight (Wt ).
Wt = M in(17.5,

16.5 · ln( 2419200

ln(3)

(7)

Where at is the trust age and ab is the block age.
3.5.2

Threshold

A system has been developed to allow an energy-efficient time-based trust
system. This is regulated by the Energy Efficiency Threshold Et .

Et =

17

(8)

The Required Threshold Rt is

Rt =

(50−Wt −Wb )·1000
C

(9)

Where C is the total NXS in a trust transaction.
3.5.3

Genesis

The genesis transaction is the first transaction of a trust key. This is required
to act as the root of the trust key’s age in order to gain a reference on its
current weight and minting rate. The hash of this genesis transaction can
therefore be used as an input in future transactions to verify that a trust
block is linked to a corresponding genesis transaction.
The following equation describes the genesis weight required to get a high
enough threshold to achieve the creation of a genesis transaction and corresponding block14

Wg = M in(17.5,

2·ac
16.5·ln( 7257600
)+1
ln(3)

+ 1.0)

(10)

Where ac is the coin age of the coins which are being used.
3.5.4

Intervals

Trust blocks cannot be created from the same trust key unless the interval
or number of blocks between their last trust block exceeds It ≥ 6.

3.6

Clock Drift

Clock drift refers to several related phenomena where a clock does not run
at exactly the same rate as a reference clock [8]. This is usually resolved
by connecting to a central server and/or atomic clock. Nexus combats this
with a peer-to-peer time-keeping system that keeps all clocks on the network
synchronized to the unified time seed.

3.7

Security

When the clocks are synchronized, a higher level of security occurs with regards to the timestamps. This is because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
generally allow up to 2 hours in the future for clock drift, which means that
14

Genesis transaction weight does not include block weight.

18

blocks can be created up to 2 hours from the timestamp, thereby leaving potential attack vectors. Nexus combats this synchronization not with median
time, as Bitcoin uses, but rather with a Unified Time system that operates
on the protocol level keeping all Nexus clocks synchronized to the second.

3.8

Time-Locks

Because clocks in the Nexus network are synchronized, new rules can be activated in the protocol based on time stamps rather than block numbers. This
allows network participants to more accurately activate consensus updates.

3.9

Checkpoints

Automated decentralized checkpoints are created every hour. A checkpoint
prevents any block that was not rooted from the last hardened checkpoint
to be invalid. This prevents an attacker from producing an alternative
blockchain prior to the last checkpoint time.

I think I can safely say that
nobody understands quantum
mechanics.

Post-Quantum Considerations

4.1

Grover’s Algorithm

Grover’s algorithm is a quantum algorithm which was
devised by Lov Grover at
Bell Labs. The summary
in Grover’s 1996 paper provides a helpful description:
”Imagine a phone directory containing N names arranged in completely random order.
In order to
find someone’s phone number with a probability of
one half, any classical algo- Figure 3: Grover’s Algorithm on Two Qubits
rithm... will need to look at
a minimum of N/2 names. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple√names ... As a
result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only O( N ) steps [62].”
Given the output of a black box function, it can be used to determine15
the input. This implies that most one-way cryptographic hash functions are
susceptible to this algorithm. Indeed, Grover’s algorithm could brute-force
a 256-bit key in roughly 2128 iterations.
k

The algorithm proceeds to call G [ π4 · 2 2 ] times in the verification of the
subroutines. The largest overhead, though, in Grover’s Algorithm is the
cost of error detection that must be done classically to ensure the accuracy
of the qubits and the two subroutines of Grover Iteration.
The first subroutine of G is attempting to assert g : {0, 1}k → {1, 0} maps
X to 1 only if f (x) = y. The next subroutine is called the “Diffusion Operator”, and it implements the transformation of g to increase the probability
that f (x) = y.
As illustrated in Table 1, Grover’s Algorithm results in a nearly 50% reduction to the security provided by one-way hashing functions against brute15

In a probabilistic manner.

force attacks. This implies that a hash, which has twice as many bits, should
be used to achieve the same level of security against brute-force attacks.

4.2

Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Elliptic Curve Cryptography, in terms of classical computing, retains high
security standards with smaller key sizes compared to RSA [58]. The following equation can be used to represent an elliptic curve:

y 2 = x3 + ax + b

a binary field F2m . The domain parameters
that are used in most other digital currencies are based on secp256k1 [13]. These parameters are associated with a Kolbitz curve and are defined over a prime
21

field Fp .

4.4

Private Keys

A private key is a number that should only be known to the owner of the
coins in a given address. To produce a secure private key, it’s necessary
to start with a number that is as close to truly random as possible.16 If
anyone is able to determine what the private key is, they can move the
coins to another address. This is why private key security is so important.
You don’t want anyone else to find out what your ’secret number’ is, and
you don’t want them to be able to guess it or determine it with a complex
algorithm based on public information. Both Bitcoin and Nexus use large
numbers so that there is almost no chance that anyone else will generate
the same random number, and it is impossible for anyone to try all of the
numbers.17 Bitcoin keys are 256 bits in length, while Nexus keys are more
than twice as long at 571 bits.

4.5

Public Keys

The public key is derived from the private key using elliptic curve cryptography. It’s easy to derive a public key from a private key, but not a private key
from a public key. However, there is concern that, in the future, this may be
possible with quantum computers. Fortunately, modern cryptocurrencies,
including Nexus and Bitcoin, do not require users to share even their public
key. When you request a payment in Nexus from someone, you first get a
Nexus address from your wallet. This address is not your public key. It’s
16

This is handled by the Nexus wallet software - it generates private keys and stores
them.
17
”How many numbers? For every grain of sand on Earth, create a new Earth. There
are 26 billion unique Bitcoin addresses for each grain of sand on each of those Earths.”[52]
Because the keys in Nexus are longer, there are astronomically more possible Nexus addresses.

22

called a public key hash, or PKH. As the name implies, it’s created by taking
a hash of the public key. This means that an attacker who wants to figure
out your private key first has to determine your public key from the PKH.
Fortunately, this is an intractable problem. Current research indicates this
may take even quantum computers on the order of a hundred billion years
[48, 49]. The public key associated with a PKH is not revealed until the
coins are spent [26]. Therefore, one can achieve a high level of quantum
attack resistance simply by not re-using addresses.
Now let’s consider the question: If an adversary did know your public key,
how hard would it be for them to determine the all-important private key?
For the answer to this question, we look to the work of Peter Shor.

4.6

Shor’s Algorithm

In 1994, Peter Shor devised a method which could be used to solve the Integer Factorization Problem IFP and the Discrete Logarithm Problem DLP
in polynomial time on a quantum computer [44]. This was an important
achievement because these problems have no classical polynomial time solution. This means that, on a classical computer, they can’t be solved in any
amount of time which can be represented by nk - for example n2 , n3 , etc.18
Because of this, they are used in cryptographic systems.
The Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) is a special case
of the DLP for elliptic curves. This is a more difficult problem to solve
classically than the DLP.[45] This is the type of problem that needs to
be solved in order to determine the private key from the public key for
cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Nexus.

4.7

Zalka, Proos and Kaye

Christof Zalka, along with John Proos and Phillip Kaye, have extended
Shor’s work by designing algorithms optimized for solving the ECDLP. The
result is the Proos-Zalka and Kaye-Zalka algorithms.
18
In layman’s terms, this means that finding a solution is infeasible as long as a large
enough number is used.

23

4.8

Proos-Zalka Algorithm

The Proos-Zalka algorithm was specifically designed to solve the ECDLP
over a prime field Fp on a quantum computer. This is an attack on elliptic
curves over a finite field. The qubit requirement for the breaking of the
ECDLP over a prime field of n bits is as follows [45]

√
5 · n + 8 n + 4 log2 n + 10 ≈ 6n
4.9

(12)

Kaye-Zalka Algorithm

The Kaye-Zalka revision addresses curves over the binary field F2m . This
specific field takes advantage of binary computation to bring quicker verification on larger keys. The equation modeling the qubits required to break
a key of F2m is as follows [46]

2m + 7 · logm + 7 + H ≈ 2m

(13)

Where H is related to the halting counter and is of order log(m).

4.10

The Benefits of Larger Keys

”Key length defines the upper-bound on an algorithm’s security since the
security of all algorithms can be violated by brute force attacks [58].”
As of 2015, a minimum key length of 224 bits is recommended for elliptic
curve algorithms [60]. Bitcoin keys are 256 − 224 = 32 bits longer than this
requirement while Nexus keys are 571 − 224 = 347 bits longer. According
to the National Security Agency “Elliptic Curve Public Key Cryptography
using the 256-bit prime modulus elliptic curve as specified in FIPS-186-2
and SHA-256 are appropriate for protecting classified information up to the
SECRET level. Use of the 384-bit prime modulus elliptic curve and SHA-384
are necessary for the protection of TOP SECRET information [59].”
Brute Force Resistance
The Large Bitcoin Collider [57] is a project that attempts to brute forceattack Bitcoin. Participants in this project generate as many Bitcoin public
addresses as possible by first choosing a random number in a given range.
Rarely, they happen to generate a public address that happens to contain
Bitcoins and the Bitcoins can be stolen since they know what the private

24

key is.19
Key length defines the upper-bound on an algorithm’s security [58] against
brute-force attacks. Nexus uses significantly larger 571-bit keys than Bitcoin’s 256-bit keys and is thus postulated to be more resistant to these
attacks.
In any case, Rico - the pseudonymous lead of the LBC states: ”Finding a
P2PKH20 -collision [one cryptographic method of creating bitcoin addresses]
would probably mean the end of P2PKH but not bitcoin,” ... ”Bitcoin would
evolve with new address types. Most certainly it wouldn’t ’die’ because of
this.”[57] This highlights one of the ways that Nexus is providing value back
to the Bitcoin ecosystem. By using different elliptic curve parameters and
different hashing algorithms, Nexus is paving the way for possible future
enhancements to Bitcoin. Instead of merly researching or discussing alternatives, Nexus is proving them on a live blockchain.
Longer Solution Time
It will take more time for a quantum computer to solve the ECDLP if the
key is larger. The run times are predicted to be of order O(n2 ) [45, 46].
This means that a key which is twice as long will take approximately four
times as long to find with a quantum computer.

Side Channel Attacks on secp256k1

As previously mentioned, Bitcoin uses the 256 bit secp256k1 elliptic curve
domain parameters as defined in the Standards for Efficient Cryptography.
Under special circumstances, a Bitcoin private key can be determined by
another process on the same classical computer in as few as 200 signatures
[50].21 With quantum computing on the horizon, and the fact that ECC already leaks private keys classically with side channel attacks, serious considerations must be made on the logic of any use of digital signature algorithms
to prove ownership of any tokens. This is the focus of ongoing research and
development in Nexus.

4.12

Key Accommodations in Nexus

Nexus currently supports key sizes as large as 571 bits, specifically sect571r1.
In order to offer more choice and to take advantage of the larger number of
qbits required to crack curves over prime fields, we will also implement keys
using different curves.
The choice of elliptic curve parameters is subtle; care must be taken to
avoid security pitfalls. Several parameter choices have been developed, as
described on the SafeCurves website [47]. We plan to add support for multiple curves to Nexus in the future, giving people the choice of what curve
to use and the ability to use multisig with multiple curves.

4.13

Post-Quantum Cryptography

Since the newly emerging quantum computer era is almost upon us, and
many cryptographers are working on new quantum encryption methods,
Nexus has chosen to use key suites and high-bit keys to provide quantum
resistance while the post-quantum industry matures. The projected time
before any practical quantum computers that could do any damage is around
five to ten years. By doubling Nexus key size, the required run time is
quadrupled; this provides more time to carefully choose a post quantum
cryptographic method. This is projected to be within the next few years
as the development of post-quantum cryptography is observed and studied
more thoroughly.
21

This is called a ”side channel” attack.

With modern hashing, upgraded private keys, multiple block validation
methods, decentralized checkpointing, time synchronization, decentralized
trust, variable block reward, time locked emission, decentralized minting,
lower level library, quantum considerations, ground based mesh networks,
and low earth orbit satilite constilations Nexus is one of the most technologically advanced frameworks on the planet. Furthermore Nexus also
represents a vision for a better future for all mankind aligned with the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
We now have an opportunity to step away from existing systems by simply
changing our focus. We can choose to look away from the systems of the
past and focus our energy on the systems of the future. Through the Nexus
framework, users now have the tools needed to change the focus and connect
through a mathematically and cryptographically validated network. Nexus

represents an important step forward in this process. The noun ”nexus” is
defined as: a connection or series of connections linking two or more things.
Nexus is an idea of connection and the technology to make this possible.
It is through this connection that people will have the opportunity to act
together in accord with one another, and pursue a future that is filled with
wisdom, prosperity and joy. Welcome to Nexus!

Vision

Vision is one’s ability to think about or plan the future with wisdom. Wisdom is the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment. In
this case, vision is coupled with wisdom, which is a direct result of experience and, therefore, knowledge. This means that vision is attainable if one is
willing to learn from the experience of the world. Vision can be understood
at a greater depth by applying the following to conduct:
1. Capable of verifying and/or understanding without premature conclusion
2. Discipline to see what is - unaltered by definitions and belief systems
3. Knowledge gained through the study of reality, society, and the work
of others
4. Accordance with the laws of nature, virtue in accordance with the
laws of the self
5. Principle formed through the understanding of this accordance

C

Philosophy

Philosophy is the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality,
and existence - as it is - with intent to understand what it is. Following
28

will include a short list of philosophies forming a foundation for vision and
principle to integrate into greater virtue, reason, and success in the form of
happiness being the ultimate value in which each individual seeks.
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.

Nicomachean Ethics

Aristotle was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist [31]. Aristotle believed that virtue was essential in achieving the ultimate goal: happiness.
As a portion of the philosophies described in his works on Nicomachean
Ethics, an idea was formed under the
name the ”golden mean” which described a world of excess and deficiency.
This philosophy described the evils of
the world - or oppositions to the growth
of life - to be either excess or deficiency.
The golden mean is described as the
quality of having neither excess or deficiency but rather a ”golden mean” between the two extremes.

Kingdom of Ends

Immanuel Kant was born ahead of his
time on the 22nd of April, 1724 in Berlin, Germany [32]. He had many
philosophies that are still studied to this day. One of his more notable
works was called the Kingdom of Ends. He describes a hypothetical existence where individuals act entirely rationally, and with reason. He defines
these people as ones capable of proper conduct. He proposed that when
those that were capable were able to live under a common law of laws that
were of the utmost importance and necessity, that a more harmonious and
moral society could form as a Kingdom of Ends.
These common laws could be considered
reference points for the value of actions
in a Kingdom of Ends, to where its correlation with universal law provides the
greatest value to those of the Kingdom
of Ends. His second formulation showed
that individuals that live in accordance
with the principle to treat ones fellowmen as end in themselves, were capable of greater virtue, and therefore, joy.
This describes an idea and philosophy of
acting in accordance and harmony with
one’s people as a kingdom of ends, rather
than each individual seeking one another
as means to their own ends.
”People can only belong to the Kingdom of Ends when they become subject to
these universal laws. Such rational beings must regard themselves simultaneously as sovereign when making laws, and as subject when obeying them.
Morality, therefore, is acting out of reverence for all universal laws which
make the Kingdom of Ends possible. In a true Kingdom of Ends, acting
virtuously will be rewarded with happiness.” 23

The Tao

In ancient China, the keeper of the Imperial Library, Lao Tzu, was famous
for his wisdom. Perceiving the growing corruption of the government, he left
for the countryside. On his way, the guard at the city gates asked Lao Tzu
to write out the essence of his understanding to benefit future generations.
Lao Tzu wrote the Tao Te Ching, left, and was never heard of again [33].
[34] Chapter 1 of the Tao Te Ching:
The ”Tao” is too great to be described
by the name ”Tao”. If it could be named
so simply, it would not be the eternal Tao.
Heaven and Earth began
from the nameless (Tao), but the multitudes
of things around us were created by names.
We desire to understand the world
by giving names to the things we see, but these
things are only the effects of something subtle.
When
we see beyond the desire to use names, we
can sense the nameless cause of these effects.
The cause
and the effects are aspects of the same, one
thing. They are both mysterious and profound.
At their most mysterious and profound
point lies the ”Gate of the Great Truth”.

People must have righteous
principles in the first, and then
they will not fail to perform
virtuous actions.

How We Make Change

The cells of our body work together to provide the capacity for life. Similarly, we can compare the cells of our planet to each individual. If we understand the benefits of cooperation, challenges can be resolved thoroughly and
quickly without unnecessary difficulties. This is how we make change; we
work together to resolve challenges with viable solutions. This is the most
efficient and effective way to bring change in the direction of our greatest
preferences.
The community is the very foundation of an economy. An economy is only
as strong as its foundation. When people loose faith in an economy, the
base of the economy will collapse and the value of its system will fall with
it. The Nexus community is already very resilient to the stress of markets.
The community is a positive and inclusive group of people from across the
world who are all aiming towards the same goals of transparency, prosperity,
and freedom.

Nexus aims to build a strong community based on a savings culture and
charity. The savings culture has been long lost but it is the best insurance
policy for any uncertain times that may lie ahead. This helps the community
hedge itself against high risk and volatile markets. The idea is that your
community member is your neighbor. If your neighbor does well, your local
economy will prosper as well.
