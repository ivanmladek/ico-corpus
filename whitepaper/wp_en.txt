Motivation
From times immemorial, people have been making bets. One of the earliest bets
known to the mankind is the one that Cleopatra and Mark Antony made. In this story,
the queen bet that she could drink wine that cost 10 million sesterces in one meal. So,
she dissolved 10 million sesterces worth of pearls into a glass of wine and drank it in a
gulp! Legend has it that this how Cleopatra won the bet.
The term eristica is derived from the Greek eristikē technē, which translates to, “the art
of winning disputes”. It is known that ancient Greeks had a very keen eye for bets. As a
matter of fact, the whole Greek mythology is steeped in the idea of a rivalry between
gods and people for a good reason.
Fast forward to the 20th century and this is when challenges and bets grew into a
commercial industry where anyone who wanted to have a bet could put his/her money
on almost any event in any city throughout the world.
So, in 1960 David Threlfall made one of the most unbelievable bets ever in history. In
one of the bookmaker’s offices in London, the Brit bet 10 pounds on an unbelievable
bet at the time that man would get to the Moon within the following 10 years! And it
did happen! 9 years later Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon and David won 10,000
pounds! He converted this fortune into a very expensive sports car but long story
short, it was all thanks to a bet!
Moreover, bets have also been known to influence culture and art around the globe.
For example, betting is the main subject in the novel “Around the World in Eighty
Days”. “The Gambler”, the novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky, was written by the author
within a month as the writer looked settle up his debts to a casino.
Hollywood celebrities have not lagged behind either. Steven Spielberg still receives
checks from George Lucas for the bet he won, when the films “Star Wars. Episode IV: A
New Hope” and “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” were released. The directors bet
on the film that will get more box office sales. Spielberg put his stake on Lucas’ film,
and Lucas, on the contrary, put it on Spielberg’s movie. As far as we know, “Star Wars”
became a real sensation. Within the first year after the release, the film got
record-breaking $740 million, which is 2.5 times more than the competitor’s gains.
This is how George Lucas lost the bet!
With the advent of the MTV era and shows such as “I bet You Will”1 and “Jackass”2, the
industry of bets was transformed. Bets were replaced by personal and group
challenges that became very popular among young people. “Jackass” for instance was
rated 68th on the top shows of past 25 years3.

Then there was the emergence of YouTube that set a new stage in the development of
challenges. Everyone could now become famous — by just performing a crazy task,
record everything on a smartphone and put the video on the Web. Videos with new
challenges get millions of views and likes, making their authors YouTube stars and
motivating new players to challenge the winners.
This is where Eristica project comes in given that it is designed to unify challenges
into one single mobile platform, where users post videos with their challenges,
challenge others and compete for top places in the overall ranking.
But, despite the huge progress, there are still problems in the industry that hinder
further development. Most notably, there is the problem of trust that hasn’t been
solved yet. This has led to the existence of intermediary guarantors, high commissions,
and complicated the procedure for creating a challenge.
Then there is the control over national currencies, legislative restrictions, the absence
of a global market which is yet another layer of problems imposed by the classical
monetary system.
Moreover, there are internal reasons for stagnation, one of them being the fact that
monetization through advertising for FunTech is the base pay. Projects are forced to
look to major advertisers, place aggressive advertising and sell the user base, which is
negatively perceived by the community.
Well, Eristica project intends to resolve the mentioned issues with the help of
blockchain technology and smart contracts. This way, Eristica will create a new
direction for development and it will be able to spearhead the evolutionary
breakthrough in the FunTech industry.

The project
concept
Eristica is a revolutionary P2P-platform that drives participation in challenges and
online competitions. The project was launched in 2015 and has already got more than
1.2 million users.
The platform enables each participant to launch and accept challenges, provide video
footage of challenges completed and get ratings based on the results.
Eristica users are also allowed to generate viral content with the videos of challenges
getting millions of views on YouTube, and the winners becoming stars. The system of
rating, reputation and ranking creates a powerful incentive for active participation.
Competitive incentive makes players fight for top places in the rating, in the quest for
fame and prizes.
With the help of blockchain technology, the Eristica project intends to overcome the
obstacles faced by the industry and create a single ecosystem for both offline and
online competitions.
Tokenization of the platform’s economy will offer the opportunity to get a reward for
winning challenges, receive virtual reward from successful predictions and buy access
to all services of the platform.
Eristica is a universal platform, where each member of the community benefits from
the synergy created within the ecosystem.

Unification
The users of Eristica will get the opportunity to create completely different types of
challenges, including competitions in online games, offline bets4, as well as mass
competitions, which is a unique advantage of the project.
One other great feature of the platform is the freedom afforded to users when it comes
to choosing the number of participants and members. There may be one-vs-one,
one-vs-many and mass competitions.
At the heart of this project is the ability to digitize the industry coupled with
democratization and unification of all business processes in the platform. The platform
brings offline challenges to online with the help of a user-friendly interface.
Challenges will be created according to a set of uniform rules while the terms of the
bet will be confirmed in a smart contract and executed automatically.
Wherever
. the term 'Bet' is used in the this White Paper the term 'Challenge' is meant ('bet' = 'challenge'). There are no connections to
casinos, money bets or gambling.

Democratization will make the industry affordable to everyone. With a single click, one
will be able to challenge thousands of participants to compete or guess the winner of
the current challenge and get rewards for it. In other words, Eristica’s ecosystem
allows everyone to pick a suitable level of participation depending on preferences.

Benefits
Financial indicators and fees in the industry of Bets and Challenges are not uniform
and sometimes the disparity can be exorbitant. Bets are usually subject to bookmaker
or intermediator firms meaning that the fees can rise up to 20%.
For example, platforms with challenges among young people charge a 10% fee while
online and eSports competitions charge 5-10%.
That said, Eristica sets a single bet for all types of bets, challenges, and competitions,
that is 3%. This is bound to become a standard in the industry and create a flow of
customers from more expensive platforms.

Synergy
Eristica will also create a platform where different types of people can interact with
each other thus creating a level of synergy in the process. The young demographic
who perhaps have never dealt with crypto-currency before, will get an opportunity to
try the products and services in the crypto-industry. This will create a new inflow of
users and speed up the process of introducing crypto-currency into the masses.
Everybody is thus expected to benefit from this paradigm. The creators of
crypto-projects get access to a new active audience, independent developers get the
platform, where they can implement their ideas. The community of Eristica, on the
other hand, will have an opportunity to get a rewarded for activity and contribution to
the development of the project.

Community
A young audience demographic is one of the attractive aspects of the Eristica project.
About 64% of the 1.2 million user base are young people between 13-25 years old
which are interested in video, challenges and entertainment. This audience watches an
average of 20 hours of video on their smartphones per week, which is 50% more than
for the average internet user. Active users log in to the application 4 times per day on
average. What’s even amazing is that the average session duration is at 13 minutes,
which is a pretty high in the industry.
At the current stage of development, the project expansion covers mainly the region of
Southeast Asia and India where we target the same demographics of people between
13-35 years with the same area of interests. Starting with 2018, local manufacturers
will pre-install the Eristica app on new smartphones. Potential growth from the
cooperation targets around 500,000 new users in the first quarter of 2018.
The Eristica project is the gateway to the world of the crypto-industry for the
ever-growing community-minded and committed project audience. Eristica intends to
democratize the existing challenge industry and make the new crypto experience
seamless for both new and existing users.

FunTech
market
Penetration of the internet technology in the entertainment industry created a new
market called FunTech, similarly to FinTech (Financial Technologies) or BioTech
(Biological Technologies). This market became one of the largest and the fastest
growing industry on the Internet. The audience of YouTube stands at over 1.5 billion
registered users and still growing each passing day. On average, users spend 40
minutes a day watching YouTube videos5.
No wonder YouTube became the medium, where mass challenges turned into a truly
global phenomenon. Most Internet users remember the globe-spanning Gangnam
Style6 hype in 2012. This was inspired by Psy’s music video that was the first video clip
in the history to hit 1 billion and later 2 billion views. This triggered the wave of
Gangnam Style Challenge with over 2 million videos featuring parodies, contests, and
competitions dedicated to the famous dance.
After that, the phenomenon of video challenges became even more popular. In 2013,
Harlem Shake Challenge7 became super popular. To date, more than 9.9 million video
challenges have been uploaded on YouTube, and this number continues to increase.
In 2014, ALS Ice Bucket Challenge became extremely popular around the globe. The
current US President Donald Trump8 was one of those who accepted this challenge
among many other personalities. Hillary Clinton is another popular figure who has
been involved in a popular challenge in what was known as the Mannequin
Challenge9.

Further growth of the market will be promoted by an increase in the number of
smartphone users. Nowadays, about 70% of the views on YouTube originate from
mobile devices. Besides, the increase in population and the expansion of the Internet
access network can be considered as a key factor that will propel this industry into
greater heights.
Viral videos with Challenges have become a part of modern culture and the Eristica
project is using this as a yardstick. Having entered the market in 2015, Eristica has
already seen significant growth in the market keeping in mind that the project is still
in the early phases of development.
By introducing technological innovation into the industry, by means of
decentralization and tokenization of processes, Eristica simplifies interaction among
participants, making the challenge process gamified, transparent and super exciting!

Eristica
overview
The project was started as an idea in 2014. It was at the time, when Nikita Akimov, the
founder of Eristica, began working on the prototype of the application, forming the
team and experimenting in the search for the best way to interact with the challenge
community.
In 2015, the first public version of the Eristica application became available for
download on Google Play and iTunes.
In August 2016, the project took part in the startup competition held by Winter Capital
venture fund and the McKinsey & Company consulting company. The Eristica team
shared the first place with two other projects, winning the prize of $75,000. This was
the first major recognition of the project.This is the same year that the project started
growing in popularity reaching 500,000 users.
At the beginning of 2017, the Eristica team focused on rapidly developing region of
Southeast Asia and India which is known for high demand for local entertainment
content. That was one of the reasons why Eristica was invited to participate in the
acceleration program of the startup Mobile Only Accelerator (MOX)11, managed by the
SOSV12 fund.
This market became both an opportunity and a technological challenge for Eristica.
The application was rebuild to work in the area with low speed Internet:
●
●
●

The size of the application was reduced to 7mb
Phone RAM consumption was decreased
Eristica app was optimized work in zone of 2G internet

In the middle of 2017, the project team successfully completed the program in SOSV
accelerator, which is one of the largest venture capital fund in the world. SOSV fund
ranks first in “Investments in the early stages” rating13, ahead of other top giants like
YCombinator and 500 Startups.
SOSV helped to get deals with major electronics manufacturers (OEMs) concerning
pre-installing the Eristica application on new smartphones sold countries like India,
Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Russia.

The Eristica
cryptocurrency
Purpose and characterization
The main mission of the Eristica project is to create a full-fledged crypto-economy in
the digital entertainment space where tokens are the main tool for all interactions
within the digital ecosystem. Eristica intends to use crypto to make the
democratization of challenges economy, including creation, participation and rewards
for challenges more efficient, fair and affordable.
Eristica utility tokens14 (ticker: ERT) will enable users to participate in bets even with
celebrities, get rewards for winning challenges and successful predictions. And also
buy access to platform services.
ERC2015 standard tokens will be issued on the basis of the Ethereum16 blockchain.
Eristica choosed Ethereum as the most technologically advanced blockchain for smart
contracts development. As a matter of fact, the Eristica token will be a cryptocurrency
with limited issuance, stable to inflation. The token can be divided into fractions.
Besides, it is interchangeable and transferable.

Building fundamental value
Estimates and predictions of Eristica are based on Metcalfe’s17 law, which states that:
“The utility of the network is proportional to the square of the number of users of this
network ≈n2.”
1.2 million users of the platform will add value to Eristica tokens. Moreover, the
constant exponential growth already seen plus the pre-installation of the application
on new smartphones will certainly contribute to the further growth of the user base
and, consequently, the increase in the value of the token.
The increasing number of users has an impact on the amount of Challenges
undertaken on the platform. Given that Eristica incentivises users to be active on the
platform, this, in turn, will increase the demand for Eristica tokens.
According to our statistics, one user creates 2 Challenges on average. Since the tokens
supply is limited and tokens are used for a prize fund and for commission fee
payments, its value is expected to increase.

Integration with third-party services and engaging partners in the project will also
contribute to the growth of the project ecosystem, and thereby, make the platform
even more attractive to users.

Ethereum settlement layer
Users who want to transfer or withdraw their tokens from the platform can do this by
interacting with the Ethereum network. With the help of any wallet supporting ERC 20
standard, it will be possible to route Eristica tokens out of the platform.
The current capacity of Ethereum is approximately 15 transactions per second18. This
is not enough for all increasing network demands. Occasionally, the Ethereum network
undergoes overloads and long delays in transactions.
In the context of a comfortable user experience, it is undesirable to use an on-chain
solution within the Eristica system. That’s why a hybrid off-chain solution to the
Ethereum scalability problem will be created for operations inside the system.
This will enable an earlier version of the system to perform instant transactions
without fees, wrap in complex functions and data, as well as provide a unified API to
all partners engaged in digital services within the platform. Technical Paper covering
those issues is coming up soon.
With the development of Ethereum blockchain technologies and the introduction of
solutions that increase the network capacity then transferring these functions to a
completely decentralized medium will become possible.

Digital economy
Wallet
The wallet is a basic and an on-demand service
for the use of cryptocurrency, which will be
implemented in every account on the platform.
The wallet features will allow users to transfer,
withdraw and receive tokens. The intuitive
interface shows the transaction history made
through Challenges.
Integration of the wallet in the accounts of more
than 1,200,000 users of Eristica is expected to
make it one of the mass mobile cryptocurrency
wallets in the world. Wallet API will be chosen
from well-known 3d party developers based on
various criteria, such as: security, functionality,
scalability and supported currencies.
Cryptocurrency has been known to be quite
complex and one of the Eristica goals is to
simplify the experience for the mass user.
This is an ambitious goal that drives the Eristica
project keeping in mind that the audience of the
project comprises of active millennials and
teenagers who are the future users of
cryptocurrencies and services based on the
blockchain.

Example of the future Eristica wallet. Options:
transfer, withdraw, transaction history and
recommendations based on the previous
actions.

The Eristica crypto-wallet is thus first step in
acquaintance with the new world of blockchain
for the audience of the project.

Eristica Game API
Initially, Game API was intended to be an experiment based on observations and
analysis of the actions of the platform’s gaming audience. Gamers made challenges
concerning the one who would score more points or who would complete the level
with the best result. Interest in such bets began after the emergence of popular game,
Flappy Bird.
The problem was the fact that the Eristica services weren’t integrated into this games,
so the gamers had to send screenshots as evidence in their challenges. Game
developers noted positives of these challenges in terms of increasing the average
duration of the gaming session, as well as in the viral effect, where users went on to
recommend the game to their friends.
On this basis, Eristica started working on a Game API. This is a simple and easy-to-use
software interface will make it possible to integrate Eristica services into games on
various platforms. Gamers can win Eristica tokens in challenges with friends and spend
them on in-game purchases inside the game right after that. Circulation of tokens will
run through both the Eristica platform itself and the partner applications with
economic links, thus, forming a strong and lively ecosystem.
First of all, Eristica will look at creating an SDK for the most popular game
development platforms, such as Unity3D Engine19 and Unreal Engine20. The SDK will
allow building of a wallet and services both in the existing and in the future games
developed on these platforms. The development will be available on Github in the
open-source format. Full deployment is expected in Q3 2018.

Example use case:
challenges and predictions
Eristica services enable users to challenge each
other and further development of these services
will enable the audience to create customized
groups that will be challenged.
It will be possible to create mass challenges that
coincide with special dates or time of day. By
combining offline and online competition into
one smart contract, users will receive the full
range of tools to create any bet or challenge.
Eristica tokens will become universal cash for
creating challenges, prize funds and rewards for
the winners. The Eristica project will charge a
3% fee from each bet. The fee will be paid in
ERT tokens.
The tokens received in the form of fees will be
brought to the project pool, where they can be
repurchased by users through the personal
account. Thus, the community of the project will
have the opportunity to buy tokens, without the
need for delving into third-party exchanges.

Example use case:
decentralized governance
Decentralized voting will make it possible to
find out the community’s opinion on all
important issues transparently and quickly, as
well as select representatives of user groups
and resolve disputable situations.
The request for voting will be sent to the user’s
feed. And, depending on the importance of the
subject, it will encourage the user to make a
choice. When voting on important issues, users
will receive tokens as a reward for participation.
The anonymity of voting will help avoid the
pressure of the majority. The transparency of the
calculation will guarantee a fair result. A smart
content filter will remove voting that isn’t
relevant to the user without padding the user
with queries.
With the help of decentralized voting, users will
be able to have an influence on solving
disputable situations when determining winners
in a challenge. In case of disputable situations, a
video with the challenge will be sent to the
users’ feed, where everyone can vote whether a
challenge was completed or not.

Example of voting request in user’s feed.
Whether the evidence provided by the
proof-video is enough for winning the
Challenge?

On the Eristica platform, videos are one of the main sources of proving that the
challenge was complete. With the introduction of blockchain technology, the
authenticity of the video shot on the smartphone will be guaranteed. The hash21 of the
video along with the timestamp will be kept in the blockchain, where everyone will be
able to check out the authenticity and timing of the video recording. Thus, the
community will be assured of the evidence presented.

Challenges to star bloggers have become a new
popular trend on YouTube. Often the bloggers
themselves encourage viewers to challenge them.
Eristica provides a ready-made and reliable
platform, where bloggers can create challenges for
their subscribers and accept challenges of other
bloggers.
ERT tokens will provide the opportunity to
monetize the event at a new level. The fee
received from the event will motivate bloggers to
engage their audience in participation in the event.
Also, rewarding the winners with Eristica tokens
will spark interests from the viewers.

Example of a Star Blogger account screen.
Options: the current and finished challenges,
achievements, etc.

Example use case:
brand challenges
Well-known brands will be able to interact with the
community in a new way. It means that by creating
their own challenges and rewarding participants
with Eristica tokens, brands will be able to work
with the audience at a new level.
The recent success of the Burger King22 offer (they
gave tokens as a reward to all buyers) showed the
real potential in a new kind of interaction based on
the tokenization of the economy.
An example of a Popular Brand Challenge.
The player must eat 5 burgers at a time to
receive the 350 ERT reward.

Eristica Challenge
Foundation
Development goals
The blockchain industry is based on the digital promotion of economic agents.
Whether it’s a reward to a miner for the found Bitcoin block23 or encouraging authors
inside the decentralized Steemit24 blog platform, it all creates a powerful engagement
mechanism.
Using the experience of the industry, the Eristica project will create its own Challenge
foundation aimed at the promotion, adaptation, and growth of the platform ecosystem.
The rewarding mechanism promoted by the foundation will become a natural
incentive for digital service providers to join the Eristica ecosystem. The network effect
of Eristica will grow with each new partner joining the system. Thus, the value of the
ecosystem for users and network partners will increase.
This is why Eristica is using the experience of the industry and creating its own
Challenge foundation aimed at the promotion, adaptation, and growth of the platform
ecosystem. In addition to providing general ethics, the legitimacy of content and
transactions, the ecosystem won’t impose unnecessary restrictions, which should
create an attractive image of the platform.

Financing and activities
10% of all the issued tokens will be reserved for activities of Challenge Foundation. In
the future, some of the tokens received from the fees will be re-invested in Challenge
Foundation as well. Thus, Foundation will have its own source of funding.
The activities of Foundation will be aimed at periodic distribution to reward active
users, opinion leaders, well-known bloggers, and of course, third-party developers
providing additional services within the ecosystem. The amount of remuneration will
be proportional to the contribution to the economy of the project. At the same time,
the payment will gradually decrease as the total value of the currency grows.
Challenge Foundation will ensure an equitable distribution of rewards using an
impersonal, result-oriented methodology based on a formula with the following
variables such as: user's activity, time spent on the platform, retention, number of
challenges, upvotes, video uploads, referrals and many more factors.

The total number of tokens is strictly limited by the initial issue. Therefore, a
deflationary economic model has been created within the framework of the platform.
It provides an increase in the value of tokens over time.
Tokens paid as fees for using the services of the platform will be kept as the project
cash reserve. Users will be able to buy tokens from the reserve at a fixed price
depending on the increasing value of the token.
Purchase of tokens will be available from the user’s personal account. Users can pay
with bank cards, local payments or cryptocurrency. Thus, a powerful flow of exchange
of Eristica tokens for classical local money will be created. This will, in turn, support
the value and circulation of tokens in the crypto-economy of the project.

Project Budget
The fund raised in the course of ICO activity will be fully and completely used for the
development of the Eristica platform. Depending on the volume of funds raised, a
specific scheme for the allocation of the fund will be chosen.
Eristica intends to become a pioneer in the field of peer-to-peer challenges using
smart contract technology and blockchain. The achieved success and the over a
million strong user base indicates the feasibility of this idea. However, further
development requires tremendous effort and top draw R&D (Research and
Development) cycles.
Taking into account the volatility of cryptocurrency rate, up to 40% of the resources of
the foundation will be hedged using the USD/EUR fiduciary currency, in order to
ensure full functionality of the project for 18 months.
The figure below presents a budget scenario where the amount of raised funds is
$5.000.000. For KPIs and more details please see the Roadmap section below.

Cryptocurrency adoption
among mass audience
The first active users of cryptocurrency were professionals in the field of IT and
cryptography. Initially, mining of bitcoins wasn’t profitable. It was more like a guiding
light, a starting point for an acquaintance of all newcomers with new technology.
Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, came to the world of blockchain through
mining. Due to its open architecture, anyone could figure out the code and launch
his/her own version of the blockchain or create an application using blockchain
technologies.
The Eristica project considers the promotion of the crypto-economy among young
people to be one of its main goals. The project is thus looking to bring in millions of
young users to the crypto world.
The first won tokens will be a new starting point for the future generation of
crypto-enthusiasts. And you never can tell, some of them may end up being future
founders of projects like Ethereum!

«For the first time I got in touch with the blockchain
industry six years ago, and my experience was very
simple. I entered the Internet, earned twenty
Bitcoins, and then spent eight and a half of them to
buy a shirt. Now these Bitcoins cost $20 thousand.
The shirt, unfortunately, was lost somewhere on a
train in London.»

Conclusion
The Eristica project has been spearheading innovation in the realm of challenges since
2015 and has already earned the trust of more than a million users. The exponential
growth of the platform is a clear indicator of the virality of content created by users
plus the fact that videos with challenges are getting millions of views and encouraging
new users to participate.
The FunTech industry is on the threshold of a new evolutionary breakthrough. While
many market participants are still at the stage of comprehension of all those new
opportunities that will be brought by blockchain and tokenization of the economy,
Eristica intends to become a pioneer in creating a single platform for offline and
online challenges.
The ecosystem of the platform will enable providers, developers, online services and
community of the project to interact with each other through Eristica utility tokens.
Using an API, third-party game developers will get the opportunity to implement
Eristica services in their products. Thus, the project will combine both classic offline
challenges and online eSports competitions. Even a simple mobile game will be easily
turned into a platform for mass competitions.
Users of the platform will be able to personally participate in online and offline
challenges, make bets with famous bloggers, receive virtual rewards for successful
predictions of the results of challenges. Moreover, they will be able to actively interact
with third-party services and the services of a developed platform ecosystem.
Tokens will become a universal currency approved for payment both within the
ecosystem and by the partners of the project. The ability to purchase tokens within the
application will create a stable demand for tokens, which will positively influence the
liquidity and growth of the value of the token. To increase the liquidity of the token,
Eristica will work hard on listing tokens at the largest exchanges.
