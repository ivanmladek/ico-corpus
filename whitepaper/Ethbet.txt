Abstract
Ethbet is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, and provably-fair Ethereum-based dicing game without a
mandatory house edge. Ethbet is able to offer bets without a house edge because players bet directly
against other players instead of against a centralized house. The disadvantage of this is that in order to
place a bet, there must be another party willing to place the same bet. For this reason it is possible that
a player must wait for their desired bet to take place, especially if it is very large. To combat this, an
additional feature of an optional player-defined house edge is added, allowing players to offer and take
(‘call’) bets with any house edge that they desire. Thus, a player that prioritizes speed over their
expected return can agree to a bet that gives him a slight disadvantage (i.e., a bet that gives his
opponent a small house edge). Similarly, a player that is patient and prioritizes their expected return can
offer bets that the formerly mentioned player may choose to call. This results in a model where players
are effectively able to become their own casinos, allowing market forces to provide players with bets as
quickly as possible at the best possible rates. The Ethbet protocol features an efficient off-chain
matchmaking relay in order to allow players to quickly and cheaply communicate their intent. The
protocol can also be extended to support betting using any Ethereum-based (ERC20) token and for use
with other games.

Gambling Without a House Edge
A house edge is a statistical bias in favor of the house, so that the house has a slight advantage in every
bet. House edges of various games found in physical casinos often range from 2% to 15%, with some
games having a low house edge (such as craps) and other games having a higher house edge (such as
slot machines). With the advent of online gambling using cryptocurrencies, various websites offer
players relatively lower house edges, such as 1%. Although 1% sounds like a low house edge, one must
keep in mind that this house edge is applied to every individual bet. Thus, if a player only places one
bet, they are expected to lose 1% of it, on average. But it’s likely that most players will want to bet
more than just once. If a player places 100 bets, they are expected to lose 1% of each of those 100 bets,
making it increasingly difficult for the player to turn a profit, inevitably leading to gambler’s ruin (the
player running out of funds). This is how dice sites are able to consistently generate steady streams of
profit for their owners and investors – they slowly but surely make sure that the more people play, the
more likely they are to lose all of their money to the house.
Betting without a house edge saves players much more than a trivial amount. Because a player’s
expected loss can be zero for every bet they make, they can now make hundreds or thousands of bets
without statistically being likely to lose more and more of their money over time. With a house edge of

3

0%, a player’s probability of gaining capital is equal to their probability of losing it – they are no longer
making an inherently irrational decision with a negative expected gain.

Provable Fairness
Most modern cryptocurrency dicing sites offer provably-fair betting. This is done by having a client
seed and a server seed. The client seed is picked by the client, often generated randomly by default. The
server seed is picked by the server. The server then hashes its server seed using a secure cryptographic
hash function (such as a sha2 or sha3 function) and provides the hash to the client before their roll.
Then the client submits their client seed and bet information to the server, and the server combines both
seeds, using a public algorithm to generate a random number. After the roll has been made, the client is
able to view the server seed that was used, and can confirm that the server did not modify the client
seed or the server seed, and therefore also the result of the roll. This results in a roll that is
mathematically impossible to bias or otherwise predict by either party, given basic assumptions
including that the client does not use a predictable seed, and that the hash function used is secure.
Although this model of provable fairness is suitable for a client-server model, it cannot be performed in
a smart contract, as the blockchain is public information and no fully-unbiased source of entropy exists.
Most solutions put fourth to securely generate a random number on the Ethereum blockchain pose
significant downsides, as there are too many actors that are able to influence the blockchain when
money is at stake. For example, if the hash of the next Ethereum block was used as a source of
randomness, then a miner can choose to modify a block before they publish it, or can decide against
publishing a block altogether, depending on if it is favorable to them. Given that there have already
been notable instances of miners acting selfishly in a way that hurts other users, this is not an
acceptable solution.
RANDAO1 attempts to solve the problem of untrustable miners by effectively crowd-sourcing entropy.
Anyone who wants to participate in RANDAO may contribute to its pool of entropy, and is
incentivized to do so as they are paid a small reward, which RANDAO in turn collects from those that
call its contract. It would take every participant to collude with one another in order to manipulate the
result2. Unfortunately it takes a wait time of several blocks for RANDAO to be statistically confident
that a miner has not manipulated its pool of entropy. RANDAO is also limited in the amount of entropy
that it can provide per unit of time, and potentially per unit of ether.
A similar algorithm called the Signidice3 algorithm is being used by early versions of DAO.Casino4, a
blockchain protocol designed for provably-fair gambling. Although sound from a statistical and gametheoretic point of view, this algorithm is computationally expensive, relatively complex, and has been
4

used less frequently in production settings. This RNG method is best implemented in a separate smart
contract that has a large amount of participants that are unable to collude among each other. Due to the
complexity and amount of risks involved with this algorithm, we have chosen not to adopt it.
One solution which is used by Etheroll5 and others is to use Oraclize6 and random.org7 to generate a
random number. Oraclize is a service that fetches external (outside of the blockchain) data for use on
the blockchain. Oraclize makes a call to random.org, returning the integer roll from random.org, the id
associated with it, and a TLSNotary proof8, showing that Oraclize did not modify the result. As the id
associated with the bet (returned from random.org) is supplied as well, it can be shown that Oraclize
only made one call to random.org for every call it was requested to make. This solution has two
downsides, the first being that it introduces a liability of depending on Oraclize, which is not desired.
The second is that random.org must be trusted to provide a secure random number. This solution is
currently implemented in at least one decentralized dicing game due to the lack of appealing and
efficient alternatives. Performing statistical analysis on the results that have been returned from
Oraclize via random.org, it appears that this solution has thus far succeeded (with high probability) in
its goal of providing a source of entropy that is unbiased. Although the previously mentioned issue of a
miner choosing not to publish a block if it would result in a RNG output that is detrimental to them reoccurs in this scenario (with Oraclize instead of the miner, however), a single instance of this occurring
could be detected as there would be a gap in the integer IDs returned from random.org. If,
hypothetically, Oraclize attempted to game this system, it could only be done once before it ceases to
work (as they would no longer be trusted afterwards).
An additional solution is currently being tested by Oraclize9. This solution involves a hardware random
data source that is integrated with the Ethereum network. The random bytes generated by the data
source are periodically published onto the Ethereum network along with a proof that they have not been
modified. Although fully functional, it is currently only available on the testnet. When available on the
mainnet, this will likely become the best option to use for Ethbet’s source of randomness. Until that
period, the aforementioned solution that has an additional liability of random.org is scheduled to be
used for Ethbet.

The Optional Player-Defined House Edge
Placing bets with a house edge of 0% does not come without a disadvantage, i.e., a bet can only take
place if there are two parties that wish to make it. As bets are significantly more advantageous for
players when made with a 0% (or otherwise negligible) house edge, network effects may cause the
majority of players to use Ethbet, as it will be more profitable than other betting alternatives. Even with
this, however, it may be possible that players are not content with the amount of time they have to wait
5

between bets, especially for larger bets, which fewer players are willing to call. To solve this problem,
an optional feature is added: allow players to offer and call bets with a player-defined house edge.
With the ability for players to offer and call bets with an arbitrary player-defined house edge, the
problem of large wait times for bets can now be solved with negligible downsides. Players are
effectively able to become their own casinos within Ethbet, setting their own house edge. As every
player that offers bets is competing against other players to have their bets taken, they are incentivized
to set their house edge as low as possible.
For example, if a player wants to make a very large bet, they may be incentivized to offer a house edge
to whoever calls the bet, so that they do not have to wait too long for someone to bet against them. This
player decides to prioritize speed over their proportional expected gain.
Similarly, if a player has a large amount of ETH and wishes to make a profit over time with it (with
high or variable probability), they can offer bets with a small house edge in their favor, making it easier
for others to play the game while giving them a small profit over time for their service. This player is
providing ‘bet liquidity’ to Ethbet by acting as their own casino, and in return is rewarded with a house
edge in their favor.

Market Potential
The global online gambling market is estimated to be worth over $50 billion USD by the end of 201710
and is forecast to grow by around 10% for years to come11. With the advent of cryptocurrencies,
allowing players to gamble with ease and with a lower house edge than previous options,
cryptocurrency gambling has already garnered a significant proportion of this market potential. A 2013
estimate suggests that up to 50-60% of all bitcoin transactions were related to gambling at one point12.
Although previously dominated by Bitcoin, Ethereum has become a major player within the
cryptocurrency world, offering significantly more features as well as a shorter block time and lower
transaction fees. As Ethereum gains more users it benefits from network effects, which are currently
leading many users to invest in and use Ethereum over Bitcoin, leading its market cap to increase to
$38 billion USD in June, 201713. Although it is already possible to gamble using Ethereum, even via a
smart contract14, players are still faced against a house of 1% or more, which is significantly
detrimental even to casual players, as mentioned above.
Given that Ethbet will be able to provide the most competitive house edge that the market allows for,
there is a strong possibility that it will acquire a significant proportion of the cryptocurrency gambling
market share, as there is no reason for a user to gamble against a house edge of 1% or higher when they
6

can instead gamble with house edges significantly lower, or possibly zero. Ethbet can allow users to bet
any amount that is technically possible, using any house edge that they desire, potentially deprecating
all other forms of gambling for users that wish to maximize their expected value.
Bitcoin dicing sites such as PrimeDice and SatoshiDice (among many others) have reported profits of
millions of dollars, with SatoshiDice selling for 126,315 BTC in 2013, which was ‘only’ $11.47 million
USD at the time15. Ethbet has significant advantages over these platforms, including that it is
decentralized, transparent, peer-to-peer, uses Ether over Bitcoin, and, crucially, provides the lowest
possible house edge. For the aforementioned reasons, the market potential of a platform such as Ethbet
is extremely large.

Profit Model
The profit model of Ethbet has several aspects which cause Ethbet tokens to appreciate in value:
The Ethbet smart contract will take a small portion of the house edge that is offered by players. This
only occurs for bets with a nonzero house edge. As an example, suppose that a player offers a bet of 1
ETH with a house edge of 1% in their favor. This player’s expected gain would normally be 0.01 ETH.
If the Ethbet smart contract were to take a 10% cut of their expected gain, this would change their
expected gain to 0.009 ETH. Thus the player would win a total of 1.009 ETH instead of 1.01 ETH,
decreasing their profit by slightly less than 0.1%, or less than 1/1000th. The portion of the house edge
that Ethbet takes is decided by token holders. This house edge can then be converted to EBET by smart
contract so that the value of EBET tokens increases. This could be done via an external protocol such
as 0x, or by an Ethbet smart contract.
In addition to this, it’s possible for Ethbet to charge a small fee on top of bets. Because Ethbet is not the
house and is instead a matchmaking platform, this fee does not need to be high like in other dicing
platforms. No matter how low this fee is, it is raw profit for Ethbet, as Ethbet has no funds at risk
during play. This value will be able to be decided by token holders. Profit from this is also converted
into EBET tokens, increasing their demand as a consequence.
Although token holders can vote on these values, they are incentivized not to set these values to be
unreasonable, or less users would use Ethbet, and the value of their tokens would decrease. For
example, token holders would never vote to charge a fee higher than alternative dicing platforms offer,
or the platform would be unable to compete with them. Thus we are able to leverage wisdom of the
crowds in order to effectively optimize the profitability and competitiveness of the Ethbet platform.

Ethbet Tokens (EBET)
For the purposes of decentralization, enforcing beneficial market incentives, decentralized governance,
further developmental funding, and future endeavors of Ethbet, an Ethbet token (EBET) will be created
on top of the Ethereum network. This will be a standard ERC20 token, and thus will be secure, easy to
store, use, and trade, as wallets and exchanges already have the needed technical infrastructure to
interface with tokens that implement the ERC20 interface. For the technical details of the ERC20
specification, see the EIP on Github16.
The Ethbet token will be used as currency for the Ethbet platform and protocol. In order to provide
incentives to run Ethbet relays as described later in this paper, a small fee is charged for the service of
matchmaking. This fee is dynamic and fluctuates based off of the bet liquidity of the platform. For
example, if few users are offering bets, the fee can be low or even negative, compared to a higher fee
when many users are offering bets. The profit that Ethbet smart contracts generate that is not in EBET
can be converted to EBET by having the smart contract purchase it, either via a third party smart
contract such as 0x or via an Ethbet smart contract. This buy-back feature allows the price of EBET to
appreciate as the platform becomes more widely used. In addition to this, it is possible for token
holders to vote on a burn rate that can be used by Ethbet. A burn rate would cause the smart contract to
destroy a small portion of EBET that are used, causing the currency to become deflationary.
In addition to this functionality, token holders are eligible to vote on Ethbet Improvement Proposals
(Ethbet IPs). An Ethbet IP is a proposed change to Ethbet, such as modifying the fees that Ethbet
charges. Rather than having a single entity decide on this proposal, the proposal will be voted on by
those who hold Ethbet tokens, with their voting weight being linearly proportional to the amount of
tokens that they hold. This way the holders of EBET are able to optimize Ethbet in the direction that
they see most desirable.

Crowdsale
Those wishing to invest in Ethbet via purchasing Ethbet tokens will have the opportunity to do so via
the Ethbet crowdsale. The funds received from the crowdsale go to fund the further development of
Ethbet, including third-party contract security audits and further web/application development. The
crowdsale will last for 4 weeks and is set to begin on September 17th, 2017, 8:00 PM UTC. All
information relevant to the crowdsale is available in the below table.

The intended funding allocation from the proceeds of the crowdsale will depend largely on the amount
of tokens purchased. With a low amount of funding, the project will be able to fully fund necessary
operations such as smart contract development, user experience development (interfaces to interact
with the smart contracts, written primarily in JS and HTML), and security audits of all critical
infrastructure including smart contracts.
With larger amounts of funding, more ambitious goals can be set. These goals include funding large
advertisement campaigns to promote Ethbet, decreasing the barrier to entry for Ethbet by promoting
additional efforts towards user experience and ease of use, overcoming legal barriers to more
widespread adoption, and additional projects involving other types of gambling and games on the
blockchain. As we cannot anticipate how many tokens will be sold or account for future unknown
values, we cannot yet provide information showing exactly what proportion of funds will be allocated
to which of these goals.
The maximum possible tokens supply is 10,000,000 EBET. Of those, up to 75% (7,500,000) can be
purchased during the crowdsale. If all of these were purchased on the first day of the crowdsale (+50%
tokens), that would make the theoretical maximum possible funding 7,500,000 / 1,500 = 5,000 ETH,
ensuring that there is no possibility the project is significantly over-funded. For more information about

Project Architecture
The structure of the Ethbet code is intended to be highly modularized, clean, and secure, with the full
project functionality being split into several smart contracts based off of the principles of high cohesion
and low coupling (where applicable). The contract for the crowdsale is separate from the contract for
the token, the contract for the game, and others. All contracts will be audited and tested extensively,
ensuring that best practices are followed and no major bugs exist.
The first implementation of the Ethbet dice game will be relatively lightweight and is intended as a
fully-functioning proof of concept. There are only three types of calls that can be made into the game
contract: place_bet, call_bet, and cancel_bet (that the player previously placed, but that has not been
called by another player). A bet is composed of several variables: the bet ID, the address of the player
placing or calling, the bet amount, and the house edge.
The ability to decide the probability of winning a given bet (such as the ability of a user to set the ‘roll
under’ or ‘role over’ values before their roll) will not be available in the initial version of Ethbet.
Instead, the win and loss chance will be set to a static value of 50%. This is done for several reasons:
• The original implementation should be as lightweight as possible to encourage a small codebase
and fewer potential bugs.
• The user experience should be as smooth and simple as possible, to decrease the overhead
involved when users use the Ethbet platform.
• The market will likely have an easier time providing all types of players with a desirable
selection of available bets if all bets have the same risk/reward ratio.
• Users are still able to manage their risk profile in an arbitrary fashion; they must instead make
several bets with potentially differing amounts if they desire a certain ratio of risk to reward. In
practice this causes the risk and reward ratio to be equivalent to one found in a variableprobability bet17.
With that said, there is no reason why this feature cannot be implemented in some manner if the token
holders are in favor of it.

Off-Chain Matchmaking
When information is stored on the blockchain, a fee must be paid (referred to as gas) in order to
provide an incentive for miners to include the information in the blocks that they mine. The more
10

information that one wishes to store on the blockchain, the higher the fees will be. As the blockchain is
immutable and must be stored by all full nodes, storing information on the blockchain is generally a
costly transaction, and should be avoided if possible. The blockchain is secure and decentralized, but at
the cost of extreme redundancy. For this reason, the blockchain is only needed when we desire a secure,
decentralized, and immutable environment.
Offering and canceling bets on the blockchain is highly inefficient: if a player wishes to offer many
bets and then cancel them, they will pay high gas fees to have that information stored on the blockchain
forever, even if the bets are never actually executed. A solution to this is to match bets off of the
blockchain, and then have players confirm and execute their bets by submitting them via a smart
contract.
This is a common system used by decentralized exchanges so that every order placement and
cancellation does not need to be stored on the blockchain, and instead the blockchain is only used
where its advantages of security and immutability are highly relevant, i.e. for the actual transaction.
One example of an off-chain matchmaking system is used by the decentralized exchange protocol 0x18,
where anyone is able to set up a ‘relay’ that allows for efficient communication of intent between
exchange users. Users are incentivized to set up honest relays through a fee structure that allows them
to profit off of providing this valuable service. Another example is the decentralized exchange known
as EtherDelta19, which hosts their own service that allows for this.
A system similar to this can be implemented within Ethbet: We can have a service that acts as a relay
and functions separate from the blockchain which allows users to signal their intent. After a match can
be found between the intent of two users, both users can submit their bet to a smart contract, which
ensures that their bet is executed fairly and securely. This matchmaking service can be hosted by
anyone as the code will be open-source. An official version of the service will be provided even though
there is no obligation to use it or to use a matchmaking service at all.
This system offers a significant number of improvements over a more naive implementation in which
all information is exchanged only via the blockchain. Aside from the significant reduction in fees for
users, it allows bets to be communicated significantly more quickly and makes it much easier for users
to cancel their bets safely. Instead of placing and canceling a bet by broadcasting and storing two pieces
of information in the blockchain, a bet can be placed and canceled instantly and with zero fees by
signaling intent and then revoking this intent afterwards.

The Ethbet Protocol
The Ethbet protocol is a description of what information users need to relay to each other in order to
signal their intent to bet assets. This protocol is open, meaning that it can be implemented and executed
by any actor. There is no need to use a specific website, browser, or even medium of communication, as
11

the information can be exchanged via any method including email, a forum post, or a physical message.
In addition to this, the protocol is extendable in that it can be modified for use with not just Ether, but
also with any ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This would allow users not only to bet with
each other using Ether, but also any other Ethereum-based token. The original version and deployment
of the Ethbet protocol will focus on Ether, leaving the option of arbitrary ERC20 token support for a
later period.
The Ethbet protocol closely mirrors the protocol outlined in the 0x whitepaper20, as the Ethbet protocol
has almost the same goal’s as 0x’s: 0x intends to allow users to exchange tokens with each other, while
Ethbet intends to allow users to bet tokens with each other. The following example demonstrates a
scenario of two users using the Ethbet protocol to make a bet with each other. In this example ‘Maker’
is the user that offers a bet and ‘Caller’ is the user that accepts that offer:
1. Maker approves the Ethbet contract to access their balance that they intend to wager
2. Maker creates an offer to bet their balance, specifying their desired amount, edge and bet expiration
time, then signs this offer with their private key, proving both their their ownership and intent
3. Maker broadcasts their bet via any medium. Theoretically the best place to broadcast a bet will be an
Ethbet relay, but there is no reason why it cannot be posted on a forum or sent via an email, as it is only
a string (text)
4. Caller reads the bet offer from Maker and decides they would like to call it
5. Caller approves the Ethbet contract to access their balance as well
6. Caller submits the Maker’s signed order to the contract
7. The Ethbet contract authenticates Maker’s signature, verifies that the bet has not expired and that the
bet has not already been called
8. The Ethbet contract executes the bet and transfers the bet amount between the two parties based off
of the outcome.
The primary method of communication with the Ethbet protocol is intended to be via relays, as outlined
in the previous section. The full protocol description of Ethbet is not yet finalized, but the information
and format of it will be relatively standard, containing the parameters of a bet (amount, edge,
expiration, and later on, asset type), as well as the necessary information to secure it, including a
cryptographic hash function like SHA3 and an ECDSA signature from the private key of the
participants.

Development Timeline
At the time of the crowdsale, the Ethbet token and Ethbet crowdsale contracts will be deployed on the
mainnet and fully functional, as necessary for the crowdsale to occur. The code in these smart contracts
is a relatively standard and lightweight implementation of the ERC20 standard, and the possibility for
critical bugs is small in comparison to that of more complex and novel contracts, such as the primary
Ethbet game contract. If a significant problem occurs that is recoverable, the necessary steps will be
12

taken to remedy the situation. For example, if there was somehow a critical flaw in the Token contract,
allowing someone to steal all Ethbet Tokens, we could fix the problem, deploy the new token contract
(with the problem fixed), and restore the balances of all users, migrating the entire platform to the
newer version of the token, similar to what happened with Ethereum and the DAO. An issue like this is
is very unlikely to occur unless it is caused by a problem within Ethereum itself, as the Ethbet Token is
nearly isomorphic to most Ethereum (ERC20) tokens, so a critical problem with one could indicate the
same problem with many others.
After the crowdsale is complete, Ethbet tokens will become unfrozen and can then be sent to other
users. At this time the development of the primary game contract will proceed. This is a relatively
lengthy process despite the simplicity of the game architecture. The general timeline is as follows:
1. Develop primary contract functionality and tests
2. Extensively test and audit the contract for potential flaws
3. Deploy the contract onto the testnet
4. Allow users to interact with the contract during a beta period
5. Continue to improve the contract as needed
6. Perform final third-party security audit(s)
7. Deploy the contract onto the mainnet
8. Continue to improve non-contract code, such as improving accessibility and user interfaces,
only updating the contract to fix critical issues or to later implement new features.
In addition to this, there’s other developmental overhead, such as the off-blockchain relay and various
user-interfaces required to interact with Ethbet in a user-friendly fashion. In order to make interaction
with the smart contract user-friendly and simple, users will be able to interact with it via the Mist
browser, giving them an experience similar to traditional websites, but while still interfacing only with
smart contracts for their betting.

Future Possibilities
As Ethereum matures as a technology, it will allow decentralized applications such as Ethbet to run
more efficiently. Improvements in other technologies such as Web3 browsers (Mist and the Metamask
extension) also help to further Ethbet’s goals. As Ethbet progresses as a project, there will be
opportunities for more features to be added. Examples include a more feature-rich implementation of
dicing, other games such as lotteries or card games, the possibility to bet arbitrary ERC20 tokens, and
more advances in gas/time efficiency, such as the use of state channels. The inclusion of these features
depends on the success of the Ethbet crowdsale as well as the opinions (votes) of the Ethbet token
holders. In addition to this, many opportunities for lowering gas costs and increasing the quality of
provable fairness will exist as more research and projects are performed in these areas.

Similar Projects
As the size of the blockchain and Ethereum ecosystems has grown considerably over the last few years,
a number of projects with goals similar to Ethbet’s have emerged. Although some of these projects are
similar in nature, they either have different goals or are lacking some of the features of Ethbet. Some of
these projects are summarized below, with emphasis on why they are different from Ethbet.

Edgeless: Edgelesss claims to offer betting on the Ethereum blockchain with a 0% house edge,
however several notable caveats exist, namely:
• Edgeless claims their unreleased Blackjack game will have a house edge of 0%, but this only
applies if every move and game played by a player is perfect. As a result, they expect the house
to profit from this game21
• Although Edgeless is partially decentralized (exists on the blockchain), it is not peer-to-peer
• Edgeless does not support ETH, only their own token, EDG, thus you must purchase EDG first
to use their platform
• Games such as Blackjack involve large amounts of data stored on the blockchain, and thus the
fees paid to execute the involved smart contracts can be high
• Edgeless generates random numbers using their own server off of the blockchain
• No publicly readable changes to their smart contracts appear to have been made for at least
several months22
14

Regardless of these drawbacks, Edgeless may be an appealing option for those wishing to play
provably-fair games of blackjack on the blockchain in the near future, however we do not consider
them a direct competitor for our target audience.

Etheroll: Etheroll was the first functioning dicing game on the Ethereum blockchain. It is similar to
Ethbet, however is not peer-to-peer and has a house edge of 1% for every bet. Aside from this, it
appears to be a successful platform and one of the only Ethereum projects that is already generating
revenue for token holders, making it a good model for future Ethereum-based projects to follow.

DAO.Casino: DAO.Casino is a recently-funded Ethereum-based blockchain protocol. It is not a
gambling application in itself, however is intended to function as a framework that allows others to
create blockchain-based gambling with a lower overhead. DAO.Casino utilizes a token called BET,
which is required for all interactions using its protocol. The goals of DAO.Casino are to help casinos
move their games onto the blockchain and to encourage on-chain game development and participation
using its protocol. This differs substantially from the goal of Ethbet, which is to provide peer-to-peer
dicing on the blockchain with no house edge.

Peerplays: Among all other projects, Peerplays23 is the only one that markets itself based off of peer-topeer interaction. Critically, Peerplays is its own currency and blockchain, completely separate from
Ethereum, and thus the barriers to entry are much larger. Although Peerplays boasts its own
technologies and smart contracts separate from the Ethereum network, as a result of this is is not able to
benefit from the network effects of the Ethereum ecosystem or from the security and reliability of the
Ethereum virtual machine and its associated smart contracts. In addition to this, there are no visible
cases of dicing without a house edge being offered on this platform.

Funfair: Funfair24 is another Ethereum-based project with the ambitious goal of ‘delivering next
generation gaming anywhere in the world’, according to their technical whitepaper. Although Funfair’s
scope includes gambling games, their focus is on providing a variety of immersive and graphically
extensive games which are ‘fun’. To quote directly from their technical whitepaper: “We don’t want
just simple, boring ‘pick a number’ games. (...) they are just not fun. We are fun.”25 In order to interact
with games built by Funfair, one must use Funfair’s token, FUN. Funfair uses a custom off-chain
technology called fate channels which functions in a manner similar to Bitcoin’s proposed lightning
network26 and is attempting to secure patents related to this technology. Funfair claims that their
implementation of fate channels is provably fair, although the server-side code to it is currently not
15

open source and implementation details have not yet been made public, purportedly to allow Funfair to
retain a competitive advantage over other players in the field. Although an interesting project with
ambitious goals, their primary objectives are very different from ours.

Although some of the above projects could be considered competitors to Ethbet, many of their stated
goals are orthogonal to ours, and just as different cryptocurrencies serve different purposes and cater to
different audiences, these projects are able to do so as well. For these reasons, we believe that the
demand for the market niche that Ethbet realizes has not yet been met by any of the above projects.

17 For example, instead of a user making a bet with a 25% win chance and a 4X payout, the user can make 2 bets with a
50% win chance and a 2X payout on each, resulting in the same risk to reward ratio. The equivalent can be done for those
who wish to risk smaller amounts, as they are able to make bets as small as feasible, dictated by network and gas fees and
their preferences.
