sensation across the globe. blockchain defined the next-generation internet technology which will transfer the interconnected information the value internet. meanwhile, utilizing the power and the value the network with decentralization consensus. blockchains technology can help the world build better, more powerful, transparent economic system, reconstruct the business ecology. and even inspire great innovation combination with many industries. particular, the distributed feature the blockchain enables participants the chain share the economic benefits from the whole ecosystem without forming monopoly. can used break the isolation the industry, encouraging compete collaboration and exchange essential data, form beneficial technical and commercial cooperation. health care industry isolated system that exclusively maintains its own information and technology. but meanwhile, the industry needs work together safeguard the health and safety human life. other than that, many diseases need improve the cure rate through sharing data and technologies among the institutions. present, the isolation the industry very common, and medical institutions are working independently and competing with each other. governments and the united nations have called upon the inter-enterprise collaboration serve the health all human beings, but produces very little effect far. the cause rooted the traditional business model that not conducive medical business collaboration and data sharing. the relatively closed and semi-market-oriented feature the industry that leads the slow development the medical field. but the healthcare industry also has very broad market space. the annual expenditure the global medical and health market has reached tens trillions u.s. dollars. developed countries, the medical and healthcare industry the united states reached nearly four trillion u.s. dollars, accounting for more than its gdp. meanwhile, among developing countries, the scale china's health industry has also reached nearly eight trillion-yuan, accounting for its gdp, and there still huge room for growth. the new business and technology cooperation mode created the blockchain technology can completely eliminate the information gap medical resources. there doubt that the solution "medical treatment artificial intelligence blockchain" can thoroughly help the current dilemma healthcare industry. the revolutionary business model and technical infrastructure enable various institutions the chain exchange data, develop, collaborate and obtain their own

institutions data training full chain data retrospect algorithm model output model insurance institutions personal medical personal medical personal medical health data health data individual health data user market sore spots there are lot sore spots the healthcare industry itself, such aging, sub-health and medical resources inequality, which have posed great challenge the human society. unfortunately, difficult solve these problems due many factors, such the unbalanced allocation resources, the low level intelligence the information system, the information barrier between medical institutions, the high cost training healthcare workers, etc. individuals lack retroactive right, knowing right and access and control right over their own medical data medical data are generated from users, but most the data are stored medical institutions. users not know the medical information, nor can control the information. when patient sees doctor, only limited information can referenced, which often increases the difficulty clinical decision-making and not conducive the patient's disease diagnosis and treatment process. moreover, users are not able enjoy the benefits generated their own medical data research. american leukemia patient's blood contained biological mechanism that could cure leukemia. without prior notification, his treatment medical research institute developed relevant medical techniques his medical data and benefited billions dollars. comparison, the data stored the blockchain can traced back the entire chain. users have full control right and knowing right about their own data, and can enjoy the benefits brought the research the medical data. the data security problems are the major concerns, and getting really serious due the fast growth medical data, health information and centralized storage methods. the typical situation, most the medical data and health information are stored data center, the data are easily damaged accidents such malicious tampering, hacker attacks, natural disasters, etc. with the speeding the informatization medical institutions, the hidden dangers such centralized storage data center are increasingly getting higher. difficult for medical data, health information effectively shared and utilized due the isolated data islands. due historical reasons, there are information barriers between medical institutions, and their data cannot communicated with each other. medical data also cannot effectively integrated and utilized. when users seek cross-hospital treatment, their medical history difficult obtain and retrieve. centralized storage also can hinder the efficiency data research. for security reasons, needs lengthy procedures for recording and filing users? medical data and for research institutes transfer these data. however, the distributed storage data the blockchain not only can ensure the security, but also can realtime transfer the data from the entire network. google once detected signs flu outbreaks some areas through users? search behaviors, and then informed the relevant medical institutions prepare flu drugs advance. present, typical clinic, flu-receiving patient will take three months report feedback for any signs and symptoms after diagnosis and observation, which might miss the best prevention and treatment period. the domestic sars and flu outbreak also exposed the low efficiency and flaws centralized medical data contradiction exists between the outburst personal health management demand and the effective management health information. the saying goes, ?the best doctor helps people prevent diseases?. people's living standards improve, the demands for better health management also increase. health management the premise disease prevention, and the premise achieving effective health management having stable monitoring sources physiological data. patients with acute and chronic disease, middle-aged group, seniors, and sub-health people all have high demands for effective health management system. the other hand, meanwhile, healthy people also have demands for stable health management. the problem that under the current health information management, users? previous medical records can only accessed when the data are stored the same hospital. but more diseases are related the personal?s past history and genetic information. the current data management mechanism unable establish such exclusive medical file for user, let alone using analyze the user's health situation. solution based the blockchain and
