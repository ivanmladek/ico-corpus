Our Story
In 2007 we created, designed, and published a rhythm and music based game called DJMAX
Technika with a team of 40 employees. The game received acclaimed reviews and international
awards and created a loyal following from around the world. The Korean government awarded us
with the prestigious Game of the Year award.
Upon launching we learned about the gaming community and how vast and communal they
were once they found other people who enjoyed the same games or had interest in the same
genre of games. These gamers were able to find each other through social networking in online
forums and YouTube channels. Gamers love to share and trade tips, secrets, and achievements.
But our biggest discovery was when we realized there lacked a platform to allow these gamers
to freely do one of the things they love most, which is buy/sell and trade their old games and rare
games or have a system to let their online friends borrow their games.
This is when we first came up with the idea of Playgroundz. We wanted to create a platform
that was easy for the gaming community to buy/sell and trade their games based on a social
trust system that utilized the social awareness of the community to ultimately help you make
decisions on your transaction and who you transact or make trades with.
Everyone in the gaming community loved the idea and all agreed there was a need for this so we
began to design it.

Project ‘Yellow’
We began our journey when the team first conceptualized and identified the project Yellow in
early 2012. Our goal was to connect users through videogames, toys and geek culture so they
may transact with one another without any authority or restrictions so we named the project
Nitty (Niche + Community). The project was released and we achieved many milestones in our
first year.

4. Problems & Solutions | a. Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding 1/2
1. Problem
Crowdfunding is a system that allows people to contribute funds for future projects based
on early concepts. Similarly, game crowdfunding allows gamers to contribute money in
advance to developers to help develop new games. This has been proven very successful
for small development studios and indie teams on existing platforms such as Kickstarter and
Indiegogo.
For example: “WASTELAND 2”, which had been halted in development due to lack of
funding, was able to continue development by receiving $2.9 million in 35 days through
crowdfunding. Gamers showed their support and the developers received 3 times their
original goal. The game launched in 2014 to critical success.
However, not all stories end successfully.

Investors

Not guaranteed

In 2013 a developer proposed a project to develop the game “Mighty No.9”, a spiritual
successor to the popular “Megaman” franchise. During this time, a proper Megaman game
wasn’t released for almost a decade and fans were eager to donate to see the project come
to life. The project was successfully backed by over 67,000 participants with a total of $3.8
million within just one month.
Although the project was successful in terms of funding, an onslaught of problems followed.
The project didn’t reach any of the promised milestones and was delayed numerous times.
The development took almost double the time they guaranteed and eventually finished
but launched to lackluster reviews. The fans accused the developers of quality issues
and undelivered gameplay promises and were upset with the overall experience and end
product.

4. Problems & Solutions | a. Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding 2/2
Crowdfunding also presents a huge problem with the trust of the donated funds.
The fundraisers for “Project Phoenix” raised funds for their project but then spent a million of
those dollars to developer other game projects secretly.
Other projects like “The Stomping Land”, where successfully funded and the team just
disappeared with the money.
The crowdfunding platforms don’t provide the means for investors to monitor and make sure
their funds are being vested and used correctly. This current system is flawed because it lacks
the proper solutions to stop these funding abuses.

2. Solution
The Playgroundz Platform provides a new videogame crowdfunding service for gamers with
blockchain technology called “Mineral”.

Investors

Funding Wallet

Developer

Playgroundz
Multisignature
Smart-Contract

Blockchain

Mineral crowdfunding features a vesting system where funds vest according to milestone
deliverables. This prevents the recipient party from receiving full funding from the start. The
funds will be deposited on blockchain with smart contracts that are supported with multisignature functions. The contributors and the developers agree on milestones, deliverables
and terms and the funding amounts are only paid after a certain number of contributors
approve them. If the contributors don’t approve the milestones, they can then decide if the
funding is to proceed with new terms or be refunded back.
Since the entire funding process is based off of IOG token and smart contract, nobody
including the receiving party can stop or modify it. In addition, everyone can also check the
development process through Block Explorer without limitations. We believe this will keep
the developers on track and honest but more importantly, this will keep the donations safe.
Also, by using IOG tokens as the form of donation, gamers and developers across the globe
can create and sponsor crowdfunding campaigns regardless of their country and currency.

Tips and Q&A 1/2
1. Problem
Gamers often face a lot of challenges and have difficulties progressing through some of their
games. Although, they can find help and content on search engines like, the information
usually lacks the perfect solutions and oftentimes provide false information.

In the current game space, each game community is usually formed according to the gamers
gaming platforms like PS4, Xbox One and Switch and not the game itself. This causes the
game information to split across different communities instead of unifying it as one. This also
causes friction for both the game and gamer because it acts as a barrier that slows down the
game and community’s growth.

Tips and Q&A 2/2
2. Solution
The Playgroundz Platform provides a new knowledge sharing service for gamers with
blockchain technology called “Navi”.

Navi is a game knowledge sharing service done through a question-answering system with
incentives. It aims to bring all information about games to one place without any bias or
boundaries.
Navi uses a compensation system for the collection of good quality information and the
determination of false information. In this system, a questioner posts a question and puts
IOG token as a reward. Then the questioner adopts an answer that was helpful and the
user who has responded to the question obtains the IOG token as a reward. Also, if a user
provides the tips or know-how for other gamers, the user can also earn IOG tokens through
donations.
As we see in Wikipedia’s case, people have the tendency to share their knowledge with
others even when its free. With Navi, we believe we can collect good quality questionanswer information for games because not only do we provide a system for gamers to
connect and share their knowledge, we also provide a reward system.
Also, by using IOG tokens as the form of reward, gamers across the globe can connect and
share their information regardless of their country and currency.

Videogame bartering for physical or digital items plays an important role for both the gamers
and game industry. The second-hand market for physical games such as console games
and PC games is estimated at about $10+ billion/year and the item trading market for digital
games is estimated at about $30+ billion/year. This proves that the user-to-user transactions
are a growing blue ocean market for the game industry. However, the existing platforms also

The most popular trading platform, eBay, prevents sellers and buyers from connecting
directly with each other. Due to the nature of virtual game items, this becomes a problem for
the buyers and sellers as they must often communicate with each other directly to trade their
items.
Craigslist, another platform with a large North American user base, has been plagued with
fraudulent cases simply due to the fact that there are no systems that protect its users.
Although there are mediation platforms which provide transactions safely through escrow,
the high fees make it hard for cheap goods to be bartered with.

The buyer who wants to trade, transfers the item value amount with IOG tokens, which then
gets deposited on the blockchain according to the Escrow Smart Contract. Then, when the
buyer makes the confirmation for the trade, the IOG token is paid to the seller.
Both sellers and buyers can trade securely and the transaction status such as deposits can be
confirmed by anyone using blockchain. In addition, users can trade at the lowest commission
because they use IOG tokens. Essentially, everyone across the world can use Aki together

4. Problems & Solutions | d. Recommendation & Collection

Recommendation & Collection 1/2
1. Problem
In recent years, the rapid growth of the game industry has led to the flood of releases. On
average over one thousand games get released monthly. Gamers now have too many games
to choose and play with and not enough time. With so many choices, the gamers need a
good system besides keyword-based search engines to find the perfect game suited for
them.
For example: If a gamer is searching for a good story game and types “beautiful story game”
they will get results like “bakery story”.

Although game platforms like Steam produce better recommendation results than search
engines, it’s still limited in scope because it only finds games for their platform. Hundreds of
good games, created by the efforts of thousands of developers, just disappear each month
because they cannot find the target users efficiently.

While the digital ad market continues to grow, the CPI (Cost Per Install) and CPA (Cost
Per Action) marketing effect for simple installation is starting to decrease. The marketing
costs continue to rise due to the increase in number of downloads required for the top rank
visibility, reflecting variables such as user engagement, execution number, and other various
changes that occur in the market. Publishers are starting to figure out that CPI and CPA
methods are not getting them loyal users.
In essence, the publishing dollars are currently being spent on attracting the mass but also
acquiring low-quality users that might not have any value or Return on Investment (ROI)

The Playgroundz Platform offers a variety of services for gamers. By tracking the game habits
of gamers using Big Data Analysis and Machine Learning on the Playgroundz Platform, we
can anticipate what games the users will like in the future in advance. This allows us to build a
personalized, targeted advertising system that is well above the level of the current keywordbased advertising system.
Through the valued and enrolled games stored in the Playgroundz Platform, we can
calculate what gamers have liked in the past, what they currently like and what future games
they could like. With the Navi service, we can help players come back to old games they
would love to enjoy again and also recommend the perfect games they haven’t played yet.
Beyond the current one-off marketing advertising platforms, we will be able to make a
personalized lifestyle marketing campaign that analyzes the user’s game lifestyle. This will
be very important in boosting the lifetime value (LTV) and the return on ad spend (ROAS),
which are key factors for the digital marketing industry.

writers, and musicians can all upload their resources and outsource or donate them to others
through IOG Token.

3. Gamers Can Crowdfund New Games, Modes and Features
Both developers and players can come together and use the Playgroundz Crowdfunding
system to help make new features, modes, and even new games. In fact, a portion of
Playgroundz’s earned revenue will even Fund and Publish new projects through a voting
system with a portion of the earned revenue.

4. Advertisement Transparency
The Playgroundz Advertisement payment system operates on the basis of Blockchain
technology. An automated payment system will use smart contracts to provide maximum
transparency and flexibility for advertisers.

5. Lifecycle Marketing (Long-term Marketing)
A lot of advertisers are focusing on the first event after install (retention, action, etc.) which
gives you a first shot of the user quality, but nothing about long-term engagement.
• We focus on Lifetime Value (LTV) and Return on AD Spend (ROAS) KPI.
• We provide solutions to reach the right audiences at each stage of the game lifecycle.

Architecture
Playgroundz is composed of each function being a modularization as a component. Each
component uses light mechanism to be created as the minimum unit, performing as a service
between each other’s communication. This fast architecture quickly enables development and
test, thereby providing flexibility in terms of expansion and management of system.
Playgroundz consists of 3 layers.

1. Application Layer
Playgroundz perfectly supports web and mobile platform. Based on core framework,
and according to each platform, customized framework is structured and adapted with
biometrics solution such as face or finger scan.
All applications are easy to utilize with intuitive interface, and user-friendly designs.

2. Business API Layer
Through JSON/HTTPS protocol, applications connect with Playgroundz framework. Even
if core framework or systems are changed, it sustains the maximum compatibility and
minimized the amending work.
Third Party can access the Playgroundz ecosystem through our SDK. The SDK observes
security policy reflected upon Playgroundz framework and provides accuracy and flexibility.
In Playgroundz, the third party will encourage us to create additional services. Along with
users and Investors, it will be a great help in growing the Playgroundz platform.

3. Foundation Layer
AKA the core layer of Playgroundz. Modularization components such as AI, utilizing Big Data
and Machine Learning, and Escrow, using Smart Contract are driven in the Playgroundz
framework.
All necessary policy and algorithms are included in the Playgroundz platform. Also, along
with safety, diversity, expandability, security, and function, all requirements will be satisfied.

6. Playgroundz Technology | c. Blockchain & Smart Contracts

Blockchain & Smart Contracts
Blockchain combined with Smart Contract is a core technology which makes the ecosystem of
Playgroundz safe and transparent.
Blockchain is dispersed ledger system in millions of computer networks, where each recorded
node cannot be erased or changed randomly by the users. Information about Blockchain is
encrypted and protected from the third parties.
Smart Contract is a digital contract, and when a certain condition is met, the code is put into
effect automatically. When Smart Contract is distributed, the contract terms can’t be changed.
All transactions that are occurred from the Marketplace and Advertisement System provided by
the Playgroundz platform will be distributed via Smart Contract. In Smart Contract, every data is
recorded permanently in Blockchain, making all transactions in Playgroundz platform safe and
transparent.

How will Playgroundz Marketplace on a Blockchain work?
All the information for purchased items in Playgroundz Marketplace are given with unique
PMIP (Playgroundz Marketplace Item Profile), encrypted and saved in Blockchain.
PMIP consists of diverse information which is item and trackable information. It also consists
of digital container which can save numerous records. Internal records in PMIP are saved
in timely order. Including hash and time stamp of previous record, it is composed of minor
blockchain ledger inside each PMIP.
All transaction history is done safely through Smart Contract. It can be traced or viewed
whenever permanently.

6. Playgroundz Technology | d. Scalability, e. Data Storage, f. User Privacy & Security

Scalability
The Playgroundz IOG token is ERC20 compatible and plays an important role in the
Playgroundz ecosystem such as Marketplace, Rewarded Community, and Advertisement
System. Ethereum is an innovative platform which expanded the possibility of Blockchain.
However, compared with the growth of Blockchain, the transaction speed of Ethereum is very
slow. There are many problems such as influence of the main chain due to the slow speed of side
chain.
Compared with development and growth speed of the Playgroundz platform, if the issues
of Ethereum platform are not solved, we are planning to develop EOS, Waves, Quantum or
Blockchain platform to relocate. In this case, IOG token will be automatically traded 1:1 with the
new coin in the new platform.

Data Storage
Playgroundz takes advantage of large volumes of data. We seek for dispersed, decentralized
spirit without any inspections. However, decentralized and dispersed platforms are being
developed and the stability is not certified. Also its function does not fit to the requirement of
Playgroundz. In the beginning of development, in order for the convenience of function and
development, data is saved and managed with centralized and concentrated form.
When the Playgroundz system is stabilized and the technology is well advanced for the
dispersed platform, we are planning to transfer the data to dispersed storage such as IPFS,
Swarm, and Bluzelle.

User Privacy & Security
We think of user’s personal information, security and protection as the top priority. We
constructed a multi-level security system to block hacking or identity theft problems.
Playgroundz will obey GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and protects user’s data
privacy according to its standard.

6. Playgroundz Technology | g. Big Data & Machine Learning

Big Data & Machine Learning
The Playgroundz system utilizes Machine Learning technology for data collection, analysis and
anticipation modeling. As Machine Learning platform, Google’s TensorFlow is used, big data
analysis technology uses text mining based on natural language processing, opinion mining and
cluster analysis.
Collecting all traceable activities including user game collection, evaluation, posts, replies, and
sharing to analyze patterns and traits. These data are used in all domains of Playgroundz system
such as recommendation system, advertisement system, and marketplace matching system.
And those who provided data are rewarded with incentives.

6. Playgroundz Technology | h. Redommendation System

Recommendation System
The recommendation system in Playgroundz is based upon PG-Metadata that borrows
Quantum theory(1) from Netflix. PG-Metadata exceeds the common level of metadata. It records
not only objective data of game including the genre, the published date and the production
period and so on, but also subjective information of game including the ambience of game
(future-oriented or horror), the graphic concept (dreamlike or retro), the complexity of game
story (linear, inverted or retrogressive) and the game difficulty, etc. In addition, it even records the
time to clear and whether or not a game has the original story of a novel or movie. Conceptually,
it records all information about game construction.
The recommendation system uses Model-based Collaborative Filtering Algorithm. The most
important thing is the latent model algorithm. Rather than comparing the similarity of original
items, it extracts conclusion by interfering the patterns and causes of preference included in
the data via algorithm ways. Through this kind of model, we can enable accurate and reliable
recommendations. The core technique of potential pattern interference is developed via
algorithms such as Bayesian Network, LDA (Latent Drichlet Allocation).

PG-Metadata registered by a user should be agreed by more than a certain number of users.
Lastly, it will be registered after the acknowledgement of Playgroundz system. When it is
registered successfully, both a registrant and an inspector of the PG-Metadata receive a certain
amount of incentive (Pointz). Such an incentive system gives many users a strong motive to
participate in building and validating vast game databases actively and voluntarily.

Quantum theory(1) : The project taken the lead in by Todd Yelin of Netflix. When metadata of a movie is written, it makes the metadata filled
with necessary information according to about 36-page guidelines. It is the key project of Netflix recommendation system to understand the
composition of contents at the quantum level.

IOG Token
Playgroundz is composed of IOG Token following ERC 20.
IOG token is the major settlement method in the Playgroundz Platform. It is utilized in every
domain including settlement of advertisement, community, crowdfunding and marketplace.
It is perfectly compatible with ERC20 standard. It can easily transfer or save in a Ethereum
Wallet or Playgroundz Wallet just like MyEtherWallet and Metamask. IOG token will not be
issued after the Token Sale. Right after the Token Sale, one can attain IOG token only through
various activities in the Playgroundz Platform or upcoming promotions.
Based on reciprocal communication between user, developers, and publishers, the Playgroundz
Platform provides an economic system, which enables virtuous cycle of IOG tokens.
