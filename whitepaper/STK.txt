WHITEPAPER

ABSTRACT
The STK token will enable real time point of sale (POS) transactions directly from users’ private cryptocurrency
wallets. We predict the ability to make purchases in-store and online using cryptocurrencies will speed
up mass adoption of the technology. The STK token is part of a global solution to facilitate borderless
transactions. To make instant payments at point of sale from a blockchain wallet requires we do a real-time
exchange of cryptocurrency into fiat. The STK token provides access to our state channels which a) ensure
there is sufficient cryptocurrency (i.e. Bitcoin, Ether) in the digital wallet and b) users spending fiat at point
of sale will complete the purchase from their cryptocurrency assets. STK automatically opens a state channel
between each user and STK’s own wallet. STK tokens fund the transaction, much like gas funds Ethereum
transactions. The first implementation will be with STACK’s digital wallet. STK tokens will be implemented
on the public Ethereum blockchain and adhere to the ERC20 protocol.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
To date, cryptocurrency has yet to gain mainstream
adoption. The last barriers to mass market adoption
will be removed when cryptocurrencies become
embedded into everyday commerce. An estimated
$22 trillion1 of consumer spending takes place annually
between shoppers and merchants. Local/national currencies are used to pay for everything from your
cup of coffee every morning to your weekly grocery run. What if you could pay for your cup of coffee
with Bitcoin or Ether? Without requiring the merchant to change their point of sale equipment, STACK is
enabling ubiquitous merchant acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This will greatly accelerate the adoption of
cryptocurrency and tapping into the existing ecosystem of global commerce.

VISION
STK Global Payment’s vision is to create a globally accessible alternative to traditional banking, allowing
you to store your money safely, access it instantly and transact with it anywhere, in any currency including
crypto by using the STK token, right from your smartphone, using the STACK app. Creating a digital wallet
as a companion to a traditional card solution, the STACK app enables you to use any of your currencies at
point of sale, anywhere in the world.

STK WILL BE A PLATFORM THAT WILL FACILITATE REALTIME
CRYPTOCURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AT POINT OF SALE.

CURRENT LIMITATIONS OF BLOCKCHAIN SETTLEMENT
Because very few merchants accept cryptocurrencies at point of sale or online, consumers must exchange
cryptocurrencies into their local currency to make everyday purchases. Through any existing exchanges this
can be time consuming, and comes with sizeable fees. Though some companies have made products that
enable retailers to accept Bitcoin payments, they are currently available at only a tiny number of locations.

Our goal is for this exchange to occur in real time, anywhere credit cards are accepted, and with fees
comparable to transaction costs on Ethereum. At present, the confirmation time for Bitcoin transactions
averages 10 minutes2, far too long for point of sale purchases. Ethereum transactions are faster, at an
average time of 24 seconds, but even this is too slow for point of sale.3 Furthermore, neither the merchant
nor the local currency provider are willing to wait the required amount of time for the transaction to be
confirmed on the blockchain, which is critical to protecting both parties against fraud.

STK SOLUTION: STK STATE CHANNEL AND STK TOKEN
There is a two-pronged problem that the STK solution will solve:

1) A lack of merchant acceptance of cryptocurrency.
STACK has partnered with an existing payment network that will allow the cryptocurrency
wallet to be used at 39 million merchant locations.4

2) Payments at point-of-sale must complete in near-instant time.
Rather than writing each payment transaction to the blockchain, STACK, will create State
Channels between the customer and STACK. These channels are an established way to provide
real time transaction guarantees on the blockchain. Once this is done, customers’ transactions
will be funded through STK’s liquidity pool to make point of sale purchases instantly.

To use this system, the user is required to hold a STK token which grant access to the STK State Channel and
will be limited to those who have STK tokens.

STK IS A SOLUTION THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED GLOBALLY,
WITH THE FIRST IMPLEMENTATION OCCURRING WITH STACK
In order for users of the STACK wallet to transact in real-time, the STK solution will be integrated into the
STACK digital multi-currency wallet. This functionality can only be accessed with a STK token. The STK token
will be used to pay for the operating cost of setting up the State Channel. Because STK tokens can change
in value, the price per transaction is calculated similarly to how gas prices are on Ethereum.

STATE CHANNELS
State Channels are a technique for making off-chain transactions with the same security guarantees as an onchain operation. State Channels allow us to conduct blockchain interactions as if they were being conducted
on-chain, but require only that two or more users exchange information with each other5. Participants in a
State Channel may exchange a large number of transactions between one another instantaneously, requiring
an on-chain operation only when the channel is closed. State Channels provide the speed required for
STACK’s point-of-sale purchase mechanism: at the moment of purchase, the user sends STK tokens to
STACK in exchange for STACK using their liquidity pool to make a fiat purchase through the global payment
network. This is a cost effective approach to enabling transactions.

HOW DOES THIS WORK IN PRACTICE?
Step-by-step process:

1. Creating a State Channel:
The user loads their STK token into the STACK mobile wallet, which authorizes the creation of a State
Channel with the STK platform. Both the user’s device and STACK keep a local copy of the current state
of the channel. Creation of a state channel requires an on-chain operation.

2. Conducting Transactions and State Changes:
When the user initiates a point of sale transaction using STACK, they receive a visual prompt in the STACK
wallet showing the value of the transaction, similar to using traditional tap-to-pay mobile applications.
Behind the scenes, the user authorizes a transaction to send the equivalent cryptocurrency to the STK
platform.

Almost immediately, the STK platform receives the signed transaction, counter-signs and stores a copy
of that new state off-chain. STK then authorizes its local currency account to pay the requested purchase
through its global payment network rails on behalf of the user. Because the transaction occurs off-chain,
there is virtually no delay except for a small amount of computation time and network latency.

3. Keeping Funds Ready:
So long as the State Channel is open, there are no fees for conducting any number of transactions
between the user and STK. Moreover, there is no fee for keeping the channel open.

4. Withdrawing Funds:
If the user wants to retrieve all or part of their STK token in the channel that has not been sent to STK, they
can do so by withdrawing their funds. The user signs and publishes a withdrawal request, which requires
an on-chain operation. It is possible to make partial withdrawals, so the user is always secure in being able
retrieve his or her ether while still keeping the channel open for future transactions with the STK network.

5. Closing:
To close a State Channel, one of the parties signs and publishes a close request to the State Channel. This
initiates a period during which either party can submit their most recent transactions, which determines
the final state of the state channel.

TOKEN GENERATION EVENT
In order to further develop and promote the STK platform, STK will conduct a token generation event that
will offer for sale 275,000,000 STK tokens out of a 500 million total supply. The proceeds of the TGE will
be used for marketing, solution development (both iOS and Android), integration of STK with STACK and
the operation of crypto to local currency exchange. The remaining will be reserved for the liquidity pool,
bounty programs and referrals. Any unsold tokens will be burned.

Each STACK account includes a STACK card – a prepaid card – which complements the STACK digital
wallet. STACK payment facilities which include the physical and virtual prepaid card can be used in almost
200 countries at over 39 million points of acceptance today. This is possible through our card issuance
partnerships with global payment networks. Moreover, users and businesses can exchange their blockchain
assets seamlessly from one user to another, with transparency that is currently lacking in a centralized
solution.
