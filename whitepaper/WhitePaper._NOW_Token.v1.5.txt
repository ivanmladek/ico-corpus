Abstract
ChangeNOW is a platform consisting of various products aimed at making interactions with
the crypto world as easy and smooth as possible. ChangeNOW’s main goal is to advance
cryptocurrency mass adoption and help the crypto community to work with crypto wherever
they want, however they want.

Common problems and ChangeNOW solutions
The world of cryptocurrency projects is changing at a high pace. Keeping up with the times,
ChangeNOW was created with a goal of bringing the cryptocurrency industry to a new level
by resolving its common problems.

Centralization
Currently we are in a counterintuitive situation where an industry so focused on
decentralization includes so many centralized services dominating users’ share. While
cryptocurrencies give their possessors freedom from regulations and authorities, centralized
exchanges and hosted wallets accumulate users’ funds, keeping the holders at risk.
Our team has a major focus on decentralization. We are building our ecosystem in a way
that users have as much control of their funds as possible.

Security issues
Centralization is followed closely by security problems. Hundreds of projects that store user
funds are at risk of being hacked. Moreover, even being as attentive to procedures as
possible and very precautious in general, these projects can still suffer from the human error
or technology failures. Despite all the efforts there is a lot of space for potential breaches
and issues that can lead to loss of great amounts of money.
ChangeNOW is built with perfect security as a goal and has gone through multiple
penetration tests. Plus, we seek to minimise the possibility of human error by engaging the
best technologies of decentralized world.
We are intent on continuing this way while keeping our standards as high as possible.

Lack of transparency
While cryptocurrencies strive to improve transparency of operations and transactions
between users, most services still lack transparency in their internal operations and
mechanisms. Even more so, most of them keep their implementation details and inner
operations secret which leads to major distrust, possibility of fraud, and alarms newcomers.

Concerning security measures and precautions, ChangeNOW takes all necessary steps to
be as transparent in its operations and implementation details as possible.

Poor customer service
In pursuit of optimisation support teams often grow detached from developers. It leads to the
most painful problems in customer service, mainly, long response times and canned
responses with no real help to the end user. Yet, when it comes to the financial sphere, no
amount of service and attention to users should be enough.
Our support team has already done a significant job in making our customer service as
smooth and efficient as possible. Support is integrated into our daily activities and users
always get high-quality and thorough answers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Usability
Cryptocurrencies and services around them are relatively young and have a lot of usability
issues. The necessity to deal with keys, addresses, hashes and verifications can be very
stressful, especially for inexperienced users. Cryptocurrency platforms require intuitive user
interfaces in order to be easily adopted by customers. Technology should serve them,
optimizing their lives and improving their experience. This is a trend in the cryptocurrency
world that we strongly support.
ChangeNOW is not only a technology but also a user experience. Every small detail that can
simplify the exchange process and make it more pleasant for the users is our priority.

ChangeNOW Instant Exchange
ChangeNOW is a wide product ecosystem aimed at making our clients’ user experience
while interacting with cryptocurrencies as easy, efficient, and pleasant as possible, including
an array of services such as an instant crypto exchange service, a Lightning node, a token
swap service, a crypto payment system, and much, much more.
ChangeNOW stays honest with its customers and collects no hidden or inflated fees. The
timing of the transaction remains rather short. Depending on the transaction volume, the
processing speed can take as little as 2 minutes.

ERC20 Token issuing
At launch, a smart contract​ based on the Ethereum network had been written and deployed
for the implementation of the NOW Token, with the smart contract source code published
openly on our GitHub account ​https://github.com/ChangeNow-io​.
The contract controls the following functionality:
1. NOW tokens issuance
2. NOW tokens transmittance

BEP2 Token issuing
On April 23rd 2019, half of the NOW ERC20 token emission has been burnt and released on
the Binance Mainnet under the BEP2 standard (NOW-E68 ticker) with a total supply of 100
000 000 NOW.

Gradual Airdrop
30% of NOW tokens in ERC20 equivalent are being distributed gradually among the users
and Affiliate partners of ChangeNOW.

For exchange users
Every week until the limit of 30 000 000 NOW tokens reached we will be distributing tokens
among all exchange users who wish to participate in the distribution.
In order to participate, users should provide us with their ETH address during the exchange
process. Amount of tokens allocated will be determined proportionally to the amount of funds
exchanged in BTC equivalent. Proportion will be derived in the following way:
●
●

Before the NOW token is listed on centralized exchanges: 1 BTC equivalent of
exchange leads to 5000 NOW (ERC20) airdrop
After the NOW token is listed on centralized exchanges: 1 BTC equivalent of
exchange leads to 1000 NOW (ERC20) airdrop

For affiliate partners
Every week until the limit of 30 000 000 NOW tokens in ERC20 equivalent reached we have
been distributing tokens among all active affiliate partners, proportionally to their turnover.
In order to participate, partners should have provided us with their ETH address through
their affiliate account. Amount of tokens allocated had been determined proportionally to the
amount of funds exchanged in BTC equivalent. Proportion had been derived in the following
way:
●

1 BTC equivalent of exchange leads to 5000 NOW airdrop

On December 9, 2018, the Gradual Airdrop tokens for our affiliate partners have been paid
out.

Private sale
After the launch of the NOW tokens, we are inviting potential investors to pass the Investor
Questionnaire consisting of the following items:

1. Description of the investor’s objectives, which they hope to achieve by taking part in
the sale
2. Information on the source of invested funds
3. Contacts
4. Amount of planned investments
Based on the acquired data, we will compile a White List, consisting of persons allowed to
invest. We are open to all investors ready to contribute at least $50,000.
In order to prevent the possible centralization of tokens in single hands, the maximum
investment threshold of $500,000 has been determined.
Investment limits are subject to change in case of significant market changes and drastic
increase/decrease of interest from potential investors.
Private sale will be available only to individuals and companies who have passed ​KYC
procedure​.

NOW Token Value
Basically, there are 2 main points to focus on: strengths of the company and possible value
of the tokens.

we’ll destroy all NOW tokens spent for services on ChangeNOW.

and partners.

Vesting Plan for the Team
Our team has extensive experience in building great software projects in cryptocurrency
field. To preserve team dedication to the project we developed a vesting plan for our key
team members comprised of 14% of the total NOW supply. Each portion of tokens will be
released only after a fixed period of time.

Decentralized Service Ecosystem
Centralized exchanges have a lot of potential drawbacks and risks. Meanwhile,
decentralized exchanges allow users to trade their tokens completely trustlessly and without
having to move their funds to a centralised exchange.
When a centralized exchange is compromised, millions of dollars and thousands of users
are impacted all at once. In a decentralized system, any attack or failure impacts only a
single user and their funds. Users are in control of their own security, which can be much
better than any centralized entity.
With the development of new technologies, we plan to build fully decentralized exchange
products, striving for a fully decentralized service ecosystem with the NOW Token as a
means of payment for various goods and services within.
