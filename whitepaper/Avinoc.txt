Abstract
In Business Aviation (BizAv), a part of general aviation (GA), but also at Airlines processes and their
optimization are still receiving insufficient attention - even today. Digitization and possible automation are slow due to the large number of different solutions and complex structures. In many places,
the coordination of flights, orders, and customer and supplier management are effected manually
or are only slightly information-based (e-mail, Excel, paper) using a multitude of incompatible systems containing non-integrated structures. In order to close the resulting gaps in communication
and information management, intermediaries are employed. On further consideration, however,
this need in itself is only a symptom and the causes are more deeply hidden. The effects are
usually high costs associated with a large overhead of up to 35% of the actual costs of relevant
services or operating material. The causes are hidden in the systemic. First and foremost, there
are delays in communication as well as inhomogeneous data or low-transparency processes. The
effects thereof are noticeable for the customer through the price on the one hand and the lack
of adequate performance on the other hand. Orders are therefore subject to considerable uncertainties in their realization1 . The quality of business aviation suffers. A future, already designed
as a fully autonomous system hardware requires a different general environment. It requires a
setting without manual intervention and without delays in its operation. It requires the availability of
an integrated, freely accessible and decentralized database and exchange layer for the complete
representation of all relevant information and payment flows in the system2 . In view of the overall digitization and automation efforts and the resulting, ever-increasing speed of implementation
worldwide, organizations should strive to reduce their overhead in order to continue to persists
on the market. For BizAv organizations, with reduced or completely eliminated overhead, there
are opportunities to enter new markets and completely new customer segments. Many potential
customers would not (yet) use a business jet or air taxi due to excessive prices, to date it is still a
privilege. In order to resolve these fundamental problems, eliminate causes and make BizAv fit for
the future, AVINOC was created.
The Aviation Network Operation Centers, which have been in existence since 2008, is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and business cloud application for BizAv, which has been
further developed to this day. Inspired by the wide range of possibilities offered by Blockchain technology today, the development team decided in 2017 to transform existing knowledge from the
ERP solution into a completely new system, the Aviation Network Operation Chain
AVINOC as a Blockchain solution provides a transparent, integrated, permissionless and decentralized base data layer for the exchange of relevant information for the GA. The main focus here
is on BizAv. The aim of AVINOC is flight coordination, order management and infrastructural issues

Delays and cancellations of flights
The system of BizAv includes all operators (aviation companies), crews (pilots, ground personnel, etc.), all infrastructure facilities (airports, authorities, dealers, fuel suppliers, manufacturers, etc.) and customers

of the GA worldwide and, with the help of the integrated transaction and payment system, achievement of an optimal use of resources and a high level of cost reduction on the market. The primary
goal is to strengthen the BizAv market with focus on reducing the time span of the information and
payment flow to zero, thus creating an optimal supply chain. This will allow the entire global market
to be strengthened and made sustainable for the future. It will furthermore result in positive effects
on all other economic sectors of a country with well-defined BizAv. It will also enable future technologies, such as autonomous or semi-autonomous flying, to be effectively and efficiently deployed
in organizations.

1 General Aviation
General Aviation (GA) covers the worldwide civilian transport of passengers and goods, primarily
aircraft and helicopters, outside scheduled (airlines) and charter flights. The GA is divided into business aviation (BizAv, or Business Aviation) and private aviation (private aviation). BizAv covers civil,
non-scheduled, company-specific and intra-factory traffic and the commercial operation of business
jets and helicopters for the purpose of transporting people and goods.

1.1 Characteristics
General aviation, and in particular commercial business aviation - in comparison to scheduled air
traffic is characterized by the offer of non-scheduled, on demand air transport in the form of individual transports. The departure and arrival airports are not dependent on a fixed network for this
point-to-point traffic. In addition to the availability of an operational aircraft including crew, the only
limitations are in the range of the aircraft, the airport opening hours and their slots. The service
is therefore largely unlimited in time and space. Typically, if not exclusively, considering the cargo
area, smaller and lighter aircraft are used in business aviation than in scheduled and charter traffic. This also allows for a high individuality of the route network, due to their ability to fly to smaller
airports with shorter runways near the actual destination.

1.2 Use
Based on these characteristics, and again in relation to the business aviation, the benefit is individual
for each demander. The main focus is on the benefits through time saving. Time can be saved by
using business aviation on demand as opposed to following a fixed time table on the one hand,
and by the resulting possibility to reach multiple destinations directly and consecutively, on the
other hand. The reduced ground transfer times between airports and departure and destination
locations as well as shorter routes and faster check-in and security check-in times at airports are
supported by use of special General Aviation Terminals (GAT). Another benefit is achieved by the
high and reliable planning accuracy as well as the high degree of flexibility of the travel activities.
The reliable execution of flights as well well-timed flights without delays are possible. In addition,
business aviation is also used for the short-term and time-critical transport of sensitive, critical or
over-sized goods or equipment. In the area of humanitarian activities, business aviation can bring
benefit in the form of health and vital blood or organ transports, and for the transport of relief
goods. The execution of evacuations in case of special emergencies is another field of application
of the GA due to its simple and quick availability.

1.3 Economic importance
In addition to individual benefits, the GA and BizAv make an important contribution to the economic
performance on all continents. This can be measured by gross value as the difference between

6

production value and intermediate inputs.
The economic impact of the sector is represented by a direct, indirect and induced value. Direct
added value is attributable to direct production, operation or maintenance of business travel and
private aircraft. The use of products and services by manufacturers, suppliers and maintenance
companies in other companies represent the indirect value along the value chain. The induced economic impact includes the financial resources spent by directly or indirectly employed employees
outside the general aviation industry.
Business aviation can generate a great deal of value for large companies that are increasingly
relying on the use of this service option to better manage their operational business. Business aviation has a demonstrably positive impact on earning power and thus on the value of the companies
involved in it.(Advisors, 2017)

2 Market
The total annual revenues of commercial aviation (scheduled, charter and general aviation) in 2017
reached a value of around USD 1.1 trillion. The share of General Aviation amounts to approximately
26% or USD 286 billion.(Aircraft, 2015; BLD, 2018; Fly, 2013; Galovic, Inkret, u. Winter, 2018;
GAMA, 2017)
Currently, around 350,000 aircraft are operated worldwide. Of these, around 93% or 325,000
aircraft are used by General Aviation. Of these, 61,000, which is 17% of all aircraft worldwide for
business aviation and about 76% or 266,000 aircraft worldwide for the rest of general aviation
(private aviation and others). Only around 7% or 25,000 aircraft cover the scheduled and charter
segment.(Aircraft, 2015; BLD, 2018; Fly, 2013; GAMA, 2017)
Figure 1: Total market of aviation

Global revenue growth in commercial aviation between 2003 and 2017 on average amounts to
around 10% per year, well above the average in Asia.(Statista, 2018b)

2.1 Operator models and usage concepts
For General Aviation, and in particular for BizAv, there are basically four different demand-based
access options for market participants. The most important determinants for choosing the appro-

7

priate model for business aviation flights are, in addition to budget constraints and the expected
intensity of use, ie. the flight requirement in hours, the distances to be covered, the availability of
the aircraft, the availability of the crew and the number the average number of passengers per
flight.vgl. [ Peter, 2004, S.15][ Sterzenbach, Conrady, u. Fichert, 2009, S.260][ Lang, Ziegler, u.
Linz, 2012a, S.47]
2.1.1 Full Ownership
Full ownership refers to the complete acquisition and independent operation - possibly by employing
a service provider - of a business aircraft. As a rule, these external service providers are charter
companies that also provide so-called aircraft management services.
2.1.2 Fractional Ownership
This operator model is characterized by the acquisition of a business aircraft by several investors.
In this case, the investment costs are proportionately payed by one-off payments and thus partownership is obtained. In addition to the acquisition costs, there are monthly fixed costs for the
operator as well as variable costs for the actual air traffic.
2.1.3 Charter / Air Taxi
Charter as the operator model is the simplest and most widely used model. Charter flights are
booked either directly with the operator or through a broker. The entire business aircraft including
the crew is chartered and usually billed to-the-minute, charging only the pure time of use. It is still
possible to differentiate between on-demand (or ad hoc) and contract (or block) chartering.
The Air Taxi as a new charter concept differs in that it provides the possibility of booking individual
seats as opposed to the entire aircraft. Preconditions for this are small and cheap airplanes as
well as corresponding information availabilities.
2.1.4 Jet Membership / Jet Card
With this operator model, a customer buys a defined quota of flight hours within a specified period
of time. Only the costs for the flight hours purchased are paid. If not consumed, the unused hours
expire.

2.2 Structure of Offers
The term providers in General Aviation refers mainly to operators of business aircraft. The provider
structure is very fragmented. The majority of providers (operators) are assigned to the area of micro (1 aircraft) and small suppliers (2 to 4 aircraft in the fleet). There are around 2500 registered
operators in the US, some 700 in the EU and an estimated 3800 in the rest of the world. Thus,
there are around 7,000 business aviation operators worldwide.

2.3 Structure of Demand
2.3.1 Customers of the BizAv
In the context of General Aviation, the term ”customers” is used almost exclusively in Business
Aviation of The demand side can be segmented into companies (large companies, medium-sized
enterprises), wealthy individuals, agencies (tourism / events / adventure / sports) and the government or authorities. The customer’s contract services include following objects to be transported:
– Individuals (VIP-Service)
– Priority goods and special cargo transports and in-house transports (with, for example, Antonov
An-225/224, Boeing 747 or Super Guppy and Beluga)
– Supply for remote and hard-to-reach regions - worldwide, e.g. Tundra (Russia), deserts (Australia / Africa), mountains (Alps, Himalaya region). In places, this is even the only supply
option.
– Air Ambulance and Flying Doctors (Australia / Africa / Amazon)
– Corporate clients for business / workforce
– urgent goods (production, health)
– dangerous and sensitive goods (radioactive material, samples, etc.)
– Emergency aid (UN, rescue services, evacuations)
– Surveillance and exploration, surveying, aerial photographs, other surveys (science, authorities)
2.3.2 Customer requirements for the product
Customer requirements, along with the expected benefits of business aviation, are focused primarily on quality, comfort and flexibility (such as simultaneous cargo and passenger flights ). These
expectations may relate to requirements placed on the hardware, ie the aircraft, the conditions on
board and the service on the ground.[vgl. G, 2008, S.13] The expectations can be summarized as
follows:
– Hardware (aircraft, prestige / brand, performance and performance parameters and purpose)
– Conditions on board (equipment, exclusivity, comfort, hybrid use - variable seating)
– Service (catering, concierge service, ... with a high quality of service and integrity)
– Conditions on the ground (transfer, handling, reception, door-to-door times and methodology
at check-in / out)

2.3.3 Demand Behavior
In terms of area, business aviation needs are basically largely scattered, with concentrations on
specific axes between centers of economic importance being identifiable. In terms of time, there
are seasonal differences with a strong phase starting in March until November and a weak phase
between December and February. Within one week, the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) are less
frequently used than the rest of the week, with most flights being recorded from Wednesday to
Friday.[ Lang, Ziegler, Linz, u. Braun, 2012b, S.72]
– Seasonality (mainly summer and winter tourism)
– Weekly pattern (Business Meetings)
– Events (large and special events, GP, Airshows, fairs)
– Particular events (disasters, rescues and evacuations, material requirements to maintain
productivity)
Trends in demand behavior can be seen in the wake of increasing sales of aircraft manufacturers.
In general, demand for business jets is expected to pick up, driven by increased customer demand.
Honeywell, in its latest market survey, expects sales of 9450 new aircraft to be delivered between
2014 and 2024. Light jets play an important role in the air taxi business, as they allow the entry
into business aviation. It is therefore important for a number of manufacturers to be able to offer
their customers a family of business jets that offer opportunities for advancement from small to
medium to large. The group of entry-level jets and super light jets includes, for example, the Learjet
75 and the Citation XLS +. Lightjets refers to models that have a range between 1100 NM and
2000 NM (with four passengers), cost between 4.6 and 12 million $ and have a cabin volume of up
to about 12 m³.(Aerokurier, 2015) Due to manufacturer demand and according to the requested
samples, the following can be found for customer demand behavior. The trend shows the growing
influence of the taxi range in the industry. Customers increasingly ask for short but also cheap
flights. These are possible according to the calculations only with corresponding cheaper aircraft.
Here, the trend also clearly shows that around 4 passenger seats are sufficient to serve a small
circle of friends, small workforce or families. The speed of transfer and the ability to stay among
themselves play an important role in this context

2.4 Industry Structure Analysis
With the help of the Five-Forces-Model (”Five Forces”) according to Porter [ E., 2008, S.79-93], the
competitive intensity of an industry can be determined based on the individual characteristics of
the so-called Five Forces. These are largely responsible for the profitability and attractiveness of
the respective industry.

10

2.4.1 Rivalry among existing competitors
The current competitive rivalry is considered as strong to very strong in all segments of Business
Aviation. Above all, information about customers is an important parameter. These trade secrets3
are particularly protected and are crucial to the success and failure of aviation operations.
2.4.2 Threat of new competitors
The threat of new competitors, however, is seen as rather low because of the high market entrance
barriers in the industry. This is in particular due to the high capital requirement and the associated
high risk. In addition, the staff is confronted with high entry barriers, because, regardless of rather
easily obtainable and reasonably priced pilot licenses, the ratings4 for the respective aircraft types
are quite expensive compared to the license. For each aircraft type, the corresponding rating must
be renewed at periodic intervals (usually once a year for professional pilots).
2.4.3 Threat of substitutes
Possible substitutes for the sector could be scheduled flights or charter flights, road or rail transport and video conferencing. The position of the substitutes is subject to the respective infrastructure as well as the general economic situation. Videoconferencing is only used in special situations
and will not pose a threat in the future. In business, videoconferencing is often given as an answer to reduced travel budgets, but experience of recent years has shown that this behavior only
increases in exceptional situations5 . Face-to-face contact is preferred by the majority of market
participants using BizAv, unless there are significant financial issues.
2.4.4 Negotiating power of the customers
The negotiating power of customers is (still) severely limited as there is great lack of transparency
in terms of prices, availability, infrastructure and information concerning the aircraft itself. The
need for intermediaries (brokers, broker platforms) only adds to the problem.
2.4.5 Bargaining power of the suppliers
Relevant suppliers include aircraft manufacturers and service partners. These include, in addition
to the Fixed Base Operators (FOO), oil companies, caterers, Air Traffic Control (ATC), providers of
flight planning services and so-called Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul companies (MRO). Among
aircraft suppliers, there is currently strong competition due to an oversupply of aircraft. The service
providers are in a strong negotiating position due to the current structure of General Aviation and
especially Business Aviation.
3

On this view, one can speak of a generally valid view for all markets.
Ratings are special theoretical and practical trainings and subsequent exam specific to one type of aircraft that will
entitle the pilot to fly this type of aircraft.

2.5 Operator / Broker / Broker platforms
2.5.1 Operator
An operator associated with BizAv operates one or more aircraft6 for the Business Aviation. An operator is either only operator of the aircraft (Operator) or owner and operator (Operator & Owner).
An operator requires appropriate state licenses that entitle him to operate business aircraft. The
licenses must be renewed periodically. The operator also ensures that all companies associated
with the organization, and in particular the personnel7 , have the appropriate qualifications and keep
them up-to-date. The operator is responsible for flight operations, responsibility is assigned to crew
or ground crew for the respective mission according to the qualifications of the persons deployed.
2.5.2 Broker
Brokers does not operate their own aircraft. A broker acts purely as intermediary between the
potential customer and the operator and without responsibility concerning the aviation aspect. He
selects the fitting aircraft from the operator for the customer, based on the latter´s requirements,r.
For this action, a mediation commission has to be paid. The flight itself is settled with the operator,
whereby it is not uncommon to buy quotas if they are offered. In principle, no specific business
license is required to practice as a broker in BizAv.
2.5.3 Business Aviation Broker Platforms
Broker platforms have emerged in recent years8 . These are accessible via Internet to a restricted
user group (operators, holders and brokers as well as agencies). In principle, these platforms
assume the role of an (additional) broker and are, however, primarily used by brokers or operators,
and not by customers, because of the high usage costs. A direct, electronic booking of flights is
not possible via these portals today, they only offer contact information or request forms.

3 Issues
An inspection of the macro environment of the GA sector and in particular the BizAv, shows framework conditions that affect the industry and in particular the supply and demand structure. These
include the economic, technological, ecological, political-legal and socio-cultural environment.
An analysis of current problem areas of the business sector, however, focuses on the examination
of the microcosm of GA and BizAv, adding structure field and the internal structure of the sector
to the logic of macro-influential factors.

The fields we have identified for the ”functioning” of the sector in terms of AVINOC, or current
problem areas, are information and communication management as well as the rapidly increasing
technologization.

3.1 Information and communication management
In the context of our solution, information and communication management means the generation,
procurement, provision and use of all relevant information in the relevant, temporal context, which
ensures the ”functioning” of the business sector in the sense of optimal planning and execution
of the respective tasks as well as the implementation of suitable information and communication
structures.

3.2 Technologization
Technologization as we understand it is the degree of automation and digitization of the information
and communication resources already used by market participants, as well as the degree of digitization of the entire sector in terms of the use of already available but not yet realized possibilities
of technology, digitization and automation.

3.3 Current characteristics
Within the identified problem areas of GA or BizAv, there are currently a number of different forms
of issues, which are illustrated by the following examples:
3.3.1 Empty Flights
Empty flights (empty legs) in the BizAv are flights without passengers to a destination to pick up
passengers or away from a destination after passengers have been dropped off. Empty flights
primarily mean a sub-optimal use of available resources and thereby cause low utilization of the
aircraft at a higher cost. The main reason for this is the lack of availability of consistent, up-to-date
and reliable information on flight capacities, fuel, crews and infrastructure. Although the balancing
and offering of such empty capacities is handled by platforms, they are often not connected and
therefore operate as islands.

13

Figure 2: Scheme of classic empty flights (empty legs, depicted in orange)

3.3.2 Intermediaries
The term ”intermediaries” in the existing context means mainly the brokers and broker platforms.
Brokers and broker platforms are required to establish the link between customers and operators
on the one hand, and to conduct business on behalf of clients and operators on the other hand. The
work of brokers is characterized by a lack of data availability, inconsistent and sometimes outdated
data, low data reliability and a high degree of flexibility using many different systems. This causes a
high manual coordination effort by e-mail, telephone and fax as well as complicated communication
structures resulting l large amounts of time spent and high system costs.

14

Figure 3: Scheme of structure today with intermediaries (brokers, platforms)

3.3.3 Inhomogeneity of the systems and increasing complexity
The information (data) required for optimal functioning is basically existent in the overall system (GA
and BizAv - macro and micro environment) and is used in individual areas in the form of isolated
solutions. However, a large number of different systems with sometimes considerable differences
in the technologies used are used in the overall system, and their system compatibility and data
homogeneity are very low. In addition, in all macro environments affecting the industry, speed and
pressure increase, which in turn increases the complexity of the overall system. Effects of this
are e.g. the high operational time required for all system participants due to difficult communication and cooperation, high system costs, increased risk and a high degree of error proneness.
This complicates cooperation and communication with business partners and customers and also
interferes with internal business processes9 .
9

Internal processes, if any, must always be adjusted or ”broken up” to respond to complex situations. Employees, for
example, are permanently prevented from doing their actual work by coordination or telephone calls. A flow in the

4 Future challenges
BizAv’s future demands on the market, in addition to solving the challenges of technological and
geopolitical change, are to continuously optimize and subsequently automate processes. This is
also required to accommodate future technologies that are currently in the developmental or even
pre-delivery stage, e.g. to integrate autonomous aircraft or semi-autonomous classic aircraft into
the organization. New technologies typically have a high level of readiness for automation and are
designed for autonomous operation. Organizations are therefore anxious to adapt their structures
to the increasing automation. This includes the automation of the functional or technical operation
of organizations operating in BizAv or its environment10 .
In order to safeguard BizAv’s growth and viability in the future, it will not only be necessary to optimize existing processes, but also to develop and win new markets or customer segments. The taxi
and cargo areas represent the segments with the greatest potential, as the claim to exclusivity on
board does not necessarily have to be higher than in scheduled or charter aircraft. Optimizing the
empty-flight problem globally would mean no losses for an individual company. Rather, the resulting
cost reduction would mean a win-win situation for the customer and the operator. The effect would
also have a positive effect between neighboring BizAv companies, since cooperation would be possible based on an enabler. Here, a cost reduction of up to 39% (see 3.3.1 on page 13), based on
the number of global empty flights, and in individual cases even of 66% or more. Price reductions
allow for the additional acquisition of new customer segments, without having to make fundamental
changes in the operation11 . Aircraft manufacturers would be able to bring new, simpler patterns to
the market - current trends are already pointing this way, in view of the growing market for micro
jets optimized for taxi flights.
As market growth increases, so does the degree of complexity implicit in the market. New solutions require more resources, especially when new technologies or systems are used. It will be
necessary to maintain and expand the existing flexibility of GA or BizAv (see 1.2 on page 6) in order
to make the actual system purpose of BizAv sustainable. This flexibility requires much faster processes in the future, which no longer require manual intervention. This not only applies to the actual
operative business, but also to the reporting in the strategic area as well as in the acquisition of
information and interaction with all stakeholders in the scope (infrastructure).
sense of an optimized process does not happen.
AVINOCs survey on aerospace found that there is a need of a high degree of digitization in BizAv. This was confirmed
by information from audits of the Research Funding Society (FFG) and the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (BAZ) in
Austria. Digitization is a basic requirement to make automation possible. The corresponding system status in
BizAv has hardly changed to this day. However, the complexity in the aviation business sector increased and digitization could not follow in this field. Third-party platforms produced a network of inhomogeneous islands. It must
be remembered that the lack of digitization can also be seen as an opportunity. That step, often associated with
additional expense of digitization, could be skipped and united under the aspect of automation. Such a declined process could for example be observed when introducing the cash register obligation in Croatia. Previously, electronic
cash registers in the hospitality industry were only available to a very limited extent; digitization was not present.
After that, almost everywhere a mobile app solution was used that met all requirements and at the same time
the processes were optimized and some automated. At that time, the development of mobile networks and new
opportunities in app development were regarded as enablers.
11
Apart from changed marketing activities or the on-board service

10

16

The infrastructure already provides certain approaches (information services at airports, portals, systems of fuel suppliers, engine monitoring using Blockchain from R&R, NMOC). However,
there are still major challenges, such as the integration of existing communication interfaces or
the simple integration of existing solutions in a single communication infrastructure or base data
layer. The communication infrastructure requires a high degree of flexibility while reducing complexity and has to cope with future challenges. Modular, simple, extensible and yet integrate-able
designs according to a defined standard offer a possibility to realize this. Without compromise,
the future system must ensure a high degree of security and stability in global deployment, and it
must not exclude participants.

5 Vision and Mission
5.1 History
AVINOC, in the form of the ”Aviation Network Operation Center”, was developed in 2008 as an
ERP cloud platform to optimize processes to a high degree and strengthen the business operation
of the companies within BizAv. Its design and integrated data structure allows it to fully cover
all the business processes of a BizAv company and fully integrates suppliers12 . From acquisition,
through the tendering to accounting and accounting modules, all financial aspects of the operational
business can be covered. The system makes it possible to make an offer to the end customer
immediately, since all (planning) data and system statuses are always up to date. In addition, the
complete technical operation was depicted and fully integrated in the design and connected with
the financial area. The technical area includes crew and qualification management, flight planning
with company flight plans and route calculation, various maps, all necessary government-defined
records and all necessary data for reporting all activities of the company13 . Furthermore, already
with the emergence of AVINOC, the idea was born to make available empty flights internally or via
APIs platforms or third-party websites. This is done on a voluntary basis by each licensee of AVINOC.
Only feasible flights are offered (spam protection, quality and customer satisfaction). Licensees can
access a defined set of flight data from pilots of other companies. On the one hand, this represents
an official obligation and, on the other hand, it made it possible to plan flights better on the basis
of the available duty times. Information on fuel suppliers and their availability, weather information,
handling and airport GATs and fees can also be shared on-demand with other organizations in the
system. AVINOC, in the form of the Aviation Network Operation Center, operates as a cloud solution
and has enabled airlines to streamline their operations for more than 9 years while reducing the
administrative burden and associated costs.
With the emergence of Blockchain as an enabler and the strengthening of Blockchain in public
perception, as well as far-reaching improvements and elimination of teething problems, AVINOC’s

transformation process - from the Aviation Network Operation ”Center” to the Aviation Network
Operation ”Chain” began. The focus was on transforming existing concepts of the underlying architecture into a Blockchain solution under the premise of a substantial simplification and the added
value of an integrated payment system, while at the same time improving security and stability
through the implicit mechanisms of cryptography.

5.2 Vision
Our vision of AVINOC is to create a unified, permissionless data base layer with an integrated payment system for general aviation and in particular for BizAv to make sustainable development possible. In doing so, we place particular emphasis on optimizing processes by fully automatizing them
to reduce communication flow times to near zero and, at the same time, allow payment for services
at the same speed. The means of our choice here is the Blockchain, which we specifically upgrade
for the purpose. We believe in BizAv as a motor for innovation and progress, and we believe in
particular that it will have far more potential in the future than may currently be imaginable in many
places. For us, AVINOC means a genuine and honest disruption14 in order to lay the foundation for
the future of BizAv and, as a result,enable autonomous flying for operational businesses on a global
basis15 .

5.3 Objectives and mission
To make our vision a reality, we will start by transforming BizAv’s existing processes and make them
less complex and less time-consuming. In the first instance, we address communication and issues
that currently lead to high financial overhead and include the key challenges of the BizAv renewal
process. Here, we focus on the two problem areas represented by intermediaries (brokers) and
empty flights. In the course of our further activity, we will try to reconcile processes with infrastructure and all stakeholders involved and (re-) define suitable interfaces. In demand management (or
operational research) and in later development, we view all problem areas from the perspective
of systems science with the help of System Dynamics16 . We see ourselves as a project designed
through and through for an open-source community and at the same time implementing all principles and methods of project and quality management in order to comply with aviation safety and to
make it sustainable. We would like to share our knowledge with the world as soon as we have been
able to lay the foundation with AVINOC as a Blockchain solution and have everyone actively participate in it. For this purpose, we have also scheduled appropriate resources to spread AVINOC in the

world17 . Using existing resources, we will create and operate the initial infrastructure necessary
for AVINOC and, as part of the project, we will expand it with strategic partners and authorities and let everyone participate in it. With AVINOC we will deliver a significant contribution to the future
of general business aviation, the BizAv.

5.4 Change
AVINOC is aware, or we are aware, that a ”disruption of general business aviation” can not happen
overnight. People always need time to adapt to changes in the environment. This is especially true
for complex markets and their stakeholders. Nor can new markets be developed instantaneously,
especially when it comes to changes in complex, situated structures, just as aviation. The process
must therefore be gradual, dynamic, voluntary and barrier-free. Additional efforts needed from the
involved companies and especially from the customer are to be avoided. We appreciate all these
aspects and consider analysis and change management to be valuable tools in our project. Our
experience as well as mistakes from the past enable us to preserve the ”big picture”, to gradually
rebuild or expand on it and, if necessary, to completely redesign it.

6 Solution
In particular, we would like to point out to readers of this white paper that this is not a technical
implementation guide. We discuss technical solutions insofar as the explanation requires. The
solution described below is AVINOC as the Aviation Network Operation ”Chain”. In accordance with
the defined problem areas and causal relationships, we focus our attention on eliminating these in
our solution and ultimately provide the appropriate conditions for the system.

6.1 Root cause analysis
The following influencing factors can be recorded in the system model as causes for the occurrence
of intermediaries and empty flights:
Communication time is required in all information acquisition processes. It increases with the
degree of complexity and the number of stakeholders involved in carrying out a flight. Manual
intervention, tuning or required approval of process steps increases the communication time
and consequently the entire process time. Likewise, manual decisions may cause process
crashes.
Transparency is currently virtually non-existent in BizAv, as all companies fear losing customers
to competitors. This leads to secrecy and and the companies isolating themselves. The

17

19

resulting low level of transparency leads to intensifying control loops (causal loops, from the
CLD) in which additional, time-consuming efforts can be identified as the main cause.
Process time (in general) is an additional factor which increases the overall time for planning a
flight together with communication time, with each additional loop (pass).
Process accesses are only digitized in places. In some places there are interfaces (NMOC18 ), but
these are inadequately interconnected, or not at all or their design is very provider-specific.
Integration requires additional adaptation efforts and updating on the supplier side and is
rarely exists for individual solutions.
Standards , there are many standard in aviation, but there are none for the coordination of BizAv
flights and planning, nor for procurement. All providers have their own structure within each
isolated solution (platform or app). Even large authority complexes, such as those of FAA
and EASA are inadequately compatible with each other in their systems. There is no uniform
protocol for the exchange of planning information.

6.2 Application and requirements
Aircraft can only be operated efficiently if the administrative and organizational environment provides suitable conditions. There should be no manual entries within the defined process flow (from
offer to payment), which could not already be replaced by automatisms today. Redundancies and
the manual or semiautomatic transfer or synchronization of data demand unacceptable additional
time and effort. All time spent in the system model increasing the systemic effort must be restricted in their effect or completely canceled out. Full digitization with inherent automation already
implicit in the design allows
– to meet future challenges in BizAv,
– to remedy failures of the past in this context,
– to create worldwide free access and
– sustainable operation with all its implications, such as to effect the required cost reduction.
For a model to produce integer data it must be based on consistent standards at information
and communication layer level. These define the structure and, in its technical realization as a
base layer including all necessary interfaces, allows the exchange of all relevant information for the
coordination of flights and infrastructure information of the BizAv. The model is permissionless, selfregulating and ensures the creation of integer data. The introduction of non-relevant information
or information that offers an advantage only to one market participant, are avoided by design,
in accordance with game-theoretical considerations and economic public interest. It will use a
18

Network Manager Operations Centre (NMOC, previously also CFMU) of Eurocontrol

20

technology that meets these requirements. Only Blockchain technology offers the suitable solution.
To cope with all eventualities, the classic Blockchain model only needs to be adapted to include
point-to-point privacy. The payment system, implicitly integrated into the Blockchain by design, is
an essential asset19 . As a result, the information flow and the financial flow are equally fast, with
the process speed in the system thus heading for its theoretical optimum.

6.3 Privacy-Classes
Since aviation business comprises organizations in competition to one another (see 2.1), fundamental questions about the architecture of the system need to be asked. An expanded, decentralized
and permissionless Blockchain can solve the apparent contradiction of transparency and desired
privacy.
6.3.1 Which data are readable for all market participants?
What is required to align the organization with the rest of the market? Which kind of coordination
does the market require? What is allowed to be transparent by definition? This is the kind of information that should be made available directly or indirectly (for example via brokers or portals),
such as information on flights, deploy-able crews (if they are self-employed or leased personnel),
information about the infrastructure (airports, handling, opening hours), NOTAMs20 , etc. This information must always be available anywhere. Solving the empty flight problem„ for example, is
directly related to unrestricted access to data of this kind.
6.3.2 What must be visible to market participants?
From an aviation point of view, this is information that guarantees the safety of aviation. These
data need not be public in nature, but every legitimate stakeholder in the system must have access
to it. These are data that are required to be recorded by the authorities and companies must
submit them on request or at periodic intervals. For example, pilot logs must be known to every
company in which the crew member has or is planning to perform duty (Duty-Times regulations).
Third parties, as organizations (with the exception of authorities) who have never worked together
with the crews, do not need this information. The same applies to airplanes changing operator,
here the entire data must be made available. Nevertheless, protection of this information is still a
primary concern, since - in accordance with recent developments such as the implementation of
the GDPR21 , these would be considered personal data.

19

This is a puristic consideration considering the original purpose.
Notice (s) to Airmen, are orders and information on temporary or permanent changes to the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP)
21
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is a regulation of the European Union for the protection of personal
data, trends there are worldwide.

20

21

6.3.3 Which data are only readable for business partners?
The essential issue is: Which trade secrets have to be kept and what are they? An identifiable
customer or an agreement with a supplier can be understood as data of this kind. This applies to
most contract contents in this context, with the exception of general information for finding the
contracting parties, official price lists or general, publicly available information.
6.3.4 General requirements
Thus, following general requirements can be deduced:
– Data must be integer, homogeneous and transparent according to the definitions of the
standard
– Data that are to be completely protected or visible only to a subset of stakeholders, have no
place in the Blockchain
– Data must be processed in real time to prevent delays in intensifying systemic loops
– The system must be decentralized and permissionless so as not to present an entry barrier
– In order to be accepted in the market, the technical barrier for the implementation in 3rd
party applications is to be kept low
– Regulations and laws must be given special consideration in aviation

6.4 Approaches
The answers to the above questions have shown that a Blockchain solution can meet all requirements. Aviation requires high transaction speed to meet the demands of ad-hoc information flow.
The system must therefore be specially adapted with additional components. The Blockchain is
mainly responsible for the handling of general, public data and serves - in addition to the classic
payment system - as a parameterizable trigger system for advanced smart contracts. It is not
possible to map all the relevant options and links apart from normal operation, which occur in aviation on a daily basis, in classic smart contracts. Already in the handling of simple flights, classic
smart contracts would not work efficiently in case of an extraordinary event, and might fail in more
serious or exceptional events. Solving the resulting problems, such as reversed transactions, cancellations, etc., additional system energy would be required.
Again and again, extraordinary events occur in aviation (such as route deviations due to weather
events or geopolitical and geographical circumstances), and complex and - from a global viewpoint,
- non-uniform judiciary prevails. To illustrate this, a simple flight and its payment could be handled
by smart contract. If everything works smoothly, the debt could simply be settled (flight operations). However, as soon as an occurrence prevent the debtor from paying off the debt, all situational distinctions in case-law would inevitably have to be made in accordance with prevailing law,

22

transnationally and, in particular, aviation transport guidelines. These are complex, non-uniform
and sometimes contradictory regulations22 that would produce a highly complex and extremely
error-prone contract on the one hand and, on the other hand, could not be reproduced by code
because of contradictions that occur in places. A smart contract with a fault23 is therefore to
be rejected for safety and efficiency reasons in aviation. The additional time and effort needed to
eliminate errors in smart contracts is in contradiction to the basic idea of optimization. AVINOC
therefore integrates in its Blockchain a generic Point2Point Smart Contract (P2PSC, see 6.4.2 on
page 25) business relationship management system, enabling advanced smart contracts based
on traditional contracts and fully compliant with jurisprudence.
6.4.1 Blockchain
The Blockchain in AVINOC allows the exchange of all relevant information which (according to 6.3.1
on page 21 or 6.3.2 on page 21) must be available in principle. This includes all information on
flights, such as the aircraft identifier or pattern (type of aircraft), departure and arrival times (in
UTC), and information about the respective airport (ICAO24 -Code). In addition, if desired by the operator, the freely available capacity25 is indicated and stored as a parameter in the transaction. This
information comes from AVINOC’s integrated slot management and allows simple status queries
based on a simple traffic light scheme (red, yellow, green). Subsequently, the status queries are
also necessary for effecting a flight booking. All information is available in the status tree. They
contain all related resources and their further availabilities in underlying branches26 . This way,
AVINOC implicitly ensures an ad hoc information flow. The user (operator, customer, supplier) recognizes which elements are missing for a flight. Third parties can adapt to it and ad hoc adjust
their projects, such as flights or sub-projects, such as crew deployment, fuel deliveries, etc. to new
or changed statuses. Customers of passenger or cargo flights can thus keep the status of their
business plans up-to-date. In the event of cancellations, it can be used to immediately book a new
slot based on further availabilities. In the future, AIs will also play a major role in predicting the development of status in time series and on the basis of the basic possibility of the analyzable behavior
of the system or of all individual market participants27 . All relevant information that makes a flight
possible in the first place and has impact on its planning, is thus coordinated by design within the
Blockchain and changes according to the required standard in mutual dependence. This allows for
the emergence of a living ”aviation organism” that knows its ”system status” at all times and can
respond dynamically to changing situations.

For example, there are openly known inconsistencies in the EASA’s duty-time regulations regarding time-of-flight
definitions between local time and UTC.

For example, the flight depends on the availability of the aircraft, which in turn depends on the fuel to be purchased

The development of AI-driven systems for predictions is not, for the time being, part of the development of AVINOC.

23

6.4.1.1 Introduction and initialization For a flight to take place, an aircraft is required28 . The
aircraft must therefore be initialized once in the Blockchain to form the basis for flights. For the
initialization of the aircraft, in the sense of a ”high value asset” in the Blockchain, the transaction
costs will be higher than, for example, for crews or individual, relevant persons in operational function. Depending on the economic performance parameters of each class of objects (aircraft, pilots,
stewards, operations managers, suppliers, etc.) that are brought into the AVINOC Blockchain, corresponding to functional units of a supply chain model, as container, there are more or less high
transaction costs. Thus, upon entry into the system, a corresponding protection against participants or actions unwanted on the market is already granted by the game-theoretical approach
implicit in the Blockchain29 .
Mind you, the Blockchain is and remains self-regulating in this approach. Once objects have been
introduced in the Blockchain (containers), they can then simply be passed around, for example,
the aircraft between different operators. They always use the same, real object and represent it
virtually. Another positive side effect is, for example, that the change of identifiers due to a change
of ownership (change of owner) always remains completely traceable. The aircraft, as a virtual
container, always remains the same. The information from the container follows the principles of
a perfect log, as a Blockchain is in general. The same applies to pilots and other objects virtualized
in the Blockchain and, subsequently, to all flights that have been finalized. Thus, the system meets
the requirements of the authorities and additionally increases the safety of aviation. Economically,
the respective organization has full cost control and cost transparency - globally, on an integer and
homogeneous database.
6.4.1.2 Business operations In daily flight scheduling operations, each entry in the block chain is
tagged as a transaction with variable transaction costs. AVINOC’s underlying design strives to make
the transaction costs of all flight components self-financing, demanding only a very small part of the
savings from the elimination of intermediaries and all related costs. For a full-availability (“green”)
status, flights in AVINOC will require a ready-to-operate aircraft and ready-for-action crews in accordance with aviation regulations (e.g., two-person cockpit operation for passenger transportation on
commercial flights). Availability of crews and aircraft implies, on the one hand, the physical availability at a specific location at a given time and, on the other hand, the existence of necessary
qualifications and recurring checks and exams that have been passed30 . Once available flights are
put into the Blockchain, gaps resulting from the empty leg problem, can be closed by all market
participants. The planning information available in the Blockchain is immediately known to all market participants. Other operators, crews, or platform providers can identify all empty-legs or flights
tagged for jet-sharing based on the location and time information available globally and instantly
in the Blockchain. Changes are also identifiable and immediately be compensated by replacement

higher than the (reprehensible) purpose, which also can not target a single market participant, then abuse will not
find a breeding ground (because too expensive).

In the aviation context, it is also referred to as qualification management or aircraft checks.

flights.
It is possible to react to large-scale and extraordinary events31 immediately and scheduling can
be adapted accordingly. Advanced infrastructure information preserves full predictability. The
focus here is not on the cause for the changes, but on immediate global communication of the
change. In accordance with to existing agreements made via P2PSC, default reactions for exceptional cases can also be defined. If companies in AVINOC are not yet in a contractual relationship
with each other, the P2PSC model integrated in AVINOC allows the connection via flight information. Thus, AVINOC creates a BizAv market network that is individually tailored to specific needs
and preferences.
6.4.1.3 The flight customer We talk about ”empowering” the customer and we mean it that way.
A closer look reveals that all information underlying the Blockchain provides the basis for a direct
booking platform - even for end users. They only need to be made available to the market through
apps or platforms32 . The customer is able to instantaneously identify and book his relevant flights
- based on planning information. He represents, as well as the original broker, a client, whose
order has to be fulfilled by the operator. For the protection of the customers, be they individual
customers only booking a single seat or business men booking the complete aircraft, a penalty
system is integrated in the Blockchain. This system can be customized by all participants in the
market, whereby AVINOC can provide an offset in the design. Cancellation conditions are defined by
the P2PSC system and come into effect under specific circumstances previously defined between
the contractual partners. Payment is made immediately and directly in the Blockchain according to
the terms of the contract. For example, the cancellation of a flight by the operator allows immediate
compensation payment (possible set by authorities) or individual amounts of penalties. The time
factor plays an essential role here. Until shortly before the flight, a substitute flight can immediately
be found from another provider (operator), also due to the extensive database in the Blockchain
and its transparency. This will reduce the number of actual cancellations of flights on the supply
and demand sides and replace them successively with another model. AVINOC attaches great
importance to promoting the self-regulatory nature of the market.
6.4.2 Point2Point-Smart-Contracts (P2PSC)
The existing Blockchain will be adapted with a generic P2PSC system. This allows the use of advanced smart contracts that are concluded between two market participants. The digital contracts
are fully compliant with the law with regards to national or international judiciaries and especially in
terms of aviation law considerations. They merely represent an expanded electronic image of conventional contracts and are clearly identifiable by signatures. The connection happens the same
way as the beginning of a business relationship, consciously and temporarily, under full control of
31

Natural disasters, geopolitical circumstances, major weather conditions
This is usually done by AVINOC’s built-in interfaces and apps, and subsequently by third parties as part of open source
thinking or strategic partnerships.

25

the business partners. The basic hierarchy model is independent and allows network or island-like
connections between the participants. All participants retain full control over their contracts and
can freely decide which network structure they want to form or belong to. The Blockchain serves
as the basis for triggering the contracts, whereby parameters for quantities can be included on
triggers. The Blockchain also helps to gain information about potential partners or suppliers. The
P2PSC in AVINOC are activated by triggers (transactions) via Blockchain. Here, too, in accordance
with economic parameters, transaction costs are incurred, which can be individually negotiated
and designed between the partners by means of a contract. Multiple triggering, with additional
(quantity) parameters available in the Blockchain, is possible33 as well as the one-time triggering of
a contract and its subsequent termination34 . Contracts can also be entered ”freely” into the system and found via flights in the Blockchain of each or only a limited number of users (see 6.4.2). The
offering of tickets for empty flights, for example, is such a contract. With the help of the P2PSC, the
degree of decentralization of AVINOC increases. Individual contracts can be concluded according
to current law, but they can still be managed and executed completely electronically (see 6.4.2).
In addition, contracts in AVINOC comply with aviation law requirements and fully obey the terms of
transport of a company. An elaborate design of a code logic is not required. The contracts include
bidirectional criteria to set contract terms top-down or bottom-up35 .
For BizAv companies as well as for the related aviation infrastructure and supply industry, this
means an easy way to transform existing contracts with suppliers into the digital world without
any noteworthy effort. Furthermore, the possibility to immediately conclude and execute a contract without further manual input as well as immediate payment by means of AVINOCoins, that
are integrated in the Blockchain, constitute significant additional benefits. In the end it will form a
cohesive, global ”organism” in the form of a decentralized marketplace network within BizAv, There
is no compulsion, each participant of AVINOC can decide completely independently, based on the
information available in the Blockchain, who to commission as supplier (opt-in), which customer to
fly with or which operator to choose. P2PSC creates islands that can chain together without constraints and autonomously. The Blockchain serves as ”activator” on the one hand and as ”executor”
of the defined contracts on the other hand
Smart Treaty Procurement (STP) P2PSC introduces order and contract management within
AVINOC. Contracts contain the complete, digitally usable specification of the desired order and are
digitally signed. For the purpose of complete automation, contracts that are interdependent can be
triggered by the Blockchain. This results in a chain reaction in which all contractual components and
contracts of subcontractors and their suppliers are themselves triggered. For example, an open
contract representing an offered flight is booked by a customer on the Internet under its contract
terms. The flight sets off a cascade of further, one-off or permanent contracts with e.g. connected
to the personnel (pilots), fuel suppliers or handling agents. This cascade is activated by a single
33

e.g. Contract with a fuel supplier and triggering of a certain amount of fuel in the refueling process at a certain time
e.g. buying a ticket or operating a flight
35
e.g. directly executable by the system, terms of cancellation on the customer or operator side, discounts, etc.
34

26

trigger in the Blockchain, the booking and payment of the ticket, immediate and legally valid. Thus,
AVINOC allows the full empowerment of the customers with just one click. The Blockchain takes
over the cascaded triggering of all connected orders and makes it possible to compare the financial
status of all involved parties or to present this availability in advance36 . The customer can only
book the flight if he has the required amount of AVINOCoins in his wallet. Automation or triggering
of further orders to subcontractors is also possible with a parameterized token. For example, the
parameter could contain the booked seats. On the supplier side, for example, the quantity of fuel
is defined and settled promptly. Linking the contracts provides AVINOC with an instant information
and financial flow that promptly provides status updates in the Blockchain. The affected containers
(aircraft, flights, suppliers) are thus always kept up to date and other participants in the system
can adjust to it - again automatically, according to their contract cascades.
An essential element of this approach in AVINOC is the protection of trade secrets37 simultaneously coupled with transparency of all processes defined by the Blockchain architecture (see 6.3.1
on page 21) and status. In the generic approach, contracts are negotiated only between participants who know each other (mesh, see also 6.4.2 on page 25). Contracts with legal character
will be digitally signed. Contractor and client can freely define their contracts and all further dependencies. The token can be processed using client contract management provided in AVINOC. This
approach provides the possibility to integrate AVINOC in a carrier in stages - thus effect a smooth
change. Companies can freely decide which contracts to define and which partners to work with,
once, permanently or even parameterized, in the course of permanent agreements with suppliers
on suitable terms.
6.4.2.1 Bidirectional Smart Criteria (BSC) Bidirectional Smart Criteria are applicable in every
contract at will and can be defined by the user or the contract partner according to the possibilities
in AVINOC. They define certain parts of the contract, that need to be fulfilled, in digital form. They are
readable fully automated, standardized and can be passed on to suppliers if required. Each supplier
can add further criteria (hierarchy) and pass on the existing ones. Here, certain criteria may be
mandatory, such as the definition of the number of crew members for a flight, or the minimum
amount of fuel that the aircraft needs for holding and reserve. Thus, on the one hand, it is possible
to prove that own supply contracts are valid under the criteria of higher-level orders and, on the
other hand, that the conditions of flight safety can be fulfilled. This makes possible
– the ”the contract guarantees”, an assurance with regard to the feasibility of the services
included in the orders (was the right services ordered on the right conditions, in the right
quantity, in the right quality, etc.),
– knowledge about data properties (criteria) to tier-n without seeing actual data and trade
secrets (zero-knowledge-proof),
36
37

e.g. in case of insufficient funds, supplies or resources available to a contractor
No knowledge of third parties regarding internal processes, contracts, volumes, etc. across all tier, ie < tier n-1 or
> tier n + 1

– the strengthening of aviation security and
– the traceability via the corresponding triggers in the Blockchain in the sense of a complete
log
6.4.3 Infrastructure data
All aeronautical infrastructure information relevant to flight operations, such as weather information, NOTAMs, ATC concerns, warnings, etc., even if it is purely data, can be accessed and treated
as services provided by directly involved suppliers within the AVINOC scope, using P2PSC and getting paid for with AVINOCoins. Here, too, is a progress from fixed costs and lump sums to real costs
of services actually obtained. This leads to cost reduction for aviation companies and an increase
in quality on the part of the providers, since services can now be evaluated more in detail due to
the increased transparency.
6.4.4 Transactions, payment and costs
In the case of transactions in the Blockchain, there are fixed as well as individual transaction costs
agreed between market participants. These cover, among other things, the Blockchain operation
and guarantee the required level of security and protection from malfunction and disruptive activities. In principle, apart from the one-time ”purchase”, ie the initialization of the object, the use of
AVINOC means only variable costs. This allows complete and simple financial planning based on
the order situation, similar to the resource consumption of energy or fuel. Here, AVINOC is able to
show in detail all the expected costs based on the contracts concluded with the suppliers and the
information available from flight planning. The flight customer thus receives a precise offer. Leaving aside the integrated payment system, whose prices depend on the market participants and
their services, and which can be customized, the costs for all transactions within the Blockchain
are low. The reduction of costs effected by foregoing intermediaries (brokers and their portal solutions) are fully visible to the company and are only marginally affected by transaction costs in the
Blockchain. From the point of view of an airline or the aviation industry, AVINOC basically finances
itself in operation.
6.4.5 Stakeholder and User-Stories
Because of AVINOC’s focus to be the interface between all stakeholders and the aviation industry,
both B2B and B2C segments are given equal attention. Usecases should not be understood as
AVINOC’s own. Instead they present the many possibilities that AVINOC brings to 3rd parties like
system integrators, app developers, big airline companies, etc. as well as the passenger. Following
are a few examples of possible interactions between different stakeholders which should further
explain this topic with specific usecases:

28

Booking an aircraft (BizAv) for a specific reason - general view Business customers as well
as private customers and organizations are given direct access to all available aircraft and can
then book their aircraft directly from the operator. The AVINOCoin is on the one hand used as
utility for all transactions (adding the flight to the Blockchain, booking the flight, booking the crew,
etc.) and on the other hand for direct payment of the flight and all related fees (Crews, Handling,
Airport-Fees, etc.).
Booking a flight (Airline/Charter) - general view With AVINOC, passengers are able to view
and book flights from all available offers, that are provided by airlines, charter-companies and even
by small BizAv companies. All offers will be made available by 3rd parties like (Airlines, Travel agencies and Portal-Operators) through the use of apps. No company is favored here. Preferences can
always by filtered out on BSC base.
Services from Suppliers (BizAv): Handling agents are needed at GAT’s to provide support for
the customers, monitor the refueling of the aircraft and match the flight plans. These agents
stand in direct relation to the operator (or in some cases the subcontractor) and have a valid
contract according to the STP. When planing, the blockchain triggers the availability of services
that the handling agent can provide. It also compensates the contractually defined services, after
the payment from the customer, directly according to BSC and all their triggered positions.
Planing, Provision and Payment of Crews: Aside from services that result from an employment,
crews can also be paid for their planned and/or performed services (depends on the contract).
In this case, the Blockchain is able to determine the exact supply and availability of crews at the
needed location. The planing of this can be done by the crews (self-employed) themselves or by
operators/airlines if they are employed there. In addition to this, AVINOC has the power to compensate for accuring changes or outages because all data is available at any time. This makes
individual uses on the base of predictions possible. That means, even if a crews is not present at
the needed location before the time they are needed, the system can determine their arrival there
and plan their next deployment. Payment of the crew is also handled the same way as it is with
sub-companies in the previous chapter.
6.4.5.1 Relevant Stakeholders
industry can be defined as:

At first sight, all relevant stakeholders for AVINOC in the aviation

– Passengers (end consumer) - searching for either flights or additional services, requesting
or booking and paying
– Operators - (BizAv) - Planing and offering flights, paying suppliers (crews, handling, fuel, etc.),
payment

29

– Airlines - Tickets and additional services for planned flights (schedule or charter), paying
crews, catering etc. - payment
– Handling-agents - Offering and planing of services, payment
– Crews - Offering services, payment
– Catering - Offering and planing of services, payment
– Fuel-suppliers - Offering and planing of services, payment
– Meteo/ATC/airports/etc. - provision of services, payment
– Exchanges and platforms (airlines as well) - Offering gateways as well as buying and selling of
AVINOCoin
– other (partners from the MRO-section, other Blockchains, aeronautics supervision, authorities, etc. - (with interest in AVINOC’s business)

6.5 Platform
AVINOC is a Blockchain adapted for contract management, P2PSC. It is a mesh network Blockchain
hybrid with autarkic nodes. Participants define permissions only on their data and only in the P2PSC
system. The Blockchain itself in AVINOC remains permissionless, transparent and decentralized true to the inventor´s intentions.f
6.5.1 DAPIs, 3rd-Parties, Standards
In addition to the functionalities already explained, AVINOC offers distributed interfaces (distributed
API, DAPI) for third parties38 . All data is stored in AVINOC in SI39 -units only, including aviation data.
Therefore, the first release also includes the implementation of conversion functions for input to
and output from the system, which are freely configurable depending on the region and operation
on the user side40
. AVINOC effects the standardization on the database and ensures complete compatibility in
accordance with a homogeneous and integer database41 .

6.5.2 Approach and stages of development
The technical implementation of the AVINOC Blockchain is effected in the form of several consecutive logical development stages. In Stage one, the basis of the Blockchain incl. all necessary
standards (see 6.5.1)) is developed, which already enables the integration and provision of all relevant data of all market participants. Containers such as aircraft and crews are already included.
At the same time, the development of DAPIs and clients for 3rd party applications takes place. In a
second step, further infrastructure (containers), such as suppliers of fuel, handling agents, etc, will
be implemented in the already executable model. In Stage two, development of the P2PSC system
will be effected at the same time in order to design the contracting42 . In the third step of development, the platform for authorities, ATC etc. will be opened and further infrastructure as well as
further smart criteria will be added.
The development of 3rd party applications can take place at the same time at all stages of development, if necessary. Integrating the open source community into the project is a key aspect,
however AVINOC will determine the when and how up to the implementation of all planned applications.
The initial roll-out after the first development phase will be effected after the construction and
configuration of the infrastructure (nodes) and is expected to take place in Q4 2018. We will make
use of already existing resources of our partners and adapt them according to the required and
predicted capacity and load requirements. We work with GitLab internally and for distribution on
our nodes. In accordance with the requirements, we set up different projects / repos and always
use three branches Initially, only our production branch will be available on GitHub. Up to a date yet
to be determined, the corresponding repos / projects on GitHub can only be changed by the AVINOC
team43 . Roll-outs are then scheduled after the first (Genesis) release (CD / CI). Corresponding
schedules will also be published. Any source code for Blockchain (Core), DAPIs, etc. will be available
on GitHub via our account44 and maintained by our team. We have registered a large number of
avinoc. *-Domains in advance for corresponding projects or side acts. These will consequently be
used from project start and support AVINOC as a brand or during the implementation of community
projects and events.

6.6 Competitors
Competitors are companies that have a competitive relationship with AVINOC as a provider of comparable services. The competitive relationship exists if both parties attempt to place similar services within the same group of users and thus affect the competitive behavior of one another.
In the context of our services, a distinction must also be made between the technologies used
(Blockchain / conventional). The target group is the same for all competitors, however, the use of
42

initially with a sufficient set of smart criteria
Irrespective of this, expansion projects by third parties can emerge as independent entities at the same time- feel
free.

Blockchain technology drastically improves the approach and accessibility of the target group.
6.6.1 Competitors - Blockchain Technology
Analyzes of the Blockchain or “crypto world” have not yet identified any direct competitors who
have made it their business to deal with empty leg flight issues, intermediaries or the handling and
operating business in BizAv. AVINOC is currently the only Blockchain solution for BizAv worldwide
that is being positioned on the market according to its system purpose and content (see 6.3.4 on
page 22).
There are already Blockchain projects in the related environment connected to the subject of
GA or BizAv, but are part of the periphery of the AVINOC solution. There exists, for example, ”aeron”
(https://aeron.aero/), who have made flight schools, pilots and consequently the increase of aviation security through transparent logs their system focus. ”Windingtree” (https://windingtree.com/)
serves the aviation-related scheduled airline business, trying to replace global players and wellknown travel platforms in this area. The GSC Aviation company, which has not yet appeared in public,
is planning an ICO to operate in the supply chain in the MRO area (https://www.linkedin.com/company/gscaviation/). All of these companies are not in fact direct competitors because of the services offered
and therefore do not pose a threat to AVINOC. We rather see opportunities for cooperation and a
possible connection of solutions and knowledge, because these solutions could complement each
other.
6.6.2 Competitors - conventional (not Blockchain) Technology
There is a number of apparent competitors and existing solutions in the current non-Blockchain
world. However, due to the technology used, these, unlike AVINOC, can meet the challenges posed
only to a very limited extent. First and foremost there is the ”avinode” platform, which has become
one of the world’s largest marketing and advertising platforms for business charter flights. The
business model of avinode, however, differs in all the important ways from what a Blockchain solution requires or makes it possible. Unlike AVINOC, avinode is set up centralistically. Direct booking
e.g. is not possible in this system. Tests by the FDSC showed that 9 out of 10 flights offered by
avinode could not be executed. In addition, there are high costs for access, which is controlled by
avinode alone. In our estimation, avinode is unlikely to be able to fundamentally change its own business model and operational structure in the near future to launch an AVINOC-style block switching
solution. Aside from avinode, there is a large number of platforms dedicated to the specific subjects of empty flights or charters in BizAv. However, these ever only address a specific area or
problem area of GA or BizAv, but not the entire area, as AVINOC does. In addition, these are not
based on Blockchain technology either, they are economic islands and barely connected and thus
have the same basic issues as all other non-Blockchain solutions.
Judging from the the lack of technological solutions on the market, combined with the inflexibility
of many established companies, we see only a small risk of getting a serious competitor at the start
of AVINOC in 2018. This assessment furthermore suggests that the use of Blockchain technology

32

is not a primary business goal of many companies, since the topic itself as well as the ”intrinsic
system understanding” seem to be absent in many places. We can therefore make the most of
our technical and technological advantage and the flexibility of our start-up.

6.7 Quality and risks
We serve aviation with our system. This is an economic sector that we consider to be particularly
worthy of protection and whose integrity is to be upheld. Therefore, we avoid unwanted risks already in the planning phase and, in doing so, also proceed according to the ISO 9001 model in order
to meet the highest quality standards. Regarding regulations, we would again like to refer you to the
already existing provisions in our general terms and conditions (https://www.avinoc.com/terms),
which allow us initial, international business operation.
Regulations AVINOC includes a token (or coin) to handle the cash flows in the Blockchain and to
supplement the information stream. AVINOC is aware of the risks that crypto currencies are
currently experiencing. We are also aware that, in the current spirit of optimism, many countries and public authorities can not keep pace with progress. This may create uncertainties
in the use or implementation of Blockchain solutions with payment function in countries that
generally provide legal certainty. Therefore,new regulations are being introduced in many
places - and will be so with increasing likelihood in the future - that could also affect AVINOC.
Due to the current situation, we have therefore chosen Hong Kong as our location because it
gives us a degree of legal certainty, at least for the next two years. The use of AVINOC must
be possible worldwide and remain secure during the course of market entry and, consequently, operation. We therefore strive to cooperate with the main aviation authorities (FAA,
Eurocontrol, etc.) and international organizations (ICAO, IAOPA, IATA, etc.). 45 . Likewise, we
are trying to uphold AVINOC in its system purpose and to ensure the aspects ”transparent”,
”decentralized” and ”permissionless”, while keeping it compliant with all existing regulations
of the financial market. In order to achieve this goal, we work only with certain agencies and
partners (eg. coinfinity, blockpit) and list our tokens or coins only on exchange markets that
follow the relevant regulations. We strongly oppose money laundering and the financing of illegal activities and plan and develop AVINOC with special regard to these aspects. The same
procedure was already followed during the development and operation of the ERP- Cloud
(Aviation Network Operation Centers), to pass the biannual audits of the Austrian Aviation
Authority (BAZ). It was paramount to avoid any risk of losing of operational effectiveness and
to ensure the highest quality in terms of safety, stability and conformity.
Development Looking at the expertise of our team and its composition, we see only a very low risk
of not reaching our goal. Nevertheless, we counteract it with seminars and permanent, lifelong learning - last not least from other team members. We are especially concerned with
the understanding and the underlying philosophy of Blockchain. Regarding the development
45

Corresponding measures have been started.

33

location Graz / Austria and its organization and human resources development, we see a
slightly increased risk of not being able to hire suitable personnel in a timely manner. We are
already aware of that issue and have therefore taken appropriate measures and if necessary,
our partners can support us. Purchasing technology or outsourcing development is not an
option for us. The quality of the services currently available on the market for Blockchains
either does not meet our standards or it is too expensive. Likewise, security aspects must
be observed in order to protect the interests of our community. We like to split up the work
and we value distributed work as well as creativity, and we recognize the knowledge of our
employees and partners as the most important asset of AVINOC. Therefore, we attach great
importance to a stable company, in order to avoid the risk of knowledge drain through personnel turnover. Corresponding measures for knowledge management have been mapped.
One essential approach is to avoid complexity and rigid hierarchy within the organization - it
has consequently been planned flat and highly interconnected.
Systems/Infrastructure Our world is changing, attacks on the cyberspace are daily occurrences.
Our team has gained more than 10 years of team experience in operating highly sensitive
systems on the Internet. The same has been true for the security of wallets, be they ”cold” or
”hot”, since 2014. This has allowed our team to develop a very good awareness of security
issues within this context over the years. For us, the GDPR also represents an instrument of
security for the EU46 . We are committed to security-by-design, which allows for cost-efficient
operation. All our systems and security solutions are developed in-house. We almost exclusively use software that has proven itself or could be intensively tested. We abstain from the
purchase of software whose source code we can not see. However, this increases the need
for quality control and quality assurance. We are counteracting this by using solid quality
management and have already defined appropriate functions
Crypto-currency risks are currently prevalent in the crypto currency market. Therefore, payment
for goods and services is often only possible with the help of ”intermediaries” in order to reduce losses due to exchange rate risk. For the stability of AVINOC in its Utilization phase,
we have designed a system in which the price or performance can remain stable, independent from external price fluctuations that could affect AVINOCoins and the trading within
AVINOC47 . We minimize the risk of jeopardizing the development budget through price fluctuations on the market after the sale of tokens by means of sound financial management
and the constitution of reserves. We focus more on the security aspect of keeping a certain
proportion of Fiat money available and less on the possibility of speculating on the amount of
crypto money (ETH / BTC) purchased48 . We calculated the development budget according
to these criteria, and, gradually, the selling price of our tokens and the underlying distribution

model will correspond to them49 . We would like to state that in the world of crypto-currency
there cannot be any precise predictions about the development of courses over a longer period of time (at least not from today’s perspective). Therefore, the financial security of our
project and thus the securing of the development budget, including all accompanying measures (marketing, sales, strategic partners, etc.), is more important to us than a high, but
highly uncertain speculative profit50 . We recognize the potential of the crypto world, understand its character and are responsible for our employees and their families in the here and
now. With AVINOC we try to establish a solution with which we will be able to move with all
the ”streams” in the real world in the near future.
Aviation Risks in aviation or competition of the industry have already been discussed in the chapter 6.6 on page 31. We consider the risks of a changing market, which could endanger the
development of AVINOC, as very unlikely to occur because of the inertia of the market and
our organizational structure and solution. The risk of not being able to enter into the necessary strategic partnerships is estimated to be equally low, as aviation is always striving
to optimize profitability and to increase security. Likewise, we are pleased to see that the
aviation sector is currently undergoing major changes and major manufacturers, such as
Rolley Roys, Airbus or Air Asia are beginning to implement Blockchain solutions. To minimize
further risks in terms of market development, appropriate funds have also been budgeted
(see Use of funds).
License for aviation business. At the moment, we do not need any aviation business license to
develop and consequently establish AVINOC. Likewise, our system is not primarily relevant in
terms of air traffic safety, it has no direct influence on the process of air traffic nor does it
deal with the quality and certification of, for example, spare parts. Air traffic regulations or
their changes therefore represent only a minor risk restricting operations. AVINOC primarily
serves the business side of the market and allows status inquiries about information that
has already been verified by means of the needed qualifications of the participants - and only
enter the system if the contracting parties are in agreement. This also implies the use of BSC,
which may be required from the query side. The responsibility to provide data in a manner
relevant to aviation law lies with the respective participant. In this context AVINOChain checks
the quality of the data (by design) and enables an integer basis. If necessary, our experts are
able to obtain further approvals, which comply with all aviation regulations in order to have
AVINOC certified in this regard.
Scenario-analysis analysis. We refrain from a scenario analysis, but note that, according to initial
cost estimates, sums below USD $8 million would mean greater uncertainty in the development of AVINOC, including all accompanying measures, regarding a successful launch, or
49

We would like to point out explicitly that we can make changes depending on the situation, according to our terms
and conditions. This is done solely to protect AVINOC and its community.

business plans.

7 Development projections for the future of BizAv in 2025
In a 2010 Delphi study conducted by the European Business School (EBS) in Paris, France, a total
of 25 projections were developed on seven topics (customer behavior, growth drivers, value added,
business models, environmental factors, substitution potentials and technologies). The following
excerpt provides a brief overview of interesting future scenarios in the context of the potential
development opportunities and activities of AVINOC. [see. Lang u. a., 2012a, S.97ff]
– New, smaller aircraft and jet types that allow long haul flights and transatlantic point-to-point
connections will be available to BizAv.
– Traffic from, to and within emerging markets (especially Brazil, Russia, India, China and the
Middle East) will be the main business aviation growth drivers.
– Demand for business aviation will exceed the projected annual growth rate for general aviation.
– Business aviation will increasingly provide access to remote areas and free trade areas.
– Airport dedicated to business aviation airports will develop.
– Very light jets (VLJs) and air taxi services will increasingly be used to meet short-distance
demand (see, e.g., Eclipse 550).
– Number of medical transports in chartered business jets will increase sharply.
– Chartered business jets will increasingly be used for emergency freight transport.
– Business aviation customers will increasingly demand efficient and convenient aviation services without time loss.
– Business aviation customers will increasingly demand integrated one-stop door-to-door services (one-stop-shopping).
– The use of business aviation is socially accepted.
– Members of the business aviation transport chain (airlines, airports, air traffic control, etc.)
will work together in system partnerships

8 Outlook - Development Potential for Airlines and Charter
Even in scheduled and charter flights, intermediaries in the form of booking platforms and price
comparison portals have entered the market in steadily increasing numbers over the past 20
years. The original idea behind these intermediaries was to increase the transparency of available
offers from the airlines, which would, on the one hand, increase the potential passengers´ benefit through better access to information, and on the other hand improve the airlines´ potential
capacity utilization.
Since then, however, the platforms´ and portals´ market power has grown to such an extent
that, on the one hand, the airlines´contribution margins have come under massive pressure, caused
e.g. by the portals pitting the airlines against each other through artificially created non-transparencies,
quotations, etc., and on the other hand, air ticket prices for customers are sometimes far above the
regular prices offered by the airlines because of additional fees charged by the platforms. Moreover, bookings via these portals are often cumbersome and sometimes non-transparent. In particular, hidden costs and obscure contractual components make it difficult to reverse the contract
and/or take appropriate action in relation to applicable passenger rights agreements. In addition,
operating expenses for airlines have been increasing, due to the need to deal with these providers.
The airlines are forced to provide and maintain staff and appropriate systems and interfaces for
data exchange (costs, overhead). There are other problems as well, e.g. customers receiving different prices for the same flight offered, sometimes without the actual provider´s - the airline´s knowledge, the prices depending on different parameters (that are determined by the tracking of
their activity and are time-related or place-related) as well as on changing booking situations. In a
nutshell, intermediaries in the context of the airline business, have assumed a market-dominating
and market-dictating position beyond their system purpose. Neither passengers nor airlines are
the winners here, since direct contact to the customers must first be made via a portal and information will therefore get lost on both sides. Many airlines have started to discontinue to use
this system or are considering it, yet doing so means a loss of market access. Cost-intensive measures are or will be required to compensate for this. However, isolated solutions will not work as
well as globally implemented solutions due to a higher fixed cost share. This and the wish for capacity compensation leads to the forming of alliances, which result in intentional as well as unwanted
dependencies.
AVINOC is able to solve these issues of the scheduled flight or charter flight sector by creating
the corresponding basic data layer or the replacement layer, in the sense of the described solution for business aviation. AVINOC is a generic and non-complex system. It does not favor anyone
and does not exclude anyone (permissionless), which also implies that airlines can participate in
AVINOC, and AVINOC will and can never prevent it. From marketing to price comparison and finally booking, AVINOC allows airlines direct contact to the customers , while creating the greatest
possible transparency for offers and prices at market conditions for all market participants.
AVINOC’s Blockchain, Contract Management STP ( 6.4.2 on page 26) and Bidirectional Smart
Criteria BSC ( 6.4.2.1 on page 27) can be used ”as-is” without additional expansion or customiza-

37

tion for operational use in airlines for ticket booking and payment, but in principle also for all other
operational activities. Catering, for example, could be further optimized, made more individual, and
the current overhead costs of services could be reduced. An optimal amount of service objects
carried in the aircraft (food, drinks, etc.) would also help save fuel costs. At the same time, the
customer’s empowerment lost through intermediary platforms is re-established through the possibility of simple direct bookings (with AVINOC practically via ”the billboard”) to the airlines. Services
can be obtained ”just in time”, according to availabilities, before as well as during the flight.
Intermediaries, in the form of booking platforms and price comparison portals, will no longer be
required. The equilibrium of the airline market will restore itself through the claims originally defined
by the customer (quality, performance, service, security of execution, transfer times, etc.), and the
market will no longer be influenced by intermediaries. With AVINOC, customers can book individual
contracts (tickets) offered by the airlines as well as individual additional services51 on-ground and
in-air, on-demand, the crucial aspect being that no additional effort on the side of the airlines will be
involved. No additional equipment or staff will be required for the execution of operational activities
using AVINOC . These activities can be carried out by the existing staff without any extra effort52 .
With AVINOC, individual, automated contracts between airlines and BizAv partners are possible,
for example, combining contracts , e.g. allowing passengers of a transpacific flight further transfer
by air taxi or other means of transport to their final destination53 .
No additional organizations are needed for the processing . Time and effort from a professional
and technical point of view can be minimized as subcontractors in the transfer business can use
AVINOC easily and without access restrictions.
The use of AVINOC in scheduled and charter traffic creates a win-win situation for airlines and
customers, generating higher contribution margins on the one hand and lower prices on the passenger side through the full automation of all relevant processes.

9 Team
The development team of AVINOC is international, it is formed in a company in Austria. It consists
of aviation, business, logistics experts and experts in the development of complex IT systems and
Blockchain solutions. More than 150 years of experience in IT, business management, aviation
and, since 2011, in the field of Blockchain technology, make possible substantial development and a
sustainable solution. In the development and project team, as well as in strategic and operational
51

such as food and beverages as well as some additional services such as transfers, etc.
Example of ”individual catering”: The passengers can receive service on-demand. This is provided by the cabin crew
and the passengers pay directly via smart device via the Blockchain. In this case, photographing a QR code on the
desired object, e.g. on a beverage bottle is basically all they have to do. The cabin crew can - but does not have to carry additional equipment for the handling (smart device). The cabin crew does not have to carry out any further
administrative work after the provision of the service, or to suppliers or the operations center. All information
is already available on the ground and the caterer can order the new contingent according to existing claims
(reservations) or forecasts for the next time the the aircraft will be used, at the correct terminal , automatically
and in suitable quality, using STP / BSC (full automation).

functions, partners, advisers and employees of the respective partner companies or founders are
involved. It is gradually being expanded with national and international expert staff. In the first instance, we strive for cooperation with Graz University of Technology (TU)54 , the Graz Know-Center55
of the TU Graz and University of Graz, the Karl-Franzens Universitaet Graz56 an. The infrastructure
for the operation and development of the Blockchain, including all technical equipment (network,
platforms, internet architecture, git, etc.), has been in use with partners since the beginning of
AVINOC’s planning. It allows the team short reaction times, modern and solid teamwork and location independence, while taking into account all safety-relevant aspects. All major developments
are done in-house. Find below a short introduction of the members of the AVINOC team, which will
be formed for the development project as a separate company after the closing of the public sales
