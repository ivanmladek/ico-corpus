1. Abstract
BioCoin, an international blockchain platform and BIO token, is a system of mutual
settlements, which allows to accelerate the pace of development and increase the
turnover of all businesses that have joined the platform. BIO is the ﬁrst crypto
currency to integrate into the real economy, into the everyday life of people. The
basis for the distribution of biocoin in the domain of real economic activity is the
system of loyalty. This is the most important and central tool of biocoin.
The main objective of the platform is to unite socially responsible businesses that
support organic agriculture, local farms, responsible attitude to the environment,
contribute to the sustainable development of the planet in accordance with the
principles of a green economy. BioCoin supports and develops local communities,
farmers, producers and sellers of pure natural products through an international
loyalty system.
BioCoin is a living ecosystem. About 20 million biocoins are already in daily turnover.
How does BioCoin work?
Within the loyalty system, biocoins are accepted for payment by all participants of the
platform. Customers receive biocoins as a reward for the purchase of goods and
services. With these biocoins, customers and businesses can settle with each other or
pay for new goods and services. In addition, biocoins are already accepted for
payment in a number of businesses without the entry of business itself into the
loyalty network. And one more innovative component of biocoin is the opportunity to
pay with them in general anywhere with the help of a crypto-technological solution
that connects your wallet and MasterCard.
The most important feature of biocoin is the logic of its spread and the growth of
liquidity in the market. In addition to acquiring biocoins during the ICO or subsequent
purchase on exchanges, you can get BIO either as payment for goods and services,
or, more importantly, as a reward for the purchase of goods and services. Such a
"consumer mining" will promote sales growth among business participants of the
platform, because this is an opportunity to get biokoins for free. In turn, this leads to
the joining of new businesses in the platform and causes an increase in the turnover
of biocoins, so that the demand for biocoins on exchanges is growing, and the price
of biocoin is rising. And the higher the price, the higher the motivation of buyers to do
the "consumer mining" and spend their money. Thus, there is a constant increase in
the cost of biocoin, the growth of businesses and customers who use it.

That leads to an acceleration in the pace of business development, whose activities
are aimed at developing responsible attitude to the environment and green
economy.
In addition, our technological solution includes the possibility of creating mutual
assistance banks and to microcredit. Interconnected users of biocoin (friends,
neighbors, colleagues, partners, etc.) will be able to create small funds for lending to
each other. This will be another incentive for using biocoins and for accelerating
business processes within all organizations and communities using biocoin. The
international blockchain platform BioCoin and the BIO token is a system of mutual
settlements that integrates into the daily life of people. And makes the world better
every day.

3. Introduction
BioCoin is an international blockchain-based loyalty platform and eco-token (BIO). It
aims to create a network of socially responsible companies all over the world, which,
through their activities, support organic farming, local family farms and responsible
attitudes towards the environment, and also contribute to the planet's sustainable
development according to the principles of a green economy. BioCoin was created by
the LavkaLavka farmer cooperative founded in 2009. LavkaLavka and our partners
from diﬀerent countries (UAZ, ZHITZ distillery, BROTECH Fermentation technology,
Good Faith Restaurant Group, Living Craftworks and others) have fully become the
participants of BioCoin from the very beginning of the blockchain-based loyalty
platform and the eco-token launch.
It is important that the BioCoin ecosystem is already operational in test mode. In the
run-up to the ICO, 20 million BioCoins were launched into the business of LavkaLavka
and its partners that joined the platform. We considered it important to allocate a
strictly limited budget (no more than 20 million BioCoins) for the system testing. And
now BioCoin already works. Farmers receive BioCoins for their produce and use them
to pay for the machinery and equipment they need (since the machinery
manufacturers have already joined the platform); they buy feed, fertilizers and plant
protection products. Customers already use BioCoins to pay in shops, farmer's
markets and cafes. They buy goods such as food, furniture and clothes. Transactions
in BioCoins occur daily and, what should be underlined, it is not merely the result of
purely ﬁnancial transactions detached from the real economy. BioCoin is already part
of the real sector today, part of the real economic activity of people. Activity aimed at
the sustainable development of local communities, farmers and enterprises that
support environmental and green technologies.
Basic principles of BioCoin:
• All clients of the stores, restaurants and other business projects that have joined
the BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme will receive rewards credited in
BIO token to their personal cryptowallet for every purchase made at these
establishments. The remuneration is 10% of the purchase amount in the national
currency (10% is the average number. Each business has the right to set the
amount of remuneration). The amount of BIO credited is calculated based on the
token exchange rate at the time of the purchase. Rewards are credited to all clients
without any exception. It does not depend on the actions of the client themselves since their ID in the loyalty system is connected to their cryptowallet through the
blockchain-module and the transaction occurs automatically.

In case the client wants to pay with the accumulated points turned into a token,
they can do so with their ID in the loyalty system, or by direct transfer of BioCoins
from their own wallet to the seller's.
Businesses that have joined the BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme can
accept not only national currency but also cryptocurrencies, e.g. Bitcoins or others
(LavkaLavka is already doing that). Upon payment token, clients also receive a
reward in BIO equal to 10% of the amount spent credited to their cryptowallets.
The technological solution that enables the acceptance of payments in
cryptocurrencies eﬃciently and legally is part of the BioCoin blockchain-based
loyalty programme.
BioCoins are accepted without restrictions as payment by businesses that joined
the BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme, along with the national currency
and other cryptocurrencies.
After the ICO, the BioCoin token will be listed on token exchanges.
All BioCoins to be credited to clients as rewards shall be purchased at token
exchanges by businesses that joined the blockchain-based loyalty programme. The
amount of BioCoins to be purchased will depend on the turnover growth of each
business.
Creators of the BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme provide free access to
all businesses that share the ethical principles of the platform. Our goal is to reach
the maximum number of clients using the platform and increase circulation of the
BioCoin token.
A total of 1 billion BioCoins was released during the emission. No further BioCoins
will be issued. The BioCoin market value will increase naturally as the number of
currency users grows, the currency circulation within the platform increases, and
the need to purchase it from businesses-participants of the platform at token
exchanges grows. The exchange rate of BIO within the blockchain-based loyalty
programme will increase in accordance with the currency exchange rate. Each
business project that joined the platform will have the right to independently set
the internal BioCoin exchange rate, being guided by the current daily exchange
rates.

4. Business model
BioCoin's key to success
BioCoin is a beneﬁcial instrument for investors who buy BioCoin during an ICO, for
business-participants of the blockchain-based loyalty programme, for customers who
buy farmers' organic produce, and, of course, for farmers themselves and ecoproducers.

The platform allows businesses to acquire new customers while avoiding discountbased losses, since all BioCoins awarded to customers return to businesses and can
be further used at their discretion.
Customers get an interesting ﬁnancial tool, making purchases cheaper and allowing
them to earn on the diﬀerence of the BIO token exchange rate. Thanks to BioCoin,
farmers and small eco-friendly producers acquire a growing customer base from all
around the world.
Further details:
• We create a replicable system of exchanging ﬁat money for BioCoins, in which
conversion happens automatically at every purchase. Conversion is embedded into
the logic of the blockchain-based platform: during each purchase there is an
automatic transfer of information about the transaction with the help of each
cutomer's personal ID to the BioCoin blockchain-module, after which BioCoins are
transferred to the customer's cryptowallet as a reward for the purchase. Every
business that joins the BioCoin loyalty platform has its wallet, to which it initially
buys BIO and, instead of virtual points and bonuses, uses them to transfer to
customers for concluded purchases. It receives BioCoins back from the customers,
when they use them to pay into the business, and the coins go in the same wallet.
• We equip the platform for the opportunity to make payments not only with real
money, but also with cryptocurrencies. This could be Bitcoins or other
cryptocurrencies – we are constantly working on adding as many types of
cryptocurrencies as possible. Thus, we expand our customer base to holders of
other cryptocurrencies, who then receive BioCoins.
• This platform functions in various countries. At the very outset it will be available in
Russia, the USA, Italy, Germany, and Japan.
• Our loyalty system and BioCoins are beneﬁcial for businesses from all over the
world.
• After all, we oﬀer access to BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme free of
charge. Businesses receive a working marketing mechanism for communicating
with clients. And thanks to the algorithm of redemption and allocation of BioCoins,
businesses do not incur discount-based losses. Customers will return all allocated
BioCoins back to the business by purchasing goods. If necessary, businesses can
sell BioCoins at the exchange or put them into circulation. Let us give an example.
A business bought 50 BioCoins for 1 dollar at the exchange in order to credit its
customer and then did so. Later on, the customer returned the same 50 BioCoins
to the business. After some time, the price for those 50 BioCoins amounted to 2
dollars. And like that, the business returned and multiplied its costs related to the
ﬁrst "discount" for the customer. The "discount" became a separate ﬁnancial tool
bringing proﬁt at the expense of the BioCoin platform. More information here.

• Businesses from diﬀerent countries that share common values get free access to
each other's audiences. This leads to marketing synergies.
• In the future, once the platform becomes more developed and the number of
participants increases, there will be an opportunity to make international payments
in BioCoins between farmers' cooperatives and all platform users. We call it a
cumulative ﬁnancial eﬀect.
Every client who receives BioCoins as reward points is able to:
a) use the BIO token as means of payment in the network of BioCoin platform
participants;
b) use BIO as an asset whose price is growing. The stock exchange value of BIO will
increase as the partner network of the BioCoin platform expands, which is the main
goal of the project team.
The only way to restock BioCoins for the ever-growing number of customers is
to buy them at the exchange.
BioCoin is more than just a business. It is more than just an investment. It is an
invaluable aid to local farmers and producers, which they are deprived of because of
the complexities of the ﬁnancial and credit systems of states. This is support of the
development of organic agriculture around the world and the promotion of
sustainable and stable development of the planet and global society.

4.1 How it works
We issue BioCoin (BIO) token based on the Peercoin fork derived from Bitcoin. In total
1 billion tokens. During the ICO, 800 million BioCoins will be sold at a price of $1 for
35 BIO (a discount programme during PreSale and the ﬁrst week of ICO is also
provided). 140 million BIO will remain in the project team. 20 million BIO have already
been put into circulation for testing the BioCoin ecosystem. It is very important to
note that farmers are already using BioCoins, which they received for supplying their
own products to LavkaLavka, as well as some customers and businesses that have
already joined the platform. BioCoins are already the reality of our days. 32 million
BIO is allocated for marketing and promotion of the BioCoin platform. 8 million BIO for the Bounty campaign. This will be the only emission.
BioCoins will be purchased at the exchange at the current market price. The BioCoin
exchange rate will determine the daily rate within the platform used for customer
transactions.

The higher the circulation of BioCoins within the platform , the higher the demand for
them will be. Every month, demand for BioCoins will grow due to the introduction of
new loyalty platform participants and the expansion of the client base of existing
partners. Whenever necessary, businesses that are part of the BioCoin loyalty
platform will place bids on the exchange for purchasing the necessary amount of
BioCoins in order to transfer them subsequently to the wallets of customers buying
farm products within the platform.
New BioCoins within the loyalty programme of a business will appear only in one way
- by buying BioCoins on the exchange from their holders (investors). For customers,
this will be a regular purchase, the result of which be BioCoins credited to their
electronic wallets as reward points. Customers can use them to pay for purchases in
stores, markets, cafes, restaurants and other businesses participants of the
blockchain-based platform.
The more new participants from around the world join the platform, the faster
BioCoins will be purchased from holders, and in bigger volumes.

Projected increase in the circulation of BioCoins among platform participants around the world from 2017 until 2020:
2017 - 30 million BIO | 2018 - 150 million BIO | 2019 - 400 million BIO | 2020 - 700 million BIO

The forecast of the circulation of the token is based on the analysis of the turnover of
the whole LavkaLavka cooperative and the business partners of the platform and the
declared ﬁgures, according to which the BioCoins will be credited to the clients of
these business projects as part of the loyalty programme.
As a result, we get a self-developing system that allows investors to initiate new
growth mechanisms for all businesses participants of the BioCoin platform as well as
for BioCoin liquidity.

This is a growth strategy for businesses, aimed at creating an economic
alternative to corporate capital and shifting towards sustainable development
and a green economy.

What is the main diﬀerence between the BioCoin and many other previously
known cryptocurrencies?
1. BioCoin is already backed by real farm and other natural and pure products at the
moment of issuance. It can be immediately used as a method of payment and
exchanged for farm products or food in restaurants in many locations around the
world.
2. It is an instrument for investing in the real economy, namely in small family farms.
3. It has an embedded mechanism of natural currency user growth.
4. By itself it is a proﬁt-making business tool, as the token nature implies that it is
constantly purchased from investors.
5. At the end of 2017, BioCoin will enter token exchanges.
6. It is accepted as payment in all LavkaLavka stores, cafes and restaurants, as well
as stores, cafes, restaurants and farmer cooperatives from other countries that
have joined the BioCoin platform.
7. By integrating into the blockchain-platform, it becomes possible to accept other
cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. BioCoins are awarded to those who can
be called "advanced cryptousers".
8. BioCoin is also a social tool. BioCoins contribute to the development of small
family farms, reviving remote villages that have been slowly dying over the past
decades. BioCoin is an instrument of sustainable development of territories and
organic agriculture.

4.2. Building on the success of LavkaLavka
The farmer cooperative LavkaLavka was established in 2009. Now it unites over 200
small family farms located in Russia, Armenia, Greece and Italy. The LavkaLavka
brand represents healthy products grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers by
farmers who care about the environment and revive forgotten varieties of fruits and
vegetables, local breeds of animals, traditional crafts and rural life. All products are
produced in small amounts with enthusiasm and genuine love for the work being
done.

LavkaLavka today: Online shop at lavkalavka.com, 6 stores, 3 cafes, 2 restaurants, a
workshop and farmers market in Moscow, a farm hub with procurement shops and a
market in the Tula Region, a production cluster for processing bioresources in the
Murmansk Region on the coast of the Barents Sea in the famous village of Teriberka.
The cooperative is going to open 5 more cafe-shops in a few months.
Key facts you should know about us.
In 2009, when we started working as farmers-enthusiasts, our annual turnover
amounted to approximately 1 million rubles. By 2016, we had an annual turnover of
around 400 million rubles. This means that over these years we have grown by a
factor of 400! In 2012, Google featured us in its advertising campaign.
Our activities are regulated by our internal standard, which is based on global
organic certiﬁcation practices and at the same time is a much broader and more
socially-oriented document. We only work with small family farms. We do not work
with large commercial farms and corporations. Our Expertise service carries out over
100 inspections annually. We support local farmers and believe that the less our food
is being transported, the better it is for us! We follow the principles of fair trade,
sustainable development and responsible consumption. We believe that food is not
just nutrition - it is the most powerful tool to make an impact on the environment. All
our activities are aimed at supporting small, local, family-run farms that respect the
environment and interests of local communities.

LavkaLavka is an active member of the Slow Food international movement that
supports the preservation of agricultural traditions and protects the interests of local
communities. In addition, we are an oﬃcial member of IFOAM
Organics International, a public organization uniting all major players on the
organic market. In 2016, the founder of LavkaLavka, Boris Akimov, was invited to
speak at the UN, where he gave a presentation on the farmer cooperative. The UN
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has twice showcased LavkaLavka's
experience as an example of successful cooperation and development of small family
organic farming, which should be scaled up across the entire planet.
In our work, we devote great attention to social aspects. One example is our project
in Teriberka village on the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Teriberka is a small village in the
Arctic that had been slowly fading away and was soon to disappear. As a result of our
work, the village has changed dramatically. In 2016, FAO representatives visited our
Festival of Territory Development in Teriberka and branded our project "an
example for the whole world".
LavkaLavka will soon add northern berries and sea salt from the region to its product
oﬀering. All these products will be produced by the people of the Russian Arctic at
new enterprises that are built there by our cooperative.
At LavkaLavka, we believe that business can and must be socially oriented and aimed
not only at earning income but also at changing the world for the better!
Support local farmers!
LavkaLavka already accepts cryptocurrencies
In the summer of 2017, the LavkaLavka cooperative
started accepting cryptocurrencies as payment in all its shops, cafes and markets. We
started with BitCoins, and then continued with ETH, SIB, WAVES, etc. Most
importantly, we managed to solve all technological and legal problems related to
token payments. We made sure that anyone can visit our website, shop or cafe and
quickly pay for products or dishes with Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. No need
to wait: the purchase is made immediately. Everything is absolutely safe from a legal
standpoint and follows applicable laws, since after the payment is made with Bitcoins
according to the national currency exchange rate, we print a check and pay all taxes
for that purchase. It is this technological solution ensuring the speed and legality of
payments in token that will be incorporated into the BioCoin blockchain platform and
made available for participants around the world. Representatives of LavkaLavka
were summoned to the Oﬃce of Public Prosecutor soon after they started accepting
cryptocurrencies. The result of the inspection was that no violations were found and
the cooperative continued accepting cryptocurrencies.

4.3. Why it is beneﬁcial to entrepreneurs
With the growth of the BioCoin exchange rate, the client will be able to receive more
and more products - this is the best motivation for the customer to return to the
store or cafe - after all, the customer receives money free of charge for purchases of
farm food, other goods and services. The platform allows businesses to acquire new
customers while avoiding discount-based losses, since all BioCoins awarded to
customers return to businesses and can be further used at their discretion. At the
same time, if the exchange rate increases, then business not only doesn't lose, but
also has additional earnings on the growing BioCoin. In addition, we provide free of
charge access to the BioCoin blockchain-based loyalty programme to all businesses
that share the ethical principles of the platform. Accordingly, businesses have a free
marketing tool to attract new customers who learn about it from the BioCoin partner
network.
You can see more about how's it beneﬁcial for business HERE.
We have already started integrating projects from other countries that share our
values into our BioCoin platform. Those include restaurants with organic food in the
USA, farmer cooperatives in Italy and Germany. Shops and restaurants in Russia,
Europe and Asia.
Talks are also underway with Slow Food and IFOAM regarding the possibility of
joining the BioCoin platform with participants of these global movements and
organizations using BioCoins.

•
LavkaLavka, a farm cooperative that unites more than 200 small family farms
and manufacturers of environmentally friendly products.
•
UAZ, Russian manufacturer of oﬀ-road vehicles.
•
Fusion Group Ltd., Shanghai, China. A company importing food to China.

4.4. Why it is beneﬁcial to farmers and consumers
BioCoins are based on the real economy and contribute to its development. BioCoins
are a development instrument of farmers' ecosystem. They help address the issue of
attracting ﬁnancial resources to farming and organic agriculture, and gain
momentum for further development. BioCoins received by farmers today will
increase in value tomorrow and help farmers grow much more rapidly.
Consumers of farm products receive real token as a bonus and when its value goes
up, products for them automatically become cheaper. 10 BioCoins credited to you as
reward points when their exchange rate is X dollars may increase in value up to 2*X
dollars over time.

About half of the 50,000 BioCoin users in 2017 should be made up by customers of
LavkaLavka stores and markets and guests of LavkaLavka restaurants and cafes. The
second half - customers and clients of businesses that will join the platform before
the end of 2017. Even now, during the preparation for the ICO, several new
businesses join the platform every day. You can see the oﬀer for partners here.

5. ICO
The development of the platform and the BioCoin currency provides new
opportunities and helps increase sales for farmers who struggle to grow their
business within the current framework of a "big corporate economy" controlled by
large retail chains and agro-holdings.
We are attracting funds to create a ﬁnancial blockchain-based platform that would
unite not only farmers, producers, stores and restaurants, but over time the platform
will be able to bring together all people who share our vision with regard to
supporting organic agriculture, sustainable development, responsible consumption
and respect for the environment.
BioCoin growth will be driven by the development of the blockchain-based loyalty
platform and introduction of new stores, cafes, markets, restaurants, factories, farm
hubs and other businesses that provide opportunities for clean products from honest
farmers to reach the tables of big city dwellers. In addition to that, the growth of the
platform already comes at the expense of those businesses that share ethical
principles of the platform, but do not directly engage in food - hotels, innovative car
companies, equipment manufacturers, and clothing sellers are already joining us.

5.1. Token speciﬁcations
BioCoin is an open source project based on the Peercoin fork derived from Bitcoin to
provide a long-term scrypt-based token which in turn is based on energy-eﬃcient
cryptographic data.
Biocoin Is real eco crypto. It's based on Peercoin. Peercoin's Proof-of-Stake system
was developed to address the high energy consumption of bitcoin. For example, as of
April 2013 the generation of bitcoins was using approximately $150,000 USD per day
in power consumption costs. The proof-of-stake method of generating coins requires
very minimal energy consumption; it only requires the energy to run the client
software on a computer, as opposed to running resource-intensive cryptographic
hashing functions .

5.2. Crowdsale
ICO is starting on 2 October. During the ICO 35 BIO will cost 1 USD, but there is also a
discount programme in place:
Test Sale (до 31.08.2017), 60 BIO = 1 USD
Pre Sale (25.09.2017 - 8.10.2017), 50 BIO = 1 USD;
Pre Sale (9.10.2017 - 31.10.2017), 45 BIO = 1 USD;
Sale (01.11.2017 - 02.11.2017), 40 BIO = 1 USD;
Sale (03.11.2017 - 30.11.2017), 35 BIO = 1 USD;
Sale (01.12.2017 -31.01.2018), 31,5 BIO = 1 USD;
Sale (01.02.2018 -18.02.2018), 24 BIO = 1 USD; .
The goal of the ICO is to raise 15 million dollars.
All funds collected at the ICO will be used for implementing, launching, maintaining
and promoting the BioCoin blockchain platform: the technological development of
the platform, expanding its client base, marketing, acquiring new partners, opening
new outlets, etc. In addition to the costs of creating a blockchain-module that will
work with all the diversity of loyalty systems in the world and convert points and
bonuses into BioCoins, the main costs will come from increasing the number of users
of the BIO token. The involvement of new businesses in the platform and
development of the most cooperative international network of LavkaLavka farmers
should create a critical share of users and business projects involved in the use of
BioCoin. And, thereby, increase the liquidity of BioCoin so as to make it an interesting
ﬁnancial instrument, growing in price. The sale of 800 million BioCoins will enable us
to connect more than 1 million users with the platform by 2020.

Long-term prospects
Once the stage described above has been implemented, we would like to take the
next step. We can use the blockchain to bring together farmer cooperatives from
around the world that share our principles. We will be able to certify each farmer and
use blockchain to track the movement of all their products. This will be a veriﬁcation
system for any product created by farmers.
