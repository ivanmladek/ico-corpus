RepMe (RPM) coin
RepMe is the brand new “incentivised” endorsement based networking and
social media blockchain community. LinkedIN meets Facebook, PR agency,
recruitment agency and talent agency all rolled into an autonomous d’App
system designed to filter and introduce qualified networks to engage and cultivate mutually beneficial social and commercial relationships.

The problem
Introverts and extroverts alike, we are a species that either must engage in or
desire interaction, whether for personal or commercial or obligatory reasons.
Unfortunately, we have constructed social barriers and gatekeepers, we have
developed insecurity and lack inclination or time. We have businesses to run,
money to save and a life to look after. We have trust issues…the business world
is sick of being hit by telemarketers and in the social realm we always think
someone approaching us has their own agenda….The problem…We have
emotions and have limited time.
Imagine if you could remove emotions and time expenditure from the entire
process and interact with someone for the very first time with surgical precision
about why you should connect and whether or not there is availability or mutual
interest?
Imagine if you could find employees through your network and interact directly.
Imagine if you could directly contact employers, business partners, investors,
old friends, new friends, anybody? Imagine if you could get paid and earn a
living simply from the people you know and network with?

In step RepMe – a blockchain operated management system taking out all of the
guess work, emotional obscurity and time sensitivity of introductions and networking.

Why is this important?
With HR spending in the trillions each year on personnel and tech – the industry itself
to date has been very slow to introduce optimising software and at present state is
still a relative pre 2010 legacy market. Commissions and costs of head hunting and
recruitment haven’t changed ranging from $1-$10k and even more for top tier personnel. The obscurity however is the fact that while costs and processes haven’t
changed much, the dynamic of the landscape has considerably. Standard recruitment and networking success has largely become reliant on social networking and
qualified referral from peers. LinkedIn’s success to date is largely due to this social
trend. Instead of a stranger at a recruiting agency pitching their client base, it’s an
endorsement or a recommendation from a close peer via social channels. With this
very obvious trend, organically taking effect, its strange that no company to date has
been able to commercialise a global working solution. Repme, as in “represent me”
is creating a dynamic, user friendly portal that turns every person in your network
into a prospect recruiter and pays you BTC, ETH, or RPM tokens simply for the
people you know, endorse and recommend.

How does it work?
Simple. Using a smart contract operated decentralised mobile optimised application, users can simply see through their network, what extended contacts they have.
They can then communicate with their own peers or via one of their peers and incentivise the ability to open up a communication line to someone in their network. This
will be a powerful tool for business, recruitment, head hunting, opportunities and
simply for making friends and dating. They then can either send out a group bounty
using tokens to be able to connect with the type of personnel they need or they can
precision request introduction with the personnel they wish to connect with and
incentivise current contacts and strangers to endorse the meet. This is one of the
most basic use cases. There are considerably innovative and exciting processes, our
platform enable.

Lets look at some of the most basic scenarios for alpha version 1.0 due to release
Q4 2018:
1. Boy wants to meet girl – Girl is 3 associations away: Boy sends a heart icon
with a request for green light to proceed through first contact who then
forwards to second contact who then decides if that is cool. The heart reaches
the girl – she decides if she wants to say hi.
2. Entrepreneur wants to make a business deal – He sends the Proposal or gift
icon through his contacts to try to hit the desired contact – he can incentivise
this run with coins. Letting every one in the chain endorse him and in return
receiving tokens for the hassle.

3. Marketeer wants to reach out to celebrity – Through 5 channels – You pay the
recipients and they agree to make the connection with an endorsement. To
make it even better, you can see the celebrities and offer tiered bonuses for
people who make the match
4. Job offer – business owner wants to approach a prospect employee – he can
simply incentivise his own staff and network providing him an army of recruiting
agents for a fraction of the cost of traditional recruitment methods.
5. Gym buddy – Simply need someone to spot you – place a bulletin on the
repme map for seeking gym buddy at these times per week. Other enthusiasts
can hit back with fee requests or just make contact for free.
6. Tennis coach, artist or learn the guitar or any other hobbie. Simple – just fire
out an icon representing the particular field and see who bites. Or if willing to
pay – send out a bounty offer for the whole network within your geographic
limits.

Simple right. This is the most basic form of our new smart d’application. We have a
whole host of upgrades to turn our native d’app into a sophisticated networking tool
and will continuously be presenting the developments via our open source Github
depository and via updates in our community on telegram and twitter.
Initially as we work towards the mobile application, the technical system is very
fundamental as explained in the below schematic. Please note this is merely the first
version and we are keeping it light and simple to ensure we have technical manoeuvrability to build the most robust finished product.

Write smart contratcs
To ensure optimal reach and opportunities, a user profile will contain valuable
personal and professional information. This information is owned by each individual. As the information is sensitive we have constructed very robust security
measures.
Procedural security measures:
– All sensitive information is encrypted
– Global setting protections
– Two factor authentication
– Facial recognition and Finger print identification
Furthermore, all communication data is transmitted through encrypted transport
layer security connections.
During development we take smart contract auditing very seriously. This is not just
for autonomy and security but it also prepares our system to make it more applicable and flexible in the long term. For this endeavour to start we will be using the
services of Quantstamp. Internally however we perform a coding standard validation as per standardization and perform code review incorporating black box test
methodology before deployment of these new dapps.

The primary industries repme is positioned to disrupt are the following:
– Human resources &amp; Recruitment
– Head hunting
– Online dating
– Commercial networking
While also creating a new platform to optimise friend seeking, hobbyist networking and social networking in general.
We are also currently developing an innovative online dating app with a very
simple technical structure that simply plugs right into our primary dapp.

Offchain personality matching engine

We are already exploring the developmental cost and timeframes for an offchain
personality matching engine that can communicate with our dapp and the ethereum platform. The potential implications of this are huge. An offchain matching
engine allows the decentralised application to operate without the heavy computational power required while maintaining a decentralised user account
model. Basically it brings about radical performance benefits without bloating
the core application. For us to succeed we need to deliver a better solution
than our centralised incumbents.
Using the power of computer simulating neural networks, we are designing a
new machine learning pattern, habit and facial detection data centre. The first
application is for the dating functionality to better peer users based on habits,
activities, peers and facial features. The first prototype is currently under testing.
The reason we are starting with dating is to use the free dating service features
as a way to deliver a large enough data feed so that we can start building out a
solution for applying it in the head hunting and recruitment solutions. Imagine
casting auditions, models, actors and the likes with a click of the button to
immediately present a range of options precision suited for certain roles. We
also believe that this will be a powerful tool for the future of recruitment as data
suggests, the industry is heading this way and employment based on the look
of someone applies to many verticals, particularly with front of house staffing
requirements. This entire project will optimise the HR process globally.

geographic location.

Tech stuff, check!
Now whats the business plan?
Simple – connection fees, commissions and permission upgrades.
In the same way recruiting agents earn commission, so will Repme, only our
commission will be 1/10th of the cost. In the same way elancer and freelancer
take fees, so will repme, only 1/10th of the cost. Permission upgrades are payable in multiple currencies, then are used as bonuses for the community of
token holders.

What about users? – simple – users via their profile and when requested to provide an endorsement or open someone’s email or make contact are offered
tokens. The user can also counter offer and request other tokens like BTC or ETH
on top as a bonus. For instance –
1. An advertiser wants me to open their email – it is highly targeted so I open for a
few repme tokens.
2. An advertiser wants me to email back but it isn’t targeted, so I request a bonus
0.005 BTC.
3. An acquaintance wants me to endorse him to an investor I know and he offers
me 50 repme to do so. I can accept or counter.
4. An ICO wants to run a bounty with a total amount split based on tasks or reaching certain people – if I know them, I can win large amounts of the bounty by
endorsing or connecting interested parties.

Token
For recruiters, organisations, agents and businesses, the repme token is an access
pass to greater features. The ability to buy your reach, upgrade your profile, boost
your job listings, incentivise your network and send digital gifts. The best part for
companies is with such automation and the use of blockchain platforms to reduce
labour requirements and process friction, is that instead of companies spending
tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands each year, using the repme token
will cost them a mere fraction. It’s the ultimate utility coin within the Repme platform that will become the ultimate recruiting and business networking tool.
Total tokens: 100B
Total circulating: 50B
Non circulating supply will be used for growth of the platform and as incentives for
downloads of our application. Every downloaded app comes complete with 1000
RPM tokens.
