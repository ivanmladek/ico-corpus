Brief Introduction

ONO is a social network based on blockchain technology which focuses
on the value of attention and offers a free, decentralised social platform to a
new generation of users.
ONO is based on the belief in the value of attention.
As far as ONO is concerned, there exists many valuable human social
activities within a social media ecosystem and ONO recognises the inherent
value of both the supply-side and demand-side of human cognitive and social
energy.
The ONO team believes in equality. As far as ONO is concerned, since
everybody is born equal as human beings, so the means available for them to
obtain incentives and gain attention in social platforms shall also be equal.

1.1 Principles
The internet gave birth to the large-scale private social platforms including
Facebook, Twitter, WeChat and Weibo. In these platforms which are controlled
by centralised companies, many millions of users are contained within them.
The platforms manage the users and create all the rules about the content
posting policies of the platform and they siphon off vast amounts of wealth
which are generated not by them, but by the content creators. In Q3 of 2017
the revenue of Facebook reached $10.3 billion USD, 98% of which was from
advertising. 1.1Content creators, who are the only contributors to Facebook’s
data, gain nothing of this $10.3 billion USD. The ONO team plans to establish

http://tech.qq.com/a/20171102/007691.htm?qqcom_pgv_from=aio

11

a decentralised social network based on the principles of freedom, equality and
social public governance, in which, the value of attention is properly defined
and the content creators can fully reap the true rewards of the value they create.
As far as the ONO team is concerned, attention and time are the most precious
resources in future society and also are the resources most valued by the
community of ONO. The act of placing the social media content within the
community has more value than the content itself. In addition, the time and
energy that was spent by creators also is considered part of the overall value
of the content. The power of the attention of users directly impacts the value of
the content; hence, the attention of the users will be incentivised as well as the
act of content creation.
In 2017, the quantity of blockchain technology and digital virtual currency users
grew in an exponential way. The number of active digital wallet users have
increased from 5 million at the beginning of 2017 to the current number of 20
million. Additionally, users with interest towards the area of blockchain and
cryptocurrency also grew by 500% in the past year1.2. The exponentially
increasing number of users reflects the massive user demand for blockchain
solutions. The sudden popularity of CryptoKitties1.3ushered in a turning point for
a new blockchain golden age.

1.2 Key Issues to look out for

1.2 Getting the result by observation from Google Trends tools
http://trends.google.com
1.3 CryptoKitties
https://baike.baidu.com/item/Cryptokitties/22251991?fr-aladdin

12

Since the blockchain came into being, the “trust mechanism” has been replaced
by the “consensus mechanism" and the “encrypted algorithm” gradually, which
is why the blockchain is widely and warmly welcomed. Hence, the central nodes
must adopt the trust mechanism. Additionally, a centralised management
structure must be applied towards all related businesses, but this might lead to
the overwhelming power of central nodes and give rise to a series of corruption
problems.
In current centralised social platforms, the same problems might occur, which
could harm the interests of users and become problematic issues. ONO not
only takes into consideration the problems inherent in centralised hierarchies,
but also takes into consideration the many and varied failed experiments
caused by boatloads of uncontrolled factors in totally decentralised
organisations. That's why the ONO team has decided to add a little top-down
wisdom into a bottom-up system, in order to correct the mistakes and
uncontrolled factors in the bottom-up system.

First, Deluge of Low-quality Content
●Insufficient Incentives
Centralised platforms siphon off vast social energy and attention, which is
created by content creators and platform users. Furthermore, the lack of
incentives for users to generate high-quality content worsens the situation of
lack of drive for content creators, which results in the loss of high-quality content
and exceptional users.
Example: a large number of Internet celebrities are dissatisfied with the reality
of this condition of insufficient incentives. Therefore, the loss of internet
celebrities continues.

13

For example, in 2017, some bad events occurred in Zhihu. Wukong Q&A
decided to create an affiliation with www.toutiao.com and signed contracts with
many former internet celebrities in Zhihu. It's worth mentioning that the price for
www.toutiao.com to hunt and employ these former internet celebrities in Zhihu
is very low1.4.

●Bad Money Drives Out Good People
In most centralised content-based platforms, data flow is the only criterion to
define the value of the network; and the rigid demand for the long-term
development of the content-based platforms is neglected, which gives rise to
boatloads of clickbait, sensationalist headline writers and vulgar content.
For example, Bai Jiahao, UC, of www.toutiao.com and other WeChat official
accounts are despised by users because of sensational headline writers or
vulgar content. 1.5.

Second, Insufficient Safety and Lack of Care For Users
● Insufficient Safety
In centralised social platforms, the safety of the information belonging to users
cannot be ensured and this information is at risk of being stolen. Some
platforms even take advantage of the data belonging to users for massive
financial gains.

1.4 Public Opinion Monitoring Report on “War for Talents” Event between Wukong Q&A and Zhihu

http://www.iimedia.cn/55436.html
1.5 omment on “Sentimental Headline Writers” by Media for Party Affairs: Criticising “Go to Sleep with

You by Crossing Big Parts of China”

14

Case: Each year, the information from over 300 million users is sold on the
black market. This information is so detailed that it can be obviously shown to
have come from various social media platforms1.6.

●Restricted Freedom
The centralised platforms, via centralised algorithms, completely control the
distribution of content, and siphon off the social energy for financial gain.
Ordinary users will never be listed in the “hot search” or “trending topics” even
if they produce quality content. Unless users pay promotional fees, they will
face restricted exposure and visibility. Some platforms are even manipulating
public opinion with "zombie" users who write fake responses or engage in the
controlling and restricting of the activities of legitimate users1.7.
The centralised platforms conduct black box operations, ban users at will, and
arbitrarily handle the accounts and content of users without any reason, for
which, the users cannot safeguard their legal rights1.8.
Case: more than 90% of the users in Weibo's most-searched hashtags (with
most usage rate) are stars and internet celebrities who are signed with Weibo.
However, if a star account with over 10 million fans does not purchase robotic

15

users to write fake posts, the likes under a single Weibo post will be under 300.
So, what's the real network flow for the most searched hashtag1.9?

Third, Sense of Belonging and Sense of Participation
● Lack of Sense of Belonging and Sense of Participation
In the platforms, such as Weibo, WeChat, www.toutiao.com and Zhihu, the
relationships between the platforms and the users are relatively separated and
isolated. The roles between them are opposite to each other, therefore, a
conflict of interest always occurs.

Fourth, questions shall be more valued than answers
The progress of science not only enriches mankind’s knowledge, but also
expands mankind’s ignorance. While forging in new knowledge, the progress
of science also triggers more questions. When artificial intelligence keeps on
storing and evolving the future of knowledge, it can be predicted that besides
answers, the computers could give one nothing. Good questions are more
scarce compared to good answers.

● Squeezing Profits
In many centralised social media content platforms, content creators cannot
obtain incentives, and the profits made by the network flow are completely
absorbed by the platforms.
In centralised social media, only the top users can truly benefit financially from
the network flow in other channels. Most ordinary users who are enhancing the
market value of the platform are unable to gain any profit.

● Complicated and Non-transparent Profit-earning Procedures
Even people in We-Media who can monetise their content will face a number
of problems in centralized platforms, such as non-transparent prices and
extremely complicated trading procedures. In fact, content managers for
internet celebrities in centralized social media platforms have to use an
exploitative system to gain advertising revenues. Most managers adopt this
exploitative method, so the profits are actually quite small2.0.
Example: the offer of an essay given to an internet celebrity in Zhihu is 3000
RMB; however, the third-party organization and the service provider will charge
a fee of more than 10,000 RMB, thus the third-party companies gain high
commissions.

Key Issues Faced by of Developers
● High Distribution and Promotion Fees

Actually
http://tech.163.com/1001/07/C29C59BE00097U7R.html

17

In the current distribution markets for software app platforms, developers will
pay high fees to release their software into these app stores. The high fees will
further squeeze the remuneration from excellent small and medium-sized
developer teams, which results in them receiving almost nothing. Example: The
mobile app market platforms have a high fee commission structure for
developers. 30% to 50% of the app revenues go into the pockets of Tencent
and Apple App Stores.
Also, the App Stores might ask for legal documentation for the software.
Additionally, the platforms will charge extra fees for publicity and promotion.

1.3 User Demand
● High-Quality Content
In ONO, behaviour of the users will define the value, and ensure the quality of
content. In the meantime, the incentive mechanism within ONO will promote a
continuous production of high-quality content and attract more users, who will
continue with the production of more high-quality content, thus forming a
synergistic and healthy feedback cycle.

● Safety and Free Social Experience
The data of ONO will be stored in the blockchain. It is a self-governed
blockchain social network dapp, free from the corruption problems generated
by centralised platforms. The algorithm of ONO will compute the personal
preferences to predict behaviours of users, in order to prioritize the individual
preferences of the users. ONO will notify users of the likes by his/her friends
that they focused on but which they are not aware of. It can even recommend
to these users some content that the users dislike right now but might want to
take a look at in the future.

18

The hot search and incentive algorithms of ONO are totally open-source and
open to the public, which is indicative of fairness. In the network, all users can
experience complete safety and freedom.

● Demand for Equality and Respect
To gather a large number of users in the platform is the core of community
culture. The preferences and attention of users foster the culture of the
community on ONO. Equality and respect are not an empty promise in the
community of ONO. The value of attention of each user can be reasonably
quantified, and the users can gain remuneration in the shared community
network in the form of the token ONOT token.

● Needs of Content Creators
Simple, Transparent and Effective Remuneration-Sharing Mechanism
In ONO, if any user releases any high-quality content, ONO will automatically
distribute remuneration via the POC algorithm, and the users can directly be
incentivised in ONOT, without any other further action. ONO will share
remuneration with all relevant users which have contributed to the creation of
that content in the social network. Users may continuously receive
remuneration generated from that high-quality content as payment for their
efforts.

● Needs of Developers
ONO will have free or extremely low issuance sub-accounts, low commission
and constant support within the network.
The relationship between ONO and the third-party development teams within
the platform is symbiotic. The developers building on the platform of ONO will

19

become an integral part of the social network system of ONO. They will build
the thriving social ecosystem together with all the users in the social network.
The third-party Dapps would use ONOT for payments, to provide more usage
cases for ONOT and to increase circulation of ONOT. Meanwhile, ONO will also
continuously offer network support to great Dapp developer teams.
In the first year, ONO will not charge any distribution fee; then the distribution
fee will be progressively increased in the next four years from 5% to 25% and
then fixed at 20%, which is far lower than the average level in the industry. All
distribution fees will be paid in ONOT.

1.4 The Solutions of ONO
The underlying philosophy of the social network of ONO is to combine core
social values with the original vision of the creation of the internet. The concepts
of freedom, equality, social public governance and diversity are the healthy
components of a diversified social networking ecosystem. Starting in 2014, the
ONO team started creating R&D products. The first of which was ERA, the
which created a value-based social network, and then CryptoDogs based on
Ethereum. All these social networks the ONO team have built were able to
successfully meet their goals.
ONO is built on the realisation that in order to establish a decentralised social
network, firstly, it needs to protect and respect the three main interests of users:
equal dignity, equal rights and reasonable remuneration for usage; secondly, it
shall provide easy-to-use and enjoyable product experiences which will exceed
all expectations.
ONO replaces the centralized and exploitative “ownership” business model with
an ONOT and blockchain-based social network rich in virtual products in order

20

to balance the allocation of economic benefits between content creators, the
users who give their attention and the platform providers. It intends to provides
a solid, highly principled foundation for the building of a decentralised,
community co-governance and diversity-centric social network.
The ONO team believes that to solve the above-mentioned key issues for
users, a complete content ecosystem needs to be based on common goals,
along with a reputation mechanism and a virtual commodity economic system
for distribution of resources. With a variety of symbiotic mechanisms these two
independent ecologies will create a continuous feedback loop within the
consensus and developed ecosystem.

Content Ecosystem:
Reputation Mechanism
The reputation mechanism is the most important mechanism in the ecosystem
of ONO. In order to guarantee that a high-quality ecosystem can be established,
ONO creates a reliable assessment mechanism, to punish the users who
conduct malicious behaviour, such as destruction and harassment. The
reputation mechanism will be applied in the media content system and
referendum system.
In the content system, if the content released by a particular user is liked,
reposted, commented on and shared, the reputation of the user will go up; if
not, the reputation of the user will go down. The reputation fluctuates according
to the quality of content released by the users. The content released by users
with high reputations will be first put into the recommended zone. When the
reputation of a user falls dramatically, all content released by this user will be
collapsed and other people will not be able to see the content.

21

In the referendum system, users will assess whether the execution results of
proposal executors comply with expectations and will make the final evaluation
of executors. The executors are able to offer high-quality services and will also
accumulate their reputations step by step. The proposals of these executors in
other executing referendum will be preferentially displayed. However, in the
case of the executors breaching the contract or whose executing results could
not reach the standards, their reputation will be undermined. When their
reputations are undermined to a certain extent, the executors’ projects will be
collapsed and they will be unable to participate in the competitive bidding.

Distribution mechanism
The distribution of content in ONO is combined with a user behavioural
assessment and reputation mechanism. All activities of users such as reading,
reposting, replies, shares, likes and dislikes of content will be recorded.
Ultimately, all this data will be combined with the reputation mechanism, and
open rules will be adopted to evaluate the quality of content. The high-quality
content will be shown in the homepage of the network. The feature of real-time
fluctuations in reputation provides users a transparent way to operate in the
network, thus ensuring the healthy development of the content ecosystem.

Incentive mechanism
With an open sourced algorithmic incentive mechanism (see 4 for details), ONO
encourages users to create high-quality content, participate in platform building,
be active in the social network and obtain ONOT token incentives. Third-party
developers can also develop mini apps based on the open platform of ONO to
provide diversified experiences for users and obtain ONOT incentives. The

22

entire token ecosystem will utilise smart contracts to establish openness and
transparency and also to ensure the interests of all creators. Users of ONO
and/or holders of ONOT which did not actively participate will not receive any
ONOT incentives.

In order to establish equal rights, the philosophy of ONO is to provide an equal
and continually amended and developed “Common Programme” system,
subject to compliance with all prevailing regulations. Eventually, it is planned
that all users can equally participate in the proposal and voting model. The
growth and prosperity of the ecosystem will be a shared common goal among
users, platform developers and content creators.
The referendum is one of the most important components of the social network
on ONO. It expresses the goals of freedom, equality and social public
governance as well as reinforces the guiding principle of ONO: “The interests
of the users are more important than anything else”. In the referendum, all users
of ONO with unique digital identities can publish proposals for the ecosystem’s
infrastructure, platform management and dispute resolution matters. The
premise of the continually amended and improved “Common Programme” is
based on community consensus. For the avoidance of doubt, while the views
of the community would be acknowledged, ultimately community members are
not connected with the Foundation (or its affiliates) in any manner, and the right
to vote does not entitle ONOT holders to vote on the operation and
management of the Foundation (or its affiliates) or their assets, and does not
constitute any equity interest in the Foundation (or its affiliates). The various
successful proposals which have obtained community support will be published
in a transparent fashion.

23

In all procedures of the referendum, the ONO team will be major participants.
The “Common Programme” will be considered as the definitive guide for the
prosperity of the social ecosystem. All users would have equal chances to get
their voices heard. All procedures and data of referendum activities will be
recorded using the blockchain in an open and transparent way.

Developer Ecosystem - My Box (See 2.2-8 for details)
In order to deliver a diversified product experience, ONO will cooperate with
third-party developers to build out the developer ecosystem.
My Box is the app store of ONO. In order to ensure the diversity of the social
network, ONO supports third-party developers to participate in and develop
various types of Dapps, rich applications and a small number of games and so
on. The users can use their ONOT tokens to purchase virtual goods from My
Box. And the developers can obtain ONOT tokens via selling applications and
distributing application revenues. The distribution of application revenues will
be conducted according to the “Developer Revenue Distribution Mechanism” in
different phases and recorded in the blockchain, to ensure that the revenues
are open and transparent.
In order to promote the developer ecosystem, ONO has a head start on
developing several mini apps, to be modelled as usage cases. For example,
the end-to-end encrypted chat-based instant messaging app and the adventure
location-based map app are just two usage cases. In order to promote the
prosperity of the developer ecosystem, ONO will nominate the members of the
developer community from the submitted proposals of the referendum, so as
support the third-party developers with tokens from the incentive pool, thus
reducing the development costs and risks in the early stages of ONO.

24

Further, as an EOSIO based blockchain, ONO will encourage dapps developed
for the EOS Mainnet and other EOSIO based sister chains to develop specific
versions for the ONO community, using the unique economics of the ONO
community. Such dapps should be relatively easy to migrate, since the platform
is very similar to the EOS Mainnet environment.

25

Chapter Two

ONO DAPP

ONO is a new type of social network based on blockchain technology, aiming
to create an ecosystem based on the value of attention with the main principles
of freedom, equality and social public governance for users. The users in ONO
can freely share and obtain valuable content, chat for study and communication
and participate in building the ecosystem. While creating network activity, it will
provide the users with incentives, users will obtain ONOT as the incentive in a
manner laid forth by referenda.
ONOT is a virtual commodity trusted and held by all members of the community
of ONO. It embodies the value of virtual goods, social traffic and of attention,
which is transferable, shareable and precious. ONOT can be used and
circulated in the social content market, referendum market, mini app market
and transactional market in order to realise its commercial viability.
ONO uses blockchain technology to record and verify the content release
details, payment transactions, consumption and purchase, as well as
referendum activities. All the operations will be recorded in the blockchain of
ONO, to ensure that operational data is authentic and unable to be altered.

The forms of the Social Network of ONO
The social network of ONO consists of one fundamental ecosystem and two
cyclic ecosystems. The fundamental ecosystem refers to the instant messaging
app and the rich content stream which satisfies the primal social engagement
needs of human beings. One of the cyclic ecosystems refers to the referendum
structure which is concerned with giving equal rights to participants. The
developer ecosystem delivers a diversified app experience to the users. The
fundamental ecosystem when combined with the other two cyclic ecosystems,

26

aims to give the users a free and open infrastructure and equal opportunities
with shared governance, which respects the dignity of individuals and reflect a
healthy human-centric experience.

2.1 ONO Product Architecture

ONO Product Architecture Diagram

27

2.2 ONO Product System
1.ID system
ONO provides a complete ID system, and users need to complete the
registration using their telephone numbers. After logging into the social network
of ONO, ONO will assign each user with a unique digital identity and native
digital wallet. The ONOchain blockchain network will encrypt user data to
ensure user privacy. In the meantime, in order to ensure the authenticity of the
users in communities, more detailed information has to be provided in order to
participate in the building of the social network.

2.My Story
My Story is the module for users to push social media content into the Circle of
Friends. The content creators and the friends of the creators can personalise
the operations including: Release My Story, Focus on Friends, Check Stories
of Friends, Repost, Reply, Save, Dislike, Like and Reward. The content posted
by users can be set as private content, open content or content that is only
visible to friends. Once the content is released, no one can delete it, but the
creator or judgment executor has the right to collapse it. The creator can edit,
collapse and amend the levels of permissions granted to others.
The content posted by all users are recorded in the blockchain of ONO. This
ensures that the content is traceable, immutable and unalterable. All content in
ONO will be encrypted. The creator has the right to amend the levels of
permissions. The encryption key algorithm ensures that only the users with the
corresponding permissions can view the content.

28

3. Chat (See Figure One)
The chat system is the most basic function of ONO. ONO uses an encryption
algorithm to ensure end-to-end encryption for the chat content, thus ensuring
the privacy of chat data. None of the servers or nodes will decrypt or save any
chat content. The chat data is temporarily stored in encrypted form upon
sending. Once the chat data is delivered to all the receivers, it will be forever
removed from all servers. The decrypted chat content will only be stored in the
local user devices, i.e., the senders and receivers.

4.Friends
The system of friends is the basic social function of ONO. The users can add
friends by random recommendations, searching for accounts, searching for
nicknames, scanning QR codes, importing address books and checking
surrounding people and so on. The friends will be shown in single list, to
facilitate users checking and selecting chat dialogues.

5.Content Distribution
Users can release content into the social network of ONO. The forms of content
include words, images, videos, expressions, positions and so on. ONO will
support richer forms to distribute content, including links, long text, Q&A, and
buying and selling and so on.

29

6.Interactive Functions
The interactive functions of ONO mainly include Reply, Repost, Like, Dislike,
Save, Reward, Don't Look at the moments of Friends, Don't Look at the Post,
and Sharing within the Website and beyond the Website.

● Replies:
The users can post replies to content, in order to interact with the author and
other observers. The data will be accumulated and stored in the data of the
primary content list.

● Repost:
The users can repost and spread the content released by other users. The more
frequently the stories are shared, the more attention these stories will receive.

● Like:
The users can express their likes of high-quality content, which will influence
the distribution and incentives related to the content. The more likes the content
obtains, the more potential there will be for bigger exposure and more
incentives will be gained.

●Dislike:
The users can show dislikes of the content that they detest. In order to protect
the interests of the creator of the content and avert malicious clicking of bad
replies, ONOT will be consumed when expressing dislikes. The dislikes will
influence the distribution and incentives of content. The content with lots of
dislikes will be collapsed, so that other people do not have to view it.

● Save:

30

The users can save the content that they like, to facilitate more convenience.
The saved content is only visible to the users themselves.

●Reward:
Any user can tip any content in ONOT, as an incentive to the content creator.
ONO will have no authority to charge any of these user-given tips. The content
creator is responsible for all aspects of their own content and needs to be
responsible for other resultant obligations legal or otherwise.

●Don't Look at the moments of Friends:
The users can choose to not look at the information of any person. After making
the choice, the users will not see any of the posts or content by that person.

● Don't Look at the Post:
The users can choose to not see the post of any other user. After making the
choice, the users will not see any information by that particular user.

● Sharing within and beyond the Website:
ONO supports users with the ability to share content in the communities, chats
and environs of ONO under the condition that sharing is allowed by the original
content creators. ONO supports the sharing of any open content in any other
app by users, and the page views from these other platforms will also be
calculated into the viewership data of the original posts.

7.My Exploration (See Figure Two)
My Exploration is the module for users to release stories and broadcast them
to the public. Any user can see the content released by any other user in the

31

My Exploration section. All users will release content according to the
guidelines as set forth by the Common Programme. The content which violates
the Common Programme will be collapsed and the content with disputes will be
solved by all users through a referendum action. Some content in My
Exploration will be focused on two principles, reputation and distribution
mechanism, both of which will influence the distribution, recommendation, order
and hierarchy of the placement of the content.
All data belongs to the content creator. The creator enjoys all interests and
bears all responsibilities related to the content. The creator can edit, collapse
and amend levels of accessibility permissions. When the content is published
by the creator in the My Exploration section, other sharing actions can occur
such as repost, reply, save, like, dislike and rewards towards the original
content.
All content will be recorded in the blockchain of ONO, to ensure that the content
is traceable and unalterable.

8.My Box (See Figure Three)
My Box is the name of the app store which is developed by ONO and is a
reflection of the diversified social network ecosystem of ONO. My Box consists
of two parts: one is the various functions released by the ONO team for the goal
of system-wide prosperity, the other are the mini apps freely researched and
developed by third-party developers based on the ONO open platform.
ONO tries to connect the users in the social network of ONO with the
developers in the ONO developer ecosystem via an open platform. The goal is
to allow users to freely make purchases and app installations. Additionally,
there will be various plug-ins and other features built into the ecosystem in order
to let developers create a rich and diverse product experience.

32

●Functions on the Platform of ONO
Given that the development of a social network needs diversified content and
structure for support during development, ONO will continue to explore new
ways to express content and will continue to enhance platform infrastructure
according to the referendum. Currently, ONO can support the following kinds
of media: words, audio files, images, position and links; and subsequently, it
will openly support long text, video, and live broadcasts and so on. In the
meanwhile, ONO will provide rich operation statistics to govern the platform.
ONO will make available SDK for its open platform, for the usage of third-party
developers, among which, all the interfaces will be open-source. In order to
display the functions of the mini app open platform, currently, the ONO team
has developed several mini app usage cases for the users and developers to
test and experience.

●Mini Apps Developed by Third-Party Developers
The fairness principle of remuneration sharing in the open platform of ONO will
attract the most talented developers. Any third-party developer can provide
users with rich third-party applications based on the open API of ONO.

9.Referendum (See Figure Four)
The referendum, which will be established by secondary smart contracts, is an
important component of the social network ecosystem of ONO and its
foundation principles are: freedom, equality and social public governance. ONO
has as its guiding principle: “The interests of the users are more important than
anything else.”
The referendum will be a place where one can find questions and answers to
important matters. ONO is built according to the belief that good questions will
help to bring about different and diverse opinions. It will stimulate the

33

imagination of all members and also generate intellectual curiosity about known
and unknown areas of knowledge. It is in this decentralised, chaotic and most
uncertain place, that the most valuable and most essential questions and
answers in life shall be generated.
The smart contract module of the referendum includes: the voting pool,
execution of proposals agency, proposals, voting, winning support, voting by all
people, publishing results, budget, fund-raising, open bidding and supervising
executive actions and so on.

●Participant
In order to make sure that the voting action of the community adheres to the
Common Programme and has the ecosystems’ best interests at heart, all users
participating in the voting must possess unique digital identities on ONO.

●Voting Pool:
The system voting pool will contain an amount of free ONOT which is set aside
to be given to the best proposals and also to stimulate the valid voting of users
to participate in building the ecosystem and creating developer applications for
the community.
The ONOT for supporting proposals will be gathered in a special pool of ONOT
for these proposals. The voting pool of each proposal is unique and for special
use. As for the proposals entering into a vote by all ecosystem participants:
When the result declaration term expires, the voting poll will immediately
execute the incentive strategy - after deducting the fee payable, 50% ONOT in
the voting pool will be used to incentivise the voters, and the other 50% will be
put into the “executing pool”. As for the proposals not entering the voting by all
people, when the result declaration term expires, the voting pool will
immediately execute withdrawal - after deducting the fee, all ONOTs in the

34

voting pool will be returned via the original routes according to their
corresponding proportion.

●Executing Pool:
Executing pool is a ONOT pool specially used to pay the fees to the executing
team winning the bid after open bidding. The executing pool of each proposal
is unique and for special use. The process to distribute ONOT is recorded in
the blockchain of ONO in order to ensure that the process is open and
transparent. After the settlement of all fees and completion of the execution
process, if there are still some ONOTs in the pool corresponding of Tokens, the
rest of the ONOTs will be immediately returned to the users participating in the
fund-raising. During the execution, if there is any factor leading to the failure of
execution, the rest of the ONOTs will be immediately returned to the users
participating in the fund-raising.

●Proposal:
On the premise of not violating the Common Programme, any user of ONO with
a unique digital identity can present proposals for the infrastructure of the social
network ecosystem, platform, governance and dispute resolutions regarding
ONO. The proposed tools cover all functions in the content release.

●Supporting and Winning Support:
Any user can transfer ONOT in any amount to the voting pool with any proposal,
so as to support the proposal and to help the proposal win more attention of
other users. Within the valid period to gain support, the proposal reaching or
exceeding support standards can be deemed as the winning proposal and will
be listed in referendum; otherwise, it shall be considered the failed proposal
and listed into a section of non-passed proposals.

35

●Referendum
Any user with a unique digital identity can participate in voting. After the voting
process is complete, the user can obtain ONOTs in the voting pool used to
incentivise the users participating in the voting. The voting is open, transparent,
unique and unalterable. Within the valid period of voting by all people, the
proposals winning more than 50% of affirmative votes will be declared and may
be executed; otherwise, they will be deemed as failure.

●Declaring Result:
When the voting period expires, the proposals will be published in the
“executed” section or “non-passed” section. Within the valid period of result
declaration, any user with a digital identity on ONO can publish a complaint
towards any proposal “under execution”; however, the user must pay the same
quantity or more of ONOT in the voting pool of the proposal to publish and to
launch the second round of voting by all people.

●Budget:
When a certain proposal is passed via voting by all people, the designated
agent will compose the proposal budget within a valid period of time and declare
the result.

●Fund-raising:
When the budget declaration of the proposal has ended, a judgment will be
made according to the result to decide whether any fund-raising shall be
needed in order to meet the budget requirements. Within a valid period of time,
if the budget conditions are met, the proposal is deemed as successful and
listed into an “open bidding” area. Within a valid period of time, if the budget
conditions are not met, the proposal is considered not passed. When the fundraising is launched for the proposal, the tokens exceeding the needed quantity

36

in the fund-raising will be returned to the originating source upon the settlement
of the proposal.

●Open Bidding:
When the fund-raising is fulfilled, the proposal will enter the open bidding
procedure for the executing team to execute it. Any user with a unique digital
identity on ONO can participate in the competitive bidding. Third-party
developers with good qualifications will be nominated preferentially.

●Supervising Execution:
In order to ensure the success of the proposal executing as well as
transparency, fairness, valid judgment criteria and processes, all the users
supporting the private fund-raising will participate in the evaluation equally; and
the results of voting shall become the executing conditions fulfilled by the
executing team. The tokens in the executing poll will be paid to the executing
team for the three phases in succession, with 20%, 30% and 50% respectively.

●Punishment for Breach of Contract:
In order to make sure that the community adheres to the Common Programme
and has the ecosystems’ best interests at heart, the developer who breaches a
contract will be unable to obtain the final payment and will also lose reputation.
The serious and continuous breach of contract will lead to the extremely low
reputation of the developer and the developer might be removed from the rolls
forever.

10.Transaction Transference

37

Transaction Transference is an important aspect of token circulation in ONO,
used to facilitate sending tokens between users. Any user with a digital wallet
can transfer, send gifts and make transactions to any other user. The sender
can customise the fee which needs to be paid in each transaction. In the
process of token circulation, all transactions will be recorded in the blockchain,
and they cannot be altered.

11.Advertising Column
The development of the advertising system is one of the foundations of the
entire value ecosystem of ONO. It is also an important ONOT value application
scenario. The continuous development of the advertising system is of great
benefit to the overall valuation of ONOT. (see 4. Economic system and 5. The
advertising system of ONO)
In the early stages of development, ONO will place the advertising bar just
below the content that users post. In the future, all personal pages belonging to
ONO can be freely defined and placed on advertising columns, such as
personal homepage, publishing content, and all other personal pages.
Users can independently choose whether to open the advertising column and
decide what kinds of advertisements to pay attention to. Users who open the
advertising column can obtain extra ONOT incentives. Advertisers can pay
ONOT to automatically match or independently purchase exposure time for any
advertising.
The ONO advertising system will be developed and maintained by the founding
team and third-party teams.

38

12.Content is implanted into the market, which is the second-level market
that matches the advertising market efficiently and transparently.
Content creators can put up their own ads to sell their own content in the market,
and advertisers can bid against each other to buy the space.

Chapter Three

Technical Framework

The technical framework of ONO can be divided into the following six parts:

3.1 Status Authentication System
As one of the basic services of the ecosystem of ONO, the identity certification
system provides many basic services including account registration, content
confirmation, identity certification, limit management and so on. After the user
registers an account in the system, the identity certification will be made. The
user by going through identity certification will obtain more authority in ONO,
such as participating in the referendum and ecosystem building and so on.

3.2 Content Storage System
The content produced by users in the system of ONO are the core products of
these users and also the core assets of the attention economy on ONO.
Therefore, ONO must ensure that the content of users is stored in a safe
manner.
The content data created by users of ONO will be encrypted before upload and
storage. Each piece of content will have its own specific content encryption key,
of Ck, generated by the creating user, and available for decryption only by those
to whom he has specifically granted access. The encrypted data will be stored
in a decentralised Distributed Hash Table (DHT) storage network, for example,
IPFS. The 64 byte (512 bit) hash of the data will be stored in the blockchain.
Users with the proper authority can access and decrypt the content through
smart contracts or other access control mechanisms, which will ensure that only
authorized users can access the data. The storage providers are unable to

40

obtain the content encryption key, and are thus unable to view data belonging
to users.
Of course, once a user has properly accessed the data, it is not possible to fully
secure from copying or retransmission.
IPFS is a an example of a decentralised and distributed storage system, aiming
to connect all computer data into the same filing system. IPFS adopts content
addressing techniques, with which, the users do not have to worry about the
location of the server nor consider the name, path and route of file storage.
Each file is stored in one or more IPFS nodes, and accessing users will
transparently locate and access the data and its corresponding decryption key
Ck based on the permissions and hash values stored in the blockchain.
The hash value is derived from a combination of the content of the file, the
creator, the time of creation (or upload) and certain other factors. If just one bit
is altered, the hash value will be totally different, in that the has function used
has the property that a single bit change will in general change half of the 512
bits which compromise the hash (true for SHA2, SHA3 and Blake2). When IPFS
is requested by the hash of a file, it will employ the DHT to find the node where
the file is stored, and then extract the file and verify the data of the file. The
IPFS network is an unfixed, fine-grained and distributed network. It can adapt
to the requirements of any content delivery network.
Currently, IPFS is under development. To ensure a good user experience, in
its early stage, ONO employs a highly efficient central development server
architecture. The contents of the users will be encrypted and stored in a central
database. To fully protect the reliability of operation and safety of user data,
high performance read and write operations are ensured; furthermore, the
interactive experience of the social network is ensured.

41

The ONO team will investigate and test IPFS and alternatives, and deploy the
fully distributed storage system when it is determined to be stable, reliable and
high performance. Our current expectation is to create a modified IPFS system,
operated by the ONOchain block producers, to ensure reliable performance.
This system will be further decentralized when confidence in the technology
and operation is achieved.

3.3 Consensus Mechanism and Incentive Mechanism Consensus
Mechanism
The ecosystem that ONO is establishing has a large quantity of data
concurrency.
It is presumed that the users logging in to the platform daily will be about five
million, and then, it might be estimated that the blockchain needs to run more
than 600 transactions per second.
(The formula: If the number of active users is 1,000,000:
1,000,000 users* 10 operations per user each day (post, comment and forward)
= 10,000,000 ops/day
= 10,000,000/24/3600/second=116 ops/second
For 5M active users, 580 ops/second
The existing POW (Proof Of Work) consensus mechanism (as used by Bitcoin
and Ethereum) is unable to meet these high transactional needs. POS (Proof
Of Stake) blockchains are, in general, not sufficiently distributed to meet our
goal for tamper resistance, and so to achieve our conditions of acceptable user
experience and a decentralised system, at present DPOS+BFT is the best
solution.

42

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is a consensus mechanism based on multiple
independent validator nodes which are in competition, and which are
incentivized to not collude. Under the DPOS mechanism, voting is used to
appoint witnesses which sign new blocks in the chain. With the implementation
of a decentralised voting mechanism, DPOS is quite democratic, which helps
to ensure honest and unbiased behaviour of the witnesses .
The pseudo code of DPOS mechanism is realised as follows, for round i
dlist_i = get N delegates sort by votes dlist_i = shuffle(dlist_i)
loop slot = global_time_offset / block_interval pos = slot % N
if delegates[pos] exists in this node generateBlock(keypair of delegates[pos])
else
skip
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is a mechanism for distributed systems error
detection and correction. If a distributed system can tolerate the occurrence of
any fault (these faults might include hardware error, network congestion and
delay, hacker attack and “bad actor” nodes), one can say that the system has
reached Byzantine Fault Tolerance. Although as early as in the 1980s, Lamport
has proven the theoretical feasibility of Byzantine-Fault-Tolerance, there was
no practical and highly-efficient algorithm to realise it until 1999, when Castro
and Liskov published “Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance” 2.1. This was the first
transfer of BFT theory into a solution can be achieved in practice.
ONO will adopt a consensus mechanism of DPOS+BFT to strengthen the
security of DPOS and make it tolerate byzantine faults. This is a powerful and

2.1

http://pmg.csall.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf

43

decentralised solution and can effectively solve the technology problems that
the platform of ONO faces.
The appearance of the EOSIO software enables the implementation of the
vision of ONO.
EOSIO is a blockchain operating system designed for commercial distributed
applications. The processing capacity of its DPOS+BFT-based underlying
architecture logic is now (July 2018) achieving 4000 transactions per second,
which can take us cleanly to about 30M active users, and can conceivably reach
millions of transactions per second. It can support multiple distributed
applications, perfectly applicable to the ONO Dapp and additional extensions.
The ONO team will continuously work to track and adopt performance
improvements to the EOSIO software and architecture to improve the
performance, staying well ahead of the demand.
Only the appointed nodes which have performed block verification work will be
entitled to earn producer reward ONOT, and such rewards shall be their only
direct compensation from the chain.
The ONOchain preview platform will come online in October 2018 as a test-net
for detail development purposes. After tuning, testing and full load testing, the
production network will be deployed in early 2019, after which all blockchain
features will be implemented. ONOchain will use the EOSIO software, as used
by the EOS Mainnet, with customization and modification to tune it for the ONO
environment.
Among the changes ONOchain expects to make, compared with the EOSIO
default and the EOS Mainnet:
•

No end user charge for RAM – All Ram costs are borne by the system

•

Optimize block window for ONO dapp

44

•

Account recovery – built-in recovery mechanism for lost or stolen keys

•

Governance via SPs, ONO team and Referenda

•

Token interchange between EOS and ONOT with EOS Mainnet.

Initially, multiple independent ONOchain block producers will be selected and
appointed by the ONO team, to ensure stable functionality of the chain. In due
time, producer selection will migrate to the voting mechanism described above.
The ONO team will operate no more than one such producing node, ensuring
decentralization and independence of the producing nodes.
To avoid doubt, the ONO team may operate multiple non-producing blockchain
API and test nodes, but will receive no rewards for such nodes.

Incentive Mechanism
Compared to some blockchain businesses, POW is not only the consensus
mechanism, but is also the incentive mechanism used to encourage active
miners to keep doing work.
Given that the ONO Dapp is a social network app, within the system of ONO,
the users who create value and who have high output are the ones who are
more critical to the ecosystem of ONO. At the same time, the cost to run the
DPOS+BFT system is extremely low. It’s different from traditional blockchain
cryptocurrencies in that it has no need to incentivise the miners beyond the
modest ONOT they earn.
ONO uses the contribution degree to prove the POC (Power of Contribution)
mechanism. POC will be used to define and quantify the contributions of users
and distribute the matching ONOT. The active behaviours of users include but
are not limited to: being a co-partner of building the social network, joining the
developer teams, being a content producer and software user, etc.

45

More details in “Chapter Four Economic System”.

3.4 End-to-End Encrypted Instant Messaging
To ensure user privacy, ONO encrypts each message end-to-end. The key of
the message sender is protocol-signed to access the conversation content,
whether it is a one-way chat or a group chat. The message will be sent in a P2P
network. If the receiver node's address is known and online, then the message
will be sent directly. Otherwise, the message will be temporarily stored and
forwarded in a P2P network node. Because the message is encrypted end-toend, any other node is unable to check the forwarded message content. In
addition, once the message is read by the recipient, it shall be permanently
deleted in all temporary storage nodes.

3.5 Dapp Open Platform
The continuous development of the ecosystem of ONO depends on the content
generated by users. The evolution of social engagement and development of
rich applications in a social network are the necessary components which drive
growth. The open platform of ONO provides a large number of basic
components. By using the basic components offered by the platform, the
developers can create customised community applications to satisfy the
demand of different users and obtain rewards for doing so. The basic
components of ONO consist of UI components and functional components. UI
components can be subdivided into view container components, navigation
components, sheet components, map components, multimedia components
and canvas and so on. The common functional components include payment
components, database components, network components and so on.

46

3.6 Advertising Algorithm
The advertisers will gain access to certain distribution channels by placing bids.
The advertising system of ONO provides multiple payment methods including
CPA (Cost Per Action) and CPC (Cost Per Click).
According to the pacing2.2 algorithm, the advertising system of ONO optimises
the distribution rate of advertising budgets. The pacing algorithm will learn to
compete with other advertisements which all point to the same target audience
and which will try to offer optimal pricing.
The rules of this algorithm are as follows:
Final bid (per impression) = optimal bid (per impression) * CTR where optimal
bid <= max_bid
CTR refers to click-through rate. The above formula is also applicable to
reflecting the VTR used to show watching times and CVR used to show
transferred amount.

Economic System

Preface
Entering into the 21st century, society finds itself in an age of information and
data overload due to the ubiquity of high-speed internet infrastructure.
"The only thing becoming scarce in a world of abundance is human attention" -The Inevitable by Kevin Kelly

"Totalitarianism at the top of the internet attention pyramid"
Hierarchical social networks decide the flow of user information and data feeds
through an algorithm which is centralised and not diverse enough. The software
algorithms that determine what one sees on social media sites prioritise
revenue over veracity. It directly affects the gap between the rich and the poor
in the real world and extracts an excessive amount of value from creators and
users. This is generally known as the Matthew effect of the platform. In these
cases, decentralisation of power has the ability to make the network healthier.

Summary of ONOT
The ONO system returns value to the users who created the attention.
As an important value certification with public trust in the social media
network, ONOT can be divided and transferred; it is required to be
consumed for certain function on the social media network, such as
placing ads. This the external usage value and product attribute of ONOT.

48

At the same time, ONOT also has many application scenarios in the social
media network. It is also a free circulation pass. This is the internal value
and circulation attribute of ONOT.

4.1 The Total Amount and Distribution of ONOT
The native digital cryptographically-secured utility token of ONO (ONOT) is a
major component of the ecosystem within ONO, and is designed to be used
solely as the primary token on the platform. ONOT will initially be issued by the
Distributor as ERC-20 standard compliant digital tokens on the Ethereum
blockchain, and these will be migrated to tokens on the ONOchain when it is
launched.
ONOT is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit
of exchange between participants on ONO. The goal of introducing ONOT is to
provide a convenient and secure mode of value exchange, payment and
settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on ONO.
ONOT does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title,
or interest in the Foundation, the Distributor or its affiliates, or any other
company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will ONOT entitle token holders to any
promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not
intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any other jurisdiction. ONOT
may only be utilised on ONO, and ownership of ONOT carries no rights,
express or implied, other than the right to use ONOT as a means to enable
usage of and interaction with ONO.
The Distributor which issues and sells ONOT shall be an affiliate of the
Foundation. The initial circulation of ONOT is 75 billion. With the year-by-year
incremental creation mechanism, the final amount should total 100 billion
ONOT. ONOT is the only circulation token of ONO.

49

Based on Proof of Contribution (POC), ONO will distribute ONOT to individuals
who contribute to the social media network.
The initial distribution proportion is as follows:
Founding Team:
A total of 20 billion ONOTs will be used to support the founding team for the
ongoing development, growth, operation and maintenance of the social media
network and the maintenance of the ONO ecosystem.
Co- contribution Partners:
A total of 35 billion ONOTs will be used to provide phased financial support and
development assistance for the ONO social network. These ONOTs will be
distributed in phases based on actual needs and the situation of the ONO
ecosystem.
Ecosystem Incentive Pool:
A total of 20 billion ONOTs will be kept and used as incentives for Tone
partners, cooperation partners, and outstanding developers who make
contributions to the ONO social media network.
Contribution Incentive Pool:
The annual increment of 5 billion ONOTs will continue to be used to incentivise
users. The incentive distribution plan is determined by the level of contribution.
In particular, you understand and accept that ONOT:
(a) is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value
in any other virtual currency) or any payment obligation by the Foundation,
the Distributor or any affiliate;

50

(b) does not represent or confer to the token holder any right of any form with
respect to the Foundation, the Distributor (or any of its affiliates), or its
revenues or assets, including without limitation any right to receive future
dividends, revenue, shares, ownership right or stake, share or security, any
voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms
of intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights,
or intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating
to ONO, the Foundation, the Distributor and/or their service providers;
(c) is not intended to represent any rights under a contract for differences or
under any other contract the purpose or pretended purpose of which is to
secure a profit or avoid a loss;
(d) is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic
money), security, commodity, bond, debt instrument or any other kind of
financial instrument or investment;
(e) is not a loan to the Foundation, the Distributor or any of its affiliates, is not
intended to represent a debt owed by the Foundation, the Distributor or any
of its affiliates, and there is no expectation of profit; and
(f) does not provide the token holder with any ownership or other interest in the
Foundation, the Distributor or any of its affiliates.
The contributions in the token sale will be held by the Distributor (or its affiliate)
after the token sale, and contributors will have no economic or legal right over
or beneficial interest in these contributions or the assets of that entity after the
token sale. To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading ONOT
does develop, it would be run and operated wholly independently of the
Foundation, the Distributor, the sale of ONOT and ONO. Neither the Foundation
nor the Distributor will create such secondary markets nor will either entity act
as an exchange for ONOT.

51

4.2 ONOT, a certificate of value
The intrinsic utility value of ONOT is achieved because of its democratic,
standardised, and decentralised nature.
"The main function of the institution is to constrain people's behaviour through
both internal and external coercive forces, to prevent opportunistic behaviour in
transactions, to reduce the uncertainty of transaction consequences, and to
help transaction entities form stable expectations..." - Institutions, Institutional
Change and Economic Performance Douglass C. North (the winner of the
Nobel prize in economics in 1993)
ONOT, A Democratic, Standardised and Decentralised Solution.

Solutions

for

Non-Standardised

Decentralisation
A small village in Yunnan grew a lot of ginger plants, and many villagers went
to collect this ginger in order to stay healthy.
One year, an experienced businessman heard about this practice and saw a
business opportunity. He decided to purchase the ginger from the villagers.
Since the large demand, output, productivity, and bargaining power of each
villager was different, the businessman could only negotiate and purchase from
house to house.
The businessman was very good at bargaining, and many villagers did not
understand the market of other places and were uncertain about the value of

52

the ginger. This led to a lot of fraud and other inequities in the transactions
between villagers and businessmen.
That year, the villagers didn’t make any money, but the businessman was very
happy——he purchased a huge amount of ginger at a very low price. He
successfully "trapped" the villagers and earned a lot through inconsistent
information.
The village's economy did not prosper in spite of the market demand.
The next year, the businessman tried to repeat the trick and went to the village
to purchase ginger.
This time, the businessman was surprised to find that the villagers raised their
prices one after the other and ignored his bargaining. It turned out that the
villagers heard that the businessman earned an exorbitant sum of money
selling the ginger in other places during the previous year. They were very upset
and decided to band together and “trap” the businessman.
That year, the villagers made some money, but because the cost was too high,
the businessman lost money and he never came to the village again to
purchase goods.
The village’s economy had not yet been developed because the informal
institution’s bargaining system changed.

2. Formal Institutional System --- A Centralised Solution
Five years later, due to mistrust in businesses resulting from problems like
information asymmetry and difficulty in commodity pricing, the small Yunnan
village experienced an economic decline, while the neighbouring village

53

became increasingly prosperous. It turned out that the neighbouring village had
embarked in industrialisation.
Just when villagers were worrying about it, the boss of a processing plant from
the neighbouring village came and pointed out a way for those villagers, saying,
“You just need to bring all the ginger to my plant and we will grind it into powder.
Then you can sell it by the pound at a transparent price.”
After some consideration, the villagers thought it was a good idea that was
mutually beneficial, therefore, they all agreed to take part in this. At the
beginning, the villagers could earn a steady income, which attracted villagers
from 7 or 8 neighbouring villages to do business with this processing plant as
well.
With the plant’s business expansion, the boss monopolised all sales channels,
with his business dominating in over 20 villages. When confronted with a
stronger business rival, the plant’s business started to face pressure. The
desire for profits forced the boss to begin cheating in work and cutting down on
materials and to defraud both customers and villagers. The plant started to have
corrupt practices.
Despite the economic development in the village, villagers here still didn’t earn
much. No longer being farmers or self-employed workers, they now became
exploited workers. What was more worrying is that with the monopoly of the
pyramid-style businesses, villagers possessed little bargaining power.

3.Decentralised System --- A Democratic, Standardised and Decentralised
Solution
After another five years, due to the extremely heavy monopoly of the processing
plant, villagers all protested against it and terminated their business relationship

54

with the plant. Having learned a lesson, these villagers jointly established a
ginger processing plant in order not to be taken advantage by any middleman.
The processing plant was only responsible for the collective management and
processing of the ginger.
Equity distribution became their biggest concern, for they might fall into the
same old trap again if there was a substantial shareholder, but conversely
would be unable to settle disputes without one.
In order to determine the value, villagers unanimously agreed to not distribute
profits by equity after negotiation. Instead, they could take the ginger they
collected to the processing plant and exchange it into the corresponding ginger
currency, based on the quantity and quality of their collection. Such currencies
could be used to exchange processed ginger powder. The currency issuing
machine was locked by a multi-layered security door and each villager kept his
own password. Only with the consent of more than half of the villagers could
new ginger currency be issued. At the same time, in order to prevent mutiny,
villagers jointly drew up rules and principles that they all should abide by, with
the content constantly being revised and improved.
Villagers can sell their ginger currency in standardised secondary markets
where buyers are only needed to purchase large numbers of such currencies
to exchange it for the corresponding ginger powder with the processing plant.
The corruption brought about by centralisation was tackled then and the village
finally achieved economic prosperity and sustainable development.

Summary
In a decentralised system, “value certificates” are indispensable. They
standardise non-standardised value and circulate freely in the secondary
market, increasing efficiency and making transactions transparent.

4.2.2 Supply of ONOT
1）Quantitative increase of ONOT—building an incentive pool
“The effect of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the
number of connected users of the system.”

---Metcalfe's Law

The portion distribution of ONOT is based on a constant definition: ONOT
incentives can be measured by the value of the users’ contributions to the ONO
social media network. The daily dynamics and content creation of social media
networks are of equal significance to the sustainable development of a
community.
Just as an individual who has been continuously promoted or a company whose
earnings have continued to grow, benefits also rise as time goes on. What
cannot be ignored is that the relentless struggles of individuals at the early
stage or the foundation-laying efforts of enterprises are of equal importance to
the individuals or enterprises.
The story of Mike will be used as an example to illustrate the growth and
increased value of the social media network.
Mike
After Mike graduated, he worked as an intern with an annual salary of 60,000
yuan. Five years after being in the workplace, he accumulated more
experience, got promoted and had his salary raised, earning 300,000 yuan
each year. During the five years, Mike’s income increased fivefold.
Mike in the Parallel World
In a parallel world, Mike fell seriously ill after he graduated, and thus became
unable to work. He didn’t recover until five years later. When he first entered

56

the workplace, he was unable to make 300,000 directly, having skipped that
stage, so was only able to make 60,000 a year.

Summary
The growing process of a social media network is basically similar to that of
Mike. No social media network can thrive immediately, that is to say, it must
experience a process of continuous growth.
A mature and thriving social media network requires the joint efforts, devotion,
and patience of all members, which will make the network more and more
attractive to users.
Therefore, it is predicted that the value of the content in the social media
network will continuously increase as usage increases. From beginning to end
ONO will persevere in having a fixed distribution of 5 billion ONOT added every
year.
This also means that the earlier someone joins ONO, the easier it is for one to
receive ONOT. In fact, from a perspective of individual equality, the more
contribution made by a user, the more incentives which will be received by that
person or group. It is important to clarify that these incentives are not without
limits or complete. The ONO social media network will not provide unconditional
support for those individuals who joined earlier.

2）ONOT circulation
ONO plans to issue 5 billion ONOTs each year for the first five years, that is,
13,698,630 ONOTs will be generated each day.
Of these, 65%, or 8,904,110 are used to incentivise social media content.

57

20%, or 2,739,726 are used to reward block producers.
5%, or 684,931 are used to reward users based on the behaviour of OP holders.
10%, or 1,369,863 are used to flexibly influence user behaviour.
Content Incentive
The content influential factor p:
We define newly created remarks (comments) to a user’s posts during the
current day as “a”, linking or re-posting by other users as “b” and the number of
received positive clicks as “c”. Repeat actions, such a thumbs-up, comments or
forwarding by a single other user are counted only once per day.
The influence factor pi for user i today is calculated to be:

The total influential factor P for the current day:

The ONOT assigned to user i from the 65% content incentive pool of
8,904,110/day is:
Ui = pi / ( P X 8,904,110 )

Rewards for OP Influential Force
When user i is affected by an OP account (such as thumbs-up, comments or
forwarding), the OPI value will be obtained. The OPI value of the user is the
total number of op held by the person influencing it.
The OPI value of user i:

58

The incentives (OPU) for OP influence that the user obtains on the current day:

Rewards for users’ login
When the number of users who login during one day is less than or equal to
136,986, 10 coins will be assigned to each user which logged in, and any
remainder will be transferred to the incentive account for activities, and used as
task incentives in special activities.
When the number of users who login during one day is greater than 136,986,
the coins assigned to each user will be 136986/x, where x is the number of
users logging in.
The ONOT received by each user logging in:

The ONOT received by the special incentives account:

Summary
5 billion additional ONOT per year will be produced on a daily basis with a total
of 13,698,630 ONOT produced.

4.3 ONOT—free flow pass within the social media network

59

Every year a fixed number of 5 billion ONOT will be added.
Because ONOT is a value marker, it has certain application attributes (platform
currency supporting the right to exchange for ads). At the same time, it is also
a pass to flow freely within the social media network.

4.3.1 Humanity’s Social Gold Mine
“Money is not natural gold and silver, but gold and silver are natural
currencies.”—Das Kapital, Karl Marx
Gold and silver are just minerals in essence, and currency was born because
of the human need to trade.
The expression, “gold and silver are natural currencies” is due to gold and silver
having the following attributes:
1.Easy to save, easy to split, has no losses/low losses.
2. It has its own inherent use case (just as gold can be used for construction or
decoration).
3. Its production can be controlled, should not appear suddenly, and impact the
market.
In a similar way:
1.ONOTs exist on the ONOchain and have no transactional losses or fees.
2.ONOT has various functionalities, as there are multiple cases where it is
used.
3.The maximum supply of ONOT is 100 billion.

60

An important factor that makes gold different from other stores of value is that
it is widely accepted. It is a currency that has been preferred for thousands of
years.
So how does ONOT compare to others of its kind? We can picture a content
environment as a gold mine: content creators invest their time and energy to
mine “golden content”.
ONOT is a standardised token that takes this kind of human-created value
and processes it through algorithm pricing.
ONO wants people to recognise the importance of this mechanism, meaning:
Recognise that human labour is not only about material output, but also about
the long term and far-reaching impact of human intelligence generated by
intellectual achievements, which is of considerable value. This value exists
naturally within humans and is not decided by external factors.
Recognise that this kind of human value can obtain results in the short-term
within the market, but its intrinsic value is far more potent and valuable than
what the short-term results represent.
Recognise that a decentralised social media network that mainly saves,
encourages, and transmits premium human content, will deeply impact human
society for a long time.
Recognise that a decentralised ONOT distribution mechanism acts as a part of
the social media network to jointly build, maintain, and iterate the ONOT
distribution mechanism, creating a “humanity’s social gold mine” with public
credibility.
Recognise the early contributors and developer teams have an indelible
contribution to the development of this kind of social media network.
This is the root of the existence of ONO.

61

Based on the “circulation” attributes of the ONOT life cycle as well the medium
and large-amount circulation scenario of the ONO ecosystem. ONOT is not just
a kind of “proof of value”, it is not a kind of “circulation system”. The core system
of ONO ensures that there will not be a large amount of selling of ONOT on the
markets which could lead to chaos, just as with the value of gold.

4.3.2 Application and circulation of ONOT
My box—developer ecosystem
ONO is not just a social media network, it is also a vast and prosperous digital
application ecosystem.
Since social media fulfils the needs of users, it has stickiness and can quickly
develop powerful network effects. This will create a continuous basis for
perseverance in the ongoing building of the social ecosystem.
Traditional centralised platforms occupy an exploitive value chain, through their
own centralised arrangement and through the collecting, extracting and selling
of social data/energy in its large-scale centralised design.
ONO intends to adhere to the principles of openness, collaboration, sharing
and value feedback, and is willing to work together with all users and
developers in the social media network to create a developer ecosystem
centred around ONO.
The open scripting language and APIs of ONO enable application scenarios
that can be expanded without limits. Third-party developers can develop a wide
variety of small programs and can also provide ONO with added-function plugins. Games, paid apps, music software, and in theory all apps can join the ONO

62

ecosystem and become a member that has the ONOT token. (See 2.2-8)

Users will use ONOT as the only platform currency and circulating token to pay,
purchase, and reward.

Referendum
In the module of referendum, the users will vote for projects requesting the
usage of ONOT.

Transfer transactions
ONO issues the ONOT virtual commodity for use within the community, to
support the transactions of users within the community, including but not limited
to the transfer, reward, purchase of services and payment for content between
users.

4.3.3 Feasibility analysis of ONOT circulation
Economists have found that measured currency will lead to deflation and
liquidity constraints, and consequently encourages the people to hoard money
holdings rather than to create consumption and investment. There will be no
such concerns within the economic system of ONO.

1）Natural benefits redistribution mechanism
One of the concerns regarding deflation is that it is difficult to achieve
redistribution of benefits.

63

Because of the strong speculative value of deflated currency, it mostly
encourages holding, and the most direct harm of this is spending inhibition,
investment containment, and liquidity obstruction. In such an environment, the
creator of value will not obtain corresponding returns, which will lead to
depression.
ONO quantitative addition mechanism directly incentivises content creators,
which forms a natural benefit redistribution mechanism. It can ensure the longterm development of a content ecosystem.

2）It’s not a legal currency: cannot be a fully “decentralised” currency
This kind of conversation often happens:
How much is a bitcoin worth?
10,000 dollars.
...
...
People still use centralised currency as a reference for pricing a decentralised
electronic currency.
There are many arguments regarding whether or not electronic currencies can
become legal currencies. Whatever the case is, ONOT will not discuss this.
ONOT at no moment will possess the attributes of a legal currency. ONOT
is an intangible property that is recognised by members of the social
media network of ONO through private agreements.
A kind of pass to circulate freely within the social media network of ONO.

64

And an intermediary that allows members to share social media network
value of social networking in real life.
At the same time, the economic system of ONO is completely connected to the
world--it is not an isolated economic system, but an open economic system.
Based on this, one cannot use a traditional deflation mechanism to understand
ONOT. Under the ONOT circulation model and circulation scenarios, ONOT
adds value and at the same time the circulation will not be hindered.

3）One will not always invest
As the measure of the value of all products in real life, as well as the general
equivalents held by most residents, deflation will lead to economic depression.
However, as mentioned above, ONOT is not a legal currency and the essence
of ONOT is that within ONO and within its wide application ecosystem, ONOT
is the only circulating token, and is an intermediary in the exchange of the
products and services within the social media network.
“Investment” and “consumption circulation” are two characteristics independent
from each other, but they coexist in the ONOT life cycle.
Just like people buy houses, stocks, and other assets, they also buy cars, new
smart phones, and other consumables.
Therefore, the circulation of ONOT depends essentially on the quality and
vibrancy of the application ecosystem.

4）Dynamic balance: excessive speculation hinders addition of value

65

“The invisible hand: everyone tries to apply his capital to maximise the value of
his products. In general, he does not attempt to improve public welfare, nor is
it clear how much public welfare is promoted. What he seeks is only his
personal happiness and personal interests, but when he does this, there will be
a pair of invisible hands to lead him to another goal, and this goal is not what
he is pursuing. Because he pursued his personal interests, he often promoted
social interests, which was much more effective than he really wanted to
promote social benefits.”--The Wealth of the Nations, Adam Smith
As Adam Smith stated, in the social media network of ONO, even if all members
of the social network have the egoist mentality of a "need to profit", the whole
ecosystem will continue to grow in the direction of health and prosperity
because of the invisible hand.
A simple logical chain:
Assuming that users are excessively holding ONOT, the liquidity of the market
will be blocked, the remuneration of third-party developers will be impaired and
the social network ecosystem will affect the social media health. This will result
in the value of ONOT falling. For that reason, invisible hands will bring the
market to a reasonable level of holding as well as spending.

5）There will always be a tendency to be stable
There would be increased demand for ONOT as a result of increasing adoption
of ONO. The ONO team looks forward to building a social media network that
is decentralised and respects the value of attention. Assuming that the ONO
social media network can do the equivalent of Facebook, one can predict that
the network has vast growth potential.

66

When ONOT tends to be stable, the speculators in the ONOT market will be
greatly reduced, but ONOT will maintain a positive and steadily growing
ecosystem.
What cannot be ignored is that with the continuous expansion of practical
applications, ONOT will continue to discover new growth opportunities.

6）The infinite possibilities of the future
The hopes of the ONO team are that with the unlimited expansion of
applications, ONOT will gradually become independent from the social media
network of ONO and form an independent ecosystem with independent growth.
It is worth mentioning that there is only one fertile soil for the ambition of the
ONOT token: a wide acceptance of a universal social media network.
In the future, the application ecosystem of ONOT will not be confined to the
ecosystem of the social media network of ONO. Any scenario that is willing to
circulate ONOT will be supported.

4.4 OP (ONO POWER)
The launching of start-ups requires long-term capital investment and investors’
commitment for long-term holding. The investment in start-ups requires the
investors' resolution for long-term holding, that is, to sell the stocks several
years later when value has been added and profits can be made. If the investors
are not committed to long-term holding, start-ups that are eager to enlarge their
size by increasing stocks and financing will be in conflict with the existing
shareholders aiming to withdraw their investments. Professional investors
understand that when new capital goes into the pockets of the old investors,

67

the enterprise will lose the chance to expand its operation forever and achieve
economic growth.
Similar to above conclusions, the ONO team believe that the building of the
social network of ONO also depends on the acceptance by all members of the
values of community flow, intellectual property and user attention and also the
acceptance of community virtual goods, ONOT.
Long-term holding of ONOT is important for the ecosystem development of
ONO. This is because it enables social networks to formulate long-term plans
which also ensures the smooth operation of the founding team. The long-term
attitude held by stakeholders will help them achieve healthy and long-term
economic growth, instead of speculation characterised by fast input and output.
ONO aims to establish a social network based on a principle of common
development and achieve prosperity step-by-step, for which, OP comes into
being. OP is the only reputation and interest certification within the ONO social
network. OP is non-negotiable and non-transferable under any circumstance.
The only channel for users to gain OP is to lock ONOT in the system by a 1:1
exchange rate. The locking term is 13 weeks. After the locking term expires,
OP launches its automatic unlocking function, which will be conducted after one
week from launching. In each week, one third of ONOT with the corresponding
OP quantity will be released to the users' accounts, with the exchange rate of
1:1.
The quantity of OP one holds will determine attributes like influence and will
also generate social clout.

Chapter Five The advertising system of ONO
Preface
At the heart of social media, where "traffic is king", the creator of the quality
content works hard to expand their reach, while the central platform swallows
a huge amount of the remuneration, which mainly comes from advertising.

The principle of the advertising system of ONO
It has been mentioned in the preface that one of the ways to achieve attention
is also the most commercialised source of income, advertising.
It is worth mentioning that advertising is not a commercial means of ONO.
Advertising is the most direct "attention economy" embodiment for the
social media network of ONO. If content and intellectual property rights are
the intrinsic assets and value targets of ONOT, advertising is the external
application and consumption scenario of ONOT.
What is worth noting is that there is a huge difference between
consumption scenarios and circulation scenarios.
Therefore, in order to explain this difference, there has to be independence from
the application ecosystem, and thus a separate chapter for the advertising
system of ONO has been set up.

5.1 The advertising model of ONO
In the social media network of ONO, users can use ONOT to place ads for
themselves or others, to transfer ONOT to others to save, use, or to hold ONOT

69

for a long time and to enjoy the other rights of members given by members of
the social media network.
It should be noted that the advertisements here are different from the traditional
centralised platform advertisements. In order to balance the freedom and
decentralisation of means of profit of content creators, advertising complaints,
and user experience, the ONO team has designed a balanced third-party
advertising strategy and promises that they will never place any ads from ONO
on it.
One can see the centralised platform in the mature market, usually using CPD,
GD, CPM/CPC/CPA and other advertising types (first screen advertising,
information flow advertising and detailed page advertising). With the
development of the internet, various sales methods, such as CPS and CPV,
have evolved.
ONO will continue to use the forms that have been proven feasible in history
and combine the innovation of free and decentralised innovation to create a
unique advertising model of ONO.
Among them, content creators will be free to open any ad sites belonging to
any page and obtain ONOT incentives for doing so. Most of the
In addition, the open source advertising algorithm of ONO will perform well in
CPM and other forms that may exist in the future.
Another problem for content creators is market standardisation which will also
be solved by the advertising model of ONO. For creators that are good at writing
soft implantation content, ONO has created a completely free trading secondlevel market soft implantation ad transactions, openly and transparently
matching advertisers and content creators, avoiding the mistakes of the story
of the exploitive ginger market.

70

5.1.1 The unique advertising model of ONO -- the advertiser
There are differences between the business form and the final appeal of
advertising for all kinds of advertisers on the market.
The original advertising plan of ONO will solve the disputes, precise reach, and
highly free definition produced by advertisers on the market.

1) Advertising positioning- efficient algorithm matching
ONO has a set of efficient, evolving and open source matching algorithms to
meet the various needs of advertisers, CPM/CPC and so on. (see the
advertising algorithm)
With a simple operation, advertisers just need to prepare a certain amount of
ONOT and choose advertising preferences. The algorithm will automatically
configure the ONOT incentives according to the advertisers needs to achieve
best results.
Of course, advertisers also have the right to freely configure advertisements.
When an advertiser desires to engage hot content creators, they need to set a
personal appointment for negotiations.

2) Soft implant advertising market -- fully free placement
The original soft implant advertising second-level market of ONO will make the
market price completely transparent and effectively match the advertising
bilateral relations.

The advertising mode of plan 1 will lead to lack of flexibility due to
standardisation. When advertisers urgently want a specific hot content creator
to advertise for it, they can choose to bid in the trading market.

5.1.2 The unique advertising model of ONO —content creators
The key concerns of the content creator:

1）Not receiving any benefits
Centralised platforms will not give remuneration to content creators when
running all kinds of advertisements.

2) Their interests are squeezed by centralisation.
Content creators usually do not have the ability to contact advertisers and have
no bargaining power. When they choose to sign agreements through
intermediaries, they are greatly taken advantage of.

3) Prices cannot be standardised, so they are unable to be open and
transparent
The "long tail effect" appears on all centralised platforms. Most of the middle
and long tail creators will not be able to profit, but in fact, they are creating
content value. Data shows that a considerable part of the niche content has
strong fan engagement, which proves that everyone's heart may have minority
preferences.

72

These content creators often run into difficulties trying to obtain remuneration
and the market valuation for their content is very low.
(see the story of the 1.1.1 Ginger Village)
The original method of ONO solves these problems well.
Every user has a presence on the social media network of ONO. Content
creators own their social networking pages and own all their created resources
on ONO.
Every content creator, if he or she is willing to accept advertisements, will be
able to open advertisement space on his/her own page and anywhere else he
or she controls. Content creators are free to set up and choose advertisements
that they approve of and have the right to refuse advertisements they do not
accept from being placed on their own pages.
Content creators will therefore obtain ONOT as a visible representation of
interest, and in the long run, will also achieve potential long-term benefits.
Each content creator can also trade his or her soft implanted ads in the free soft
implanted advertising market, so as to ensure that the prices offered to them
are open, transparent and decentralised.

5.1.3 The unique advertising model of ONO — users
For users, most of the time, watching advertisements is a very painful and
difficult matter.
In fact, users are disgusted with the advertisements advertised by centralised
platforms. Users not only dislike, but have support for their favourite UP owner,

73

the content creator, subjective advertising, or the need to rely on the benefits
of advertising [2.4].
Case: It has been seen in many minority WeChat public numbers, such as in
professor A Yin's content reviews, "A Yin, you finally picked up ads." "I'm
relieved to see you in the advertisements." And so on.
The advertising model of ONO meets this requirement, thus ensuring user
experience.

5.2 Achieving and continuously operating of the advertising system
5.2.1 The remuneration distribution of the advertising system
80% of the ONOT consumed for advertising will be distributed to viewers, 10%
for the users who incentivise the open advertising column, and 10% for the
team that incentivises and audits the advertising.
(Note: this decision is initially decided by economists, which needs to be dealt
with through voting to make the adjustments.)

1）Additional incentives for open advertising
Advertising location is one of the sources of advertising revenue. Content
creators can independently decide whether to open the advertising field and
what advertisements or content are put into it.

2.4 "Song Zhongji, if you do not do ads you will not make it."
http://www.adquan.com/post-2-34120.html

74

ONO encourages users to open advertising tabs, so users who open
advertisements will obtain additional incentives from advertisers in ONOT.

2）Continuous operation and maintenance
The social media network of ONO has the right to audit the content of the
advertisement in order to maintain the free rights and interests of the user and
the security of the property. The unlawful, unconventional, and programmed
advertisements that go against the common creed of the community will not be
entered into the advertising space.
The advertising distribution system needs continuous maintenance by a
technology team, and also needs an O&M team to audit and run advertising
content. Both teams need sustained financial support.
Therefore, 10% of the advertising revenue of ONO will be used to motivate this
team to maintain basic operations.

3） The special first five years
In the first 5 years, the ONOT from advertising revenue will be allocated to users
and content creators reasonably under the premise of deducting R&D costs.
Why is this done? An advertising system needs a lot of R&D and maintenance
work to ensure its stable and efficient operation. A high-quality advertising
distribution system is good for the social media network of ONO as it would
increase circulation of ONOT.
At the same time, this will ensure that the total amount of ONOT circulating in
the market will be:

75

200+350+200+50*5=100 billion

5.2.2 Formula
In the early stage of the social media network of ONO, a simplified and CPM
advertising model will be applied, and it will be iterated and modified according
to future voting results.
The simplified, initial CPM advertising model is as follows:
First of all, there has to be a prediction of the number of advertisements.
The number of advertisements will be taken as the pricing basis of ONOT
(ONOTs Cost Per Thousand Impressions, OCPM).
Secondly, the ONOT used in advertising has to be reasonably split and
distributed. (see 5.2.1 for detailed distribution rules)
13698630/0.8=17123288
Therefore, under ideal circumstances, the number of ONOT paid by advertisers
every day is:
13698630/0.8=17123288
The OCPM can be calculated after the number of ONOT payments and the
number of advertisements is predicted.
OCPM=17123288/（predicted views of ADs/1000)

OCPM=17123288/（predicted views of ADs/1000)
However, the number of advertisements and the number of advertisements will
be biased. Therefore, AAF (Actual Advertising Fees) is used to represent the
real income of the day.

76

ACTUAL ADS FEES = OCPM*(REAL VIEWS/1000)
After deducting the 13698630 ONOT paid to advertisement consumers, the
remaining ONOT will be distributed equally to the advertising system
maintenance team and open advertising column users of the open advertising
column.
When AAF>13698630,
The advertising system operation and maintenance team: get (AAF 13698630) *50%
The open advertising column content creator and user: get (AAF -13698630)
*50%

Summary
In the future, the advertising mechanism of ONO may become more
complicated. But its core operations, that is, the incentivisation of advertisement
consumer, the advertising system maintenance, and the open advertising
content, combined with the ONOT mechanism, will not change unless it is
required to be modified through voting.

77

Chapter Six

Execution

Preface
Recently, users from all over the world are questioning and protesting against
Facebook for leaking private information of nearly 50 million users.
This abominable act clearly exemplifies how a social network can be misused.
It not only sells users personal private data for profit, it can even involve greater
schemes and conspiracies—changing the political climate, controlling the
thinking of people, and destroy people’s lives.

A Difficult Paradox
Because of this, users will have the following concern: will ONO be like
Facebook or other centralised platforms? Will they peep on users? Sell and
leak user data2.5?
The answer is negative.
Any centralised for-profit organisation should not interfere with the data rights
of users. When a centralised platform exploits the rights of users, they are
definitely engaging in wrongdoing.
ONO is a free, decentralised social network; its mission is to restore user rights
to themselves. Therefore, ONO and the ONO team would never peep on users,
sell or leak their data.

2.5 Americans Believe that Facebook’s Data Leakage is Unacceptable
http://tech.qq.com/a/20180411/003831.htm

78

In order to ensure user experience and efficiency, early user content will be
stored through a small number of centralised solutions. At the same time, in
order to the true safety of content, when the technology is mature enough, the
contents to will be transferred to IPFS and the original centralised server copy
destroyed. To ensure openness and transparency, all the coding will gradually
be open source, thus eliminating user concerns.
But then, there will be another question that cannot be overlooked: Will the
ONO social network be a completely free social network without any regulation?
Can one post any content they want even if it is malicious in nature?
The answer is also negative.
A social network, along with its purpose and significance, is not merely a simple
developer tool or a chat software—just as previously mentioned in the
economic system, it functions as a gold mine for human culture; it bears
people’s non-material cultural intangible assets, producing a long-lasting and
deep impact on humanity.
The original intention of launching a social network such as ONO is to define
attention value, encourage more quality content, reduce vulgar and low-quality
content to not exploit the attention of users or harm them in any way.
In fact, from the long-term significance of human civilisation, producing and
propagating inferior content is also a kind of evil in itself.
ONO tries to create a kind of civil governance content execution solution to
solve this paradox.

The Values undergirding ONO

79

As the white paper previously stated: Through “referendum”, the ONO social
network’s governance system would have democratic features.
So, what cannot be changed?
In order to create a free and prosperous social network environment, ONO will
maintain a kind of unchangeable resolution from beginning to end, that is: ONO
uses the community consensus as a baseline; all of the social network
members are equal and should all be respected and happy; with the ultimate
vision being to have a prosperous social network ecosystem. These are the
values undergirding ONO, these values exist naturally and cannot be affected
by any will and will never be changed.

The Execution of ONO
“Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else.” —
Declaration of the Rights of man and of the citizen, Fourth Article, 1789.
Imagine that ONO is a non-regulated, fully free social network. Any person can
use ONO for evil purposes as they like. Then, the user experience on ONO will
be even worse than that of a underground network—criminal, discrimination,
and extreme discourse, groundless content and terrorism, anti-humanity, and
other types of content that are extremely negative to the point where its
dissemination hurts society would be running wild. It would eventually come to
a point where the bad outnumbers the good, or lead to hatred, war, or other
worse consequences.
In fact, this is not the true definition of freedom. Freedom comes with its
established responsibilities, duties, and respect for rights of people. Its basis is
not do harm. It is the right for people to realise or express their will, but without
doing harm.

80

ONO will absolutely not tolerate any behaviour that hurts the rights of its people.
This kind of content will be hidden. Users that engage in malicious behaviour
will be reported and punished.
Thus, another question arises: Who decides which content is in violation of the
rules? Who will come to manage the content of ONO?
From beginning to end ONO is committed to decentralised and democratic
governance. The values of ONO do not support any centralised methods—
centralised evaluation and execution will lead to a great amount of bad user
experience.
This is why the super partners’ role is born. This is a type of election system
where certain highly regarded community members will be chosen as "super
partners". Super partners (see chapter 6. ONO Partners) are chosen through
an referendum where all members of ONO participate, representing their will.

81

Chapter Seven

The DAC of ONO

“A small country has fewer people.
Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than
man, they are not needed.
The people take death seriously and do not travel far.
Though they have boats and carriages, no one uses them.
Though they have armour and weapons, no one displays them.
Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.
Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure;
They are happy in their ways.
Though they live within sight of their neighbours,
And crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,
Yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die.”
- Chapter 8 Tao Te Ching, translation by Gia-Fu Feng (馮家福 Feng Jia-fu,
1919–1985) and Jane English (1942–)

Vintage Books, 1989 https://terebess.hu/english/tao/gia.html#Kap08
The DAC (Decentralised Autonomous Community) of ONO is a distributed,
autonomous organisation running continuously within the ONO social network.
The DAC operation mechanism of ONO divides operational tasks and
distributes them publicly, so that operations can be implemented transparently

82

and without management. Participants do not need to be employees to be part
of the DAC of ONO.
After using the Partner system for a period of time, the ONO team discovered
the importance of the organisation’s governance mechanism. A truly
decentralised social network requires that the founding team as well as the
technology itself be decentralised and promoted in the community.
Management and governance should be decentralised as well.
Centralisation will result in corruption and abuse of people’s rights in the short
term. In the long term, a centralised organisation will rely on top-down
management which will result in a narrower and narrower design; conversely,
decentralised organisations will bring the consensus of human thinking and the
formation of natural co-governance which will lead to the development and
prosperity of its ecosystem.
As Lao Tzu said in the Tao Te Ching,
“Yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die.”
The “small country, few people” chapter of the Tao Te Ching consists in
acknowledging the significance of differentiation of roles and communities in
society, but opposes the imposition of centralised, wide-scale values. The
intention is that in addition to acknowledging top-down wisdom, it also
recognises contextual rights that are created by communities from the bottom
up. Federalism is more idealised for equality, collectivism, consensus, and
autonomy.
“Letting communities self-organise combined with some outside governance”
contains the fundamental meaning of decentralisation. When larger and rigidly
controlled structures are involved in public governance and which are brought
into being through the consolidation of power, if they do not know how to let
communities self-organise, the abuse of rights is extremely likely.

83

Freedom, equality, social co-governance and diversity are the values of the
social network of ONO. The vision of ONO is similar to that of Lao Tzu’s
approach to public governance and coincides with the concept of the DAC. The
DAC of ONO thus is born.

7.1 What is a DAC?
The DAC organisation has the following characteristics:
1) Management Discretisation
2) Autonomous voting mechanism
3) Decision-making process is 100% transparent, decision-making is reversible
4) There is no administrative overlord; any distributed autonomous institution
must have a mechanism to expel the founder, and it should not be under the
exclusive control of any one individual. Therefore, administrator roles can
automatically change hands to maintain vitality. For example, the governance
mechanism of Wikipedia 2.6 decided to kick out its founder from the Wiki
Foundation.
5) Come and go freely. Join at any time and leave voluntarily at any time.
6) The sub-organisation has the same characteristics as the main-level
organisation. Therefore, no subordinate relationship exists between the many
layers within the organisation, but they should be mutually cooperative.
7) The organisations are symbiotic and form a mesh-like interconnected web.
Each point in the web forms in a non-linear fashion and is able to influence
other points without needing to go through a strict hierarchy.

84

7.2 DAC Incentives on ONO
Historical data shows that traditional social media spends no less than 20% of
its revenue each year on operational expansion, as can be seen from past case
studies.
Obviously, investment in operational promotion can increase the number of new
users more quickly, increase the activity of the social ecosystem, and promote
the development of it. This activity has long-term benefits for the social network
of ONO.

DAC Operational Incentives Pool of ONO
Therefore, an amount of 2% of ONOTs is issued for smart contracts every day,
that is, a total of 273,973 ONOTs will flow into the DAC operational rewards
pool of ONO and be dedicated to DAC operations. (For example, the
remuneration and costs incurred by community partners, volunteers will be paid
through DAC operating expenses allocated through ONO).

7.3 Early DAC Operational Incentive Pool Management of ONO
Since the DAC operations of ONO has not yet been formed, the DAC operation
pool of ONO is temporarily being managed by the NOME TECH PTY, the main
body of the founding team. It is jointly planned and used by the Super Partners,
the founding team and all the DAC organisations on ONO.
All decision-making processes, operating conditions, operating costs, and final
proposal results will be published. The flow of expenses will also be recorded
and tracked on the blockchain.

85

In order to prevent collective corruption, users have the right to monitor and
influence the use of DAC operating expenses of ONO through a Referendum.

7.4 Different Organisations of DACs on ONO
The DAC Community Partners of ONO
Community Partners are a class of DAC organisations that are part of the DAC
operations on ONO.
As mentioned above, DAC operation on ONO upholds the principles of
decentralisation, creating, developing, and governing the community and
promoting social networking.
The Community Partners are not full-time or part-time employees of ONO, but
participate in the prosperous development of ONO in an autonomous, cogoverning DAC style. In theory, the number of Community Partners is everchanging, autonomous and infinitely variable.
Community Partners consist of the most well-respected members of the
community of ONO, and they take initiatives to assume the responsibility of
establishing the community of ONO in addition they are counsellors for the
founding team regarding the operational needs of ONO.
Based on the values of ONO, and in order to grow the community and social
network of ONO as their organisational goal, Community Partners need to use
their ability to build relationships with their group members and keep the
community active, creating an autonomous, prosperous and active ONO
network. They need to have ongoing discussions about the environment within
their communities.
Although the founding team is not obligated to participate in the governance of
the DAC of ONO, it will do its best to support the Community Partners in fulfilling

86

their organisational goals with a friendly attitude and collaborative spirit. For
example, resources such as materials, founding team incentive sharing, online
media traffic, DAC operating rewards pool funding, etc., are provided to assist
Community Partners in forming an autonomous and prosperous community.

DAC Community Volunteers on ONO
Community Volunteers form a type of DAC organisation that is part of DAC
operations on ONO.
As mentioned above, the DAC operation mechanism on ONO upholds the
principle of decentralisation, creating, developing, and governing the
community and promoting social networking.
The Community Volunteers are not full-time or part-time employees of ONO.
Instead, they participate in the prosperous development of ONO through the
means of autonomous and coordinated DAC activities. In theory, the number
of volunteers in the community is ever-changing, autonomous and infinitely
variable.
Community Volunteers act based on the core philosophy and values ONO.
They are willing to guard the main system of returning value to content creators,
answer questions from new users about participating in the processes of ONO,
help more people understand ONO, and better understand how ONO can meet
their respective needs.
Although the founding team is not obligated to participate in the governance of
the DAC of ONO, it will do its best to support the Community Volunteers in
fulfilling their organisational goals with a friendly attitude and collaborative spirit.
For example, resources such as materials, founding team incentive sharing,
online media traffic, and DAC operations incentive pool funding are provided to
assist them in the dissemination of the values of ONO.

87

DAC Tone Partners of ONO
The Tone Partner is the abbreviation of the founding partner of the early social
network building of ONO. This refers to the first 300,000 people who joined the
social network of ONO in addition to the developer team of ONO.
The 300,000 Tone Partners will be the first to participate in the building of
content mechanisms, creative support, active contributions, and popularisation
of users who might potentially like ONO before the social network of ONO is
fully open to the general public.
The social network of ONO is grateful to the Tone Partners for their early trust,
commitment and support. In return, ONO will award the Tone Partners with a
series of incentives within the social network, including but not limited to ONOT.
The 300,000 Tone Partners will be joining in three stages. They are: 50,000 in
the first phase; 100,000 in the second phase; and 150,000 in the third phase.
A total of 300 million ONOTs will be used for incentivising Keynote Partner
participation.

DAC Co-Contributing Partners of ONO
The Co-Contributing Partner is an abbreviation for the joint Construction
Partner of the social network and refers to a person who, in addition to the
developer team of ONO, provides early financial support, development and
assistance to the social network of ONO. The social network of ONO expresses
its gratitude to the Partners of ONO for their early trust, commitment and
support. In return, ONO will incentivise the Co-Contributing Partners with a
range of things in the social network, including but not limited to ONOT.

88

According to the degree of contribution, Co-Contributing Partners are divided
into several levels. Co-Contributing partners will enjoy a series of exclusive
rights within the social network, including exclusive mission incentives in
ONOT, as a marker of the value created by the Co-Contributors. The CoContributing Partners have the right to retract their support for the social
network of ONO at any time. When their support is retracted, all the Partners’
special rights, including the incentivised ONOT, will have to be returned.

Unlimited Possibilities: The DAC of ONO
As mentioned above, the DAC of ONO will continue to grow with the
development of the social network of ONO and ONOT, and it will also produce
unpredictable changes. In the future, there may be more secondary DAC
organisations belonging to the DAC of ONO.
Let us reiterate here that the core values of ONO will always be the same.

7.5 Special members of the DAC of ONO: Super Partner
Super Partners are the loyal guardians of the values of the social network of
ONO and are the managers of the social networking content which needs to be
collapsed. Not only that, the Super Partners are obliged to pass on the values
of ONO to others, plus develop and assist more Community Partners and
Volunteers.
The mission of the Super Partners is to maintain the security, freedom and
decentralisation of the social network of ONO, properly manage harmful
content, prevent abusive behaviour from spreading, and transmit the values of
ONO. This will be the prerequisite for the development of the social network of
ONO.

89

The Super Partners should be: loyal, kind, self-controlled, humble, possess
long-term vision and embody firm beliefs, and serve all of humanity.

Punishment and Consequences
In the social network of ONO, the content ecosystem is an important
component. The importance of optimising content quality and reducing the
influence of harmful content is obvious. ONO can use the reputation
mechanism to promote the birth of high quality content with “invisible hands” to
curb the proliferation of low-quality content; individual dispute cases can be
resolved through Referendums — but there is still a problem of inefficiency in
judging the content of the Common Program.
When there is content that obviously does not conform to the boundaries of the
Social Network Common Program of ONO and needs to be immediately
collapsed, everyone requires the Super Partner to complete this work in an
extremely short period of time to prevent the social network from being
contaminated.
ONO provides Super Partners with an efficient and collaborative working
method. Super Partners can perform actions against harmful content through
web-based management background/mobile management back-end tools.

Communication and Incentives
Undoubtedly, the role of the Super Partner will assume a critically important
responsibility and will also attract a large amount of ONOT incentives. However,
it is worth mentioning that the Super Partners need to reasonably allocate the
obtained ONOT according to operational requirements.

90

In order to ensure the safety of users in the social network of ONO and to
sustainably develop the Super Partnership system, the Super Partners’ real-life
information and operations will be required to be publicised. Any one user may
impeach a Super Partner if they do not work or do evil.

Definition of Super Partner
Super Partners have the following characteristics:
1) The total number of Super Partners numbers no more than 51 persons, who
are selected through the public election system;
2) The Super Partner does not need to belong to any enterprise or entity, only
to a decentralised DAC organisation;
3) Super Partners are a special type of DAC organisation. Although they are a
DAC on ONO, their incentives are not derived from the DAC operation rewards
pool of ONO;
4) The Super Partner is similar to an administrator of the social network; the
difference between this management mechanism and the traditional centralised
platform/existing decentralised platform (2.7) is that the Super Partner’s
authority is mediated through the Common Program. Clearly, the power of the
user community over the Super Partner can be effectively exhibited, i.e.,
through complaints, impeachment, veto, and general elections. And, most
importantly, the Super Partners and all users are in a community of interests
rather than in antagonistic relationships.
5) Super Partners also have certain rights: content management/third-party
application management/participation in operations, markets, technology
iterations, etc on ONO.

91

Super Partner Roundtable Proposal
In the Referendum, virtually every user can participate in promoting the
prosperity of the ecosystem of ONO through a Referendum vote. However, in
actual experiments, it has been found that the democratic mechanism of ONO
has a non-negligible efficiency problem, which will lead to a long process from
decision-making to action and will hurt the user experience. A Super Partner
Roundtable Proposal that balances democracy and efficiency came into being.

Representatives of Public Opinion
Without prejudice to the Common Program and public interest, the Super
Partners have the ability to bypass the Referendum within their jurisdiction and
to vote through the Super Partner Roundtable. All the proposals and voting
results of Super Partners will be published on the social network of ONO and
on the official website. The founding team will never participate in this proposal
form and voting.

Founding Team’s Early One-Vote Veto
The founding team retains a veto vote in the selection of the first generation
Super Partners. This is done to prevent the collective corruption of the Super
Partners, and there may be no awareness of impeachment rights in the early
users of the social network of ONO.

User Rights Are Most Important Aspect

92

Users can reject a proposal passed by any Super Partner through a
Referendum.
It needs to be reiterated that the power of the Super Partner is always effectively
mediated by the public consensus. Users can vote for the Super Partners that
he or she wishes to elect from previous elections, complain about a Super
Partner that he or she is disgruntled with, impeach him/her, and reject any of
the Super Partners’ proposals.

The First Generation of Super Partners: Trial Period
The first batch of Super Partners emerged in April 2018. At this time, the social
network of ONO had not yet been launched and they cannot be voted in through
the Referendum. But as the White Paper section says, “The social network of
ONO requires Super Partners.”
Early trust and support are important components for a social network. Thanks
to the first batch of supporters of ONO, the first generation of Super Partners
partnered with communities that have contributed to the early building of ONO.
People and volunteers submitted applications. Community Partners and
Volunteers can apply to become the first generation of Super Partners. This
position can be voluntarily retracted but it is not transferable to others.
At this stage, there will be 51 Super Partners who embody the values of ONO
and are willing to contribute to the early building of the social network of ONO.
In order to ensure that the process is truly open and transparent, ONO will
publish this data and selection process.

Options

93

In addition to the Community Partners and Volunteers, the Super Partners also
set up an alternative list. Alternative Super Partners are also selected by the
community Partners/Volunteers. When the Super Partners in the trial phase are
appointed or removed, the alternative Super Partners will fill up the vacancies.

Trial Period
Due to the special nature of the first generation of Super Partners, the Super
Partners exist in the trial phase before the first Super Partner election. During
this trial phase, any Super Partners who have not fulfilled their duties will be
removed.

Appointment and Removal Mechanism
To ensure the safety of users in the social network and for the sustainable
development of the Super Partnership system, the Super Partners’ real-life
information and operations will be required to be published. Any one user may
impeach a Super Partner if they do not work or do evil.

Publishing Schedule
According to the open and free user ecosystem of ONO, in order to ensure that
the work of the Super Partners is open, transparent, and
verifiable, the daily work of the Super Partners will be published, such as the
number of teams and workers, amount of work completed, awarding bonuses,
etc.

94

All users of ONO will be able to clearly understand the working ability and output
of each Super Partner based on their work documentation in order to determine
which of the Super Partners will receive their vote during the next general
election.
At the same time, ONO will regularly organise weekly and monthly meetings of
the Super Partners. Each Super Partner will report on their work, including but
not limited to the team-building situation, the problems encountered and the
necessary collaboration. The meeting will be publicly published. The purpose
of the meeting is to create joint strategies for the team of ONO and the Super
Partners to build and improve the Super Partner system.

Formal Super Partner Mechanism
Data shows that traditional social media companies recruit more than 10,000
employees each year as content review specialists. It has been learnt in the
Super Partners section that it is necessary to collapse inferior content.
Reducing inferior content can improve the quality of user content and at the
same time increase the social activity in the network. This also has long-term
benefits for the entire ecosystem of ONO.
From this it can be seen that the Super Partners will assume enormous
operational pressures and will also be responsible for the development of the
social ecosystem of ONO. At the same time, with regard to the continuous
development of ONO in the future, multi-lingual global Super Partners will likely
participate not only in this form but perhaps they will create a secondary DAC
organisation to establish a cross-cultural effort.

Super Partner Incentive Pool of ONO

95

A portion of 2% ONOTs, i.e., a total of 273,973 ONOTs, will be issued via smart
contracts on a daily basis, which will flow into the Super Partner Incentive Pool
of ONO and will be dedicated to supporting the development of the Super
Partner ecosystem.

Distribution
Super Partners are part of the DAC organisation of ONO, but because they
have a fixed total number and are elected, they have considerable influence.
The ONO team believes that greater responsibility and a higher degree of
involvement in the decentralised, self-organised system of ONO will mean that
Super Partners will have to act with complete transparency.
Therefore, the work of the Super Partners will be quantified and the distribution
method of ONOTs will be decided accordingly. This distribution model should
be based on the consensus of the Super Partner DAC of ONO.
Its allocation will go through a trial period until it reaches the consensus of the
users. The ONO team believes that short-term chaos and confusion will be
unavoidable just like the experience of anarchy, but it is undeniable that this
practical process is necessary.
All decision-making processes, operating conditions, costs, and proposal
results will be published. The record of expenses will also be recorded and
tracked on the blockchain. In order to prevent collective corruption, users have
the right to monitor and influence the distribution and use of the Super Partner
Incentive pool of ONO through a Referendum.

Election Mechanism

96

ONO has detailed procedures for the Super Partner election.

Candidates:
ONO is based on freedom, decentralised user intent, a statement of the general
election, from a fixed point in time and ending in the next election, candidates
may have the intention to apply for public information in line with the rules of
the election in any channel, and Publish campaign statements and declarations
through any channel;
In order to create a free and decentralised user-directed platform, ONO will
issue a statement about the general election, reasons, time schedule, next-term
membership and election methods. Interested parties may openly submit
application materials that meet the election rules in any channel. The
candidates may publish campaign statements and declarations through any
channel.

Objection Period
ONO will regularly collect qualified candidates and publish their candidacy
materials during a certain period of time before the results of the voting is
announced. During this period, a user can initiate a declaration of objection to
any candidate through a Referendum. According to the result of the
Referendum, it will determine whether or not he/she will continue to be a
candidate.
The following describes one’s eligibility for election.

97

Referendum period
When the objection period ends, all new candidate channels will be frozen and
everyone can vote for their chosen candidates who have been published.

Elected
When the Referendum period is over, ONO will announce the list of Super
Partners according to the voting results and award the title of Super Partner to
the winners. From the date of election, all new Super Partners will begin to
implement the Super Partners’ work and mission.

Withdrawal
Super Partners and SP candidates may withdraw at any time. After the
withdrawal, they will be replaced by alternatives via the alternative Super
Partner mechanism. The monthly incentives will be paid on a daily basis. If they
apply for withdrawal during the election period, they will lose their current
election eligibility.

Options
Based on the results of the vote Referendum, ONO will compile a list of Super
Partner candidates who did not receive enough votes and arrange them
according to the number of votes each received. When there are situations like
withdrawal, appointment, and impeachment in the Super Partner roster, which
would result in fewer than 51, the alternate Super Partners must fill the
vacancies, according to the number of votes they received.

98

Appointment and Removal Mechanism
In order to prevent the Super Partners from committing evil and in order to
protect the safety, freedom, and decentralisation of all individuals in the social
network of ONO, a mechanism has been set up for the appointment and
removal of Super Partners:
1. With regard to solving controversies surrounding managing abusive content
and the Referendum, here is clarification: If a Super Partner does not collapse
user content based on the “Collapsing Content Rules,” the Super Partner will
soon be voted on.
2. If the Super Partner loses more than 75% of the votes and if this behaviour
occurs more than 3 times in the relevant appeal for that day, he/she will be
restricted from his/her content management rights for that day. If this penalty is
given more than 3 times, the Super Partner is deemed to be as acting badly
and will be removed from the list of Super Partners.
In this way, it is ensured that the job of collapsing harmful content is carried out
by those who are efficient and active.

Rules for Collapsing Content
The collapsing content rule is to ensure that the Super Partners can work better
and jointly formulate strategies and agree with each other. As with the Social
Network Common Program of ONO, it will be continuously optimised and
iterated.
1. Content that does not conform to the Social Network’s Common Program of
ONO should be collapsed.

99

2. In order to protect the diversity of content, the content must not be collapsed
according to personal wishes or preferences.
3. If content is found to be contentious, Super Partners are responsible for
initiating a Referendum to solve individual case disputes.
Every user has the right to appeal their collapsed content.

Challenges and Strategies

For the social network ONO, the main challenges are two-fold: capacity and
efficiency.
The capacity issue will grow as the number of social network users grows for
ONO. With the increase in the number of users, the speed and amount of
content managed will experience explosive growth. Increasing content will put
pressure on storage; IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed storage network,
suitable for single upload multiple downloads, which is a characteristic of the
social network. It can ease the pressure on data volume surges; however, as
the exponential level of data volume increases, the download speed will still be
a problem to be considered. We are considering to use IPFS, or something
similar, or some modified version of it. We will use the ONOchain preview
network to test performance and scaling before deciding on the final storage
system.
The efficiency problem is also a huge challenge. Based on the characteristics
of the blockchain, the drastic increase of data volume will lead to inefficient
chaining and will result in a poor user experience. The social network of ONO
adopts the DPOS-based EOSIO software, trying to solve the ever-increasing
pressure of efficiency. However, when the number of users is extremely large,
the speed of the consensus algorithm is still a constraint factor, so a better
algorithm is required to support high concurrency scenarios. We will make
certain modifications to the EOSIO software, to tune it for our use case, and
expect to achieve the necessary performance parameters.
Fortunately, the increasingly open operating strategy of ONO will be
synchronised with iterative techniques, enabling the implementation of an ideal
community

step-by-step. We

will

continuously

track

and

implement

108

performance and other enhancements of EOSIO, from the main repository, the
EOS Mainnet, and other EOS based sister chains.
DPOS+BFT implemented in EOS is a long-awaited, high-quality solution — as
described in the previous section, it can effectively solve performance problems
and support a high-concurrency data network. Experience from the EOS
Mainnet, launched in June 2018, shows that it can achieve 4000 transactions
per second. We expect this to improve gradually over time, and will stay current
with improvements.
ONOchain will launch in cooperation with experienced, capable block
producers which have experience from the EOS Mainnet, to ensure stability
and that the top technical skills are applied. The initial producers will be globally
distributed, independent and highly decentralized appointees.
At this time, the content creation infrastructure of ONO has been completed
and a more optimised version will be released on EOS. Once V2.0 is
completed, registration will be officially opened to all users.
Through the foreseeable future, ONO will operate on the EOSIO DPOS
architecture. Should a new blockchain technology emerge and prove more
effective, we will consider and possibly migrate to that new technology. The
ONO technical team will continuously evaluate and implement technical
solutions. The team will make choices which are based on open source and
open standards, and which will always allow migration to better solutions.

Nome Foundation

NOME’s Legal Structure
The ONO project established a NOME Foundation based in Australia. The
Foundation will act as an independent legal entity and be solely responsible for
the founding team organisation, development, promotion and operation of the
ONO project and assume all relevant legal responsibilities.
The NOME Foundation will strictly abide by local laws and regulations, provide
project financing to specific groups in an appropriate manner, and will distribute
ONOTs as well. For legal reasons, ONO will not conduct fund-raising activities
in certain countries and regions. The entire amount of funds raised by the ONO
Foundation will be used for technology development, marketing, community
building, financial auditing, business development, and other purposes that are
closely related to the development of ONO projects.
Policies vary from place to place around the world. Due to compliance with local
laws, ONO may not be able to provide normal services in some countries or
regions.

The role of the NOME Foundation
The NOME Foundation is an independent organisation whose main
responsibilities include:
Support R&D of the platform, development and select important partners of
ONO.
Responsible for the development and support of teams and related parties;
Abide by all rules, legal structures and perform compliance supervision.

118

Statement of Risks and

Disclaimer
Risks
You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with
purchasing ONOT, holding ONOT, and using ONOT for participation in ONO.
In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or part of the ONOT which
had been purchased. IF YOU DECIDE TO PURCHASE ONOT, YOU
EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING
RISKS:
Policy risk: There may be price volatility caused by unstable policies on
blockchains in countries and regions around the world. It is impossible to predict
how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or
create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications,
including ONOT and/or ONO. Regulatory actions could negatively impact
ONOT and/or ONO in various ways. The Foundation, the Distributor (or its
affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory
actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such
jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory
approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. After consulting with a wide range of
legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and legal structure
of virtual currencies, a cautious approach will be applied towards the sale of
ONOT. Therefore, for the token sale, the sale strategy may be constantly
adjusted in order to avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible. For the
token sale, the Foundation and the Distributor are working with Tzedek Law
LLC, a boutique corporate law firm in Singapore with a good reputation in the
blockchain space.
Transaction risk: The trading behaviour of the secondary market will affect the
market price of ONOT at all times. The secondary market for emerging digital
currencies has a larger volatility than the traditional market, and there may be
drastic fluctuations in prices.

120

Technical risk: The underlying technology of the blockchain is in a high-speed
development stage, which is a requirement for projects on ONO. There may be
a situation where the development of ONO is hindered due to the stagnation of
the technology.
Operational risk: Risks caused by uncertainties in operating factors of ONO
such as the business strategy, inter-bank competition, and cooperative
institutions.
Failure to develop: There is the risk that the development of ONO will not be
executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without
limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency
or ONOT, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds
for activities.
Security weaknesses: Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations
may attempt to interfere with ONOT and/or ONO in a variety of ways, including,
but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based
attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that
a third party or a member of the Foundation, the Distributor or its affiliates may
intentionally

or

unintentionally

introduce

weaknesses

into

the

core

infrastructure of ONOT and/or ONO, which could negatively affect ONOT
and/or ONO.
Other risks: In addition, ONO also faces many risks, including but not limited
to the world economy and environment, blockchain development, corporate
operations, and other unpredictable events. The potential risks briefly
mentioned above are not exhaustive and there are other risks (as more
particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions) associated with your purchase,
holding and use of ONOT, including those that the Foundation or the Distributor
cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated
variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks. You should conduct full

121

due diligence on the Foundation, the Distributor, its affiliates and the ONO
team, as well as understand the overall framework, mission and vision for ONO
prior to purchasing ONOT.
