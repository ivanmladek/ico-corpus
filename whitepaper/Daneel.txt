A NOTE FROM DANEEL’S FOUNDER

First of all, thank you for your interest in Daneel. I hope that this
document will enlighten you about our vision and our project.
Daneel is born from the passion of its creators for Blockchain and
cryptocurrency, in a changing world, one in which the two technologies
have a real role to play.
Our role is to democratize cryptocurrency in order to make it more
accessible to mass market investors, by proposing a thoughtful and
innovative solution for them.
We are aware of the bad publicity linked to the notion of an ICO (Initial
Coin Offering) over previous months, mainly due to a lack of reliability
in certain projects. That’s why, even though the legislative framework is
still developing, we were determined to respect all basic responsibilities
in legislation, security and information. We hope that you will therefore
see this as guarantee of reliability, and that you will believe in us and in
Daneel.
We welcome your comments and suggestions at the email address
joseph@daneel.io.
Enjoy your reading and see you soon,

Joseph Bedminster
Founder of Daneel Assistant Company

WHITEPAPER

INTRODUCTION TO BLOCKCHAIN AND TO
CRYPTOCURRENCY

Blockchain: a revolution in the making
A real, innovative tool which is about to profoundly transform our societies as well
as the relationships between individuals, organizations and states, Blockchain
represents a chain of “blocks” (digital containers) where information of all sorts is
stored: transactions, contracts, title deeds, works of art…
This set of blocks form a database similar to the pages of a great accounts book,
known as a “register”, which is itself hosted by a group of network users.
Unlike the centralized system that currently governs our societies, Blockchain
primarily allows users to get away from a centralized body or a third party.
At the heart of this system, special users called “miners” have the role of ensuring
the validity of transactions by providing the entire network with the computing
power of their computers.
Once the algorithm has completed its validation exercise, all users of Blockchain
can simply verify that the exercise is correct; then, when a large majority of
Blockchain users have validated the computing operation, the block is added to
the chain and the transactions that it contains are considered valid.
Blockchain therefore includes the following advantageous characteristics:
•

Security: The decentralized framework and the blocks’ codes guarantee the
absolute security of the information.

•

Disintermediation: The concept of “consensus” replaces any of centralized
validation.

•

Autonomy: The creation of cryptocurrency covers the costs of the
infrastructure involved.
WWW.DANEEL.IO

WHITEPAPER

By this revolutionary principle, Blockchain is on the brink of causing a profound
upheaval to all sectors of the economy, and many related projects have already
begun.

What is cryptocurrency?
Each Blockchain is associated with a
cryptocurrency (also called a token). The
most well known is the Bitcoin, a currency
invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.
Today,

there

are

several

hundred

different digital currencies.
They all share the common trait of being
a virtual means of exchange, not based in
any single state, as opposed to the Dollar
or the Euro. They circulate via peer-topeer networks, based on cryptographic algorithms, and are not necessarily
intended as a payment system between users.
The number of units in circulation and the maximum money supply are defined in
advance and visible to all. Until proven otherwise, cryptocurrency cannot be
counterfeited or stolen.
It is possible today to define several separate families of cryptocurrency, which are
adapted to the objectives of the communities who use them:
§

“Infrastructure” currency: the type of currency likely to bring about the
most profound changes, whose ambition goes far beyond being a simple
means of payment, and which has the objective of offering a real alternative
to the existing financial system.
Examples: Ethereum, NXT, Ripple...

WWW.DANEEL.IO

7

WHITEPAPER

§

“Social” currency: currency created to allow the easy exchange of small
financial amounts between web users (“social tipping”), on existing social
networks in particular.

§

Alternative currency: broadly inspired by Bitcoin, these currencies
attempt, via technical innovation, to function either more easily, more
securely or more rapidly, for example by reducing transaction verification
times.

o Examples: Litecoin, Digibyte...
§

Anonymous currency: currency created solely to serve as a purely
anonymous means of payment, protecting both the user’s identity as well
as their transactions.

o Examples: Monero, Bytecoin…

Exchanging cryptocurrency; a speculative
investment
Cryptocurrencies are primarily an investment of potential
profitably.
These alternative digital currencies represent, in effect, a new
kind of investment intrinsically linked with our modern digital
economy.
While extremely volatile, they can demonstrate impressive
financial performances:
Bitcoin exceeded a rate of 6,000 USD in October 2017, despite being traded at a
rate of 434 USD in January 2016!

Indeed, it’s because of cryptocurrency’s speculative nature that it attracts
investors, who generally appreciate the risky characteristics of this kind of market.
Speculation is rampant in the universe of cryptocurrency, not only in regards to
rate variation against the dollar, but also regarding the financial operations that
cryptocurrencies finance.

WWW.DANEEL.IO

WHITEPAPER

Many investors are also in search of an asset to provide diversification to their
portfolio, and thus invest a small proportion of their assets with a view towards a
long-term gain. Cryptocurrency can effectually provide for the needs of investors
seeking to diversify their risks by turning toward alternative investments.

Accessing reactive and reliable sources of
information; a strategic challenge for the
cryptocurrency investor
A major concern for every investor, having access to a comprehensive, reliable
and rapid source of information is a fundamental part of the decision-making
process in cryptocurrency investing.
With the development of the digital world and the increasing
“datafication” of our society, information is becoming more
and more immediately accessible to every individual, through
exchange platforms, social media, specialized print media,
television programs, groups of influencers, word of mouth and
more.
Not a day goes by without being flooded with information!
In the face of such an inundation of data, investors will inevitably encounter a
number of difficulties.

WWW.DANEEL.IO

9

WHITEPAPER

Cross-referencing sources and analysing content to access reliable
information
Rumours and conflicting or manipulated information can significantly influence the
purchase and sale of cryptocurrency for numerous investors.
In fact, for many years digital and interactive means have bit by bit taken over all
classic forms of communication media and non-media, and the Internet has come
to be completely integrated in corporate marketing campaigns.
Furthermore,

the

development

of

social

networks

favouring interaction between web users in an often
anonymous manner has led each individual to post more
and more often, unavoidably leading to an increase in
«misinformation». The Internet has thus become social,
movable and participative… and today one tweet from an
influential individual may have more of an impact on cryptocurrency rates than the
actions of institutions themselves!
So, to what extent can information concerning cryptocurrency be biased? How can
reliability be ensured, so that the plethora of online information a user encounters
does not jeopardize every one of their investments?

Capturing the right information at the right time, amongst all
available data
As an investor, the search for reliable information often resembles a complex
quest: how can we identify the limited number of good resources? How can we
sort them out? How can we interpret this information in order to make informed
decisions?

WWW.DANEEL.IO

10

WHITEPAPER

In addition, while certain investors may benefit from a lack of information, others
feel «overwhelmed» by the flow of available data and will inevitably find
themselves exposed to an overabundance of information.
This phenomenon of overexposure will result in an alteration in decision-making
and a decline in investment performance.
Information encountered about investments needs to be sufficient without
becoming overwhelming, as well as easy and practical to use.

Capturing the emotions of the market
The sheer amount of information available renders each investor more vulnerable
to emotion when investing.
« Fear of Missing Out » (FOMO), « Panic sell », « Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt »
(FUD), are several examples of the phenomena that can negatively influence the
ability of investors to manage their emotions while making decisions.
This poor emotional management then leads to ill-thought-out short-term actions,
including sudden changes in trading and investment strategies, and the following
of unfounded trends… often at the expense of invested capital.

Benefiting from an appropriate level of knowledge and
comprehension around cryptocurrency
Understanding the details of Blockchain and cryptocurrency, learning to trade,
mastering the fundamentals… these are some of the many topics that each
investor should know and understand. But where can this information be found?

WWW.DANEEL.IO

11

WHITEPAPER

The various tutorials available on the Internet come with a relatively high price
tag, and are often not sufficiently adapted to an individual’s personal level.

The difficulty in managing multiple cryptocurrency
portfolios
Investors in cryptocurrency generally invest through exchange platforms chosen
based on:
•

The number of cryptocurrencies listed

•

The volume of exchanges present

•

The fees charged by the platform

•

The level of security and reliability

•

The design and ergonomics

Therefore, it often happens that an investor is obliged to use several platforms to
buy and sell the currencies they are interested in.
Managing these different platforms often involves multiple restrictions for the
investor:

difficulty

in

following

investment

performances,

using

different

currencies, slowness of services, two-step connections to platforms, managing
multiple sets of login details, risking error during transfers between platforms… as
many situations within this sector require a high level of responsiveness, this set
up may prove dire for the investor.

Our objective

To design the first intelligent personal assistant who
can accompany you in the daily management of
cryptocurrency.

WWW.DANEEL.IO

13

WHITEPAPER

Limits of existing personal assistant services
Assistants (or “bots”) currently available on the market have many notable
functional and technological limitations.
The present solutions are effectively confined to supplying information (the rate of
a cryptocurrency, information on the launch of an ICO, newspaper articles…)
through different channels of communication like Facebook and its “Messenger”
application, through “Slack” or even through “Telegram”.
Their use is also rarely user-friendly, as they often necessitate using predefined
commands to carry out simple requests, based around the recognition of set key
words (« What is the price of BTC? »).
These solutions respond only to a basic need, using primitive artificial intelligence
systems that are not able to:
§

Understand and interpret natural human language

§

Analyse and select the most reliable information available

§

Interact in a relevant way, in order to communicate the right trend at the
right time

WWW.DANEEL.IO

14

WHITEPAPER

Our solution
As we are fully aware of the limitations of these previous solutions, we’d like to
suggest an assistant of a new kind: a personal assistant based on Watson, one of
the most efficient artificial intelligences in the market, who will be responsible for
providing daily assistance in the world of cryptocurrency.
Through this, you will have ready access to an intelligent counsellor able to:
§

Understand and interact with you

§

Keep you informed in real time, with quality information that he gathered and
analysed himself

§

Identify and capture the different emotions of the market

§

Alert you as soon as one of your investments is in jeopardy

§

Facilitate easy portfolio follow-up and management, as well as ease of sales
and purchases.

§

Provide daily advice on your investments and on market trends

§

Provide personally-tailored indicators

This is the objective we have set for ourselves, and you can help us to develop it.

What type of investor is Daneel suited for?
Daneel is not intended to address professional investors, particularly those already
involved in trading rooms. Indeed, these investors often rely on specialized and
costly technologies, often developed and jealously guarded by banks.
On the contrary, we want to democratize access to artificial intelligence for
investors by offering our technology to non-professionals.

WWW.DANEEL.IO

15

WHITEPAPER

To do this, we have identified three mass-market investor profiles: beginner,
intermediate and advanced users.

WWW.DANEEL.IO

16

WHITEPAPER

TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS

The main technological stakes
In order for Daneel to meet all the objectives that we have set, we will have to
address several factors on a daily basis.

Make full use of the power of « Natural Language Understanding »
Daneel will need to be able to understand your queries
every time you turn to him, regardless of spelling or
sentence structure.
We will have to be confident of the ability of the system to
analyse and understand the meaning of human language,
to perceive emotions and to correctly perform the relevant
actions.

Guarantee the reliability of the information analysed and proposed
by Daneel
How can we, in a world with a huge amount of sources of information (online
newspapers, forums, social networks, expert networks, exchange platforms…)
determine which sources are reliable, so that information used is sure to be
trustworthy and free from manipulation?
We currently make use of the superior skills of the Blockchain sector, of specialized
journalists, and of specialized counsellors to bring together different informational

WWW.DANEEL.IO

17

WHITEPAPER

references. The goal is to categorize these, and then to determine reliability, as
well as which the method to employ for each source.
To gather together the mass of information within a sector
is the first step, but to analyse it is another one entirely. To
provide the requisite intelligence to the service, it will be
necessary to perfect the algorithm developed during the
prototype

design,

in

order

to

consider

all

flows

of

information, and give only the most suitable and reliable
information to the user.

Offer personalized advice, adapted to the needs of each nonprofessional investor profile
As a personal assistant, we want to make Daneel as personalised as possible for
each user. We would like to make each experience unique, and aim to place Daneel
in a position to provide the best possible advice to the user. Our primary objective
is user satisfaction. That’s why we have created the profiles of «novice user»,
«intermediate user» and of «experienced user». Every user will therefore be able
to take advantage of all the features they require, while receiving an experience
tailored to their level, and to their expectations regarding information and control.

Ensure the security of all data
How can we ensure the safety of your information? How can we limit the risk of
hacking attempts by outside third parties?
Important safety measures should be established between the user and the Daneel
ecosystem. The mobile application, as well as the web platform, will have to
address important safety constraints and will therefore be frequently audited by
external services and partners.
As for the architecture, it must be hosted and secured by the world’s leading
specialists in the cloud and IT security.

WWW.DANEEL.IO

18

WHITEPAPER

Our teams will endeavour to monitor the functioning of all services, as well as
questions asked and answers delivered, in order to ensure the reliability of
exchanges with the API of our ecosystem, and those of our partners.

Relying on best practice in terms of ergonomics and design
We attach great importance to offering the best user experience throughout the
use of the Daneel service.
To do this, we’d like to refer to the best practices used in ergonomics and design
during the development of each both the web and mobile interfaces, and commit
to an approach centred completely on the user.

WHITEPAPER

Presentation of Daneel’s features
STAY INFORMED
Gather, aggregate and analyse information
The concept of curating is at the heart of Daneel.
To begin, Daneel searches, browses, collects and analyses
different sources of information available from various online
channels: news feeds, general media, specialized media and
social networks.
Once the information is collected, he sorts and categorizes all relevant data in
order to only offer information deemed to be highly reliable.
You will then see in real time a summary of all necessary information concerning:
§

The current rates of all your specified cryptocurrencies

§

Cryptocurrency news sorted by theme (technological, legal, partnerships…).

§

Different « Initial Coin Offering » operations available

Analyse the Emotions of the Market
In addition to analysing and summarizing information, we wish to allow Daneel to
analyse the emotions of the market using a « Social Emotion Indicator » function.
Our artificial intelligence collects messages posted on social networks, then
analyses them and conveys to the user the predominant online sentiments
surrounding the cryptocurrency of their choice.
In this way, you can more easily detect «pump» or growing doubt surrounding a
cryptocurrency, and be up-to-date for every decision you make.

WWW.DANEEL.IO

20

WHITEPAPER

In addition, you can also benefit from indicators which identify which currencies
are the most cited in news sources and on social networks, as well as those most
searched on Google.

Define a Cryptocurrency Confidence Score
Our artificial intelligence will use a specially developed
algorithm to calculate a « Confidence score »., by analysing
currency rates, recent events, and the perceived emotions of
users on social networks.
This score, given out of 10, will reflect the reliability of a
currency at a given moment.
It will give investors a good idea of the risk involved in an investment.

Access to the detailed analytical report of cryptocurrency
Need a comprehensive report on a currency? Histories, statistical data, graphics,
company organisation, important personnel, recent events:
Find all this information in one document, generated every day, thanks to our
artificial intelligence.

INTERACT
Interact with Daneel thanks to our conversational service
What could be an easier way of obtaining information than simply asking for it?
To get Daneel’s analyses, you only need to express a request.

WWW.DANEEL.IO

22

WHITEPAPER

Artificial intelligence searches for the information best suited to your research, and
the results are then easily communicated to you. Daneel may also offer quick
choice actions in response to certain demands, in order to help you save time.
Based on the “Machine Learning” principle, the system will learn continuously: the
more users that pose questions, the more it will be able to refine its answers and
results: that is the power of IBM’s Watson artificial intelligence!

Never heard of Watson’s power?
« Watson is an IBM-designed computer system that applies
advanced technologies for natural language processing,
information

retrieval,

knowledge

representation,

automated reasoning and automatic learning to the field of
open-ended question answering. »

MANAGE YOUR PORTFOLIO
Manage your cryptocurrency portfolio
You will be able to manage different accounts from compatible exchange platforms
within the application. Add your account via your API keys, and then follow the
progress of your investments in real time …

Daneel will provide you with daily guidance in managing your investments. You
will be notified immediately if your investments fluctuate, or if a new piece of
information is likely to impact one of your investments!

WHITEPAPER

Don’t want to use API keys?
Simple: tell Daneel the type and quantity of each cryptocurrency you possess, and
he will register it in your personalized profile and provide advice to you in the exact
same way!

Place orders in one click
Thanks to the API of the exchange platforms compatible with Daneel, you will be
able to place immediate purchase and sale orders: you will therefore be able to
react rapidly to any announcement or an important event that Daneel shares with
you!

WHITEPAPER

LEARN AND EDUCATE YOURSELF
Particularly suited to beginner users, the «Education» service
helps to respond to the main questions concerning the sector
and Blockchain technology. Several ideas and concepts will be
explained to the user each day, and they will be able to test
and

validate

their

knowledge

through

Multiple-Choice

Questions.

SHARE
Social trading & social interactions
In addition to the help given by our artificial intelligence, we wish to integrate a
functionality called «social trading», a service which allows users to observe and
follow the investments of experienced investors.
Through this, the most popular community traders could receive DAN tokens in
exchange for their participation in the ecosystem.

AND AFTER ?
We will organize, on a recurring basis, different innovation events during which
every Daneel user will be able to submit new functionality ideas.
The best ideas will be rewarded in DAN tokens.

PARTNERSHIPS & PARTNER SERVICES

In order to accelerate Daneel’s development and carry out our project, we have
placed etablishing partnerships at the heart of our strategy.

Partnership with IBM
It is through this goal that we have already
developed an international partnership with the
company IBM.
Thanks to this partnership, we now have access
to unmatched expertise on artificial intelligence, to leading-edge solutions such as
Watson as well as to the means and resources that allow us to sustainably support
our project.
As IBM, a renowned multinational in the sectors of the cloud, of Machine-Learning

These terms prevail over any other document issued by the Customer or the

documents presented in the media, on the official website https://daneel.io, and
other paper or digital copies, are therefore presented as non-contractual and do
not engage the responsibility of the Company.

ARTICLE 3: INFORMATION REGARDING THE SALE
3.1 Notice regarding the sale of tokens during an ICO
§

Participation in an ICO, and more broadly, investment in a cryptocurrency
is a high-risk investment. None of the information or analysis presented in
this document is intended to form the basis of an investment decision, and
no specific investment recommendation is made. As a result, this document
does not constitute investment advice.

§

The Customer is fully aware of the fact that the acquired tokens do not open
any right to participate in the decision-making process within the Company,
any right to its results or any economic interest. Tokens are not recognized
as Company shares or any other comparable asset.

§

Furthermore, the DAN token is not considered as electronic money within
the meaning of European Directive 2009/110 / EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009.

WWW.DANEEL.IO

57

WHITEPAPER

3.2 The DAN token in the Daneel ecosystem
§

The Sale is for the sale of virtual "Tokens" (or "Tokens"), "Daneel Tokens"
(the "DAN").

§

Tokens will have a virtual currency role in the Daneel ecosystem. They will
make it possible to acquire and pay for the subscription required to access
the intelligent assistant service.

§

The token created and issued by the Company, called the "DAN Token" is a
non-regulated digital asset. It will be accepted within the Daneel ecosystem.

§

The Company is the sole decision-maker in its capacity to provide the Daneel
ecosystem to token owners, within the framework of technical, legal,
economic or other constraints imposed by third parties or by the Company
itself on its operations. The Company warns buyers (the "Customers") that
DAN cannot be used until the Daneel ecosystem has been created.

§

If the DANEEL ecosystem is not completed or does not function
permanently, the tokens will not be refunded. The owners of DAN accept
that this is a significant risk.

3.3 Creation and issue of the token
§

At the end of the Sale, the tokens will be created on the Ethereum Blockchain.

§

The Ethereum protocol does not belong to the Company, it is a decentralized
and autonomous Open Source protocol.

§

The Company has no rights or responsibilities over this protocol.

§

Tokens

will

be

generated

using

a

"Smart

Contract"

(https://www.ethereum.org).
§

The token generated will respond to the nomenclature called "ERC20", as
described by the Ethereum community.

§

Tokens will be subject to the operating terms of the Ethereum network.

§

The creation of the smart-contract and the issuance of

tokens will be

WWW.DANEEL.IO

58

WHITEPAPER

provided by the Company or a third party authorized by the
§

Company.

Once the Customer owns the tokens, they may freely give up, exchange or
sell all or part of them.

§

The Customer is informed of the immaterial and virtual nature of the DAN
tokens that they acquire.

§

The Customer is aware that no guarantee is attached to the DAN Tokens.

3.4 Token price
§

During the sale transaction, the token will be sold at the following price: 1
DAN Token = 0.25 EURO.

3.5 Validity of the tokens
§

There is no time limit for the validity period during which the tokens may be
used.

§

The Company reserves the right, if it proves necessary, to set a limit at a
later date.

§

In this case, the Company undertakes to notify Customers within a period of
at least 6 months.

§

Tokens, once issued, being linked to the Ethereum Blockchain, cannot be
permanently removed from the network. Thus, in the event that the Company
calls into question the validity of the tokens, the tokens would continue to
exist on the Ethereum network, but would simply no longer be accepted
within the Daneel ecosystem or by the Company.

§

The Customer understands and accepts the validity of DAN tokens as
described in these Terms.

WHITEPAPER

ARTICLE 6: WARNINGS ABOUT RISKS RELATED TO
THE SALE
6.1 Risk of losing access to DAN tokens due to loss of identification
information
§

Tokens acquired by the buyer may be associated with the user's
DANEEL account, stored on an exchange or on a physical medium. The
loss of information to access the DAN tokens will result in the loss of
the DAN acquired during the Sale. The Customer should refer to the
identifier security and storage clause as described in the Customer
Responsibilities - Storage and Security section.

6.2 Risks concerning the Ethereum protocol
§

The DAN and the Daneel solution are based on the Ethereum protocol.
Thus, any malfunction, or unexpected operation of the protocol can
impact the Daneel ecosystem, along with the DAN tokens.

§

Ethereum, a protocol currency, can itself lose value in a similar way to
DAN tokens.

§

Further information on the Ethereum protocol is available at the
following address: http://www.ethereum.org.

§

The Company is not responsible for the network or the Ethereum
protocol.

6.3 Risks related to the ongoing development of the ecosystem
§

Many platform features and functionalities will have to be developed as
part of the Daneel project. The Customer accepts that the Daneel
solution is subject to software and technical risks and that there is a
WWW.DANEEL.IO

67

WHITEPAPER

risk that such features and functionalities may never be deployed on
the platform.

6.4 Legal risk
§

Blockchain technologies have been reviewed by various regulatory
agencies around the world, including within the European Union. The
ICO was structured in consideration of the European law applicable at
the time of the offer.

§

The development and operation of the Daneel solution and DAN tokens
may be impacted by the passing of new laws impacting Blockchain
technology,

cryptocurrencies,

possession

or

exchange

of

cryptocurrencies, etc.
§

The risk that any new legislation may impact the development of the
Daneel ecosystem as well as the value of the DAN tokens, should be
taken into consideration by the Customer.

§

Given the current state of legislation concerning the technologies used
within the Daneel ecosystem, the Company encourages Customers to
carefully read the legal issues that concern them in their country of
residence.

§

The Customer is thus informed and accepts that the Company cannot
be held responsible if the Customer participates in the Sale by
disregarding the laws in force in their country of residence.

6.5 Risk related to the value of the DAN token
§

Considering that the value of DAN tokens will change over time, the
WWW.DANEEL.IO

68

WHITEPAPER

Customer is informed that the adoption of the project by the public and
the success or otherwise of developments related to the Daneel project
may have an impact on the price of DAN tokens.

6.6 Risk that the functionalities offered do not meet Customer
expectations
§

The Daneel service may be subject to significant changes depending
on the functional and technical decisions made by the Company. All
Customer's expectations regarding the personal assistant service and
DAN tokens may not be fulfilled when the service is launched.

6.7 Risk of theft and piracy
§

Despite all the means the Company employs to ensure the security of
