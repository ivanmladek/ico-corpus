A cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of additional units of the
currency. Cryptocurrencies are a subset of alternative currencies, or
specifically of digital currencies.
Bitcoin became the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009. Since then, numerous
cryptocurrencies have been created. These are frequently called altcoins, as a blend of
bitcoin alternative. Bitcoin and its derivatives use decentralized control as opposed to
centralized electronic money/centralized banking systems.
The decentralized control is related to the use of bitcoin’s blockchain transaction database
in the role of a distributed ledger.

Overview
Cryptocurrency and digital asset markets are relatively small compared to traditional
finance markets and do not allow large institutional investors to enter this new and fast
growing ecosystem. One of the main reasons preventing large players from entering the
crypto revolution are illiquid order books and wide market spreads. This prevents sizeable
cash flows from entering and exiting the markets in an efficient and cost effective way and
leads to scepticism among traditional money managers.

To support this fast growing ecosystem of various crypto currencies and digital assets, the
crypto economy needs a professional and large provider of liquidity across all crypto
related markets. This will lead to a faster and more stable growth
of the entire crypto economy.

Quantum project
The aim of the Quantum project is to bring institutional grade liquidity to cryptocurrency
and digital asset markets. This will be achieved by creating a liquidity pool of funds and
allowing crypto community to participate in increasing the depth of various order books.
The liquidity pool will be funded by issuing Quantum tokens that will be sold and traded on
various crypto markets.

Quantum token
Quantum tokens will be issued on the Ethereum network and will be freely traded on an
open market. Ethereum is an open-source project which allows creation of smart contracts
and provides users with a secure and fast transaction system.

Presale period
⅓ of all issued tokens will be made available to early adopters during a presale period. The
conditions of the presale, including the start and the end date, will be published on the
official project website. All funds collected from the sale of Quantum tokens will be
injected into the liquidity pool and used to provide liquidity for different exchanges or any
other crypto markets created in the future.

Issuance of tokens
Quantum tokens will be issued and distributed among presale investors no later than 30
days after the presale period is completed. The amount of tokens issued will be final and
based on the amount of funds collected during the presale period. All instructions on how
to take delivery of Quantum tokens will be sent to email addresses specified by investors
during the presale period.

Trading of tokens
The Quantum project will promote and add Quantum tokens to as many marketplaces
as possible. This process will start as soon as tokens have been issued. Buybacks, data
quoting or any other market actions performed by the issuer will be executed on an open
market and will be announced on the official project website.

Token buybacks
Any income generated from the liquidity pool will be used to buy back tokens at the best
possible price available on open markets. This operation will be executed on a monthly
basis and publicly announced on the official website of the project.

Destruction process
All tokens that will be bought back by the Quantum project will be sent to a black hole
address and will get destroyed forever. The black hole address will be published on the
official project website and will be auditable in real time. This process will decrease the
amount of tokens in existence and increase the value of all other tokens
still held by token holders.

Liquidity pool
The Quantum project will reserve ⅔ of issued tokens to be able to support further
development and to increase the size of liquidity pool in the future to boost the ability to
make markets as they grow larger and more liquid. The increased amount of funds in the
liquidity pool will also speed up the destruction process of all tokens in existence and add
more upside potential to the growth of the value of a single Quantum token.

Risk management
The Quantum project will use advanced risk management models to mitigate any potential
loss of funds in the liquidity pool. All models have been back-tested since the inception of
bitcoin and will be modified to meet all risk profiles of any currency or digital asset that will
start trading on open markets. Any funds waiting to be deployed to the market will be held
in a secure multi signature vaults.
