THE TOKEN OF COMPLIANCE

White Paper

Abstract
Consisting of experienced professionals from compliance, AML1 , virtual currency2 , blockchain and tech ecosystems, the Coinfirm team came together in
2015 under the vision to bring a new level of transparency and efficiency that
serves the entire blockchain ecosystem, spreads its benefits into the traditional
economy and enables the mass market to use it safely. Out of that vision the
Global Standard that is the Coinfirm AML/CTF3 Platform (also referred to as
the ’Platform’) was built.
Now, Coinfirm is taking the next step in bringing effective AML/CTF compliance and allowing for the transparency and democratization of the financial
system by actively involving market participants with AMLT.
AMLT used in the Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform is the missing puzzle to bring
virtual currencies into the mainstream in a safe, secure and compliant way. It
helps exchanges, payments processors, financial institutions and all players in
the financial system to manage the regulatory risk related to blockchain value
transfer. It allows network members to provide information, rate other market
participants and democratically help determine the related risk to entities and
counterparties using virtual currencies.
AML/CTF is connected with risk management, not just simply strict laws, rules
and regulations to follow. There is also a degree of internal assessment needed
by obliged companies to build a correct risk management model. AMLT helps
with compliance in an innovative way while by engaging and providing beneficial
participation to the users of virtual currencies.
Coinfirm works with world-class partners and clients ranging from major virtual

currency players such as Dash 4 and RSK 5 , to leading financial institutions such
as SEI 6 . Being a key link in bringing virtual currencies and blockchain to the
mass market and a wider range of organizations, Coinfirm and AMLT is helping
ensure transparency and safety within the ecosystem, and allowing it to grow
by solving one of the largest needs, effective compliance and AML procedures.

AMLT and blockchain Ecosystem

Challenge
The over 100 Billion USD market of virtual currencies has a problem with access to the mass commercial market and traditional banking and struggles with
regulatory compliance.
As studies

7

and industry leaders

8

have shown, effectively addressing Regula-

tory Compliance and especially Anti Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist
Financing (AML/CTF) for blockchain and virtual currencies has been a massive roadblock and the missing link to the traditional commercial and financial
sector and their overall mass adoption.
Countering Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing is not only a legal obligation but also a moral one. Without prevention and control mechanisms on transactions money flows directly to illegal business, drug dealers, human traffickers,
terrorists or weapon traders and puts the entire market and its participants at
risk. Hence the companies dealing with exchange of value via blockchain should
ensure that they are not either knowingly or unknowingly exposed to, party to
or facilitating such high risk transfers or counterparties. The lack of such basic
risk management may pose a breach of rules for the companies involved.
Blockchain is a peer-to-peer system and with all of its benefits it also brings
some risks such as counterparty risk that is currently mainly mitigated via intermediaries in the traditional economy such as banks or payment transmitters.
Even when you are accepting virtual currencies in your online book-store for
example, the funds may come from unknown sources. Potentially sources that

you don’t want to be exposed to and that could put you and your clients or
partners at risk. Furthermore, you may know the party you’re dealing with
very well, but knowingly or not some of their blockchain assets could come from
people who obtained them from illegal sources which in the end makes you
associated too.
The proper application and execution of AML/CTF rules and regulations is a
worldwide challenge that is yet to be solved. The current estimates indicate in
the traditional system AML enforcement fails 99.9% of the time and less than
1% of global illicit financial flows are seized and forfeited 9 . The procedures are
fairly arbitrary and rather general than specific, i.e. considering all transfers
from some countries as high risk which helps contribute to the issue of financial
exclusion.
The application and execution of AML/CTF procedures is even more important
for virtual currency businesses. It is a growing burden that is limiting the speed
and scale of market growth. Operating in this new dynamic space requires
the application of the same standards as banks and other financial institutions.
However, we believe that contrary to the banking system though, the process for
virtual currencies can be largely driven by effective data and be fairly democratic
as all participants of the ecosystem could deliver input and participate. Thanks
to that it could be way more accurate, effective and less arbitrary than the
traditional systems. Therefore, it could not only allow for more transparency
and efficiency but also open up the financial market to more participants and
promote real financial inclusion.

Environment
Virtual currency acceptance is continuously increasing, while banks and financial
regulators are still unprepared.
The market of virtual currencies has grown tremendously in recent years, not
only in terms of value but also in terms of services offered and entities involved.
Banks and financial institutions are not able to properly provide services to
these businesses because they are not able to determine and manage the risk
related to companies operating in this space. As banks do not have efficient
and effective tools and processes to determine this risk they also can’t provide
banking services to clients that are accepting virtual currencies. For example,
Japan has over 300,000 businesses

10

accepting cryptocurrencies. You can also

officially pay some government fees in Switzerland, catch a cab in Amsterdam
or shop with major retailers like Overstock.com using bitcoin, just to name a
few cases. Even leading payment processors all over the world like Adyen are
accepting virtual currencies11 . Yet, the inability to properly determine the risk
blocks the ability for traditional commercial players from being able to safely
accept, adopt and benefit from virtual currencies and blockchain.
There are new entrants on the market that are interested in virtual currencies
and bearing similar risks without proper tools:

• Virtual currency exchanges and payment processors
• Hedge funds
• Large companies that want to improve cash management
• International transfer entities (financial institutions)
• Internal Blockchains/Virtual Currencies for large groups

Market size
Costs of non-compliance and lost opportunity estimation.
For those that are following compliance and regulatory standards, the costs of
AML/CTF compliance is high and will continue to increase as current solutions
and processes are not only ineffective but inefficient and still manual in a lot
of ways. Financial institutions already spend double digit percentages of their
labor towards compliance while virtual currency companies are spending even
more

12

.

The cost of the compliance for virtual currency businesses can increase over 50%
of its total time and labor costs when taking systems, reports, training, manual
processes etc. into consideration. Costs of ‘non-compliance’ are even higher

13

.

Not only does it limit the ability to be commercially adoptable across the wider
market but may also result in the closing of the business, paying fines or even
potential legal ramifications for the business owners. Recent examples show
that non-compliant businesses can be shut down regardless where they operate
and the individuals behind them can be chased around the world.
The risk isn’t only limited to payments on blockchain. Smart contracts or
blockchains designed to exchange value can also be taken advantage of for money
laundering or terrorist financing purposes and similarly require proper assessment. This risk will be increasing especially for Initial Coin Offerings, Token
Crowd Sales, or new models that are yet to be defined.
Blockchain provides a unique opportunity to totally redefine and correctly conduct AML/CTF compliance. However, the solution must be a global platform
that solves these problems for the entire ecosystem in a new, effective and efficient way. The solution must grow with and represent the democratized network

it creates and become the ‘back bone’ for the ecosystem, running unnoticeably
and smoothly in the background.14 It also must democratize strict rules by
being able to show other aspects of transactions and entities – not only hard,
regulatory AML/CTF assessments but also more subjective information.

Solution
The Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform - A Global Standard.
A solution is needed for virtual currency businesses and traditional businesses
that accept virtual currencies or simply want to have exposure to it. At the end
of the day, any entity touching virtual currencies or operating with them needs
to apply AML/CTF compliance rules to protect themselves, their partners and
their clients from potential risks and to allow for its commercial growth.
Any firm that has a commercial relationship with virtual currency companies
also need to understand such risk. Businesses intelligence companies such as
Thompson Reuters cannot ignore information about what they have in their
portfolio.
Any market as large as the virtual currency market and entities operating within
it need, analytics and an AML/CTF compliance solution for legal, commercial
and moral reasons. The market is global and it is growing rapidly and is no
longer ignored by big business, financial institutions, criminals, regulators and
financial investigation units.
The solution is here. A global platform that solves these problems for the entire
ecosystem in a new, effective and efficient way, that grows with the network it
creates and becomes the ‘back bone’ for the ecosystem while running unnoticeably in the background. The entire ecosystem now has a simple and straight

forward solution that helps with the compliance for the most sensitive aspect of
its businesses.
Coinfirm’s AML/CTF Platform15 has been solving these issues in an innovative
way, with actionable structured data that increases efficiency, reduces costs
and streamlines compliance near to automation, bringing the ability for mass
adoption and redefining AML compliance overall.
Coinfirm’s goal is to make AML rules a reality and to build the global standard
for AML/CTF for blockchain applications. The foundation for this standard
has been set by the Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform (‘Platform’). At the moment of creating this document the blockchain agnostic Platform serves three
main blockchains: Bitcoin, Dash and Ethereum, and is currently in the
process of integrating other popular blockchains both public and private. Due
to the blockchain agnosticism of the Platform, the majority of public and private blockchains can be integrated into the Platform within 30 days. Now we’re
taking the next step in further advancing the virtual currency and blockchain
ecosystem and Coinfirm’s transparent and democratized global network with
AMLT.
A missing element that will push the new global ecosystem’s efficiency and
transparency forward is a dedicated token that streamlines processes within
and delivers benefits and rewards for its participants. The method for Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform is the token representing the global standard for
AML/CTF compliant commercial blockchain transactions, that the blockchain
asset for Coinfirm’s collaborative network, AMLT (ACCESS RIGHTS) will
be implemented into an already vibrant living network of players, providing
a strong foundation with commercial adoption and use.

• Users of Virtual Currencies: a global standard, central reference and data
access point enabling effective and efficient management of AML/CTF
risk related to virtual currencies and blockchain assets, as well as anti
fraud measures;
• Virtual Currency Exchanges, Businesses and Payment Processors, as they
are recognized as obliged institutions, they must fulfill required standards
and procedures. AMLT allows to effectively streamline and automate
AML compliance, reduce costs, risk and be commercially acceptable to
major partners and clients;
• Traditional Sectors like banks or business intelligence companies: having or accepting clients tied to virtual currencies pose risks that need to
be understood and managed. Delivers a global standard, central reference and data access point enabling effective and efficient management of
AML/CTF risk related to virtual currencies and blockchain assets, and
allows for virtual currency and blockchain adoption.
• AMLT streamlines, democratizes and decentralizes AML/CTF risk assessment and processes;
• AMLT helps the exchange of information between market participants
about the risk related to users of virtual currencies in a transparent way
over and above objective rules arising from rules and regulations. Democratization of strict rules and risk based approach via AMLT means
that one can, in their AML/CTF risk assessment, make a decision on the
potential risk determined by both Coinfirm’s platform as well as the voice
of other market participants.

Introduction
“There is no FinTech without RegTech.”

RegTech has a much wider scope of influence than FinTech as it is solving
problems related not only to FinTech but also to a much broader range of
sectors, industries and economic and human elements. Our aim is to enable a
better, faster, more secure, transparent and effective way of transferring value
and open up an entire new world of opportunities for the market and individuals.
The ecosystem impacted by the lack of effective and efficient AML/KYC risk
management for blockchain transactions covers:

• Companies accepting virtual currencies
• Banks and Financial Institutions
• Business Intelligence Companies
• New ICO’s
• Smart Contracts
• New Market Entrants
• Individuals Globally

• Size of a Money Laundering

It is said that the money laundering market is between 800 billion to 2 trillion USD annually and is around 3-5% of Global Domestic Product (GDP).
This is capital that does not reach taxpayer and government services, homes,
infrastructure and businesses, but is destined to reach drug traders, terrorist
organizations, human traffickers and other nefarious enterprises building their
empires.
UK Government – UK national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing
“Money laundering can undermine the integrity and stability of financial markets and institutions. It is a global problem. The European Commission’s 2013
impact assessment of the EU anti-money laundering/counter terrorist financing
legislative framework points to global criminal proceeds potentially amounting
to some 3.6% of GDP; around US$ 2.1 trillion in 2009. Both money laundering
itself, and the criminality which drives the need to launder money, present a significant risk to the UK. The laundering of proceeds of overseas corruption into
or through the UK fuels political instability in key partner countries. The NCA
judges that billions of pounds of suspected proceeds of corruption are laundered
through the UK each year. Money laundering is also a key enabler of serious
and organized crime, the social and economic costs of which are estimated to
be £24 billion a year.”21
United Nation Office on Drugs and Crime (‘UNODC’) – the foremost international authority and commonly cited entity
“Criminals, especially drug traffickers, may have laundered around US$ 1.6 trillion, or 2.7 per cent of global GDP, in 2009, according to a new report by the
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). This figure is consis21 https://www.virtualcurrencyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/08/UK-

tent with the 2 to 5 per cent range previously established by the International
Monetary Fund to estimate the scale of money-laundering. Less than 1 per
cent of global illicit financial flows is currently being seized and frozen, says the
report.”22
Global Financial Integrity – Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries
“Every year, roughly $1 trillion flows illegally out of developing and emerging
economies due to crime, corruption, and tax evasion - more than these countries
receive in foreign direct investment and foreign aid combined(. . . ).developing
and emerging economies lost US$7.8 trillion in illicit financial flows from 2004
through 2017, with illicit outflows increasing at an average rate of 6.5 % per
year - nearly twice as fast as global GDP.”23

• Money stopped

Unfortunately, the statistics are not looking well here. From the statistics indicated above, it means that only up to 2% of laundered funds have been stopped
by all efforts applied by governments, regulators, banks and businesses. So, 98%
of laundered funds never make it back into the system, but instead - reaches
the previously mentioned nefarious enterprises.

• Cost of Compliance

Massive and expensive efforts have been made to improve these numbers and
processes – banks, financial institutions but also virtual currency businesses are

increasing their time and cost expenditures towards these issues. Global spending on anti-money laundering (AML) compliance is set to grow to more than $8
billion by 2017. It is, therefore, a costly but necessary obligation for companies,
particularly when confronting the rising threat of terrorism and the increasingly
sophisticated way in which it is financed, which is of critical importance to the
world and its governments. blockchain is playing an increasingly prevalent role
in combating money laundering and this will further highlight the commercial
advantages for companies that incorporate such RegTech and innovation into
their AML/CTF procedures. It will also help examine the potential concerns
from a client’s perspective and a fact how these issues should be addressed before
solutions such as blockchain gain universal industry approval.24
According to the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF)25 , an estimated $7 billion annually is spent in the U.S. alone for implementing AML/CTF
Regulation processes. The cost is disproportionately high in smaller countries
such as Mauritius, which has 1.3 million people with 25 government officials
working on AML/CTF implementation - more AML/CTF bureaucrats than
the country has opticians - and that’s not counting bank staff who carry out
customer investigations and other elements of compliance.26

• Risk of exclusion

Due to high AML/CTF risk banks and financial institution do not service or
enter countries with significant structural problems, political corruption or political instability. Because of this a large number of innocent people and legitimate businesses are excluded from the financial system. This is called the risk
of exclusion. Virtual currencies are a great solution here however it needs to

be applied with care and in line with regulations otherwise we face repeating
the same problem. AMLT is designed to help with these aspects through the
use of the Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform, but also by building a mechanism
where participants can collect and share data in a democratized way. This way
one can indicate to the network that these counterparties operating in high risk
countries are trusted and in fact low risk and others can, with a degree of additional analysis and assessment, use this data for their benefit. With such an
effective and accurate system, entities can be judged individually as opposed to
their entire nation or region being excluded as it is today.
Example: a company located in Somalia (high risk) is trading with an established entity in Europe and paying in virtual currencies. With a long record of
legitimate trade and an assessment conducted where no political risk exposure
was discovered, the entity in Europe can rate and add data into the network
reflecting the legitimacy and stability of the Somali entity. This way the Somali
entity receives a lower AML/CTF risk rating indicated via Coinfirm’s C-Score
and other European counterparties can rely on this information and trade with
the Somali entity.

• Risk related to virtual currencies

Virtual currencies are characterized by non-face-to-face customer relationships,

currencies. Anyone can download the free, open-source software from a website
to send, receive, and store Bitcoins and monitor Bitcoin transactions. They may
also permit anonymous transfers if the sender and recipient are not adequately
identified. The speed of transaction processing in virtual currencies presents a
significant benefit to users, although it varies according to the virtual currency
that is used. These systems can be used to make cross-border payments and
funds transfers.
Virtual currencies commonly rely on complex infrastructures that involve sev22

eral entities, often spread across several countries, to transfer funds or realize
payments. The difficulties created by virtual currencies stem as much from the
elusiveness of the various stakeholders as from the international (and extraterritorial) nature of both transactions and participants. This is particularly the case
when the servers and the individuals and legal entities that use them are located
in non-cooperative countries and territories. Virtual currency systems may be
located in jurisdictions that do not have suitable AML/CTF regulations. Centralized virtual currency systems could be complicit in money laundering and
terrorist financing and intentionally seek out jurisdictions with low AML/CTF
regimes.

A New Deal – Global Standard for AML/CTF
Compliance for blockchain based transactions

Due to its characteristics, blockchain, especially public blockchains, are perfect
for RegTech and AML/CTF compliance solutions as they deliver the ultimate
level of data trust and transparency.
It is evident that in an increasingly digital commercial landscape, the role that
solutions such as blockchain will play in facilitating AML/CTF procedures is
an inevitability rather than a possibility. The efficiency and transparency with
which discrepancies concerning client data can be detected should be commended and supported as consistent scandals and highlights of inefficiency in

the current ecosystem shows. The recent alleged involvement of major UK
banks such as HSBC, RBS and Barclays in a Russian scandal concerning the
movement of approximately £65m highlights that any FinTech developments
that can help to expose other crimes of a similar nature should be endorsed.29
However, convincing more cautious companies to engage with this technology,
with the knowledge that their sensitive transactional information is distributed
so openly, is a major challenge. Finally, whilst there are hundreds of different blockchain networks, protocols and virtual currencies available, the benefits
of blockchain are partially undermined until standardization can be achieved
as different networks will not be able to communicate with each other simultaneously. Though perhaps idealistic, achieving standardization and resolving
privacy concerns will be a key to blockchain’s long term success.
How can Coinfirm build this world differently for virtual currencies with exchange of value on a public blockchain where Coinfirm can access public ledgers
and analyze them?
How would blockchain impact money laundering?

Blockchain - the solution for efficient and effective
AML/CTF

A global standard – the decentralized nature of blockchain and virtual currencies implies that user and transaction records may be held in many different
jurisdictions, some of which may not have adequate AML/CTF controls, making
it difficult for regulators and law enforcement to access them. Furthermore, it is
impractical to assign responsibility to one particular jurisdiction as blockchain
transactions can pass through dozens of jurisdictions in seconds and cannot be
blocked or overseen. Therefore, the only effective approach to AML/CTF for

AMLT

THE TOKEN OF COMPLIANCE

blockchain and virtual currencies must be a global standard - central reference
and data access point, operating across all jurisdictions and without significant
entry barriers.
A self-sustaining system – in peer to peer value transfers, by design there
is no central authority that could provide effective AML/CTF coverage and
remove the risk from network members. Therefore, the effective approach to
AML/CTF for blockchain and virtual currencies must interact with users of
the ecosystem in real-time and engage them in collaborative data collection and
transaction counterparty verification, in an easy and automated way, without
putting additional effort on users.
Easy to use data access point – the effective AML/CTF system for blockchain
applications must be able to provide structured, actionable data on blockchain,
virtual currency transactions and transaction counterparties, with associated
money laundering risk, fraud, noncompliance and financial performance. It
must be an easy to integrate solution for both public and private blockchains,
that turns compliance into an automated, efficient and reliable process.
Easy to deploy in traditional sectors – blockchain technology in conjunction
with Coinfirm’s solution, creates a near automated system, truly capable of
separating illicit funds from circulation significantly more effectively and at the
fragment of the cost. By utilizing decentralized oversight and creating a specific
environment of interactions between users, it creates an effective infrastructure
unachievable for traditional centralized financial systems. This enormous added
value of an AML compliant blockchain solution must be easily deployable within
traditional sectors like banks and financial institutions as well.30

benefit of all by allowing blockchain transaction systems to be safely adoptable.
Coinfirm creates an ecosystem that promotes the engagement of individual users
and entities in addressing a major roadblock on the way to the mass adoption
– compliance. The solution should be powerful enough to create the movement
towards financial inclusion of those who were unjustifiably excluded by faulty
compliance solutions of the current financial system.
The Platform decrypts and analyzes data from blockchains in real time. The
data collected from blockchains include:

• transaction hash and type (e.g. single/multiple input and output, single/multiple signature)
• transaction input and output blockchain addresses
• transaction value
• balance of funds on blockchain addresses
• transaction timestamp
• fee
• size and message
• address cluster
• information about the node that approved the transaction and more.

• all transactions could then be processed instantly in unlimited amounts
on a permissioned blockchain; this would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of processing transactions far more easily and in real-time than
using SWIFT;
• all transactions would be registered on the blockchain with a timestamp
- information about the recipient, the sender, the costs and the amounts
involved;
• the data registered on the blockchain is immutable, and can never be
changed, making it fully auditable;
• privacy is protected, as access to blockchain information is limited and
only available to those permissioned to access that particular record;
• Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and related sanctions monitoring could
be automated, removing the overhead and obligation of the banks and
other financial institutions to do this onerous activity;
• estimates believe that 60% or more of the costs of AML/CTF compliance
could be removed through this process as a result.31

Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform and AMLT

The Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform serves as a foundation for the safe adoption

the Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform continues to not only solve problems for the
blockchain industry but allows it to be adoptable within the traditional economy.
In the distributed economy, tokens are at the core of a project. Since presenting
AMLT to Coinfirm’s partners and potential users there have been many interesting conversations about creating tokens that harness the full power of the
distributed business model. A well-designed token increases value along with
the growth of its network and incentivizes the community and early adopters to
use, participate, spread and evangelize the platform it represents.
AMLT represents added value and is distributed among the participants - Network Members who receive AMLT in exchange for data provided to the Coinfirm
AML/CTF Platform. For Network Members, AMLT powers the interactions on
the platform and allows them to provide information to the network for the benefit of themselves and transparency of other participants.
If Bitcoin is the petrol that makes the car run then AMLT is the motor oil that
keeps blockchain assets running smoothly.
The data collected from the blockchains are complemented with data from the
following actors of the Coinfirm ecosystem:

• Clients, Partners and Authorities – data about blockchain transactions on external Platforms and services is provided either automatically
(through API’s) or in packages by our clients and partners such as virtual
currency exchanges and business intelligence companies. Such a model
allows for unparalleled transparency and for Coinfirm to have an ultraeffective service for Coinfirm’s clients and semi-automated development of
products and services along with the expansion of cooperating entities.
• Platform Users – the Platform is developed with the aim of creating
interaction in the ecosystem and providing users incentives to be a part of
the ecosystem and provide information and evidence on blockchain trans-

actions and suspicious addresses.
• Post AMLT launch – Network Members, who are users of AMLT and
the Platform that meet certain criteria defined by a Smart Contract, will
create the entire new and effective global ecosystem for data collection
and validation – see details in further parts of this White Paper.

The data collected from blockchains is further perfected with data collected from
external resources. For this purpose, Coinfirm has developed a set of advanced
tools, including crawlers, scrapers and an internal department of skilled data
researchers and analysts. External data sources include:

• Clearnet (Internet) – Coinfirm harvests data from websites, forums
(reddit.com, bitcointalk.org, etc.), blockchain explorers (blockchain.info,
walletexplorer.com, etc.) and more.
• Deep Web – Coinfirm collects information about blockchain addresses
and transactions used for illicit activities on Tor, Freenet, I2P, darknet
markets and more.
• Data leaks – Coinfirm monitors and harvests all relevant data leaks and
indexes them for blockchain addresses and transactions.
• Tracking own funds – set of proprietary analysis methods and tools for
semi-automated identification of blockchain addresses.
• Network Nodes – set of proprietary analysis methods and tools for acquiring information from network nodes.

The collected data is further processed thorough several categories of Big Data
Analyses:

• Data merge and fuzzy matching – algorithms devoted to match the
data from blockchains with the data collected from other sources, through

AMLT

THE TOKEN OF COMPLIANCE

White Paper

either one-to-one matching or with assumption of probability - fuzzy matching.
• Transactions/addresses Flagging – Flags indicating risks or other attributes are assigned to addresses and transactions as a result of merging
blockchain data with data from other resources as well as based on our
transaction patterns analysis algorithms. For example, a Flag for drug
trade relation is assigned to an address if the address was found to be
used in a drug trade on a darknet market. The Flag may be automatically further propagated on subsequent transactions depending on certain
circumstances and analysis.
• Paths, proximity and density analyses – Coinfirm uses graph databases
to recognize transaction patterns such as specific paths, and relation to
Flagged addresses or graph structures. Addresses and transactions involved in specific patterns are appropriately Flagged.
• Behavioral analyses – Coinfirm’s algorithms look for transaction patterns and characteristics that represent a certain user profile, for example
high risk users, such as long-term accumulation of funds or use of complex
transactions in order to layer the track of funds.
• Clustering analyses – set of algorithms aimed to recognize and group
addresses and transactions belonging to one user.

The diagram below shows the Data collection and analysis within the Coinfirm
AML/CFT Platform:

31

AMLT

THE TOKEN OF COMPLIANCE

White Paper

Once processed, the data is subsequently provided to Platform users in the
form of structured reports or actionable data sets pulled through the Platform’s
API. In both scenarios data is structured in a way that enables streamlining
of compliance and automation of the decision-making process for users. The
exact content of the data can also be customized for select users. Select data is
available for free in order to expand Coinfirm’s ecosystem, allow access to such
tools for all and facilitate the mass adoption of blockchain.
The following structured data is currently available in the Coinfirm AML/CTF
Risk Reports:

• C-Score – Coinfirm risk score that is numbered between 0 and 99 and
reflects the level of money laundering, fraud or compliance risk. Coinfirm
Risk Rating is the reflection of the above mentioned C-Score as either low,
medium or high-risk rating.
• Coinfirm recommendation – Coinfirm’s transaction recommendation,
e.g. transact freely, transact with caution, do not transact.
• Entity name – identified virtual currency addresses connected to legal
commercial entities e.g. Bitstamp.

32

AMLT

THE TOKEN OF COMPLIANCE

White Paper

• Profile – information about the type of entity (e.g. exchange, payment
processor, wallet, gambling service etc.) and Profile characteristics (e.g.
extensive user, trader, miner, mixer etc.) based on behavioral and identification analysis. Over 50 Profiles are currently available.
• Risk Indicators – over 150 scenarios that the address/user is assessed
against, including: use of darknet markets, terrorist financing, crime and
cybercrime, tax evasion, industry risk, layering track of funds, behavioral
characteristics, country risk.
• Financial activity – data sets of financial activity, status, and cash-flow
indicators and charts, for example: list of identified addresses of the user,
timestamps and value of first and last transaction, funds balance history,
average transaction value, number of transactions, turnover and many
more.
• Whitelist – yes/no information on whether the user is listed by Coinfirm
as a trusted party (e.g. an exchange with a good reputation). Multiple
other data sets are available upon further client’s needs discovery and
development.

6.4

Coinfirm Risk Score – C-Score

The C-Score is an internal Risk Rating indicator expressing the level of money
laundering, fraud and compliance risk associated with counterparties of blockchain
transactions. Each blockchain address or group of addresses identified as belonging to the same user is assigned with 0 to 99 C-Score, where the higher
score reflects higher risk. Here Coinfirm presents only the highlights of how a
C-Score is generated. The overall process is depicted in the diagram below:

33

AMLT

THE TOKEN OF COMPLIANCE

White Paper

Coinfirm uses a system of Flags assigned to blockchain addresses or holders
(payment processors). Flags carry the value (usually binary – True or False,
however other types of variables may be used) resulting from events related to
blockchain addresses and users. For example, a binary Flag “terrorism financing” is assigned to blockchain address in case it was found as a donation address
of a terrorist organization. Some flags are assigned manually and others result
from automated processing or automated propagation of already existing Flags.
Flags are automatically transposed into the Risk Indicators, each representing a
specified, defined risk associated with a blockchain address or its user (multiple
Risk Indicators can be assigned to one address or user). Coinfirm’s AML/CTF
model currently utilizes hundreds of Risk Indicators grouped in a few categories:
Criminal or Illicit Activity, Cybercrime, Industry, Service and Occupation, etc.
Coinfirm’s model consists of Risk Indicators typical for traditional AML/CTF
systems used by financial institutions as well as blockchain specific ones. Below
there are two examples distinguishing between the two mentioned types of Risk
Indicators:
Example 1 (Risk Indicator typical for traditional AML/CTF systems):
Address related to terrorism financing:
“This Risk Indicator increases the risk assessment of the evaluated blockchain
address when: - The evaluated blockchain address was found or reported together with evidence or credible indication that it may be involved in terrorism
financing; or

34

AMLT

THE TOKEN OF COMPLIANCE

White Paper

- The evaluated blockchain address is discovered through data analysis as being
used in terrorism financing;
- Terrorism financing refers to activities that provides financing or financial
support to individual terrorism or terrorist groups.
For example: The evaluated blockchain address was found on the website of
a terrorist organization and was referred to as a donation address.”
Example 2 (Risk Indicator specific for blockchain applications):
Address with incoming transactions passing significant fees to miners:
“This Risk Indicator increases the risk assessment of the evaluated blockchain
address when:
- The evaluated blockchain address receives funds in one or more transactions,
which are executed with a transaction fee causing the passing of significant
funds to mining addresses (transaction fee amount or fee/kB of transaction size
is significantly greater then network average at the time of transaction);
- Illicit funds are frequently distributed in the form of inflated transaction fees
on blockchain addresses functioning as miner addresses but owned by an author
of the transaction; due to the nature of blockchain protocol, funds passed in
the form of transaction fee rather than regular blockchain transaction are more
difficult to be traced;
- Mining addresses are blockchain addresses owned by miners, who are responsible for sustaining the process of adding transaction records to the blockchain
ledger; miners receive remuneration on their mining addresses in the form of
transaction fees and newly created coins or tokens for providing computing or
storage resources required for confirmation of transactions in the blockchain
network or storing the copy of the ledger.

35

AMLT

THE TOKEN OF COMPLIANCE

White Paper

For example: the transactions outgoing from the evaluated blockchain address
are executed with transaction fees set to the equivalent of several thousand USD,
while the actual transaction value is of minor value.”
Each Risk Indicator carries a risk severity score, which is the number from 0 to
99 reflecting the level of risk represented by this Risk Indicator.
The final C-Score translates into a risk evaluation that can take three forms: low
risk (0;33), medium risk (34;66) and high risk (67;99), which translate respectively into the following Recommendations: “transact freely”, “transact with
caution:” and “do not transact”.
The C-Score can be decreased in the case the address or user has been Whitelisted
or will be rated well by network members using AMLT. In order to become
Whitelisted, the applicant should contact Coinfirm in order to pass a KYC
process and prove the ownership of the blockchain addresses. Currently the
Whitelist assumes a maximum decrease of the C-Score by 15 points and applies
in the case when the original evaluation is not high risk.
Select Flags are automatically transposed into Profiles, each representing specific characteristics or industries related to the blockchain address or user(multiple
Profiles can be assigned to one address or user). Profiles do not carry the risk
severity score and therefore do not impact the C-Score, as all adverse Profiles
(e.g., mixer, gambling service, charity, inactive user) have corresponding Risk
Indicators that carry the risk evaluation.

AMLT – fuel for the Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform and the transparent ecosystem

Although the Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform accepts payments in fiat and other
cryptocurrencies, it is intended that activity in the Platform will eventually be
performed primarily using AMLT and all purchases of AML Risk reports will
be performed using AMLT. The principal purpose of a AMLT is therefore to
operate as an ‘in-app token’ and an ‘access token’ that grants users access to
the Coinfirm Platform and the services provided therein. AMLT will also offer
discounts on fees charged within the Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform.
Another feature of AMLT is that it is the reward for Network Members who
contribute their services to the ecosystem by providing identification and verification information (such as for information regarding public keys used in
transactions with counterparties) and fulfilling certain other criteria that will

39

AMLT

THE TOKEN OF COMPLIANCE

give them the status of a ‘Network Member’.
Users of AMLT will become an important and active part in building the transparent new era of finance and a foundation for the mass adoption of blockchain
and virtual currencies. The interactions between AMLT users will move the
economy towards transparency and financial inclusion of good actors and exclusion of bad ones with precision beyond the reach of the current financial system
in which individuals unjustifiably suffer from financial exclusion.
AMLT was designed to activate and be used by not only blockchain related
entities but also an entire scope of actors from traditional sectors, including for
example: large commercial companies, banks and financial institutions, some of
which are already Coinfirm’s clients and partners.
This shows the flow of AMLT in the Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform.

In case the Participant does not provide all data required by onboarding process
until AMLT Crowd Sale Timeout, providing this data would still be possible
within 2 weeks after the Crowd Sale, the documents will be verified within a
maximum 4 weeks after the Crowd Sale.
Only if the Participant provides all of the data required by the onboarding
process on time and the Participant’s compliance evaluation results are within
the acceptable risk limit, the AMLT will be paid out to Participant’s Ethereum
Address. Otherwise ETH paid in will be returned. AMLT tokens will be released
to Participants up to 4 weeks after the AMLT Crowd Sale.
In case the compliance evaluation will result in a high risk score, the Participant’s Ethereum Address may be flagged as such on the Coinfirm AML/CTF

for example: companies, banks and financial institutions, legal entities and
governments, some of which are already Coinfirm’s clients and partners.
Users who want to purchase AMLT and become a compliant, active part of
the ecosystem, need to pass through the AML/CTF and KYC check. The User
provides his/her Profile and Identity Data as well as the Token Address devoted
to hold AMLT. The User’s Token Address is verified on the Coinfirm AML/CTF
Platform against suspicious transactions and the User’s Identity Data passes
through standard KYC checks, e.g. appearance on sanctions lists.32
If the evaluation result indicates low risk, the User obtains a status of a Qualified
User and his Token Address is put on the Smart Contract Whitelist. The

allows users to complete their AML/CTF compliance model with transaction monitoring. The Coinfirm AML/CTF is blockchain agnostic and
currently provides services for Bitcoin, Dash, and Ethereum.
• 1.0 AMLT: AMLT becomes the fully transparent access token of the Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform and network where in order to fully use the

Qualified User or Network Member is required.
