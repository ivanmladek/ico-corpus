REPLAY ATTACK
A simple way to synthesize a victim order is to simply remember a past order and use it when the
price is adverse for the victim. The exchange simply
duplicates an order and fills it at a price favoring a
colluding user. Custodian contract prevents replay
attacks by the tracking order ids of all matched orders and rejecting duplicates.

CANCELLED ORDER ATTACK
A variant of the above is when the exchange simply
fills an order that was cancelled. Storing cancelled
order ids in the smart contract is impractical, since
cancels are numerous and cancellation need to be
fast. However, proof-of-cancellation (exchange signature on cancel request) can be used as a fraudproof that can be submitted to the Custodian. The
custodian can verify that a cancelled order has been
filled and halt the exchange.

PRICE-TIME PRIORITY
For a compromised exchange to skim from the user,
it would need to violate price-time priority. This can
be detected in most cases.

market moving adversely would cause an execution
at a better price (<= o1.price) but with worse order
time (>o1.time), enabling us to detect the violation.
The time for an execution is effectively the time of
the taker order. Therefore, price-time priority has
been violated if:

SUBMISSION OF FRAUD-PROOFS
A malicious actor would need to withdraw their
funds after a fraudulent action. As long as there is a

All attacks can be detected by the victim as soon as
they occur and a fraud-proof can be submitted to the
smart contract, which can be used to take corrective
action such as disabling the exchange and allowing
all users to withdraw their funds. A small mandatory
delay before withdrawal ensures there is sufficient
time to submit fraud-proofs before a malicious user
can siphon money from the contract.

COMPARISON TO OTHER DEX
Leverage and Derivatives: Most DEX are not focused on risk management and derivatives offerings. We hope to be the first exchange that offers
derivatives with secure custody.
High Speed: Blockchain not involved in the critical
create-cancel-execute path, making Leverj highly
competitive against other DEX in terms of speed.
Congestion insensitive: Leverj can postpone sync
to blockchain during times of blockchain congestion, while enabling trading to proceed, only impacting withdrawals. On-chain matching DEX cannot degrade gracefully during network congestion.

3. DERIVATIVES ON LEVERJ

NON-CUSTODIAL DERIVATIVES
The major distinguishing requirement of leveraged
exchanges over spot exchanges is risk management.
Since users who owe money can simply walk away
in a decentralized environment, we need to ensure
that no account goes into negative balance.

2. Auto-Deleveraging: Ensures integrity of system and
no positions are dangling.
To implement the above in a manner that makes
trading enjoyable requires careful crafting of appropriate leverage offered, reference index construction and handling of corner cases.

LEV AND FEE TOKENS
The Leverj DApp is designed with a bi-level token
structure a two level tokens. The primary token is of
fixed supply, and represents a license to transact on
LEV platform proportional to the percentage ownership of the token supply. The secondary token FEE is
the accounting mechanism to ensure the rights of
LEV can be exercised fully in a decentralized manner.

BI-LEVEL TOKENS VS REVENUE
SHARING
Most revenue sharing systems have the following

challenges:
1. Building liquidity is difficult.
2. Attracting other service providers to grow a rich
ecosystem is extremely challenging without liquidity.
The two level Leverj token system has been carefully
crafted using economics and game theory to incentivize liquidity and quickly grow a rich ecosystem.

USER PERSPECTIVE
From the user‚Äôs point of view, bi-level tokens have
the following advantages:
1. The second level token holds fees stable in ETH
terms to ameliorate cryptocurrency Ô¨Çuctuations.
For example, when the ETH exchange rate is very
high in USD terms, it makes sense to sell your full
ETH position instead of using part of it to pay fees.
2. The ability to sell excess capacity when trading activity

11

SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE
From a systemic point of view, two level tokens
have enormous positive consequences.
1. The accumulation of FEE tokens over time will
increase trading pressure. This is analogous to
typically higher volume on no-fee exchanges, simply because more trading strategies are proÔ¨Åtable.
This increased trading pressure increases volume
and liquidity greatly, enabling tight spreads and
predictable Ô¨Ålls, without slippage and helps facilitate generally healthy markets.
2. A secondary effect of FEE accumulation is that it
enables a rich ecosystem with many other participants. The ability to pay for additional services from
auto-generated FEE tokens means that traders are
more likely to purchase, and providers more likely

Leverj is designed around a bi-level token structure.

ensure the rights of LEV can be exercised fully in a

insufficient FEE tokens to satisfy the trading volume.
This may give rise to a premium on FEE tokens and
may result in undesirable behavior such as hoarding. To prevent this, fees can be paid in ether and
the equivalent FEE tokens are generated and distributed to LEV stakers.

LEVERJ.IO

STAKING CADENCE
To simplify the UX and security of the staking contract, there is a fixed staking cadence which computes the number of tokens staked and the duration of the stake. This enables a simple calculation
that allocates the FEE tokens to the traders.

EXPIRY
At the end of the staking period, all LEV are returned to stakers and FEE tokens proportional to
their stake are distributed to stakers.

STAKING FORMULAS
For single stake:
Let L => Number of lev to be staked (passed by user)
Let T => the expiry block number
Let t = T - current_block => number of blocks to stake
Then Lt => Number of Lev blocks staked
stake[user] += L
evblocks[user] += Lt
total_levblocks += Lt
FEE events (periodic aggregated) could combine
with expiry:
Total_Fees += FEE sent for trading fees + ETH sent
for trading fees * ETH_FEE_RATE
At Expiry Adjust Supply:
If Total_Fees > FEE_supply:
Generate (Total_Fees - FEE_supply) FEE tokens
At expiry (for all users):
Fee_share[user] = (levblocks[user] / total_levblocks)
* Total_Fees
Transfer fee_share[user] FEE to user
Transfer stake[user] to user

Disclaimer: Our project is subject to several other considerations that require flexibility in how we
spend the raise. For example, if we get an opportunity to partner with a legacy financial powerhouse, we
may need to invest significant resources for speedy
implementation. We may also have opportunity to
work with regulators in untapped crypto markets
such as the United States that may require unforeseen expenditures. All-in-all, since we have a centralized component, we have need for operational and
strategic flexibility unlike a pure protocol project.
Converting to Fiat: Most of the raise will be kept in
ETH and be converted to fiat as necessary. There will
be an initial conversion of up to $5M USD to bootstrap the project.

is unlikely to be profitable. In addition, there is substantial risk testing out unproven ideas with real

market data, while avoiding market risk. Once the
trading idea or setup is proven, it can confidently be
executed on a live account.

CROSS/FIXED
Traders who trade long timeframes and accumulate large positions need to use all available margin (cross margin) to ensure they can accumulate
through large dips without being stopped out.
However, often they also wish to trade portions with
fixed margin to protect profits on moves on a smaller timeframe. Leverj is the only exchange that offers
simultaneous fixed and cross margin while splitting
a fixed portion out of the cross margin for partial exit.

Blockchains can suffer congestion for extended durations. A severely congested network may mean
that settlement transactions are confirmed with
