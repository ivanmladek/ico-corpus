Introduction
As the popularity and mainstream acceptance of blockchain and digital assets
increase, traditional investors have been looking for more exposure to these
digital assets and blockchain based technologies. However, many things can be
“lost in translation” when it comes to integrating the digital currency world and
the world of traditional finances. Providing a seamless exchange between crypto
and conventional assets is the underlying philosophy behind Cryptopay
expansion and Initial Coin Oﬀering (ICO).
Investors, who use digital currencies, currently have to interact with several
counterparties to successfully manage their risks and portfolio. These
counterparties being traditional banks, payment networks and financial services
companies. The majority of them don’t understand the nature of digital
currencies, which can cause frustration, account freezes, losses and not to
mention the various ineﬃciencies that come with moving between the diﬀerent
asset classes.
With the emergence of blockchain, a growing number of users and businesses
are beginning to struggle leveraging the existing infrastructure in order to
manage the transfer of funds between physical and virtual platforms.
As of now, Cryptopay provides the ability to spend, save, and transact digital
currencies. The Cryptopay wallet allows users to eﬀortless trade between bitcoin
and fiat currencies, specifically the GBP, USD, and the EUR. This wallet service is
complemented by a prepaid card that lets users quickly access funds stored in
cryptocurrencies. Soon hereafter, we are launching the a service that will allow
users access to equities and the ability to own current accounts.

Cryptopay Products
Existing products
Bitcoin Wallet
The Cryptopay wallet is the core product that lays as the foundation to all
existing fee-generating services. We oﬀer a hosted bitcoin wallet (Ethereum,
LiteCoin and Ripple coming soon) and integrated simple exchange services.
For even further convenience, Cryptopay introduced Flex accounts - instant
exchange options. Whenever a user sends bitcoins to one of these fiat
denominated accounts, bitcoins are instantly converted and do not require any
additional manual conversions.
CPAY Prepaid Card
The Cryptopay prepaid card was launched in early 2015, and was one of the first
digital currency cards on the market. At that time, the card was the first real tool
that brought bitcoin to the mainstream. It allows any bitcoin holder to spend their
coins, online or otherwise, anywhere that accepts traditional payment cards.
This,
paired withWhite
the digital

paperwallet, allowed users to utilize their bitcoins in day-to08
day life.

that brought bitcoin to the mainstream. It allows any bitcoin holder to spend their
coins, online or otherwise, anywhere that accepts traditional payment cards.
This, paired with the digital wallet, allowed users to utilize their bitcoins in day-today life.
Cryptopay acts as an intermediary that links the card issuer, the bitcoin wallet,
compliance services and the bitcoin exchange. Cryptopay allows users to have a
single point of access to the complex financial and technical infrastructure in a
user friendly way.
In 2017, we started doing business with a new card issuer, and have developed
the second generation of the Cryptopay prepaid card. Acting as a program
manager, we are registered with the card scheme and certified under PCI-DSS.

The second generation of our card has been completely redesigned. Not only
has the physical design of the card been updated, but we’ve improved how it
works, and it’s backed by a diﬀerent technology stack:
•

NFC enabled - the world’s first contactless bitcoin prepaid card;

•

Cards have higher ATM withdrawal limit;

CPAY Prepaid Card (continued)
•

Cryptopay verification now takes less than one business day and doesn’t
require any review by the issuing bank.

As of now, we have issued more than 91,000 cards, both plastic and virtual.
Merchant Processing
The bitcoin payment gateway was the first product released by Cryptopay in
2013. We began providing high risk merchants (gaming, gambling, etc.) with the
ability to accept/send bitcoin as a payment channel without the risk of holding
bitcoins. Most merchants use our API with SLA guarantee and we have
developed features to meet their specific needs.
Featured clients:

Payment processing is a product with a long-term development strategy that
heavily relies on sales and business development. From a commercial
standpoint, the revenue from this business stream is driven by the adoption of
bitcoin and in the long run this will aﬀect other revenue streams through various
cross-sell business opportunities.

Products Under Development
Brokerage Services
The recent dramatic valuation of diﬀerent popular digital currencies have
generated a lot of wealth for early adopters. From the long term perspective,
many digital currencies holders will eventually have to reduce their exposure to
digital currencies due to many reasons - starting from liquidity preferences to
changing attitudes of perceived risk. We soon expect to see many investors shift
the holdings of their portfolio from digital currencies to traditional financial assets
- stocks, bonds, derivatives and even term deposits.

ICO Cryptopay White paper

Brokerage Services (continued)
We believe that we will benefit traditional asset managers/brokers as they will
get interest from relatively young, but wealthy individuals. However, due to
compliance reasons, much of the shift of wealth will be followed by multiple
issues - asset freezes, compliance checks, bank account shutdowns, etc.
Traditional financial institutions neither understand this new generation of clients
nor can they serve them in the right manner.
Our focus is to provide traditional financial services to the digital currencies
community in a secure and compliant way. Users of Cryptopay brokerage
services will be able to move holdings from bitcoin, to say, Apple stocks within a
single account and without any additional eﬀort.
As a regulated entity with payments and prepaid cards we are in the best
position to combine a high level of service that our users love with regulatory
requirements.
Current Accounts and Banking Services
At the moment, making and receiving payment from a bitcoin related source
(bitcoin exchange, broker or platform) is liable to end up in a compliance
nightmare. Yet again, traditional financial services companies do not understand
digital currencies and whenever there is an inflow of funds from that space
issues arise. Many cryptocurrency traders and miners dream of a bank account
that understands the nature of their business, and is able to provide at the very
least, basic payment services. However, even in Europe, it is diﬃcult to obtain
and maintain a bank account that is associated with digital currencies.
Cryptopay plans to provide its clients’ payment accounts with an IBAN attached
to it and the account will be in the name of the customer, rather than Cryptopay.
Bridging these two distant worlds together will create a place where the digital
currencies community will be able to hold, save, and transact with its fiat
holdings without fear of getting their current accounts shut down. Thus, we
believe that providing complementary services like brokerage and a contactless
prepaid card we will be able to retain customers and new customers will switch
their current banking provider in favor of Cryptopay.

P2P Marketplace
Without a doubt, the market of ICOs and fundraising through such ICOs is here
to stay. Now the market is in its early days. Lack of investor protection and
presence of fraudulent market players discourages many investors to participate
while putting the larger market at risk.
We believe that regulations do not necessarily mean that ICOs would not be
allowed or banned. For more conscientious projects, commencing an ICO on a
regulated marketplace provides the opportunity to reach more investors, due to
transparency of the marketplace and clear investor protection mechanisms.
Once our previous fundraising goals are met and the projects connected with
those goals are implemented, Cryptopay will have enough resources and
underlying infrastructure to establish a regulated marketplace for ICOs without
sacrificing the spirit of decentralisation promoted by blockchain. Getting a
brokerage and a payment license means establishing sound dialogue with the
regulator. Having raised enough funds would prove in eyes of the regulator, that
our project has enough resources and investor demand to continue moving it
further.
Cryptopay will liaise with a reputable regulator in continental Europe to find the
best regulatory and legal framework that is most conducive with success. Critical
functions like trading, price discovery and settlement / clearing will be taken care
of by subsidiaries that were established by funds, raised on the previous
milestones. Other critical functions, like authorisation, audit and legal services
would be provided through partners from well established and reputable
professional firms. On top of that, we will run and underwrite ICOs and perform
legal due diligence, mandatory escrow and provide IR / communication platform
for projects. Some existing, well known tokens will be added to the platform to
drive the adoption and attract new investors. At the same time, many roles, like
register and listing authorisation / depositary would be performed by the
ethereum blockchain itself.
Retail investors will be able to invest in a broad range of tokenized securities,
create custom investment portfolios and get insights and reports though
Cryptopay investment research department.
Accompanied with a debit card this is the perfect solution not just to invest, but
also to keep investments liquid.

CPAY Initial Token Sale
General Overview
An Initial Token Sale or Initial Coin Oﬀering (hereinafter - "ICO") is the event at
which a cryptocurrency project sells part of its cryptocurrency tokens to early
adopters and enthusiasts in exchange for funding. For the party oﬀering the
tokens for sale, this provides a proven methodology for raising funds and
ensuring adoption of the tokens once they are in circulation and is a popular way
to upscale an existing product or service. On the other hand, for the purchasers
of tokens, ICO is an opportunity to participate in the early development of
cryptocurrency business.
Initial Coin Oﬀerings ("ICOs") have quickly grown to account for more startup
funding in blockchain-based companies than all of Venture Capital. Nearly $2.3
billion has been raised to date in ICOs, with the large majority of that taking
place in the first half of 2017.
The massive increase in the value of cryptocurrencies significantly contributed to
the growth of ICO market during the last year. The market capitalization of all
Cryptocurrency has risen from $7 billion in January of 2016 to over $130 billion
as of now in September 2017.
Bitcoin has appreciated nearly 30X since September of 2013 ($135 USD per
Bitcoin), reaching over $4,000 per Bitcoin in September of 2017. In part, this is
due to Bitcoin’s role as the most widely known, used, and accepted
cryptocurrency for payments.
Ether has appreciated more than 100X since August of 2015 ($2.83 USD),
reaching over $300 in September of 2017. In part, this has been due to Ether’s
role as the core utility token of Ethereum - the most widely used blockchainbased computing platform for ICO’s / token sales.
ICOs are a way for early cryptocurrency holders to diversify their holdings using
the cryptocurrency itself.
In the last year we’ve seen an incredible move by startups and founders towards
use of blockchain technology and tokenized models. Rather than building new
products on centralized architectures and database structures, an incredible
wave of new development and innovation is happening on blockchain
technology to kick oﬀ new decentralized services and models.

General Overview (continued)
wave of new development and innovation is happening on blockchain
technology to kick oﬀ new decentralized services and models.
There’s a deep technical community running full speed towards a blockchainbased future, with experienced technology company founders jumping in to the
fray with blockchain. A majority of the ICOs you’re seeing today are for new
companies, who are yet to launch their products to the market.
We’re also starting to see the ICO and tokenization model start to catch up with
more mature and established companies like Cryptopay.

Purpose of CPAY ICO
Even though Cryptopay already has a number of working products, a FCA Small
Payment Institution licence, and thousands of customers, taking the business to
the next level requires more capital to scale our impact. There are many
variables to be considered, such as, to continue developing products, entering
new markets, and hiring experts to help build the business. The funds raised
during the ICO will allow us accelerate the building of our platform which needs
a higher volume of loans than we are able to support at the moment.
Oﬀering a token instead of a traditional venture capital round enables the
community to participate in the Cryptopay success story, rather than limiting it to
a small, selected number of traditional venture capital funds. By acquiring CPAY
tokens, token holders will benefit from our future success. A token sale is fast,
transparent, and eﬃcient for exactly this purpose.
The main advantages of the ICO model of business expansion:
•

Token sales are a cost eﬀective mechanism for raising funds;

•

The ICO will be not only a fundraising event, but also a great marketing
opportunity;

•

Token sales provide an opportunity to engage with the community and
build products in consultation with token holders and experts - delivering
products that are best-of-breed to customers.

75% of all CPAY tokens will be for sale to the public between the phases of the
ICO pre-sale and the ICO sale to the general public.
A further 10% of CPAY tokens will be retained by the Distributor, and will be used
for various purposes. Purposes such as, community initiatives, business
development, academic research, education and market expansion or future
token sales. The Distributor considers this as a testament to the fact that
Cryptopay wants to be transparent and inclusive for the community at large,
which Cryptopay perceives as its most valuable asset.
At the same time, Cryptopay feels that it is essential that the interests of
Cryptopay are aligned with those of the ecosystem in the long-term. In order to
support long term growth in a sustainable way, founders and the development
team of Cryptopay will be rewarded with 5% of tokens in exchange for their
eﬀorts and resources contributed to the development of the CPAY products.

Token Holders Rewards
Holders of CPAY tokens will receive monthly referral commissions. Starting from
January 2018, 10% of the aggregate revenue from existing and newly developed
products will be distributed every month to holders of CPAY tokens pro rata.
According to the current performance of the business and latest medium-term
projections, the suggested referral commission is equal to a competitive passive
income on publicly available investment schemes.
In order to distribute monthly referral commissions to CPAY token holders, the
distributor will deposit the required amount of ETH along with each participant
share on the smart contract. ICO participants will be able to get funds out of the
contract up to the monthly allowance.
After the token has been listed on major exchanges, the CPAY tokens market
price will be highly dependent on the underlying business performance, as well
as the company's future growth perspectives on the medium to long term
horizon. The Cryptopay team has already established a solid basis for
sustainable medium term growth, grounding on the existing products and
infrastructure. There is also a long term business plan for further product
development.

Foundation and CPAY Team Vesting
In order to ensure the longevity of the project and protect the integrity of the
Cryptopay team, their tokens will be vested. Vesting ensures the founders’
commitment to building the system in the long-term. Founders and the
Cryptopay team will have 2 years vesting with a 6 months cliﬀ. Meaning that
Foundation retention and CPAY team tokens will be locked in a smart contract,
which would release them every 6 months proportionally during a period of two
years, starting on the 7th month after the ICO.

control.

Financial Highlights
Cryptopay Current Financials
Cryptopay has nearly 4 years of active trading history with a relatively high profit
margin and positive operational cash flow.
Principally, there are two methods by which Cryptopay generates revenue. Flat
fees are charged to individual clients for diﬀerent operations, including card
issuing, card loading and exchanging cryptocurrency. Corporate clients are
charged fees for the cryptocurrency processing and white label card issuing.
Another revenue stream is a margin on FX rates for exchange transactions
during loading, internal transfers, and processing.
The current monthly level of activities that are subject to Cryptopay fees amount
to approximately 22,230,000 EUR. During the last year there has been an
average of 10% monthly growth, and we expect this trend to continue for 2018.
We believe this because of the overall blockchain fintech industry growth rate
and the latest market and competition research. It is also in line with the fact that
soon most of our competitors will have to limit their services to EEA countries
residents, while the Cryptopay bitcoin prepaid cards do not bear this restriction
as we have a direct BIN sponsorship.
The most significant business costs are connected with ongoing research and
development processes, infrastructure, and existing product maintenance in
addition to the interactions with various financial services providers and
intermediaries.
The business is fully equity financed and does not bear any significant external
borrowings.

Financial Projections
Starting from the last months of 2018 FY business plans to begin launching new
products in accordance with the established roadmap. After a certain initial
period the following new revenue streams will respectively follow:

ICO Cryptopay White paper

Financial Projections (continued)
•

Trading fees;

•

Interest on leverage provided;

•

Monthly management fees;

•

International payment transactions fees;

•

Platform fees for listing, running and escrow of ICOs;

•

Value added services for companies listing their ICOs.

According to the established financial forecast, this intensive development is
expected to contribute into almost doubling revenue during 2019 and 2020.
Upon successful implementation, of all three milestones, the business aims to
support and permanently improve all existing products, expand customer base,
and benefit from extensive growth - the eﬀect on revenue is anticipated to be
70% and 40% annual increase in 2021 and 2022 respectively following
underlying market saturation. After having raised funds to cover the
development of the third milestone we aim to achieve a unique position on the
market. The Cryptopay ICO platform may be put into a unique regulatory regime
that will make it the first and only fully compliant and legal platform for ICO
fundraising.
The cost structure is going to alter in accordance with new lines of business, but
is still budgeted at a reasonable level. There will be a number of significant oneoﬀ capital expenditures for licenses acquisitions and necessary business
combinations that will aﬀect profitability on the long-term horizon. The
forecasted profit margin during 2018-2022 is concurrent with the industry
competitive level.

Conclusion
We believe that blockchain and cryptocurrencies are the payment method of the
future. In order to make such payments possible for all consumers with maximum
convenience, we aim to connect the blockchains in the background and oﬀer an
easy-to-use interface to any of the blockchain and traditional assets.
With the ICO to be conducted by the Distributor, a wide range of individuals will
have the opportunity to participate in our long-term growth and success story to
fundamentally change the world of payments, brokerage and banking.
