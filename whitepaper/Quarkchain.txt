RISK!FACTORS!
The$ acquisition$ of$ virtual$ currency$ or$ tokens,$ including$ QKC$ issued$ by$ as$ set$ forth$ in$ this$
Whitepaper,$ involves$ a$ high$ degree$ of$ risk,$ including$ but$ not$ limited$ to$ the$ risks$ described$
below.$Prior$to$any$purchase$of$QKC,$prospective$participants$(“Prospective!Participants”$or$
“you”)$should$carefully$consider$the$following$risk$factors$and$the$other$information$contained$
in$ this$ Whitepaper.$ In$ particular,$ Prospective$ Participants$ should$ carefully$ consider$ and$
evaluate$ all$ risks$ and$ uncertainties$ associated$ with$ the$ current$ initial$ coin$ offering$ (the$
“QuarkChain!ICO”)$and$the$sale$and$purchase$of$QKC.$
The$risks$described$below$are$not$the$only$ones$we$face.$Additional$risks$not$presently$known$
to$ us$ may$ also$ adversely$ affect$ the$ QuarkChain$ Network$ should$ such$ risks$ subsequently$
materialize.$ If$ any$ of$ the$ following$ risks$ actually$ occur,$ the$ maintenance$ and$ level$ of$ usage$ of$
QKC$may$be$severely$affected$as$well.$In$such$cases,$the$trading$price$of$QKC$(in$the$event$they$
are$listed$on$cryptocurrency$exchange(s))$may$decline$due$to$the$materialization$of$such$risks.$
As$a$result,$you$may$lose$all$or$part$of$your$investment.$$
This$Whitepaper$also$contains$forwardJlooking$statements$that$involve$risks$and$uncertainties.$
The$ actual$ results$ could$ differ$ materially$ from$ those$ anticipated$ in$ such$ forwardJlooking$
statements$as$a$result$of$certain$factors,$including$the$risks$faced$by$us$described$below.!
RISKS!RELATED!TO!PARTICIPATION!IN!THE!QUARKCHAIN!ICO!!
The!QUARKCHAIN!ICO!may!not!result!in!an!active!or!liquid!market!for!QKC!
•

There$ is$ currently$ no$ public$ market$ for$ QKC.$ While$ the$ Foundation$ (and$ its$ affiliates)$
will$ use$ reasonable$ endeavours$ to$ seek$ the$ admission$ of$ QKC$ for$ trading$ on$
cryptocurrency$ exchange(s),$ there$ is$ no$ guarantee$ that$ QKC$ will$ receive$ approval$ for$
admission$to$trading$on$any$such$cryptocurrency$exchange(s).$$

•

Furthermore,$even$if$QKC$are$admitted$to$trading$by$cryptocurrency$exchange(s),$there$
is$no$guarantee$that$an$active$or$liquid$market$for$QKC$will$ultimately$develop$or$even$if$
it$develops,$will$be$sustained.$It$should$also$be$noted$that$QKC$have$no$known$potential$
uses$outside$of$the$QuarkChain$Network.$

There!is!no!assurance!as!to!profitability!in!participating!in!the!QUARKCHAIN!ICO!
•

There$is$no$assurance$that$the$value$of$QKC$may$increase$over$time.$In$particular,$there$
is$ no$ guarantee$ that$ the$ market$ price$ of$ QKC$ will$ reach$ or$ exceed$ the$ original$
participation$price$paid$for$QKC$in$the$initial$QKC$sale$pursuant$to$the$QuarkChain$ICO.$$

The!value!of!QKC!may!fluctuate!and!be!volatile!
•

The$ virtual$ currency$ markets$ are$ often$ volatile$and$ suffer$ from$ periods$ of$ limited$
liquidity.$ Once$ purchased,$ the$ value$ of$ QKC$ may$ be$ influenced$ by$ digital$ currency$
market$ trends,$ exchange$ rate$ volatility$ and$ other$ factors.$ The$ majority$ of$ such$ events$
are$ unpredictable$ and$ are$ not$ within$ the$ control$ of$ the$ Foundation$ (and$ its$ affiliates).$

June 2, 2018

This$may$correspondingly$cause$the$value$of$QKC$to$significantly$fluctuate$over$periods$
of$time.$$
•

Additionally,$outside$of$seeking$a$listing$on$cryptocurrency$exchange(s),$the$Foundation$
(and$its$affiliates)$does$not$and$has$no$intention$to$take$any$further$action$regarding$the$
subsequent$ trading$ and$ circulation$ of$ QKC.$ Any$ subsequent$ trading$ of$ QKC$ will$ be$
determined$ on$ a$ willingJbuyer,$ willingJseller$ basis,$ based$ on$ the$ relevant$ parties’$
reaching$ a$ consensus$ on$ its$ value.$ At$ no$ point$ does$ any$ party$ guarantee$ the$ liquidity$
and/or$the$market$value$of$QKC.$$

There! is! no! assurance! that! the! Foundation! (and! its! affiliates)! will! obtain! the! necessary!
funds!from!the!offering!of!QKC!proceeds!
•

The$QuarkChain$ICO$may$not$reach$the$target$sale$amount$and$as$such,$the$Foundation$
(and$its$affiliates)$may$not$have$sufficient$funds$to$execute$its$plans$and/or$operate$the$
QuarkChain$ Network,$ which$ may$ correspondingly$ materially$ and$ adversely$ affect$ the$
business,$ financial$ condition,$ reputation,$ results$ of$ operations$ and$ prospects$ of$ the$
QuarkChain$ Network.$ This$ may$ also$ result$ in$ the$ failure$ to$ create$ the$ necessary$
momentum$ and$ increased$ usage$ of$ the$ QuarkChain$ Network,$ which$ may$ consequently$
result$in$a$decline$in$the$value$of$QKC.$

Future!sales!or!issuances!of!QKC!could!materially!and!adversely!affect!the!market!price!of!
QKC!!
•

Any$future$sales$and/or$issuances$or$simply$the$perception$that$such$future$sales$and/or$
issuances$of$QKC$may$occur,$could$have$a$material$and$adverse$impact$on$the$value$of$
QKC.$

Negative!publicity!may!materially!and!adversely!affect!the!price!of!QKC!!

Any$ negative$ publicity,$ whether$ justified$ or$ not,$ involving$ the$ Foundation$ (and$ its$
affiliates),$ the$ QuarkChain$ Network,$ QKC$ and/or$ any$ key$ personnel$ of$ the$ QuarkChain$
Team$may$similarly$have$a$material$and$adverse$impact$on$the$value$of$QKC.$

RISKS!RELATED!TO!REGULATION!AND!TO!THE!VIRTUAL!CURRENCY!INDUSTRY!
The!laws!applicable!to!QKC!and!their!future!development!are!divergent!and!emerging!
•

The$regulatory$status$of$QKC$and$distributed$ledger$technology$is$unclear$or$unsettled$in$
many$ jurisdictions.$ In$ particular,$ the$ virtual$ currency$ or$ token$ economy$ is$ completely$
novel$and$subject$to$a$divergent$and$rapidly$changing$regulatory$environment.$There$is$
currently$ an$ underdeveloped$ yet$ rapidly$ emerging$ body$ of$ law$ internationally$
governing$this$area.$The$regulation$of$virtual$currencies$has$become$a$primary$target$of$
regulation$in$all$major$countries$in$the$world.$It$is$impossible$to$predict$how,$when$or$
whether$ regulatory$ agencies$ may$ apply$ existing$ regulations$ or$ create$ new$ regulations$
with$ respect$ to$ such$ technology$ and$ its$ applications,$ including$ QKC$ and/or$ the$
QuarkChain$ Network.$ Regulatory$ actions$ could$ negatively$ impact$ QKC$ and/or$ the$
QuarkChain$ Network$ in$ various$ ways.$ In$ particular,$ it$ is$ possible$ that$ such$ emerging$
2

June 2, 2018

laws$ and$ regulations$ could$ result$ in$ unexpected$ transfer$ and/or$ other$ forms$ of$
restrictions$being$imposed$on$QKC.$
•

The$Foundation$(or$its$affiliates)$may$cease$operations$in$a$jurisdiction$in$the$event$that$
regulatory$ actions,$ or$ changes$ to$ law$ or$ regulation,$ make$ it$ illegal$ to$ operate$ in$ such$
jurisdiction,$or$commercially$undesirable$to$obtain$the$necessary$regulatory$approval(s)$
to$operate$in$such$jurisdiction.$After$consulting$with$a$wide$range$of$legal$advisors$and$
continuous$ analysis$ of$ the$ development$ and$ legal$ structure$ of$ virtual$ currencies,$ the$
Foundation$ (or$ its$ affiliates)$ will$ apply$ a$ cautious$ approach$ towards$ the$ sale$ of$ QKC.$
Therefore,$for$the$token$sale,$the$Foundation$(or$its$affiliates)$may$constantly$adjust$the$
sale$strategy$in$order$to$avoid$relevant$legal$risks$as$much$as$possible.$

•

QKC$may$not$be$resold$to$persons$who$are$residents$of$other$jurisdiction(s)$where$the$
purchase$ of$ QKC$ may$ be$ in$ violation$ of$ the$ applicable$ laws$ of$ the$ relevant$
jurisdiction(s).$ Accordingly,$ the$ Foundation$ (and$ its$ affiliates)$ cannot$ guarantee$ there$
will$be$sufficient$demand$or$liquidity$for$QKC$after$they$have$been$admitted$to$trading$
on$cryptocurrency$exchange(s).$$

•

While$ the$ operation$ of$ the$ QuarkChain$ Network$ is$ currently$ not$ subject$ to$ any$
regulatory$ licence$ requirements$ under$ any$ applicable$ laws.$ However,$ over$ time,$ the$
applicable$ laws$ may$ change.$ As$ a$ result,$ the$ QuarkChain$ Network$ may$ need$ to$ adapt,$
and$ (a)$ incur$ more$ costs$ to$ comply$ with$ regulatory$ requirements;$ (b)$ temporarily$
suspend$business$in$order$to$comply$with$such$requirements;$or$(c)$modify$the$manner$
in$which$it$conducts$its$business$in$the$applicable$jurisdiction.$$

Uncertain!tax!consequences!relating!to!an!investment!in!QKC!
•

Currently,$ the$ tax$ characterization$ of$ the$ purchase$ and$ sale$ of$ QKC$ pursuant$ to$
applicable$ laws$ is$ uncertain.$ However,$ given$ the$ advent$ of$ technology,$ the$ relevant$
regulatory$bodies$may$ultimately$choose$to$tax$the$sale$and$purchase$of$QKC.$This$may$
lead$ to$ a$ reduction$ in$ the$ value$ of$ QKC$ in$ addition$ to$ you$ being$ made$ subject$ to$ tax$
obligations.$ It$ is$ your$ sole$ responsibility$ to$ comply$ with$ the$ tax$ laws$ of$ the$
jurisdiction(s)$applicable$to$you.$

The! use! of! experimental! technology! carries! operational,! technological,! regulatory,!
financial!and!reputational!risks!
•

The$ QuarkChain$ Network$ relies$ on,$ amongst$ other$ technology,$ blockchainJbased$
software$systems$and$smart$contract$technology,$and$QKC$use$cryptocurrency$wallets$or$
other$related$token$storage$mechanisms.$The$technology$is$experimental$and$in$a$pilot$
stage$of$development.$The$technology$may$be$made$subject$to$existing$laws$not$initially$
meant$ for$ said$ technology,$ or$ new$ regulations$ regarding$ blockchain$ technologyJbased$
applications$may$be$introduced.$Such$newly$introduced$laws$and$regulations$may$cause$
issues$ and/or$ conflict$ with$ the$ current$ QuarkChain$ Network$ concept,$ which$ may$
ultimately$ result$ in$ the$ need$ to$ make$ substantial$ modifications$ to,$ and/or$ lead$ to$ the$
potential$ suspension$ or$ termination$ of$ some$ or$ all$ of$ the$ functions$ on$ the$ QuarkChain$
Network.$ There$ is$ correspondingly$ no$ guarantee$ that$ the$ services$ and$ projects$
described$ in$ this$ Whitepaper$ will$ not$ need$ to$ be$ adjusted$ or$ modified$ in$ certain$
3

countries$ because$ of$ the$ then$ regulatory$ environment.$ It$ also$ cannot$ be$ ruled$ out$ that$
some$services$will$be$impossible$to$provide$in$certain$jurisdictions.$
No!offer!of!securities!or!registration!!
•

The$ offer$ of$ QKC$ pursuant$ to$ this$ Whitepaper$ is$ not$ intended$ to$ constitute$ an$ offer$ of$
securities$or$a$solicitation$for$investment$in$securities$in$any$jurisdiction.$$

RISKS! RELATED! TO! SECURITY,! CYBERSECURITY,! AND! THE! HANDLING! OF! PERSONAL!
DATA!
Dependence!on!computer!infrastructure!
•

We$are$highly$dependent$on$information$technology.$We$are$also$subject$to$hacking$or$
other$attacks$on$our$IT$systems.$As$such,$a$system$failure$would$have$an$adverse$effect$
on$ the$ use$ of$ the$ platform.$ Despite$ the$ intended$ implementation$ of$ all$ reasonable$
network$ security$ measures,$ the$ processing$ center$ servers$ are$ vulnerable$ to$ computer$
viruses,$ physical$ or$ electronic$ breakJins$ or$ other$ disruptions$ of$ a$ similar$ nature.$
Computer$viruses,$breakJins$or$other$disruptions$caused$by$third$parties$may$result$in$
interruption,$ delay$ or$ suspension$ of$ services,$ which$ would$ limit$ the$ use$ of$ the$
QuarkChain$Network.!

•

Additionally,$ hackers$ or$ other$ malicious$ groups$ or$ organisations$ may$ attempt$ to$
interfere$with$QKC$and/or$the$QuarkChain$Network$in$a$variety$of$ways,$including,$but$
not$limited$to,$malware$attacks,$denial$of$service$attacks,$consensusJbased$attacks,$Sybil$
attacks,$ smurfing$ and$ spoofing.$ Furthermore,$ there$ is$ a$ risk$ that$ a$ third$ party$ or$ a$
member$ of$ the$ Foundation$ (and$ its$ affiliates)$ may$ intentionally$ or$ unintentionally$
introduce$ weaknesses$ into$ the$ core$ infrastructure$ of$ QKC$ and/or$ the$ QuarkChain$
Network,$which$could$negatively$affect$QKC$and/or$the$QuarkChain$Network.$

•

Further,$ the$ future$ of$ cryptography$ and$ security$ innovations$ are$ highly$ unpredictable$
and$ advances$ in$ cryptography,$ or$ technical$ advances$ (including$ without$ limitation$
development$of$quantum$computing),$could$present$unknown$risks$to$QKC$and/or$the$

•

While$the$Foundation$(and$its$affiliates)$will$implement$reasonable$security$measures$to$
ensure$ that$ QKC$ can$ be$ securely$ held$ by$ the$ respective$ users,$ there$ is$ however$ no$
assurance$ that$ there$ will$ be$ no$ theft$ of$ QKC$ as$ a$ result$ of$ hacks,$ sophisticated$ cyberJ
attacks,$denial$of$service$or$errors,$and/or$vulnerabilities$or$defects$arising$from$our$IT$
systems.!

Malfunction,!breakdown!or!abandonment!of!experimental!technology!!
•

As$ QKC$ are$ based$ on$ the$ blockchain$ protocol,$ any$ malfunction,$ breakdown$ and$
abandonment$ of$ the$ blockchain$ protocol$ may$ have$ material$ adverse$ consequences$ for$
QKC.$Additionally,$QKC$remain$subject$to$technical$advances,$such$as$the$development$of$
quantum$computing,$which$could$present$risks$to$QKC$and$the$QuarkChain$Network.$

Risk!of!Mining!Attacks!!
•

As$with$other$decentralized$cryptographic$tokens$based$on$the$blockchain$protocol,$QKC$
are$susceptible$to$attacks$by$miners$in$the$course$of$validating$QKC$transactions$on$the$
blockchain.$Successful$mining$attacks$present$a$risk$to$QKC,$including,$but$not$limited$to$
accurate$execution$and$recording$of$transactions$involving$QKC.$

Disclosure!of!information!!
•

Personal$ information$ received$ from$ QKC$ holders,$ including$ but$ not$ limited$ to,$ the$
number$of$QKC$owned,$wallet$addresses$used,$and$any$other$relevant$information$may$
be$disclosed$to$law$enforcement,$government$officials,$and$other$relevant$third$parties$
when$ the$ Foundation$ (and$ its$ affiliates)$ is$ required$ to$ disclose$ such$ information$
pursuant$to$any$applicable$law,$subpoena$or$court$order$received.$At$no$time$shall$the$
Foundation$(and$its$affiliates)$be$held$responsible$for$such$information$disclosure.$

•

Additionally,$as$at$the$date$hereof,$the$QuarkChain$Network$is$still$under$development$
and$its$design$concepts,$consensus$mechanisms,$algorithms,$codes,$and$other$technical$
details$ and$ parameters$ may$ be$ constantly$ and$ frequently$ updated$ and$ changed.$
Although$ this$ Whitepaper$ contains$ the$ most$ current$ information$ relating$ to$ the$
QuarkChain$ Network,$ it$ is$ not$ absolutely$ complete$ and$ may$ still$ be$ adjusted$ and$
updated$by$the$QuarkChain$team$from$time$to$time.$The$QuarkChain$team$has$no$ability$
and$obligation$to$keep$holders$of$QKC$informed$of$every$detail$(including$development$
progress$ and$ expected$ milestones)$ regarding$ the$ project$ to$ develop$ the$ QuarkChain$
Network,$hence$insufficient$information$disclosure$is$inevitable$and$reasonable.$

Risks!Associated!with!KYC!
•

The$ Foundation$ (and$ its$ affiliates)$ reserves$ the$ right$ to$ conduct$ further$ “know$ your$
client”$ assessment$ (KYC)$ on$ all$ Prospective$ Participants.$ Such$ KYC$ may$ be$ conducted$
following$ the$ receipt$ of$ funds$ from$ Prospective$ Participants$ of$ QKC$ in$ the$ QuarkChain$
ICO.$ In$ the$ event$ KYC$ is$ not$ satisfied$ (as$ determined$ by$ the$ Foundation$ (and$ its$
affiliates),$in$its$sole$discretion),$the$Foundation$(and$its$affiliates)$$may$return$any$such$

materially$ and$ adversely$ affect$ the$ business,$ financial$ condition,$ reputation,$ results$ of$
operations$and$prospects$of$the$QuarkChain$Network.$

•

Hackers$ or$ other$ people$ engaging$ in$ similar$ forms$ of$ criminal$ activity$ may$ attempt$ to$
steal$ QKC$ and$ money$ raised$ from$ the$ QuarkChain$ ICO$ which$ would$ result$ in$ the$
Foundation$ (and$ its$ affiliates)$ not$ having$ the$ required$ funds$ to$ develop$ and$ grow$ its$

The$ Foundation’s$ (and$ its$ affiliates)$ intends$ to$ rapidly$ and$ significantly$ expand$ its$
operations$and$it$anticipates$that$significant$expansion$of$its$operations$will$continue$to$
be$ required$ in$ order$ to$ provide$ market$ opportunities$ and$ attract$ market$ participants,$
which$ is$ necessary$ to$ provide$ market$ liquidity.$ The$ anticipated$ rapid$ growth$ may$
present$ unique$ challenges$ to$ the$ Foundation$ (and$ its$ affiliates)$ management,$
operational,$ and$ financial$ resources.$ The$ success$ of$ the$ QuarkChain$ Network$ is$
dependent$on$its$current$management$personnel$for$the$operation$of$its$business.$$

Competitors!
•

Various$ types$ of$ decentralised$ applications$ are$ emerging$ at$ a$ rapid$ rate,$ and$ the$
industry$ is$ increasingly$ competitive.$ It$ is$ possible$ that$ alternative$ networks$ could$ be$
established$ that$ utilise$ the$ same$ or$ similar$ code$ and$ protocol$ underlying$ QKC$ and/or$
the$ QuarkChain$ Network$ and$ attempt$ to$ reJcreate$ similar$ facilities.$ The$ QuarkChain$
Network$ may$ be$ required$ to$ compete$ with$ these$ alternative$ networks,$ which$ could$
negatively$impact$QKC$and/or$the$QuarkChain$Network.$
