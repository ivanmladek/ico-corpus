Cajutel Sarl
Bissau, Guinea-Bissau

Whitepaper / Business plan
August 2017
Version 1.6b

1. Executive Summary
Cajutel sarl is a Guinea-Bissau company under Swiss ownership. Its major shareholder also owns
DataCell ehf , which built and operated a crypto mining datacenter and assisted Wikileaks in credit
card payments in 2010. Furthermore he started Icell ehf, a mobile operator in Iceland in 2007 and
operated Emax a rural area wireless internet access network using 4G technology and Backbone ehf
which operates a encrypted backbone network in multiple continents and is laying fiber. The know
how on how to operate a wireless network in harsh environments can be easily transplanted into
other countries. In this project we are envisaging to build up a countrywide access network for
Guinea-Bissau and with a future expansion to neighboring countries to allow the large public to be
able to access the internet. Customers who have never had access to the internet before ever. This
is a pretty unique situation to touch such a virgin market and gives us the opportunity to grab the
market completely. Our vision is to build the most cost eﬀective broadband access network and to
provide state of the art communications for its customers and thus create a big boost to the
education and economy. CAJUTEL will bring aﬀordable, reliable internet communication to the local
market and is focused to provide the best performing mobile data network for Guinea-Bissau and
Guinea. CAJUTEL will be the fastest internet provider in the area for the public, outperforming the
existing operators oﬀering by a factor of 10x to 100x with an at least 30% cheaper price. This
enables internet technologies not present in West Africa simply due to lack of bandwidth and too
high prices. It makes it aﬀordable for the general public to get access to the internet. Thats why only
less than 2% have access today. So there's 98% available to be grabbed by us.

People
The CAJUTEL management have strong telecommunication backgrounds and have all started up
several successful companies before, especially in mobile and internet.

Network & Infrastructure
At the time of writing, CAJUTEL is in process of acquiring all the needed licenses for its operation
and is working on a draft rollout plan and all the contacts needed to start operation nation wide. The
plan is to cover 75% of the population with highest speed internet access within 2 years. The
network infrastructure is in the final stage of being chosen based on previous experiences of the
various vendors picked. Network planning is done in house and completed for the first phase of the
network.

Marketing
CAJUTEL has a well thought through marketing plans to address the needs of the local market. The
main diﬀerentiators to the other operators are speed, availability and service quality. Given there are
currently only very weak low level players in the market, we are early field players backed up with
over 25 years of experience. This gives CAJUTEL a very good handle to address the local market
quickly. The marketing message will be heard loud and clear and people will understand in a split
second and we can take the market by storm. The demand is there, the competitors are almost non
existent. It's gaining market share by acquiring new customers in a market which just have started to
feel the need for the service. A unique position. Its similar to what AOL did in the US when the
internet boom started, except, that this boom will be 10x faster growing due to the wide availability
of modern aﬀordable technology.

Sales
Sales will be through direct sales in diﬀerent of sale locations of CAJUTEL and through partner
companies such as computer vendors, Kiosks and the like. Word of mouth marketing is very easy
and will spread like a wildfire in such underserved markets.

Market Potential
Even though the market in Guinea-Bissau is relatively limited (there are 2million potential customers),
and the business case is aiming for a very pessimistic 5% population share in 4 years it still provides
a high return of investment and a high profitability. Adding Guinea with 10 times the population and
very similar situation increases the potential by a factor of 10. The key element in this is to keep the
operating costs down to the minimum while grabbing as many new customers as possible during the
time people start to use internet for the first time. The whole CAJUTEL business case is optimized
that way. This will give CAJUTEL a competitive edge which the existing operators have no way of
matching without similar investments. As these players ar big companies and have slow processes,
we will outperform them by large, meaning our infrastructure will be amortized by the time they get to
the market and we have a competitive advantage they can't easily catch up.

Funds Requested
At this time, CAJUTEL is looking for an investment of 30M$ to cover Guinea-Bissau and Guinea (the
big plan) or a minimum of 12M$ for the slower building plan to only cover Guinea-Bissau.

Use of Funds Requested
The funds will be used to build up the initial network and to fuel expansion an operating losses for a
year until the break even point is reached from where on CAJUTEL can fund its own expansion.

Financial Projection
Break Even: less than a year, Return of Investment: under 4 years
For a full view of the financial projections a deeper look at the spreadsheet is recommended.

Background

Cajutel is currently owned by two individuals, Mr. Andreas Fink, a telecommunication expert
who have started mobile networks before and Mr. David Vine who lives and has operated
wireless MMDS TV networks in the region and has all the high level contacts needed to make
things work in Africa.

2.3

Guinea Bissau

!
Guinea-Bissau is a country of west Africa. It is adjacent to Senegal towards the north and Guinea
towards the south. It’s size is 36'125 km².

!
The population of Guinea-Bissau is 1.647 million (est. 2010).
Guinea-Bissau's GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and its Human Development Index
is one of the lowest on earth. More than two-thirds of the population lives below the poverty line. The
economy depends mainly on agriculture; fish, cashew nuts and ground nuts are its major exports. A
long period of political instability has resulted in depressed economic activity, deteriorating social
conditions, and increased macroeconomic imbalances.
Guinea-Bissau has started to show major economic advances after a pact of stability was signed by
the main political parties of the country, leading to an IMF-backed structural reform program. The key
challenges for the country in the period ahead would be to achieve fiscal discipline, rebuild public
administration, improve the economic climate for private investment, and promote economic
diversification. Latest development have confirmed that the country is well on its path. After several
years of economic downturn and political instability, in 1997, Guinea-Bissau entered the CFA franc
monetary system, bringing about some internal monetary stability.
Guinea-Bissau is a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa
(OHADA).[39]
Guinea-Bissau has a natural resources of oil but it is currently not being harvested but development to
do so is in progress which will bring additional busines to the country.
The currency is the west African CFA which is tied to the Euro ( 655.957 CFA = 1€)

2.4

Guinea

Guinea is the country adjacent to the south of Guinea-Bissau. It also touches Senegal,Mali, Ivory
coast, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

!
The population of Guinea is 10.5 million and a size of 245'860 square kilometers. Its economic and
political situation is very similar to Guinea-Bissau. Geographically is more mountaneous than
Guinea-Bissau. The language spoken in Guinea is French. The capital is Conakry. The main export
articles are Bauxit, Gold, Diamonds and other mining products as well as ofshore petroleum
products. The literacy rate of Guinea is one of the lowest in the world: in 2010 it was estimated that
only 41% of adults were literate (52% of males and 30% of females). Primary education is
compulsory for 6 years, but most children do not attend for so long, and many do not go to school at
all.

2.5

Telecommunications

Telecommunications has recently developed mainly in the mobile field. Guinea-Bissau is equipped
with only 4'844 telephone lines while the number of mobile phones have reached 1.2 millions [1].
The latest increase in mobile phone use has been occured only in the last few years as 10 years ago,
there was no mobile network at all. Despite the wide availability of telephony today, the quality of
service on mobile telephony is very bad. Call succeed rate is around 20%. Calls between carriers are
often not possible.
Internet usage is currently very low. There are approximately 15'000 internet users and they are
paying a very high price (approx 60$ per month for an advertised speed of 300kbps (measured
100kbps) and get a very slow connection which fails often. It can take up to 20 minutes to load the
Google web page.
Guinea-Bissau currently does not have access to sea cable. Even though there where plans to
connect a sea fiber cable, it has not occurred yet. All telecommunications thus have to go over
neighboring countries or over satellite links.

3. People
Andreas Fink, CEO
Andreas has 25 years of experience in telecommunications. In
1992 he has started up an internet provider named Ping Net GmbH
in Switzerland, in the very early days of the internet. Ping Net
GmbH was the first ISP focusing on individuals in the country. It
became 1998 a full featured telecommunications company before
it was sold to World Online International a pan European internet
service provider which went IPO shortly after. Andreas worked for
Cisco Systems in the area of SS7 signaling and telco switching
until in 2001 he started Global Networks Switzerland AG (now
SMSRelay AG) which develops and builds GSM infrastructure for
mobile operators and provides messaging services. Global
Networks Switzerland AG also have established a GSM network in
Antarctica. In 2003 Andreas has launched BebbiCell AG, a mobile
virtual network operator (MVNO) initiative with combined GSM/
VoIP services oﬀerings which was successfully sold a couple of
years later. In 2007 he aquired a GSM License in 2007 and built a
network there. In 2010 purchased the failing e-max network in
Iceland to converge it into mobile high speed network for the
country. e-max has been sold in September 2013 to 365 ehf, the new 4G LTE license holder in
Iceland and will serve as the base of their network rollout. The e-max network had over 500 base
stations covering a big portion of the population, especially in the rural areas.

David Vine, CTO
David is of British origin but has lived the last 25 years in
various west african countries. He currently holds a Guinea
Bissauian passport and a British one. He has build TV and radio
broadcast stations and MMDS relays in Senegal and GuineaBissau and knows very well on how to build low cost networks
and how to deal with African government and institutions. He is
well networked within the region which is vital for this project.
He currently lives in Dakar, Senegal, but is in the process to
move to Bissau to handle this project.

Anita Lokica, Procurement Manager
Anita has worked for Andreas Fink on various infrastucture
projects in Iceland in the past. She is very experienced in
dealing with suppliers from around the world and make sure
the needed infrastructure elements arrive in time. Her
experience in Icell ehf and DataCell ehf are very valuable to
building up the network in the fastest time possible

Sachin Bhargava, Social Media & Marketing
Sachin has joined us recently to deal with all the
marketing aspects of our ICO and the social media. He
has over 10 years of experience in information and
telecommunication industry. After completing his degree
in technical, he started his career with a reputed Telecom

was really appreciable. Later, he worked in leading
multinational company Wipro on the designation senior
project manager and currently he is the project manager
in the leading IT Company and manages the projects and
highly focused to serve the best work to their client. He is
fully dedicated to Cajutel.

Third parties
We work with a lot of third parties which we have been working on in the past. Especially during the
buildup phases, we pull in experts from various companies to plow fiber into the ground, do radio
propagation calculations and similar things. Our extensive network of partners is long and well
proven in previous projects.

4. Feasibility Study
4.1

Market Analysis

By 2014, 70% of the population has a cell phone but only 2% have internet access.
The internet market is currently underserved and extremely overpriced. The current mobile operators
are not serving the public well. The main issue is that they do not have enough capacity into the
country which our plan is solving by setting up our own infrastructure to the border and to the sea
cable landing stations.

4.2

Competitor Analysis

The market is currently divided between the 2 mobile operators MTN and Orange
Internet speeds oﬀered are limited to 256kbps (60$/month). Business oﬀerings go up to 1Mbps
(1400$/month).

4.3 SWOT Analysis
4.3.1 Strengths
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Strong technical experience among the shareholders
New staﬀ, thus able to build a highly motivated culture.
Innovative technical solution to cellular infrastructure.
Market wanting a new Network to increase coverage.
Low fixed costs.
No legacy costs.
Comparable first mover advantage due to widely untapped market
Many of the systems are turnkey solutions with a fast time-to-market
Well networked with suppliers, building partners, government

4.3.2 Weaknesses
• Board of directors live in diﬀerent continents.
• Need to fill key positions in the short build-up timeframe
• Low GDP in country (but only on paper, in reality its much higher)

Page 9
! of !24

4.3.3 Opportunities
• Access to International customers (increasing amount of tourists and visitors).
• Competitors in Guinea Bissau are mainly thinking voice only
• Strongly underserved market / totally new market

4.3.4 Threats

4.3.4.1

Customers

Low Threat

• Guinea Bissau target market is retail customers, therefore they are fragmented and lack
power.
• The youth market is quite fickle, and thus churn could become an issue once market
saturation becomes reality.

4.3.4.2

Suppliers

Low Threat

• To provide service to international customers CAJUTEL needs to be a member of the GSM
Association.
• Rapidly changing technology.

4.3.4.3

Competitors

Medium Threat

• Financially strong competitors in the mobile area

4.3.4.4

New Entrants

Medium Threat

• New entrants in Guinea-Bissau are possible but unlikely.

4.3.4.5

Substitutes

Low Threat

• Fiber, ADSL, Wimax are obviously substitutes. Due to the almost non existence of phone
lines, ADSL is not a viable option. Fiber would have to be built first as well and is not a current
option for residential.
• Satellite services are also a substitute, but these are more expensive and carry a high
propagation delay.
Page 10
! of !24

4.3.4.6

Government

Low Threat

• The regulator is a major factor for CAJUTEL. The regulator has welcomed new licensees and
is begging for new service providers to give them internet. The world bank has given
investment guarantees (see http://www.cajutel.gw/investor/IGGenglish.pdf )

4.3.4.7

Weather

Medium Threat

• Harsh weather (strong rain) could delay rollout.

4.3.4.8

Consequences

• Marketing and Technology are the key pillars to CAJUTEL business and need to be the
response to these threats

Dealing with Africa

Doing business in Africa has a few challenges for the people who are not familiar with the
culture and people in Africa. We would like to point out a few things which are maybe not to
obvious to some readers who don't deal with Africa a lot.
First of all, if you read GDP values of countries and you will see that people earn 60$ per
month on average. The reality is very different however. GDP figures are calculated out of tax
returns divided by the population. This however doesn't reflect the fact that a lot of people
don't pay tax at all but still make a living. Often taxes are not based on income but on import
and export. So a local farmer who sells his potatoes on a daily basis to his neigbors, basically
shows up with 0$ income in the statistic. Secondly, theses statistics often don't reflect
changes in the last few years which can be dramatic increases due to political changes (end
of a war for example). From our experience on the ground in Guinea Bissau, the average
normal person earns around 250-350$ a month while the statistic show 60$. 50'000 people in
Senegal where able to afford a 50$ payTV subscription in 2004 which would be impossible if
you read the GDP statistics.
In 2004, there was no GSM in Guinea-Bissau, only 5'000 wired phones. In 2014 there where
1.4 million subscribers out of 1.7 habitants. Take away the underage children and you can
safely say that everyone had a mobile phone. This pickup of a new service is extremely fast
and its because they are so far behind that they go from zero to the newest generation
almost instantly while in Europe, we had several decades of small improvement step by step.
So while it took like 25 years for everybody in Europe to basically have internet, the same
thing will happen in Africa in 10 years or even less. Also africans spend a lot more for their
GSM phones (in relation to their income) compared to other countries
There are also special risks, depending on the country you are in. In some places people try
to dig up copper wires so they can sell the metal in it. Given we don't use copper but fiber,
there is no value for the digger at the end but the damage is still there.
The solution to that is not obvious to the non African. You use a local religious priest to saint
the cable and then nobody will touch it ever. Similar to protection of radio towers you simply
hire the local village chief to take care of it and pay him like 10$ a month and then no one
would even dare to take it down.
These kind of african specialities need sometimes innovative ideas. Our David, knows it all
since he lives in the area since over 20 years. Andreas also has been dealing with african
companies since 2003. This know how is crucial to have. If you come as European or
American newcomer to the market with a bulldozer attitude, you would fail due to such small
issues or at least it would slow you down a lot. Given we all deal with Africa since a very long
time, we are very used to these issues and can deal with them with ease.

5. Marketing Plan
5.1 CAJUTEL Compelling Reasons
Guinea-Bissau has a moderate size population (only 1.6 million inhabitants) and a high
cellphone and internet users increase rate. So CAJUTEL doesn't even needs to come up
with very strong compelling reasons for customers to choose CAJUTEL instead of the
competitors for their first internet connection. As internet use is very small, this marketing
resource is widely unused. Competitors are focusing on phone use only.
CAJUTEL has decided to focus upon 4 focused selling points, which will be difficult for the
competitors to match.
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Best Speed (2Mbps as minimum level, can go to several 100Mbps)
Best Customer Service
Better coverage
Best Quality
Best Price.

5.1.1 Flat Rate Subscription
CAJUTEL customers oﬀers free calls inside the network, free SMS inside the network and unlimited
data. The free calls/SMS can be a driving force to converge existing mobile users of other networks
into CAJUTEL’s network. This will become a substitute to a traditional fixed network telephony.

5.1.2 Free Device
Offering a free phone or CPE gives the advantage of low entry cost to get the service.
CAJUTEL will offer each customer a free device, when they sign a 24 month contract. This
will bind customers to the company long term. However as this is mainly a prepaid market,
we estimate this option to be only valuable for fixed installations.

5.2 CAJUTEL Price
5.2.1 Subscription
CAJUTEL charges a standard subscription fee of approx USD 50US$ per month, and will be
lowered in steps down to 9$ per month. This entitles the customer to unlimited use of the
CAJUTEL network. In addition to that additional fees are charged for phone calls over that
network and similar.

Page 13
! of !24

5.2.2 Other Services
The basic internet service can be completed with a telephony service, IP-TV and other IP
based services. This is not been calculated into the business plan as it requires the
availability of the matching devices which is still limited for telephony services for example.
This is why those additional revenue streams have been left out in the calculation for now.
The focus is on pure ISP access. However once the devices and services are available,
those services can be launched if it makes commercial sense generating even more revenue.

Page 14
! of !24

5.3 CAJUTEL Rollout
Many cellular networks make the mistake claiming that their network is commercially ready
before it is, and believe that despite its nascent stage it can handle more volume than is
realistic.
CAJUTEL knows that it will not be able to meet the demand generated by its offerings, thus
CAJUTEL must resist starting the network before it has a certain coverage and capacity. It is
easier to handle applicant queries, about when they will be able to become customers, than
customer complaints about quality which spread bad word of mouth. People talking about
how good the service is and how happy they are is the best advertisement you can have.
Obviously CAJUTEL needs to quickly rollout their network, whilst holding back customer
demand. The rollout has been estimated at 1-4 new city distribution site per month depending
on building speed variant (which depends mainly on total investment)
The first site to be covered will be in Saõ Domingos, Canchungo and then the capital Bissau.
This is required as the connection point to the international network is from Banjul in Gambia
from which we can reach Saõ Domingos within 2 Microwave point to point links. This path
gives us excessive bandwidth starting at 1Gbps. At a later stage, the connection will move
south into Guinea until it reaches Conakry to connect to the landing station there too. A third
path is into the eastern part of Senegal to then ride on a existing fiber of Tigo into Dakar
where many seacables land.
(see also section 9 with updated exact dates)

5.4

CAJUTEL Promotion

Prior to deciding to offer free phones/CPEs, CAJUTEL had identified youth and small
businesses as ideal target groups.
But, the offer of free devices will generate such large demand that the market segments will
self-select CAJUTEL.
Heavy advertising will not be necessary to inform the market of CAJUTEL’s offering. Viral
marketing will spread the message quickly. This will be supported by ‘sign-up rallies’ at
targeted events, and joint promotions with sponsors.
➢
➢
➢
➢

Awareness
o The press will be running articles about CAJUTEL
Interest
o The Public is expecting CAJUTEL to give better coverage and speed
Desire
o Free devices, free downloads, and free use within the CAJUTEL network will create
pent-up desire.
Action
o Customers will be queuing to fill in the applications.

This matches experiences from the past when TV services was started to be offered.
Page 15
! of !24

5.5 CAJUTEL Distribution
5.5.1 Application
Customers will apply mainly via stores / kiosks carrying CAJUTEL service point.

5.5.2 Approval
• Full validation will be performed as the application is captured.

5.5.4 Customer
As the customers are approved they will be sent/given
✓ A welcome pack
✓ Their SIM Card (if applicable)
✓ Their CPE access device or portable device.

Usually fixed CPE's will be installed by one of our service engineers for a fixed install fee to
make sure its properly set up.

5.6

ARPU

Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) is the most common benchmark for Cellular companies [see
section 6.4].

CAJUTEL’s ARPU is based on the monthly subscription fee which is initially 50$ and later
down to 9$ for private individuals. Compared to usual 7$ ARPU in african countries just
based on voice, its rather high.

Page 16
! of !24

6. Business Plan
6.1 Guinea-Bissau Network
6.1.1 Cells
CAJUTEL will use the latest 4G Cell technology. This gives CAJUTEL an enormous speed advantage!
Each complete Cell base station will consists of:
• 2.1GHz, 2.6GHz, 3.5Ghz and 5GHz 4G Equipment
• 3 to 16 sectors with 2 transceivers per sector
• 48V Power Supply with battery backup for 72 hours, plus redundant charger and controller.
Solar panel to provide the needed electricity.
• Ethernet Switch
• Microwave Point to Point links (initially) and later fiber to the tower.
A dedicated guaranteed bandwidth of 5.4Mbps per customer is planned with theoretical peak
performances of up to 270Mbps. This will permit for IP-TV streaming in full HD quality to all customers
at all times. For pure mobile use, the LTE systems gives great mobility and coverage while providing
reasonable internet access speeds of up to 150Mbps.
Picture of typical cell equipments used in 3.5 and 5GHz bands

!

!

6.1.2 Data
CAJUTEL intends to supply the best of 4G speed for data.
This will be a major marketing factor as most internet offerings are limited to 300kbp/s today (due to
use of GPRS) while with above equipment this can peak above 270MB/sec. Only Fiber to the Home
will be able to compete with that which involves costly construction and thus a much slower rollout.
Page 17
! of !24

7. Cash Flow Projections
7.1 Financial Projections
7.1.1 CAJUTEL Network
Speed is of the essence for CAJUTEL to gain market share in Guinea-Bissau, thus by the end of Year
2 the full complement of cells will be installed – giving coverage to 90% of the population in the
country
Initially, as the cells are installed a few customers will be signed up; the Marketing Launch will only
be after a month of testing.

7.1.2 Turnover
CAJUTEL’s main source of income is their monthly subscription fee.

7.1.3 Cost of Sale
The cost of the free end user devices has been treated as a Capital requirement.
There are four groups of costs in the Cost of Sale
• Running costs
o
The ongoing costs of linking each Cell to the Network
o
Rental of cell site
o
Backbone costs
• License costs
o
The Spectrum License payable to the regulator
• The cost of messages / calls sent to other networks
• The international backhaul cost (sea fiber capacity)
This results in a very profitable business

Capital

The Guinea-Bissaun business has four types of capital requirements:
•
The cell towers including the backhaul microwaves / fiber.
•
Free devices
•
Oﬃce costs,
•
Core Switching and Billing Infrastructure.
A new free device will be required for each new Subscriber.
The Core Switching and Billing infrastructure will be implemented at start
The hardware will be written oﬀ over 4 years, and thus could be replaced in Year 5.
The software will be kept current by the annual Software Licenses.

7.3

Payback

CAJUTEL’s combined operations are profitable, and despite high initial capital requirements and free
devices, the business will be self sustaining in Year 4 and able to replace equipment from operating
profits. These graphs are based on a pure 100% investment. A mix including loans is also possible.

Cash Utilization

The full amount of the loan or investment depends on the choosen variant.
We have calculated variants to build Guinea-Bissau and Guinea (big), and Guinea-Bissau ooly with a
slower buildup (small). The big variant requires 30M$, the small variant 12M$. Anything in between is
possible. The more cash we raise, the faster we build, the more customers we get, the more return
we get.
Most of the cash is required for capital expenditure, however, as CAJUTEL only becomes profitable
after one year, there are still some initial operating losses to be covered.
The largest area of expenditure is network buildup, this is primarily all the back end equipment, the
cell towers to reach the coverage and the backhaul. This is the long term investment which will also
is unique to the market and secure long term profits.

Exit Strategy

CAJUTEL is in the fortunate position of having several viable exit strategies to repay the Investment.
1. Limiting further growth to retained profit.
2. Extend the facility.
With such a sound investment and track record, it is likely that CAJUTEL can continue its facility into
the future and expand into neigboring countries.
3. Sell to another company.
CAJUTEL will be an attractive proposition for an International cellular company, especially for its
license and customer base.
4. Listing.
Listing on a Stock Exchange or other stock markets was originally also an exit strategy but due to the
initial coin offering (see section 8) this has basically been done now.

7.7

Assumptions

Depreciation has not been put in the projections, as this is not a cash item; but rather the full
replacement cost is shown in the projections.

7.7.1 Operational Assumptions - Guinea-Bissau
Whilst CAJUTEL’s pricing structure encourages customers to get their frequent contacts to also
convert to CAJUTEL, these projections assume that there is not a concentration of contacts.
International Calls are only 3% of Guinea-Bissaun traﬃc, so they have not been included in these
projections.
The Guinea-Bissaun business will be run from Guinea-Bissau.

7.7.3 Financial Assumptions
Inflation has not been applied tariﬀs will be increased inline with costs .
Tax has been applied at full rate in the Income Statement, although financial management should
permit significant tax savings and cash flow improvements.

8. Initial Cryptocurrency Offering
Cajutel has decided to raise financing for this project by issuing Etherum based tokens as share
certificates. This means every token is representing a share in the company and equal voting right.
The company has authorised 720'000 additional shares to be sold for this ICO and 60'000 shares to
be allocated for bounties and for advertisement costs. 1'000'000 tokens are retained by the existing
shareholders which makes a total supply of 1'780'000 tokens in circulation. This number will not
grow unless the shareholders agree to issue additional shares which is envisaged to be needed in
the near future.
These Shares are distributed in 5 Phases
Phase 1
Phase 2
Phase 3
Phase 4
Phase 5

10'000 Shares/Tokens
10'000 Shares/Tokens
100'000 Shares/Tokens
200'000 Shares/Tokens
400'000 Shares/Tokens

sold at 0.05 Ether per token (75% Discount)
sold at 0.075 Ether per token (62.5% Discount)
sold at 0.10 Ether per token (50% Discount)
sold at 0.15 Ether per token (25% Discount)
sold at 0.20 Ether per token

Reaching funding phase 4 allows us to build the network in Guinea-bissau.
Reaching funding phase 5 allows us to expand the plan into Guinea as well.
The date for the ICO to start is set to Unix Timestamp 1503045000
2017-08-18 08.30:00 UTC
and will last until 2017-11-18 08.30:00 UTC

ICO Start

18. August 2017 08:30 UTC

Construction of first 6 radio towers to link up Bissau to Banjul begin in
First customers to be online and sales of services to start:

December 2017
February 2018

Month Number 1 in the excel sheet becomes November 2017 and the rollout of new radio towers
continue according to the excel sheet (every month a couple of towers more).
First financial year ending will be end of 2018. A payout of dividends will be agreed by the general
assembly of the shareholders. We expect that end of 2018 we will rather want to use the earnings to
refinance the expansion and don't pay out a dividends at this time unless we are exceptionally
successful. First payout of dividends is expected end of year 3 when the company has reached the
return of investment and can finance its expansion on its own.

10. Investment Return Estimates.
The company will be profitable in year one and in year 3 the return of Investment is reached. This
means the company can pay dividends. The exact dividend values will depends on the operating
profit and need for reserves for further expansion. If the company pays out 60% of the EBITA as
dividend, then the earnings per share in year 4: would be 13$, in year 5: 16$, in year 6: 23$.
So someone buying a token in the beginning would earn in 6 years 52$. Depending on in which
phase he invests, this can be a increase of value of 1.86x up to 5.31x. The interesting is the following
years as you can expect dividends far above the 20$ per share every year as the capital expenditure
to build up new infrastructure drastically decreases.
Besides the dividend, the token itself represents a value as it is creating money for the investor.
Should he sell such a token on the free market, then it can be sold at prices of 8x - 20x EBITA. These
are the factors which are seen on publicly traded stock market companies in this business area. This
means an investor investing into one token today could potentially earn 52$ in 6 years and then sell it
for 300$ to 772$ range.
All those figures are pure guesstimates as it depends on the buyers view of course but these values
are based on how other telecom companies such as AT&T are currently valued at the stock
exchanges.
So an investor investing into one token, holds 6 years and then sells the token, could earn up to
824$. Given it took GSM 10 years to get to 100% market in this area, our 14% market penetration
after 6 years is a very pessimistic estimation. It could be easily be that we reach a lot more which
makes the returns and the value of the token a lot higher even, way over the 1000$ mark.
