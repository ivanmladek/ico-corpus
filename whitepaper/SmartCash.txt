Brief Introduction and Technical Details
SmartCash is a peer-to-peer digital currency that can be used without
having to trust a third party, which makes it possible to be your own
bank.
SmartCash is meant to be a currency and our vision is to replace
centralized fiat currencies. Our strategy is to make SmartCash as easy
to use, fast and secure as possible to build a foundation that can
support daily transactions for people everywhere.
We aim to grow our platform by supporting community and third party
projects, hiring developers, gaining merchant acceptance, and using
both grassroots and established marketing methods.
SmartCash is a coin with its own blockchain that uses Bitcoin 14 core.
The launch date was July 11, 2017 and the Coin Ticker is SMART.
SmartCash never held an ICO nor was any money raised from private
investors. SmartCash is self-funded using block rewards only.
Blockchain consensus’s uses Proof of Work based methods and new
blocks are mined using the Keccak algorithm. The average block time is
55 seconds and the Maximum Supply is 5 Billion SMART. The current
Block size is 1 MB and Adaptive Blocks will be used for capacity
scaling as needed. The block reward is calculated as follows:
143,500
Block Re war d = 5000x
(m a x.5000)
Block Height

The SmartCash Concept
Early cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, only reward miners while neglecting
other actors that play an active role in maintaining, developing and
promoting the project. SmartCash prioritizes block rewards to
additional areas that matter for ongoing success of global
cryptocurrency networks, including projects, development, outreach,
support, nodes, and price stabilization

Currently, 70% of the block reward is allocated to fund Community
Development: SmartHive Project Proposals (46%) and Hive Teams (24%).
The remaining 30% of the block reward goes towards Mining (5%),
SmartRewards (15%), and SmartNodes (10%).

SmartHive Governance and Hive Teams
The intrinsic value of SmartCash is the SmartHive governance model and
how the community can vote to fund the best projects with block rewards
stored in the SmartHive Project Treasury and administered by the
SmartHive.
The idea is that the SmartHive Governance Portal engages community
members and other 3rd parties interested in growing SmartCash into a
global worldwide currency. Everyone can create a proposal that helps
SmartCash in some way with a fee of 100 SMART. Then every SmartCash
holder also can participate in the voting process and help decide if its worth
getting funded or not by the SmartHive Project Treasury.
All users have the ability to vote; 1 SMART equals 1 vote. Proposals are
open to vote for 14 days and payments will be made in accordance
with the delivered milestones. Proposals open to vote can be found at:
vote.smartcash.cc
A major diﬀerence compared to other cryptocurrencies is that we believe core
teams can ultimately lead to ineﬃciency and centralization. In order to create
and maintain a decentralized governance structure SmartCash has Hive
Structuring Teams. These teams are in charge of vital project areas, such as
development, outreach and support and consist of people directly involved in
the project. Every Hive Team runs independently, but cooperatively resulting in
organic growth.

SmartNodes, SmartRewards and Miners
SmartNodes are servers that run a SmartCash wallet and enable the
next generation features to be added. One of the key features is
InstantPay, which enables transactions to be locked in about a second
and allows instant point-of-sale in-store and online purchases.
SmartNodes are required to have 100,000 SMART collateral, a
dedicated VPS (IPv4 address, 2GB RAM, 20GB drive), and be able to
run 24 hours a day.
SmartRewards are a price stabilization mechanism and a way to
encourage long term holding. Long term holders are a key to the
project’s success since the SmartHive proposal budget needs
SmartCash to appreciate in value in order to fund meaningful 3rd party
proposals and help grow SmartCash into a successful global
cryptocurrency.
Each individual SmartCash address holding at least 1000 SmartCash
over the period of one month, will be paid on the 25th of the next month
shortly after the new snapshot of the blockchain is taken.
To support the blockchain network we have launched three oﬃcial
SmartCash 0% fee mining pools for anyone to join free of charge.
The Mining Pools Overview can be found at: mines.smartcash.cc

SmartCard and POS Solution
Debit and credit card payments have become the dominant way for many to
carry out most, if not all, of their daily transactions. Adoption of card
payments became increasingly simple for small businesses and now quick
and aﬀordable smartphone-powered solutions have widespread adoption.
SmartCard emerged oﬀering to solve many of the problems traditional
payment systems are facing such as long settlement times, chargebacks,
and high fees. SmartCard is a blockchain-based solution that aims to
improve on the digital payment card model. Our main goals are to streamline
crypto transactions and make them practical for use in real-life payment
scenarios. At the same time we aim to drastically reduce fees and
confirmation time frames over those found in current solutions.
The SmartCard makes it possible to pay with SmartCash using a physical
card where no mobile wallet or phone internet access is required. Since
the SmartCard doesn’t use a bank or a credit card processor, transactions
are not subject to any restrictions. Merchants will have a point of sale
(POS) app, so they transmit transactions for you but can’t initiate the
payment without your permission.
For further information about how the system works and how both merchants
and customers will benefit from using the SmartCard and SmartCash POS App
please visit: smartcash.cc/smartcard/

SmartBand
The SmartBand is a partnership between Stratum, ATAR, and
SmartCash. ATAR launched a wristband which is linked to an account
where people in Brazil can deposit fiat and pay with it for their daily
needs using NFC technology built in the band at over 2.5 million
merchants.
The partnership with Stratum, an international exchange, makes it
possible to link your exchange SmartCash wallet with your SmartBand
to load the ATAR account with SmartCash. Stratum automatically
converts SmartCash to the local currency required for purchases. Once
a payment is done, you will receive a notification on your phone for
each transaction.
With over 85% of all point of sale terminals in Brazil accepting the ATAR
Band, this pioneering cooperation allows SmartCash to be accepted
broadly by merchants with no additional steps, technology, or training
required

Benefits of Accepting SmartCash for Merchants
• No processing fees
Traditional forms of digital transactions include a processing fee which is
paid to the intermediary (e.g. credit card processor). Since SmartCash is a
peer-to-peer system that uses a decentralized ledger, there is no additional
cost involved for the merchant.
• Fast transactions
Receiving payments from a customer using SmartCash takes less than
5 minutes till they show up in the wallet of the merchant. We also oﬀer an
instant payment solution by using our InstantPay feature.
• No restrictions
Transactions sent within the SmartCash ecosystem are irreversible.
Merchants can accept payments from all over the world and be sure that
they will receive the money and that it won’t be charged back for whatever
reason. Merchants have a better control of their return policies and this
process helps eliminate customer fraud.
• Customer Privacy
Because we eliminate the intermediary and transactions are irreversible, there
is no need to collect private information from your customers to accept their
payment if they are using SmartCash.
