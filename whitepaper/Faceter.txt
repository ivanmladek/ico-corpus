Executive summary

Video surveillance systems are currently the most efficient technical tool to ensure
public safety by the means of recording facts and controlling the situation at any site.
The global increase in crime, terrorist attacks and, most especially, public concern
about safety are the factors that promote the development of the global video
surveillance market. According to Markets&Markets, the industry’s turnover reached
$30.37 billion in 2016. The growth rate is seemingly unabated, as the industry is
expected to reach $75.64 billion in turnover by 2022.

The problem is something similar – most video surveillance systems are of little
use, and therefore inherently inefficient, since it is only possible to record data via
videos, and store video archives. They are therefore backward-looking and dumb in
that they cannot, and are completely unable to react to a situation when it is actually
happening in real time.
Computer vision technologies are expensive to develop and require the
additional expense of requiring substantial computing resources to run. Only
a few very expensive B2B solutions have computer vision and video content
analysis implemented as a part of their technology stack. As a consequence, their
technologies are still very early-stage compared to the possibilities offered by the
vast potential of neural networks. There are currently no products to analyze video
streams by means of objects, faces or event recognition that are remotely affordable
to consumers.
Faceter is the first decentralized surveillance system for consumers. Faceter makes
video surveillance smart, giving brains to cameras through enhanced face detection,
object detection and real-time video analysis. These features allow cameras to
understand the situation and respond to it, offering much better security to all the
customers.
Computer vision technology on the blockchain powered by a decentralized
network of miners makes the product affordable for all-sized businesses and mass
market consumers. The benefit from a mining perspective is that miners can use
the same Graphic Processing Usning (GPU’s) that they use to mine Ether*. At
Faceter’s technological core is the absolute respect for privacy, and the utilization
of the features of convolutional neural networks to split the tasks reinforces this
commitment. As a result, sensitive data is always processed in a completely trusted
environment, and all images not subject to recovery are passed to the decentralized
network. This amounts up to 80% of the total amount of calculations performed.
Faceter plans to fill this niche by offering a product with broad functionality and an
affordable price to mass consumers, such as small businesses and ordinary people.

cards (2x16Mh/s).

Faceter’s background

One of the project’s founders – Robert Pothier – came up with an idea of creating
​​
Faceter after realizing that video surveillance systems, which are supposed to
ensure security, do not actually work. At the same time, current crime rates in South
Africa, where Robert lives, create a strong demand for security systems from large
companies, individuals and small businesses. Large enterprises can afford to buy
and maintain expensive modern video surveillance systems powered by intelligent
software, whereas individual users and small businesses are deprived of this
opportunity.
Robert envisaged great potential that would come from creating a smart video
surveillance product at an affordable price which anyone could use. Thus, the idea
of Faceter
​​
was born. The product was based on the experience acquired by Robert
and his development team in their previous project: Pay.Cards. It is an open library
for the recognition of information from bank cards created under the supervision of
Vladimir Chernitsky as a CTO. The project has been very successful with the library
having been downloaded more than 25,000 times, and Pay.Cards technologies have
been applied in a variety of commercial areas around the world.

Vladimir Chernitsky supported the idea of ​​creating an intelligent system for video
surveillance and accepted the offer to become Faceter’s co-founder and CTO. In this
role, he applies his twenty years’ experience in creating high-tech software products
and his four years’ experience in research and development of neural networks
capabilities to recognize visual information.
As a professional with international business management experience, Robert
assumed the role of CEO. The project received investments from a business angel
to the amount of $1.2 million. Within one year, the project team created the first beta
version of the product and launched several pilot projects with various companies
in South Africa in order to test Faceter technologies, including an industrial
enterprise, a casino network, a network of pizzerias, and one of the largest banks
in the country.

Faceter’s background

Faceter’s Milestones
2014
Vladimir Chernitsky joined the team that was working to create a solution for scanning
bank cards using computer vision. By that time, he had already been engaged in
research and development in the field of computer vision and artificial intelligence
(deep learning) for one year. The team tested all marketable products available on
the market and found out that none of the open source libraries available at the
time made it possible to create a simple and efficient bank card scanner. Under the
supervision of the new CTO, the team developed a plan to create its own product.

2015 (Q1-Q2)
The team launches its first successful product in the field
of computer vision: Pay.Cards. An open source library
for iOS and Android platforms allows users to embed a
bank card scanner into mobile applications. The scanner
is capable of recognizing not only the card number,
but also the validity period and the card holder’s name.
According to the test results, the product is recognized
as one of the best on the market and outperforms such
competitors as cards.io and Apple Pay.

2015 (Q3-Q4)
An idea is born to apply the team’s accumulated experience to achieve a bigger
goal: to create a public security system powered by face and object recognition
technology. The team starts working on the project called "scanface".

2016
The team develops and tests a variety of neural network training algorithms and
achieves high accuracy of face recognition. These developments form the basis of
a product called Scanface (scanface.io). The created algorithms demonstrate high
results in Megaface and LFW tests.

2017
The first pilot projects to test the product in real conditions in South Africa are
launched. Representatives of these companies are satisfied with the test results and
are ready to sign contracts to use the product for commercial purposes. The team
is full of enthusiasm to make
​​
face detection and video stream analysis algorithms
available to mass users.

Faceter’s background

2017

Scanface project has been renamed to Faceter. The team develops a plan to create
a cloud service on the basis of available technologies which would be affordable for
regular users and small business. To achieve this purpose, the company plans to use
decentralized distributed computing technologies (fog computing), which allows for
a significant reduction in infrastructure and product costs.
The team decides to run a crowdfunding campaign to attract investments in order to
create a Faceter version for mass consumers.
The Faceter project team is driven by its experience of working together on related
projects and the belief that technologies for organizing public and personal security
using video surveillance will become more intelligent by 2030. Video stream
processed by computer vision will cover up to 70% of public spaces in developed
countries and up to 50% in developing countries, which will help reduce crime rates
and facilitate crime detection.

Faceter is an advanced intelligent software for
videostream analysis and facial recognition for
business,government and consumers, developed
to significantly reduce crime in society.

Modern video surveillance software allows devices to automatically perform a variety
of tasks in an automatic mode without human intervention – from simple motion
detection and counting the number of people and cars to compiling databases of
people and vehicle numbers.

Video surveillance for "smart cities"
Twenty years ago, people started installing video cameras in public places in large
cities. Today it is an indispensable element of security systems, both in private and
public areas. It is one of the components of intelligent transport systems and an
indispensable element of smart cities’ infrastructure, which is one of the fastest
growing markets.

In smart cities, CCTV is used to record violations of traffic rules, to control the
operation of municipal services, to restrict access to closed areas, as well as in
parking and toll payment systems on high-speed roads.
In 2016, in developed countries, there were about 200 CCTV cameras per 1,000
residents of large cities.

Video surveillance systems for small businesses and individual
users
The number of cameras installed in private homes, shops, restaurants, gas stations,
and offices is growing every year and so is the demand for more advanced
solutions. However, modern software for "smart" video surveillance is currently not
available to individuals and small businesses because of high costs and a lack of
development focused on this particular target audience.
According to the forecast of Market Research Future, the global market of home
CCTV cameras will grow by 11% per year from 2017 to 2023 and during this period
may reach $8 billion or 10.7% of the entire video surveillance systems market.

Transition to IP-based surveillance systems
In 2014, the IHS company completed a ten-year study which revealed that around
245 million professional CCTV cameras are used around the world. Also, an analysis
was made regarding the types of cameras used. The results showed that 20% of the
installed equipment was represented by network cameras, and only 2% of equipment
used was new digital CCTV cameras transmitting high-definition images. All other
devices used were analog video cameras.
According to Allied Market Research, analog cameras, which began to be installed
in developed countries about 20 years ago, are now being replaced by digital ones
powered by IP. The market volume of such devices is projected to increase by almost
20% per year despite the fact that their cost is constantly decreasing.

IP-based video surveillance technologies have revolutionized the industry offering
a higher level of flexibility and scalability compared to older-generation video
surveillance systems. IP cameras allow their users to use innovative technologies for
video stream analysis. According to experts from leading international companies,
such as Accenture, IHS Markit, PwC (data-driven city concept) and some others, the
demand for intelligent video surveillance systems capable of analyzing video streams
in real-time mode has grown significantly in recent years and will continue to grow.

High demand for face recognition software
The latest developments in the field of machine vision caused video surveillance
systems to reach a new level. Technologies powered by neural networks and artificial
intelligence elements allow their users to recognize faces in video streams in real-time
mode.
According to the forecast of Allied Market Research, one of the most important
factors affecting the global market for facial recognition systems is the growing
demand for "smart" software for video surveillance systems.

1

Rising demand for surveillance systems for enhancing safety and security
The major driving factor of the market was the increasing demand for advanced
security & surveillance systems in civil and government agencies to enhance safety
and security. Burgeoning data breach cases and brute force attacks have increased
the demand for advanced surveillance systems, which in turn has increased the
demand for facial recognition solutions.

2

Increasing application in physical security and intelligent signage
The significant increase in incidence of terrorist attacks on government organizations
and the commercial sector in the recent years drives the companies and governments
to implement robust physical security strategies. Moreover, this technology is
expected to witness high adoption in intelligent signage application on account of
rising concerns of security and use of marketing strategies to analyze the customers
based on their age, gender, and other facial attributes. Over a period, physical
security and intelligent signage are expected to fuel the demand of facial recognition
technology.

3

Technology advancements such as cloud-based services and 3D-based recognition
systems
Technological advancements are likely to reduce the prices of facial recognition
systems in the future. Software development kit (SDK) technology has improved the
accuracy in terms of recognizing facial features. Therefore, the improved quality of
products enhances awareness amongst users, which in turn is expected to increase
adoption of facial recognition biometrics in the future.

4

Increasing application in mobile security and drones
Increasing demand of facial recognition in smart devices, such as smartphones,
laptops, tablets, and personal digital assistants, which are used for both personal and
business purposes, presents various growth opportunities for the facial recognition
market. Moreover, burgeoning number of drones in various commercial sectors,
such as media & entertainment, inspection, and surveying, contributes to the
rising demand of facial recognition. For instance, as per the Federation Aviation
Administrator (FAA), around 30,000 drones are expected to be introduced by 2020.
Therefore, these factors are expected to provide immense opportunity for the growth
of facial recognition technology.

5

Lack of accuracy and high implementation cost of facial recognition technology
Currently, high implementation costs and low accuracy of the technology negatively
affect the growth of the market. Costs such as maintenance and middleware costs
also contribute to the implementation cost. However, few manufacturers, such as
FaceFirst, Inc., have started using efficient algorithms, such as PCA, FFT, to improve
accuracy and reduce the cost of facial recognition technology. Therefore, with the
development in technology, lack of accuracy and high implementation cost of facial
recognition technology are likely to reduce their impact during the forecast period.

Current problems in the field of video surveillance

To date, the use of CCTV systems for security purposes has not lived up to its
expectations. Such systems are mostly used for the continuous recording and storage
of video archives. Street cameras only record what happens in the street. If a crime is
committed, all that a policeman can do is watch a video, find a shot with a criminal’s
face, and send a picture of poor quality to other police offices. For example, in 2009,
while investigating 95% of murders, Scotland Yard detectives used videos recorded
by CCTV. However, this did not help the victims of those murders.
Obviously, such functionality is not sufficient to ensure high levels of security.
According to numerous studies, the installation of cameras significantly reduces the
number of crimes in parking lots (by 51%); however, in city centers and in the streets,
the situation improves by no more than 10%. In some countries, there have been no
significant changes in the criminogenic situation since the introduction of CCTV,
which makes these technologies virtually useless.
The potential of CCTV is enormous. Due to new developments in face recognition
technology and the use of an event-based security approach, CCTV can become a
truly effective tool. The highest potential for FR technology is in the niche of public
security in crowded locations.

What if a camera could be connected to intelligent software that is able
to analyze events and automatically turn on an alarm system and call the
police, firefighters or ambulance right at the time of the event?
What if a camera was able to recognize an offender's face in the offender
database long before a crime is committed?
What if the system could immediately provide investigators with a list of
all public places visited by a criminal over the last year, including the exact
dates and times?

Such features are not yet available even in sophisticated urban systems. The first pilot
projects to test automatic face recognition technologies in public security systems
were launched in 2016. Video surveillance systems with such features as reaction to
events, face recognition, comparison against databases, and other advanced features
have already begun to be built into corporate systems. Such systems, however, are
not scalable and cost a lot of money. The high cost of licenses and prohibitive IT
infrastructure costs make them unaffordable even for medium-sized companies, not
to mention small businesses and individuals.
Faceter plans to fill this niche by offering a highly functional product affordable
for mass consumers, by utilizing all the benefits of decentralized computing an
blockchain.

Faceter’s solution

5.1

System description
Faceter’s main component is a decentralized infrastructure where complex data
processing using neural networks is performed using the decentralization powers of
Fog Computing and Blockchain.
Faceter is a system that makes smart video surveillance and provides cameras with
"eyes" – face recognition, object detection and real-time video content analysis. At
the next stage, all these capabilities will be combined into a single feature: the ability
to "understand" the situation and respond to it accordingly.
The low cost of such computations makes them affordable for small businesses and
mass consumers; they can even be used in combination with the simplest video
cameras connected to the Internet.

Faceter’s Primary Features
Object and facial recognition and resultant behavioral analysis greatly
enhances the capabilities of video surveillance systems to detect potential
threats or such events as a smiling customer, a focused employee, etc. The
technology’s algorithm was proven by LFW and MegaFace test, which are the
most trusted in the industry.
Convenient applications for any computer or mobile device allow users to
access video surveillance systems from anywhere and without having to
master complex and slow interfaces.

Faceter’s solution

Fog computing — The cost of the product is significantly reduced by involving
cryptocurrency miners into a decentralized computing network to perform
recognition calculations with the added benefit of offering miners another
option to utilize their existing equipment.
Blockchain — Faceter uses all the nascent opportunities of smart contracts
to deliver flexible and transparent payment options and as well as proof-ofrecognition mechanisms to a Fog computing network. This is the way Faceter
contributes to the growth of the crypto-industry.
Machine learning — using neural networks, you can teach Faceter to react on
variations of certain events.
											
Data protection — Faceter does not process the source video stream outside
its trusted environment; only anonymized data is transferred to decentralized
networks.
					
The Faceter token is the “fuel” of a decentralized network enabling flexible,
transparent, cross-border closed-loop settlement mechanism for all
participants.

5.2

Competitive advantages
Most of the video surveillance software available on the market uses two parameters:
recording time and source. This means that the user can only see what happened
at a certain time on each of the installed cameras. Faceter greatly expands the
possibilities of working with video.

Decentralization
The utilization of leading-edge decentralization technology via fog computing and
Blockchain, Faceter is able to transform a previously fragmented and difficult to
access industry into technology that all means of potential users can leverage too
their particular advantage. The involvement of multiple mining sources, at incredibly
attractive rates, makes this an opportunity that cannot help but succeed financially,
across many different points of access.

Highly Accurate Facial Recognition
Thanks to the high-level facial recognition
technology (confirmed by LFW and MegaFace
tests), Faceter is able to:
– draw up a card file of office workers, family
members, or restaurant visitors;
– generate a report indicating who and when
was filmed by cameras;
– track each case of a particular person
appearing in a certain place and issue
specific records from the archive.

Faceter’s solution

Integration Interface
Faceter can be "taught" how to respond to certain events. For example, the system
can send SMS to parents when their child comes from school and transfer information
through the API to integrated systems. It can be a smart home management platform
that can give the microwave an instruction to automatically heat up food. In the next
two years, Faceter will also be able to support the protocols of several leading smart
home platforms and standard API callbacks. When integrated with urban services,
Faceter can be configured to perform specific actions, such as sending alerts to
911 rescue service in the event that there are any signs of violence or a crime being
prepared.

Truly Smart Surveillance
In future versions, in addition to detecting and recognizing faces, Faceter
will also be able to:

identify emotions by facial expression
and tone of voice; register cries for help
or aggressive intonations, sounds of
breaking glass or atypical noises;

identify objects of certain types
in the camera’s scope, including
weapons, money, flames determine
their characteristics, such as color,
volume, weight;

recognize text and character
sequences, such as in vehicle numbers;

"recognize" pets.

Affordability for the mass consumer
The cost of computing and storing data is one of the main expenditure items in
products powered by AI and neural networks. Faceter’s technology involves the
use of distributed decentralized computing powers: fog computing. This approach
allows to significantly reduce infrastructure costs compared to standard public cloud
computing (AWS, Microsoft Azure, etc.) in proprietary or leased data centers, which
makes Faceter’s facial recognition and video stream analysis technologies affordable
for the mass consumer.

Faceter’s solution

5.3

Application areas
Faceter has developed a product version for corporate and government customers
which can be used in many scenarios, both as a cloud service and a "boxed" solution.
The main goal of the next stage is to develop a product for mass consumers based on
decentralized computing powers (so-called "fog computing"). This technology helps
reduce infrastructure and computing costs and makes the services more affordable.

B2C
Software designed for households can be used in apartments, offices, country
houses, as well as in family shops and restaurants. Payment is made based on
a monthly or annual subscription. The rates depend on the number of cameras
used and the workload (the number of recognized faces per unit of time).
Faceter’s solution for individual users:
– increased security level;
– affordability;
– extensive applicability (integration with smart home technologies).

B2B
Software with extended functionality for enterprises can be used in factories,
warehouses, large enterprises, hotels, casinos, shopping centers, banks,
restaurant chains, etc. Thanks to the technology partnership agreements with
vendors of household, office and industrial equipment and manufacturers of
sensors and other components for smart devices, as well as organization and
production management systems, Faceter will provide the following additional
features:
Security based on video surveillance
Faceter allows users to significantly improve the performance of their security
systems thanks to the event analysis approach. This technology allows users to
detect outsiders in the territory of enterprises and offices, as well as to monitor
the safety of objects and identify fire, non-standard noise, etc.
Personnel management
Faceter can automatically keep track of the time that each employee spends
in the office and at their workplace; automatically recognize visitors and keep
a log of visits; identify cases of employees’ atypical behavior; recognize facial
emotions, tone of voice, etc.
Customer relationship management
Faceter’s analytical algorithms allow users to count the number of visitors
and identify their gender, to keep a log of visits to specific clients, to note

Faceter Whitepaper

Faceter’s solution

any particularities of their behavior (for example, their interest in certain
products), to detect queues at cash registers and notify responsible personnel
accordingly;
Integration with existing solutions and equipment
Technological partnership with vendors of software and household, office
and industrial equipment, including manufacturers of sensors and other
components related to the IoT concept.

B2G
Software for municipalities can be used to analyze video stream in the streets
and on roads, as well as in crowded places, railway stations, airports, and
strategic facilities. It can also be integrated with databases.
Faceter assumes the possibility of recognizing an offender’s face and running
it through the entire database of archival records to reveal the places recently
visited by such a person. The solution provides automated control over
compliance with norms and regulations in transport and public places, which
will increase crime detection rates and ensure higher levels of public security.

5.4

Future development
After Faceter is adopted by the market, it can be used to maintain white lists in a
variety of services; for example, on websites where employees can be hired to do
some housework. In addition to ratings and reviews, Faceter system can also store
links to a blockchain record containing biometric identification data (vector facial
recognition, voice recognition, etc.). The same method can be used to store the
records of shop visitors and to check the integrity of buyers, sellers or couriers.
If all cameras connected to Faceter are integrated with police and rescue service
databases, information about wanted criminals, missing children or people in
trouble can be instantly sent through the system to find their relatives and places of
residence. In such emergency cases, the police and special services will also be able
to access the system in order to discover the "prints" of people in video archives of
Faceter users without compromising confidential information, since the system will
only use data for which the camera owner gave their consent.

Faceter’s solution

The Internet is called the "nervous system" of
mankind through which "nerve impulses" are
transmitted in the form of huge amounts of digital
data, thus forming the collective knowledge. If we
look at humanity as a single system that recreates
the functions of a living organism, blockchain and
the collective security approach can be perceived
as one of the vital components – an immune
system defending this organism from potential
internal and external threats.

Faceter technologies

6.1

Data processing
The Faceter software complex
is designed in the form of a set
of modules each of which is executed
at different system levels and is
responsible for individual stages of the
platform operation. The language of
ML components development is C++11.
In addition, GPU acceleration is actively
used.

A server with computational capacities is required for
offline solutions whose volume depends on the number
of cameras and the frequency of people getting into
focus. For the online solution, the user is required to
log in to Faceter’s website and add RTSP, HTTP or RTMP
link to video camera. At the next stage of the product
development, cameras will be automatically connected to
ONVIF interface.

Stages of the face recognition process
1

Receiving and decoding video stream from camera;

2

6.2 Faceter Decentralized Network
Due to the rapid growth of decentralized services, including blockchain-based
services, Faceter plans to build its own computing network by means of attracting
individual owners of GPU resources, as well as to use affordable solutions, such as
SONM or Golem, instead of expensive cloud services. Thus, there will be no need to
use the expensive monopolized services of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc.
The use of miners’ resources or other idle computing power can be extremely
beneficial both for the owners of these resources and consumers. Even a rough
comparison of the cost of renting GPU servers on Amazon Web Services to the
amount of compensation paid to miners for block calculations demonstrates a huge
difference. In addition, the network complexity is adjusted every few months which
allows for the reduction of miners’ rewards, and after new consensus mechanisms are
adopted, there will be no need for GPU computing at all.

Faceter technologies

The main participants of Faceter network are the owners of GPU resources (Miners).
A smart contract will be concluded with each of these nodes. This contract will be
used to accrue compensation for the provision of computing capacity.
A decentralized environment requires special verification of the trustworthiness of
connected nodes. In order to ensure the quality of computations performed, less
productive nodes will be verifying the performance of other nodes and repeating
calculations performed. High-performance nodes are supposed to be fully loaded
with tasks, whereas less powerful ones will be given just fragments of the same tasks.
The results of the calculations will then be compared by a smart contract, and if there
are enough confirmations from participants, each of them will receive their portion of
the reward from the formed balance. If nodes responsible for the verification receive
a different hash of calculations, this will confirm a miner’s bad faith and will lead to
their disconnection and redistribution of accumulated reward among new computers.
Faceter calls this concept "Proof-of-Recognition".
The distribution of tasks for the performance and verification of work will be dealt
with by special orchestrator nodes (Video Hubs) which also act as video hubs and
obfuscators of sensitive data. Such nodes will be located in the trusted zone unlike all
other nodes working with impersonal data of no value.

6.3 Personal data protection
Users of video surveillance systems usually connect their cameras to cloud platforms.
There are dozens of such cloud applications on the market serving a lot of people and
companies (sometimes millions of them): Ivideon, Camcloud, XMEye, vMEyeSuper, etc.
All such services have access to CCTV cameras, but virtually none of them have
developed a clear policy for handling user data; oftentimes, there is no proper means
of controlling access to data.
Faceter’s modular architecture allows users to work with original video stream in
trusted environments: on camera owners’ devices, on Faceter’s servers, or in cameras
themselves, if possible. Only obfuscated (impersonal) data is used to perform tasks on
decentralized networks. In other words, such data cannot be converted to the original
format with reference to the owner.

Consumer trust is our priority. At all stages of Faceter
development, we are guided by the YOU OWN YOUR DATA
principle, giving our customers an opportunity
to fully control their personal data.

6.4 Faceter token use model
The effective operation of a decentralized network requires a flexible, transparent
and transboundary settlement mechanism for all participants. Traditional approaches
using fiat money are not viable in this particular case, since they don’t fully meet any
of these requirements.
The solution to this problem is Faceter's own token used as a basis for making
payments between consumers of intelligent video surveillance services and network
participants. Integration of the blockchain technology into Faceter platform is
planned to be executed in several stages:
Stage 1: issue of tokens on Ethereum for free sale and internal economic purposes of
the project, as well as for payment of remuneration to node owners ("miners").
Stage 2: development and launch of proprietary blockchain and possible token
migration. This step is supposed to solve the problem of decentralized task
distribution, increase the system’s speed, ensure independence from Ethereum
blockchain and reduce transaction costs within the platform.

System functioning model
Faceter’s services can be paid for with tokens or other payment tools (bank cards,
electronic wallets, cryptocurrencies). In order to ensure the normal functioning of
the latter, Faceter will implement mechanisms for the instantaneous conversion of
payments to tokens. The cost of camera maintenance is set by Faceter in USD and
may be revised on a quarterly basis.
Faceter's relations with customers and miners are regulated by a set of smart
contracts that guarantee transparency and the fulfillment of all the terms and
conditions. Below are the main points relating to the settlement process in a
decentralized network and Faceter token use:
1

Faceter forms a pool of smart contracts with miners where all the main terms and
conditions are stipulated, including leased computing power, remuneration rates,
contract duration, etc.

2

Faceter pre-transfers tokens to miners’ smart contracts for the subsequent payment
of leased services using the system’s reserve pool.

3

Service users submit applications to connect their CCTV cameras and make payments
using their preferred payment methods. If payment is made without using FACE
tokens, instant conversion to tokens will be performed.

4

Smart contracts are also created for customers. These smart contracts stipulate
the parameters of purchased services and are used for receiving payments made in
tokens.

Faceter Whitepaper

30

Faceter technologies

6.

5

Customer funds his account with FACE tokens to cover miner rewards.

6

The customer smart contract distributes tokens. The main part of tokens is returned to
the system’s reserve pool (~60%), a portion goes to Faceter (~20%) as compensation
for video obfuscation costs and service support.

7

The transaction identifier obtained through burning is an access key to the service. It
is then broadcast along with all tasks in the decentralized network and can be verified
by each participant.

8

The client connects their cameras to the service and starts transmitting video
stream. Faceter carries out decoding and obfuscation of all images and passes
them to miners for in-depth analysis and the selection of unique vectors of detected
objects. Obfuscation is necessary to protect sensitive data. To achieve this goal, the
features of convolutional neural networks are used where, after two convolutions,
the image is irreversibly distorted and can be safely transferred to other nodes for
subsequent convolutions. The whole process of face recognition includes more than
40 convolutions.

9
10

11

For each miner, Faceter randomly assigns three other miners who perform the
validation of calculations results (re-processing of individual fragments).
Once a day, miners pass hashes of processing results to a smart contract. The same
action is performed by nodes responsible for validation, following which hashes are
reconciled. If they do not coincide, this indicates bad faith of one of the miners, in
which case their remuneration is automatically frozen thus initiating an arbitration
procedure.
Miners independently request payment of fees from their smart contract taking into
account the escrow period which takes from 1 to 14 days. During this period funds
are held. The duration of the escrow period depends on the miner’s ranking and may
decrease in the process of work.

Business model

Faceter’s business model includes multiple ways of income generation depending on
the results of the crowdfunding campaign (see paragraph 9). Below are listed the key
mechanisms of project monetization.
Fees for processing video
Consumers will be offered a service at $9.99 per month per camera,
whereas Faceter will deduct its own commission before giving the task to
miners to process the video stream.
Contracts in B2B and B2G sectors
Large corporations and state enterprises are highly interested in such
products and are ready to enter into long-term contracts with a monthly
fee for each connected camera.
Faceter hardware solutions
Priority is given to close cooperation with suppliers of video surveillance
equipment. It is also planned to develop proprietary and co-branded video
cameras capable of performing primary video stream processing and its
obfuscation on embedded chips optimized for Faceter algorithms.
Marketing services
When the global infrastructure of Faceter becomes industry standard,
camera owners will be able to use their data in global marketing research
and get paid with tokens.

Scenarios for the use of raised funds
Funds received through the crowdfunding campaign will be used in accordance
with the Roadmap. At the same time, the number of features implemented on the
platform will depend on the amount of funds raised. The implementation of all the
declared features will be possible if the project collects the maximum amount of
funds (Hard Cap). Faceter should be considered as an R&D project in the field of the
latest (bleeding-edge) technologies. The team confirms the plans declared; however,
their implementation depends on the results of the crowdfunding campaign. The
project’s business and financial model provides for the proportional demand for the
final product with some extra functions. Below is a table with three possible scenarios
