EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Objective
PotCoin was the first cannabis related blockchain currency and intends to remain a leader in the space.

Moving

forward PotCoin will be focused on marketing, creating business partnerships and developing merchant relations.
The development team will also explore the possibilities of smart contracts, and how this may benefit merchants
and consumers in the legal cannabis industry. PotCoin has the intention of adopting and taking advantage of the
continuously evolving developments and technologies in the blockchain space. We are also looking at various
methods to incentivize PotCoin users and merchants to adopt and use PotCoin.

Goals
With daily developments and the constant evolution of new blockchain technologies, PotCoin intends stay up to
date with current security, consensus and technological developments. We aim to increase adoption and
acceptance of PotCoin with the use of rewards, incentives and exciting new services.

Solution
In order to take advantage of new technologies and potential security advantages PotCoin will explore the
possibility of migrating to the bitcoin or potentially the ethereum blockchain. Our future development plans involve
smart contracts, cannabis tracking solutions for merchants, point of sale technology and tokenization of seeds,
strains and more. In order to best accomplish this, migration to a secure network that will allow for blockchain 2.0
applications is the best and most logical evolution for PotCoin. This will allow for the creation of a future
decentralized autonomous organization (D.A.O.) to implement voting, fund raising an development for PotCoin and
the PotCoin community.

Project Outline
PotCoin will explore the possible benefits leveraging the security and features of the Ethereum Decentralized
Network as well as other platforms such as Counterparty & Rootstock. We strongly believe that these next level
blockchain platforms is precisely what is needed for the PotCoin community to grow. The Ethereum Virtual
Machine allows for the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) which will allow for community
voting, decentralized development, the creation and implementation of blockchain 2.0 technology and smart
contracts. There are already are numerous ambitious projects being built on the Ethereum Platform. PotCoin
having the ambition and mission to economize the legal cannabis industry will explore the use of the Ethereum
Network or a equivalent technology on the bitcoin network to allow PotCoin to leverage the security and
development benefits to the cannabis industry, it’s users and merchants.

PotCoin Seed Bank
What is the PotCoin Seed Bank?
The PotCoin Seed Bank is a simple and easy way to turn your PotCoins into real cannabis seeds.
Simply join The PotCoin Seed Bank, Stake your PotCoins and you will generate “SEED” tokens
based on the number of seeds available in the bank. Each SEED token is redeemable for 1
cannabis seed from the PotCoin Seed Bank at any time and will be shipped free of charge.
How do I turn my PotCoins into cannabis seeds?
The PotCoin Seed Bank will launch on April 20th, 2016 and allows PotCoin holders to generate
cannabis seeds based on their PotCoin holdings. Simply use the application form and follow the
simple steps here:http://www.potcoin.com/seed-bank/
It is important to note you remain in control of your PotCoins at all times and you can opt out of the
Seed Bank at anytime.
How does this work?
PotCoin has partnered with leading cannabis seed producers to offer this amazing opportunity to
the PotCoin community and cannabis enthusiasts. PotCoin holders will be eligible for generated
seeds based on their holdings. The more PotCoins you stake the more seeds you earn.
How many seeds can I get?
There is currently no limit to your contribution on the PotCoin Seed Bank, however as popularity grows
this may change. For each 60day period the seed bank will display the total number of seeds to be split
among it’s members.

POTCOIN
How do I join?
When you apply to the PotCoin Seed Bank you must submit a PotCoin address that contains PotCoins.
Once your application is submitted you will be required to send a small transaction (+/-0.042POT) from
your submitted PotCoin address to prove you control that account. You will receive a confirmation email
and your PotCoin address will be added to the Seed Bank. You will now generate SEED tokens and will
be sent cannabis seeds at your request.
Are there requirements?
Yes! Anyone can join the PotCoin Seed Bank, however to be sent the cannabis seed, you must live in
one of the participating geolocations listed. This is why we’ve chosen to distribute SEED tokens which
can be exchanged and redeemed for cannabis seeds at anytime. Once a PotCoin address is accepted
into the Seed Bank the coins must be staking at that address for 30days to generate seeds. The
amount of seeds generated depends on the total number of Seed Bank Members. Here’s a distribution
example of SEED tokens for a 30day period.

What is the PotCoin Reward Program?
The PotCoin Reward Program will allows merchants and businesses to reward and incentivize their
current clients to use and familiarize themselves with PotCoin by distributing FREE PotCoins with
every purchase made.
Who, When & Where?
The PotCoin Development Team is exploring partnerships with existing businesses in targeted
geographic locations which are best suited for PotCoin. These merchants will receive FREE
PotCoins and redeemable coupons codes they can distribute to existing customers. PotCoins that
will be given to merchants will be taken from the Development Fund which can be seen here:

Community contributions can be made to the address above and all funds will be distributed as
Merchants Rewards. PotCoin is looking to partner with a limited number of merchants in one city to
maximize the impact of marketing and the rewards program. There will most likely be 3 levels of
rewards for merchants based on their volume of customers.

PotCoin Smart
How?
We strongly believe in the creation of a PotCoin Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) which will allow for
community voting, decentralized development, the creation and implementation of blockchain 2.0 technology and
smart contracts. There are already are numerous ambitious projects being built on the Ethereum Platform.
PotCoin having the ambition and mission to economize the legal cannabis industry will use these explore the most
secure way to transition to a PotCoin Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

Ethereum?
The Ethereum Network is based on blockchain technology but is seen as a Virtual
Super Computer with a much wider scope and many more possibilities. Bitcoin is
still the most resilient and tested network however, the Ethereum Virtual Machine
could eventually allow for greater development possibilities for PotCoin. We also
feel that the growth, scaling and development possibilities permitted by the
Ethereum platform offer significant advantages. With this being said there are still
numerous risks and unknowns associated with a new technology. The Ethereum
Network is immature but it is experiencing daily growth. The PotCoin
development team is closely monitoring network growth as this new technology
has the potential to fulfill the many goals and aspirations of blockchain technology.

Counterparty?
The Counterparty platform has been tested and is proven in
terms of security, ease of use and development however there
are limitations which are overcome by the Ethereum platform.
There are currently many projects that leverage the security of
the bitcoin network via the Counterparty protocol. STORJ,
GEMZ, BCY, FLDC and many more projects use the
Counterparty Platform. These projects are limited to bitcoins
10minute confirmation time and face the current scaling
challenges of the network.
There are also projects like
Rootstock which is trying to implement all the advantages of Ethereum on the bitcoin network may prove to be the
best solution for the PotCoin community but it is still in the development stage.
