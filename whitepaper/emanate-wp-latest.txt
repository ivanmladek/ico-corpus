Our entire artistic world is full of works inspired by and derived from others.
Without derivative works and collaboration, the artistic world would be only a
fraction of what it is today.
The laws and restrictions in this area are constantly evolving and Emanate aims
to be a key contributor to progressing workable standards that promote fairness
and openness in the blockchain enabled world.
Emanate will strive to adhere to standards and respect existing jurisdiction
laws. This may mean restricting or blocking some platform features to users in
some geographies.
Emanates aims to free artists from the restrictions that currently inhibit their
creativity and market access, whilst fairly rewarding the rightful owners of
original and derivative music works.
Our team is working with global experts to evolve the technologies and
processes that promote a vibrant, open, fair and economically sustainable
music industry for all participants and provide a better experience for fans and
listeners.

ABSTR ACT

Emanate is an audio exchange protocol designed to enable producers,
distributors and influencers in the music industry ecosystem to connect
via blockchain based smart-contracts. The EMANATE (EMT) token is the
cryptographic asset that will be sold in the early stages of the Emanate
maturation journey. The tokens should be bought by those who wish to claim
a position in the Emanate ecosystem because they believe in a decentralised
future for the music industry.
If the Internet were designed today it would look more like a distributed
blockchain network than a centralised server based system(1). Similarly in the
music industry today, the road to monetising music can be highly centralised.
Neither serves the contemporary 21st century music technology needs or the
needs of the audiences.(2)
Many problems exist for artists, remixers, DJs and labels; the payment lag for
creative works, the contractual complexities associated with collaborations,
difficulty licensing small bits of audio and the current music industry financial
processes. These, and the legacy structures that exist impede progress and
integration with today’s technological advancements.
With Emanate, artists, DJs and music influencers may find a way to share
more output with each other and their fans, earning income proportionate to
their contribution, whilst increasing their influence and notoriety. Emanate
could help listeners and fans discover new music, connecting them to artists
in previously unimaginable ways, enabling them to contribute directly to their
favourite artist’s success.
We recognise the music ecosystem consists of more than just artists and
listeners. Behind the success of many great tracks are samplers and audio pack
makers; tastemakers and influencers; labels and promoters. We believe it’s
critical that all contributors are rewarded fairly, whilst also providing incentives

for audiences and supporters.
Emanate will be introduced to the music industry, by building dApps on our own
Audio Exchange Protocol, in three main phases which align to our technology
development, token economy maturation and legal environment:
1.

Smart collaborations
Emanate smart collaborations will enable artists to quickly exchange files,
projects and simple contracts to protect themselves in their day-to-day
collaboration workflow. In our commercial release smart-collaborations
with be seamlessly integrated with various aspects of the Emanate
platform and this forms the fundamental basis of the Audio Exchange
Protocol.
In earlier stages, the dApp will resemble a file sharing service with the
added protection of a blockchain-back smart-collaboration. In stage one
Emanate will also launch a basic streaming function in order to give artists
a home for their music.

2.

Collaborative music marketplace
The second dApp to be built by the team, is a music streaming and
collaboration marketplace. This will open new revenue generation
streams for artists and will contribute heavily to the token distribution
phase of token economy. Artists will exchange their work in an open and
decentralised market for tracks, stems, vocals, remixes and DJ mixes.

3.

Full Audio Exchange Protocol
A two-way audio access and monetisation protocol for artist-listener
playback, 3rd party integrations and data writing and reading. The first
full release of the Audio Exchange Protocol will see the technology become
available for developers to integrate audio into their projects and could see
many new DApps built into the ecosystem.

Emanate puts artists first and is focused on building a future-proof blockchainera platform for musicians. We believe improving the creation process by
enabling effective sharing and collaboration is the key to truly transforming
the sounds of tomorrow. More effective music creation produces better music,
which ultimately delivers a better experience for listeners.
Collaboration, sharing, remixing, posting and playlisting is encouraged and
rewarded with tokens.
The threat of a fine for music piracy has not worked (11). The solution is a
monetary reward for the behaviour that adds value to the system.

BAC KG RO U N D

Emanate is a concept that was conceived by its founders many years ago. We
imagined a real-time audio marketplace where trending songs and remixes
that have just been released automatically appeared in the playlists of top
DJs in real-time as the audiences reacted to the emotion purveyed by the
producers. We believed that music influencers should be able to monetise their
playlists and blogs, and those who contribute to the community should pay less
for their music than passive listeners.
The Emanate team members have decades of experience in their respective
fields, and the concept described above resurfaced with the proliferation
of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. We quickly realised that the
industry needed not just an application, but a full ecosystem that could one
day serve as an alternative music industry, built on a decentralised network.
We began writing, designing, networking and honing the ideas that have
gone into creating Emanate. While several blockchain music projects had
experimented with cryptographic payment for music, no ultimate proof of
concept had yet been developed.
In December 2017, a leading blockchain music app on steemit had more than
6000 artists and over 130,000 visits per month paying more than $120,000 USD
to artists per month. These numbers are not huge in the scale of the industry,
but they are enough to prove the potential of the space.
Other platforms address monetisation for independent musicians and
hobbyists, however the innovative features of the Emanate platform will extend
this much further and bring it to the professional music industry. Coupled with
a structured marketing and advertising plan, influential industry connections
and a robust commercial grade product roadmap, Emanate should take
blockchain music to the next level.

S O W H AT’ S T H E P RO B L E M ?
Legal, publishing and payment systems within the music industry only function
well for the artists and businesses at the very top, leaving the majority of
artists and businesses in unsustainable situations.
The core music industry processes have not evolved much from a time when
creating professional music was highly specialised, resource intensive,
expensive, slow and therefore only available to the well-financed and industry
elite and accessed via restrictive long-standing recording deals. Centralised
legacy structures, traditional contractual workflows, legals and revenue
collection mechanisms have not adapted to the digital age.
The industry’s inability to adapt led to widespread piracy that threatened the
sector’s viability in the early 2000s which did not serve anyone. Listeners were
disadvantage through poor quality content, lack of choice and access to an
ultimately dysfunctional industry where the artists suffered most.
The effect of digital disruption has seen massive sector consolidation and the
creation of behemoth structures that achieve marginal profitability through
the production of formulaic music, broadcast to the public via a collection of
small selection mainstream delivery channels.
The music industry’s biggest innovation in the last 10 years has been the
emergence of digital streaming services. Despite the billions of dollars invested
and massive audience adoption, these companies are all haemorrhaging
resources, and losses accelerate with user uptake. Whilst the streaming services
have turned the tide on industry revenue decline, there remains a far greater
fundamental problem.

E M A N AT E ’ S B LO C KC H A I N S O LU T I O N S
Incremental adoption of a new, decentralised music technology, processes and
economy
In order for the industry to truly flourish, artistry must be put back at the centre
and artists must be rewarded for their creativity, and the friction and contractual
complexity of rights management and payment must be automated for the
benefit of all participants. Artists should be paid first for use of their works, the
friction and cost to get music to listeners must be removed, transparent and
accurate usage information made available to all parties, and finally payment to
the contracted terms must be immediate.
When a listener enjoys a song, that is an exchange of value, which must be
represented by the exchange of another value carrying an asset. While Spotify
and other do this well, they are only fixing a small part of the bigger problem.
The concepts behind Emanate were born from the realisation of the power of
blockchain technology to enable effective collaboration between artists, and
what cryptocurrency can do for micropayments between listeners and artists. We
started work designing a set of collaboration and monetisation tools that would
enable a hotbed of collaboration and rapid monetisation directly with listeners.
We very quickly realised this only worked in a direct artist-to-listener relationship
that requires complete industry disruption. We believe this is neither realistic nor
desirable as most industry participants and stakeholders play an important and
valuable role.
Our vision has crystallised; we want to build a technology platform that enables
the music industry, puts artists and listeners at the centre, embraces and
recognises all players that add value along the journey. We wish to move towards
a Decentralised Autonomous Community (DAC) that can succeed at various
scales via adoption by industry participants who believe there is a better way.
The old world can still exist, however Emanate will spawn a faster, more agile
and efficient music industry that embraces creativity, accelerating growth. This
framework will tear down barriers to entry, broaden the musical middle-class and
flatten the earning bell curve between amateur musicians and global superstars.

INTRODUCTION
TO E M A N AT E
It is well documented that blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies are
set to revolutionise the music industry (10). There are some innovative projects
underway, however Emanate is unique in that it:
•

Is the only blockchain project revolutionising the core workflow of music
production and collaboration, and improving distribution and listenability in
the process.

•

Has potential to form an integral part of the new blockchain-enabled music
ecosystem.

•

Can connect every music producer in the world, enabling them to
collaborate instantly and effortlessly. Smart-collaborations will mean
their work can be published with fair and agreed royalty share, instantly
monetised by an audience of avid listeners.

Emanate is designed to power a world where artists are free to create,
collaborate and share without the confines and pressure of formal contracts,
publishing and distribution.
Emanate will make every attempt to work with existing music projects to
improve the current constructs of the music industry, providing a new backbone
and starting a revolution to change things for the better, forever.

PRODUCTION?
Many projects have proposed blockchain to recognise artists’ ownership
rights over sounds tied to smart-contracts. In the world of Emanate, you will
discover a new way of working, coined ‘smart-collaborations’ that enable
artists to work together from anywhere in the world, and publish their work
for fair and instant monetisation.
The EMANATE (EMT) cryptocurrency payment system provides the means
for instant payment, and the incentive to keep newly created music on the
platform. Since existing platforms, such as soundcloud™, have little to no
monetisation opportunity, there is less desire for uploaders to adhere to
piracy and copyright guidelines and policies. Sounds that are stolen will not
be supported for monetisation on Emanate and those who attempt to do so
risk their reputation and ultimately losing their Emanate account. Previous
attempts by the music industry to clamp down on piracy have only forced
illegal music sharing into new parts of the internet.

OBJECTIVES
The overall objective of Emanate is to revolutionise music collaboration globally
and create a middle-class for musicians. Emanate doesn’t aim to take down
the music industry, it aims to enable and improve every part of it. (12).
All participants in the industry have a role, from the listeners, the bedroom
producers, DJs, remixers, to the labels, promoters, and clubs. And now more
than ever, software developers in the technology world need to be able to do
new things with audio that do not always fit within the legacy processes of
yesterday’s industry. Emanate aims to provide a better mechanism for artists
to make new music and form fundamental agreements about ownership, which
make it easier for human and non-human users to consume audio.

TEAM
Blockchain Music Pty Ltd has assembled a start-up cast for Emanate with
deep and diverse skills in the areas of blockchain development, cryptocurrency
economics, marketing, music industry business, music production and
performance, software production and technology innovation. Our core team
of founders have 38 years of software development experience, 40 years music
production experience and 36 years business management experience. To find

POSITIONING
Emanate’s Audio Exchange Protocol is not something that otherwise exists, and
it has no direct competition. Think of it as the audio-layer of the internet. The
one place where a piece of audio can be placed for use on any platform and
payment for every play. While this is hard to visualise, our dApps have more
tangible characteristics.
The Emanate Live collaboration and streaming platform is a complementary
component of the music industry as it stands today. If it had to be compared to
existing players, it is:
•

Like Soundcloud, but with micropayment monetisation similar to Steemit

•

Like Splice but more open and with the power of crypto/blockchain enabling
micro transactions and a song-creation data layer

•

Think Soundcloud + Splice, on the blockchain

For music producers, Emanate Live is positioned as the go-to platform for
musical inspiration and collaboration. It’s a new backbone for the production
workflow.
For fans and listeners, Emanate Live is positioned as the very best place to hear
the latest new sounds, to discover the biggest new tracks first, and to earn
cryptocurrency in exchange for musical influence and following.
Why should passive listeners pay the same for their premium subscriptions
as those who actively contribute to the community via playlists and shares?
Emanate addresses this issue.

The EMANATE (EMT) token economy has been one of the primary focuses
on developing the Emanate ecosystem. The EMANATE (EMT) token is central
to the utility and ongoing governance of the platform. Emanate have and
continue to work closely with Actuaries and Lawyers to design our token
economy to be beneficial to token holders at all stages.
The purchase of EMANATE (EMT) tokens is considered a to be made as an
intention to participate in the future Emanate ecosystem. The tokens and
token-economics are designed to also make EMANATE (EMT) tokens useful to
the owner, giving token holders access to platform features, and requiring the
use of EMANATE (EMT) for certain types of transactions.
EMANATE (EMT) may be required for the following functions:
•

Artists to publish music for monetisation

•

For listeners to consume audio

•

Network node holders will likely be required to power the network; they
will need to stake EMANATE (EMT) tokens and may also receive tokens as
payment in return for the node operation services.

The aim of the EMANATE (EMT) token is not only to utilise the services within
the network but as an incentive mechanism to the broader community to
provide services to the Emanate ecosystem and ultimately creating a more
valuable and beneficial platform for all. This could take the form of rewards
paid in return for the service of running an Emanate network node or rewards
paid for other Emanate ecosystem services.

SALE PHASES
Token sale distribution will be completed in three phases:
•

Private strategic round (30 million EMT)

•

Public crowd sale (83 million EMT)

From Q4 2018, EMANATE (EMT) tokens can be acquired via a capped presale at various different rates and lockup periods. These rates and lockups
represent the amount of tokens that would be required to perform different
roles on the Emanate network. With a hard cap of 83 million tokens in the
sale phase, it is the first chance for the public to buy Emanate tokens and it
designed to let artists, institutions, music lovers and early adopters secure an
EMANATE (EMT) holding as early as possible.
All tokens may be locked after the end of the crowdsale period until the
tokens are listed. They will be unlocked before a major exchange listing unless
another vesting agreement is in place with an individual holder. Emanate
reserves the right to delay this unlocking period due to the constantly
changing exchange landscape. Token minting will be completed and tokens
will be unlocked as soon as possible after the crowdsale but at a time deemed
suitable by the team.
The total hard-cap for token-sales has been reduced from approximately
$12 million USD to $7 million USD. The Emanate team have placed a soft-cap
of $5 million USD. If this soft-cap is not met, the project will continue but
unsold tokens will fall into an Emanate Platform Sustainability fund which is
explained further below. Additionally, the roadmap will be revised to reflect
the smaller amount of resources.
It should be noted that any of this detail is open to change, the Emanate team
is working on significant partnerships that could increase the scope of the
project and lead to a massive initial user-base. The team reserves the right
to raise the price of the EMANATE (EMT) token in the main sale before the
main sale commencement. These additional funds will be allocated towards
making the partner platform, crypto-ready for integration with the Emanate
ecosystem.

The sustainability fund is a pool of unsold assets that is set aside for future
funding and platform development opportunities. The Sustainability Fund has
the following properties:
•

All unsold tokensale pools will be sent to the fund.

•

The Sustainability Fund tokens will be locked for 6 months, meaning they
will not be counted in the circulating supply.

•

After 6 months 25% of the pool will unlock every 6 months and made
available as below:

These funds can be used in the following ways:
•

Tokens can be bought by large industry investors and partners, if agreed
by the DAC and with a forced vesting period

•

The community can pass proposals and vote for fund expenditure on
platform features or other expenditure.

•

3rd party developers may apply for token allocation to help fund
community projects.

•

Charitable music organisations may also apply.

All proposals for the use of funds from the Sustainability Fund will be passed
via the Emanate DAC.

A TWO TOKEN ECONOMY
Emanate are researching the legal and technical viability of a two-token
economic model to solve liquidity and volatility issues that currently exist in
many cryptocurrency ecosystems. In this hypothetical scenario, the two tokens
are EMANATE (EMT), used to stake a place in the ecosystem, and ‘MNX’, a
stable token designed for platform liquidity and stability only.
‘MNX’ would allow artists to interact and listeners to stream music on the
Emanate platform. Every time plays occur, ‘MNX’ would be distributed
accordingly. Artists, record labels, remixers could sell ‘MNX’ internally into a
selection of other tokens including EMANATE (EMT) itself.
In this scenario, EMANATE (EMT) would be a token staked to provide services to
the Emanate ecosystem. EMANATE (EMT) stakers could benefit by earning MNX
from a network fee built into every smart contract but ONLY if they provide

services to the network.
To protect MNX from market volatility, it would purely internal. Meaning no
user would hold their private key and the tokens will never be listed.
By separating the staking coin and liquid MNX tokens, we believe we have
solved a fundamental flaw in other crypto economies - volatility. This allows
an artist to freely create whilst also ensuring a better user experience for the
passive listener. The details of this hypothetical two token economy and mintand-burn control mechanism will be detailed on the Emanate medium page
and will be a point of ongoing discussion and exploration.
EMANATE (EMT) tokens should not be purchased with any expectation that
this two-token model could be adopted as this is dependent on regulation.

MARKETING

Emanate is in the position where music is both the product and medium, and
that offers exciting promotion and marketing communication opportunities. A
full marketing plan is being developed and will be released after the crowdsale.
The strategies below outline some of the key marketing concepts the Emanate
team has conceived to support a successful entry:

M U S I C I A N S AT T H E C O R E
Emanate is designed for artists, DJs and music influencers. By building an
effective collaboration environment to effortlessly create and share new music,
we are organically creating a compelling destination that offers listeners the
latest and greatest new music.

PA RT N E R S H I P S
A number of major partnerships are in negotiation, these partnerships could
lead to an immediate audience acquisition in the hundreds of thousands and a
revenue stream much earlier than would otherwise be possible.

MARKETING

NICHE IN THE BEGINNING
Music is an immensely powerful force, however music as a ‘thing’ is difficult to
market effectively without multi-million dollar branding campaigns, due to the
vast differences between the tastes and demographics of the listeners across
various genres. Emanate have chosen to initially target the electronic, hip
hop and computer-made music segments, as they are the most culturally and
technologically ready early adopters.
Over the past two decades this form of music has integrated into pop and
spread across the globe, starting in the European underground scene, spreading
to Australia, dominating the United States music scene and now proliferating
throughout Asia.
The merging of electronic and hip-hop genres has moved computer-based
music production into the listener, amateur and professional musician
mainstream.
In addition to the marketability of more refined genres, the dynamic between
producers, vocalists, remixers and DJs is an ideal-use case to prove the
Emanate concept and the platform design and construction.
We fully intend to create something for all musicians and genres, electronica
and hip hop is simply where we plan to start.

A C C O U N T G I V E AWAY
When the Emanate platform is ready for beta launch, and hosts hundreds
of thousands of unique tracks, Emanate intends to give away 1 million free
trial accounts that will be pre-loaded with a token balance. This could propel
Emanate from early adoption to mass awareness in a matter of months. We are
considering the inclusion of EOS token holders into this drop.

REFERRAL CODES
Early adopters will be given referral codes for inviting friends to the platform
and rewards in exchange for new sign-ups that lead to active use.

REMIX AND PRODUCTION COMPE TITIONS
To attract more artists to the platform, regular production prize based
competition events (like hackathons) will be hosted by Emanate in partnership
with prominent artists and industry sponsors.

AUDIENCES
Emanate is designed for Generation Z: The 2 Billion humans who have been
tasked with changing the world for the better. They grew up connected via the
internet, with an ethos and a belief in the power of ‘we’ over ‘me’.(2)

ADDRESSABLE MARKET
Emanate are initially targeting the largest, most technologically and culturally
ready market segments for the evolution of the music industry. We will grow
and mature together, and through this generation Emanate will be the vehicle
to transform the way music is created, spawning new models and markets,
creating entrepreneurs and for the first time ever, building a sustainable music
middle class.
Emanate have focused on the power multiplier of propensity for adoption and
use with an offering aimed squarely at the largest global population group.
Generation Z represent 26% of the population but 48% of media audiences(25)
and are a powerful force in technology adoption to forge social change,
particularly in areas where their passions lie, and like earlier generations, music
is a clear passion for this group.
Finally and critically this bubble generation are just now moving into their
productive earning years, poverty levels are decreasing, along with their access
to the technologies necessary to listen, create and share music.
Generation Z are DIY and more community oriented than their predecessors
and are quick to adapt technology to their purposes and benefit. The
Emanate capability is perfectly positioned, where timing meets opportunity,
generational readiness meets a technology whose time has come, in an area of
common passion.

THE BASE CASE
Let’s assume very conservatively 25% of the target segment has access to the
technology required to use Emanate, then assume half of those are music
lovers and half again see themselves as influencers.
•

Geography - Global - Asia, Pacific, Europe, Americas

•

People who pay to stream music ~ 600 Million

•

Music influencers ~ 8 million

•

Independent artists ~ 5 million

Emanate aims to acquire 10% of the audiences above by 2021, and our capacity
to do this will be validated with the launch of our MVP this year.

A DV E RT I S I N G A N D P R
Emanate is assembling a team of artists, advisors and ambassadors who
collectively have over 3 million social media and music account followers.
We intend to rapidly increase this reach to over 10 million through additional
ambassador outreach. Our ambassador team will work closely with Emanate
to assist us develop and showcase our capabilities. Our referral marketing
program for early-birds will help on-board 1 million users who will receive a
complimentary token allocation to start their journey.
The platform will launch with remix and production competitions from high
profile artists.
The Emanate marketing team will produce video content showing the end-toend track creation process using our platform, and we will also showcase live
demonstrations before the Beta platform release.
An allocation of the crowdsale funding will go towards traditional Public
Relations, Digital Advertising, Search Engine Optimization/Search Engine
Marketing, Events and related activities.

M O N E T I S AT I O N / R E V E N U E
The Emanate revenue model and token economy has three main stages.
Combining traditional business models and crypto-economics is highly complex
and as such the information below is open to change:

#1 - Smart - collaborations

#2 -Emanate Live

#3 -Emanate AEP

STAG E 1 : TO K E N D I ST R I B U T I O N
Included in the token distribution stage is the tokensale itself, any token
airdrops and the early stages of the platform development during which artists
will be rewarded via MNX that can be swapped for EMANATE (EMT).payments

for plays, collaborations and even profile creation. This is designed as a way to
reward early adopters without requiring credit card subscriptions to be paid to
developing platform.

STAG E 2 : G RO W T H
During the growth stage, artists will continue to be rewarded with MNX
payments from the platform pool, and distributed according to activity and
EMANATE (EMT) holdings.

STAG E 3 : M AT U R I T Y
In maturity it is expected that the platform will reach a critical mass of users
and the ecosystem will be able to support fair payments without the need of
the supplementary platform pool payments.
The revenue model for Emanate is derived from the following features:
•

Multi-tier subscription based accounts for all users

•

Transaction fees (resulting in a % margin of certain transactions)

•

Broadcast licences and commercial partnerships

T W O - WAY M A R K E T P L A C E

MARKETING

Production tools
Through partnerships with sample and loop makers, Emanate will be populated
with ready-to-use sounds for music producers.
Stems and samples
Artists will be encouraged to upload stems, loops and samples from their backcatalogues, and to monetise the scraps of incomplete work that may have
never earned any revenue.
Back-catalogue
All artists approved for official Emanate status will be invited to upload their
back catalogue free of charge.
Influence
By partnering with prominent musicians, we believe up-and-comers and
amateur producers will follow.

DEMAND
Partnerships with music software companies
Encouraging artists to work on the platform will drive organic growth. Emanate
provides a valuable and compelling new revenue stream for artists/creators and
rights owners that will be difficult to ignore.
The rate at which EMANATE (EMT) is earned, scales with the size of the
community and the value of the currency. As the listener base grows, artists
will earn EMANATE (EMT) at a lower rate from our platform fund pool.
With artists of all genres and skills drawn to the platform, Emanate could
become the best place to find new music.

EMT USE CASES

1 million listener accounts will be seeded when the first production version of
the platform is released. Each account will receive a free balance of EMANATE
(EMT) platform tokens.

USE C A SE: MUSIC PRODUCER
I’m a music producer working with a number of artists and vocalists, and I
need to send and receive a lot of files and often the royalties and naming
rights contractual discussion continues as I do my work. I chose to send all of
my files via the AEP protocol, with simple smart-contracts attached so that
the recipient knows what they are agreeing too in using my work and the
transaction is recorded on the blockchain.

U S E C A S E : R A D I O STAT I O N
I run an electronic music radio station in Korea. I use Emanate to find new
artists and when I find someone promising I survey my audience on Facebook
to see if they like it. Facebook uses the Emanate AEP to stream music when it is
ready to debut on air. I also connect my airplay cue to the AEP. The API can see
I’m a broadcaster and the rate I charge increases due to my need for a public
broadcasting license for the material.

U S E C A S E: I N D E P E N D E N T A RT I ST
I use Emanate to publish all of my works. Because I have a profile page and an
independent record label on Emanate, my works are automatically stored via
the generic AEP configuration. This means I can publish my work to Spotify™,
iTunes™, soundcloud™ and to other in-venue broadcasters*. I can even get radio
play! This way I get paid as soon as my music is played without waiting months
for royalties.
* Please note that the above platform integrations do not exist yet and are not
yet in negotiation

MARKETING

USE C A SE: ARCHIVED WORK S
I run a government-funded indigenous language archive, with critical storage
responsibility for over 50 years of historical language audio recordings. I
choose to publish the recordings via the Emanate AEP protocol stored on the
distributed IPFS file server network. This removes my single point of failure and
makes all of the works available provided the end agent has been approved to
access these works and has the appropriate credentials.

USE CASE: VR MUSIC EXPERIENCE
I run a Virtual Reality nightclub called ‘Destination X’. In my club I have resident
DJs and special events. All of my audio recordings from the live sets are stored
in the Emanate AEP so they can be further monetised in the outside world.

USE CASE: APP DEVELOPER
I am building a fitness app that syncs music to the users’ heart rate and mood.
I am working with the Emanate protocol to ensure I have a constant supply
of new music, categorised with the meta-data I need for my application to
function. My application server has an Emanate account which pays the
originator as audio is consumed by my users.

RISKS/CHALLENGES

LEGAL USE OF AUDIO
Emanate is focused initially on new music, with no existing license agreements.
The uploader will accept that the audio they are sharing fulfils this requirement
and accepts responsibility for the outcomes.
Piracy is deterred with strict governance and enforced with zero-tolerance.
Over the past decade, most attempts at music licensing protection have
failed or resulted in overly restricted playback environments due to little or
no incentive for users to abide by the guidelines provided. Emanate flips this
problem on its head by rewarding users who play by the Emanate rules.
In the last 2 years, revenue from music sales (and streaming) has started to
head in the right direction, thanks to platforms like Spotify (15). Emanate aims
to follow this model but to provide even greater reward for music influencers
and artists.
Users must ultimately accept they are the legal owners of a piece of audio
before uploading, and this will be policed through various policies:
•

All files checked at upload stage or audio analysis matches, and are
flagged when a similar title is applied.

•

Community flagging enables users to self-police unfair content

•

Users proven to be sharing pirated materials will have their account
suspended

•

Browser fingerprinting uniquely identifies most users so sounds stripped
from the platform and shared in other channels can be traced back to user
behaviour.

•

Unusual traffic or user behaviour is tracked and investigated

•

Emanate accounts with balances over $1000 USD will be asked to verify
their identity.

Emanate aims to abide by the international regulations for intellectual
property management and enforce it to the extent of its capabilities given the
decentralized nature of the Emanate platform and the future of the distributed
web.
In the developmental stages, there is some risk exists of audio being
downloaded from Emanate and uploaded to other platforms exists, however
this will be made clear to artists. In maturity, Emanate will prevent this
behaviour via encoding technology, access permission, watermarking and
decentralisation of files.

C H O I C E O F B LO C KC H A I N
The Emanate team recognised a degree of risk associated with choosing EOS
as a main net platform. We spent a lot of time researching Dan Larimer’s
technology views and choices that have gone into EOS, and we believe it is the
best bet for this project. No other blockchains have the speed potential and
fee-less design that EOS does.
Risk has been reduced through the development of a blockchain connector, a
type of middleware that will allow Emanate to move relatively easily between
blockchains should a more suitable solution than EOS arrive.

SCOPE
Emanate is a project that is large in scope. This is being addressed through
partnerships and community development. Emanate has closed, or is close to
confirming partnerships for the following:
•

Meta-data structure and handling

•

Social connection and sharing (vampr.me)

•

Audio recognition

Additionally, the EOS community will provide many components that can be
used, such as:
•

Wallet frameworks

•

Email based account handling

To assist in creating a rich ecosystem, Emanate will make various APIs and
source code available to music-tech developers so that new applications can be
built by 3rd parties. The Emanate team will assist in the briefing and funding of
these to the community.

GOVERNANCE
If Emanate wished to create a new music ecosystem that is better than the
current one, it is more than just the technology that needs to be decentralised.
Blockchain Music Pty Ltd has committed to launch a Decentralised Autonomous
Community (DAC) governance system for the Emanate platform that will give
a voice to the community and the partners. Eventually, we see Emanate being
governed as a DAC in which the founders of the project are but a few voices
within a sea of many. This is now made part of our roadmap.

32

© 2 0 18

MARKETING

FO R M AT I O N P H A S E
During phase 1, the DAC will be launched with a 20% voting power over
platform governance. This means that proposals and votes can be taken from
the community but due to the immaturity of the platform, Blockchain Music
will retain final decision-making power. Key partners will have some voting
power and the community votes will be taken from the top token holders
working closely with eosDAC.

GROW TH PHA SE
During the growth phase, the founders’ share of voice will diminish and some
proposals will be passed purely by community vote. This will be treated as
experimental, and monitored closely by Blockchain Music.

M AT U R I T Y
In maturity, the % of voice held by Blockchain Music will drop back to equal
weighting with the community and other industry partners. We foresee seats
being taken by representatives from all parts of the music industry including
labels, managers, songwriters and publishers.

MANAGEMENT METHODS
A 3rd party tool will likely be used, or a bespoke EOS-based alternative. The
following issues are an example of what the community will vote on:
•

New partnerships

•

Large expenditures

•

Platform features

•

Costs and fees

•

Exchange listing proposals and timings

The DAC will be discussed in depth on our Medium page and social channels.

TECHNOLO GY AND
DEVELOPMENT
W H AT I S E M A N AT E ?
The Audio Exchange Protocol is designed to enable artists across the globe to
collaborate without knowing each other, to integrate seamlessly with 3rd party
platforms without cumbersome contracts and negotiations and to get paid
quickly and accurately.

H O W D O W E D E F I N E E M A N AT E ?
Emanate cannot be defined strictly as a DApp. EOS allows developers to take
a copy of parts of the software and access its subsystems to build their own
networked applications which run in parallel with the mainnet.
With this in mind, we position Emanate as an Audio Exchange Protocol - a set
of decentralised technologies, rules and APIs that together form an ecosystem
for the music industry.
The Emanate team is currently working with an EOS test node and as we
discover more about the platform, we are documenting progress and building
our architecture and technical specification.
This paper is currently light on technical details, due to the unknowns that
are currently in place. It would be irresponsible of the development team to
document plans and processes that may not be correct. Our GitHub will be
kept up-to-date with any non-sensitive commitments, and in order for the
community to follow progress, we will deploy features sprint-by-sprint to our
sandbox environment.
Let’s discover more about what is being built and how it will be delivered on the
next page:

The Audio Exchange Protocol could be to music what HTTP is to web content.
In the same way digital advertisements are served to publishers through
platforms such as Google doubleclick or sizmek, we see music could be served
via Emanate to listener touchpoints like Spotify, radio broadcast, bars and
nightclubs.
EOS will provide a basis, a framework and a platform for many of the Emanate
components below:
•

A music-focused Blockchain backbone

•

A ledger that stores the data connected to a piece of audio including:
• Who created it?
• Who collaborated?
• Was it derived from any known source?

•

Distributed storage of audio files, categorised in a way to interact with the
ledger and smart-collaborations, accessible via a protocol for developers of
3rd party applications

•

A smart-collaboration framework which references simple agreements
between users and between applications

•

A two-way payment system including customisation of a wallet framework

•

API endpoints for each audio entity

•

Two-way usage data between agents and audio entities

•

Network nodes

Ultimately, Emanate will provide the APIs for standardised interaction,
collaboration, consumption and payment for audio between actors in the
ecosystem. On top of this set of components, a number of dApps must exist,
and an opportunity for many more community developed dApps may arise.
Usage of the network requires Emanate tokens for transacting, with a fee
structure that makes usage affordable for amateurs, yet is scalable to the
volumes commercial applications demand.

TECHNOLO GY AND
DEVELOPMENT

Emanate favours a PoS/DPoS over PoW blockchains due to the fact that
large mining farms use more energy to maintain. While transforming the
music industry is our primary goal, we do not wish to do so with significant
environmental impact.
We have settled on EOS(21) as the best platform to commence building our
production grade platform. EOS covers decentralised storage, ultra fast
processing, no transaction fees, and smart contracts on DPoS consensus model.
We have chosen to take a small risk aligning ourselves with the EOS roadmap
for several reasons. Emanate will monitor the progress of EOS and other
blockchains and will build a component-based software that can easily plug
into other architecture. For now, we see EOS being successful for the following
reasons:
•

Design for ultra-high throughput from the beginning

•

Fee-less transactions

•

Multipurpose programmable nodes

•

Distributed file storage

•

Proven graphene blockchain framework

•

Proven DPoS consensus model

•

Highly proven technical direction

•

Development community funding

Finally, dApps built on EOS can layer the EOS blockchain referencing the
mainnet for certain functionalities, meaning that applications are not likely to
clog the consensus queue as was seen with CryptoKitties.
The Emanate founding team have been working hard to connect with global
EOS community, to make use of the various open source components and
tooling and to gain support from BPs. We’ve successfully connected with Block.
One and have been recognised for our use of the EOSIO software.
Our team recognise that the long-term success of EOS is not down to Larimer
or Block.one but to the community. Our team has been liaising with Block
Producers and staying close to the developments within the community, and we
have great belief in the community’s ability to launch and sustain a mainnet,
and to continue the roadmap.

STOR AGE
Emanate makes use of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)(17) technology for
storing all the content in a decentralized way, making it more accessible. Other

DEVELOPMENT

technologies, such as EOS Storage, may be suitable for long term storage and
archiving.
IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that connects all computing
devices with a common file system. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web,
but can be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within a
single Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput contentaddressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms
a generalized Merkle DAG (18,19), a data structure upon which, versioned file
systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web can be built. IPFS combines
a distributed hash table, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying
namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust
each other.
All the non-free content should be encrypted in IPFS, using the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) (20) algorithm with both user keys and platform
keys, in a way that the track will only be accessible through the Emanate API/
SDK after end-user validation of access rights and required royalties and/or
licensing accounted for, all of which are enforced by smart-contracts on the
blockchain.

M E TA- DATA
No global standard for audio meta-data exists as yet, although some templates
are emerging such as DDEX which is being explored by Emanate. Additionally,
we are seeking partnerships (three currently under consideration and more
to be explored) which will mean we can contribute to a global meta-data
standardization movement without having to make it a core focus of our
development team.

PAY M E N T S
The Emanate ecosystem is designed to carry value and data between
participants. This token economy is made stronger by allowing music industry
partners into the ecosystem. We foresee Emanate tokens being used as a
purchase mechanism for other music industry services and two genuine
partnerships are currently in negotiation. These partners, and other partners
like them, may choose to accept Emanate tokens as a payment mechanism.

AUDIO API ENDP OINTS
As mentioned through this document, it is intended that each piece of audio on
Emanate will be accessible via an API endpoint for use in any other application.
Of course the entity accessing the audio will itself need a user profile and a
token balance so that payments can flow back to owners of the audio.

E M A N AT E DA P P S
Smart-collaborations tool
‘Smart-Collaboration’ is a term coined by Emanate team, and is currently a
unique proposition in blockchain, cryptocurrency and indeed the music world.
Each time two artists share some audio, an agreement is executed on the
blockchain. This is the backbone of the Emanate ecosystem for royalty
calculations and artist payments. Smart-collaborations enable Emanate
to work with the music industry and artists to access a wealth of samples,
sounds and vocals then publish music immediately without further contracts or
negotiations.
The smart-contract based collaborations workflow frees up-and-coming artists,
musicians and producers from the burden of legalities and contracts that often
discourage collaboration.
All contributors to a final sound receive their contracted share from all royalties
to licensing revenues the sound generates, without any trusted party in the
middle. This technology alone will revolutionise the way musicians collaborate.
The publisher sets a part of their work and conditions of use, the next
collaborator accepts and adheres to those contract parameters, adding their
own when publishing their derivative of the collaboration. This technically
complex process is seamlessly integrated and hidden in workflow, helping
ensure all are compensated for their work according to the accepted contract
conditions.
Below, you can see how the smart-collaborations will form a fundamental part
of how EMANATE (EMT) payments are distributed to artists:
Emanate has built an initial smart-collaboration tool which will be tested within
a partnership with a large audience, allowing artists to share projects with
each other within the protection of a smart-collaboration, referencing a basic
agreement of terms. This will give real customers access to the world’s first
usable blockchain-based smart-collaborations for the music industry.

E M A N AT E L I V E A L P H A
The Alpha release will be a web-based platform where artists connect and
work together via smart-collaborations and monetise their music via listener
playback based micropayments. For listeners, Emanate Alpha will provide access
to a wealth of new sounds and a closer connection to the artists. The Alpha
Phase will contain the Emanate smart-collaboration layer, artists download
WAV files in order to create new music projects, and upload to Emanate via
a smart-collaboration ‘project package’ that includes the means for tagging
contributors. During the Alpha ‘distribution phase’, listeners will participate and
artists can upload sounds, earning tokens for their work.

DEVELOPMENT PL AN

The web app is being developed using the latest Javascript frameworks on EOS
with IPFS experimentation, enabling enabling decentralization. This ALPHA
platform will utilise some centralised services on AWS in order to prioritse user
experience and performance over idealistic decentralisation. Our clear goal,
however, is to eventually run a competely decentralised Emanate network.

E M A N AT E B E TA S U I T E
Emanate Beta introduces DAW integration via tools such as Ableton plugins. At
this stage file downloads may be removed leaving all audio workflows between
the IPFS layer, a user-cache and the DAW. This represents a major barrier to the
use of stolen and illegally used content. At Beta stage, listener accounts need a
token balance to play music, which in turn rewards the artists.
The Beta release of the Audio Exchange Marketplace will make improvements
on the Alpha release, introducing features that are key to our overall

DAW P LU G I N S
VST Digital Audio Workstation plugins and integrations would bring Emanate
sounds and collaborations directly into the workflow, removing user initiated
file downloads completely. The journey from sound recording to full track
release would exist entirely in the cloud, with user ownership protected by the
blockchain.
These integration plugins and tools would make it possible for the Emanate
platform to simplify the music production workflow while ensuring all parties
involved get the agreed revenue stake in the final creation.

DEVELOPMENT PL AN

MOBILE APP
A mobile app would allow fans to listen on the move, build playlists, share
tracks and cache files. Artists would be able to access stems, samples and
musical parts to start compiling ideas into project packages. Emanate will look
into iOS and Android native apps and/or Progressive Web Apps to support this
functionality.

PA RT N E R I N T E G R AT I O N S
By Beta stage our key partners would be scheduled to have Emanate token fully
integrated into their systems so that artists can not only earn income within
the network, but also use it to purchase services and content that could further
an artist’s career and help to finesse their craft. Technically speaking, these
partners become part of an economic network, and the pieces are planned to
be in place for music industry partners to join.

PRODUCTION RELE A SE
Emanate Live 1.0 will be the first official production release of Emanate,
currently road mapped to begin in 2020. This introduces the Emanate Audio
Attribution layer, network nodes and algorithms that prevent piracy and reward
artist’s unique music production via the Emanate platform. While 2020 seems
a way off, it must be considered that this is a commercial grade software
release, usable for any musician even if they have zero knowledge of blockchain
or cryptocurrency.
To support the Emanate ecosystem, the network will need nodes for both IPFS
style distributed storage and for the Emanate ledger. These nodes will likely
require staking and will likely pay rewards in exchange for services.

DEVELOPMENT PL AN

FUTURE PLANS

LIVE PERFORMANCE AND PUBLIC BROAD C A ST
In future, public broadcasters could be able to sign up for a special broadcast
Emanate license, ongoing for licensed venues, cafe and shops and once-off
broadcast licensing for event hosts. The live performance layer of Emanate
could bring the ecosystem to the mainstage. Artists would connect to a
dedicated Emanate channel via their performance software when performing
to audiences. This connection means producers would be able to see when and
where their tracks have been played and to whom, and a premium payment
would be made for the audience broadcast. In the future, this may lead to
audience participation opportunities, monetisation of broadcasted live sets and
live audience favourites from inside the mobile app.

A LG O R I T H M I C AU D I O AT T R I B U T I O N
Emanate has priority access to a globally patented audio recognition and
analysis algorithm. This would ensure only high quality audio makes it to the
platform.
Emanate plans to employ a number of algorithms to assure security, recognition
of unique material and creation of derivative works. To combat plagiarism,
Emanate will include source separation of uploaded audio content to decipher
possible sub-ownership of audio, recognition of previously published melodies,
timbres and beats. Ideally, any prior art is recognised. If a submitting artist
infringes copyright, an algorithm would inform an existing artist.
These algorithms are achieved through strategic partnerships and license deals.
Working closely with Matt Brown (Audio Engineering Advisor), Emanate will look
to include the use of his globally patented work and other algorithms derived
from its patented ideas.

MAC AND PC APPS
Native studio applications would allow artists to streamline music production
workflows, combining files store locally with cloud-based Emanate samples.
By production release, our roadmap will see each Emanate studio application
operating optionally as a network node. Producers running this would earn
Emanate tokens as payment for their services to the network.
Native desktop apps take music production to the next level by providing
synchronisation of Emanate audio files with users’ preferred Digital Audio
Workstation (DAW). This makes the experience of using their local sample library
or one from other side of the planet, by their favourite producer and shared
minutes ago with their followers, feel the same.
These apps make it simple to browse, listen, shortlist, find, and sync with their
DAW, and keep track of all relevant metadata until the time of publishing the
final product and share the revenue with all parties involved arrives.

CONCLUDING
VISION

Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies are paving the way for new ideas
that challenge everything we know about our industries. Whilst elements of
blockchain technology are still maturing, innovation must start now.
The music industry is ripe for transformation, whilst there is a clear opportunity
for artists to connect directly with fans, there is also an industry at work in
which every component plays a part. Emanate aims to evolve the existing
industry ecosystem.
We envisage Emanate as the ubiquitous platform every artist uses daily to
collaborate, share and sell their work.
We plan to evolve this ecosystem into a Decentralised Autonomous Community
(DAC) that sits inside the old-world music industry as a better way to run a
music business. This will form a community with clear governance, structure
and most importantly; streamlined operations with artistry at the core.
Our decision to build on a fee-less, scalable, multi-faceted blockchain like EOS
will see us build a platform that is practical in every sense. We truly believe
Emanate may be one of the first real killer dApps.
We have a grand end-vision with a well-considered and equally achievable
starting point. As a music lover, an artist, a crypto enthusiast or a developer,
we think you are going to love everything about Emanate.
