Introduction
Problem Statement
For over a decade we have witnessed explosive growth of the digital content industry led by a variety of
web and mobile content platforms such as Reddit, Youtube and Spotify. It has become an indispensable
part of our modern daily life, with audio and video streaming constituting 70% of Internet data traffic.
However, the success and fairness of the industry is impeded by several long standing challenges facing
creators, consumers, advertisers, and distributors of digital content.
• Content creators struggle to profit from their own creations. It is extremely difficult to monetize one’s created content online. On many content platforms such as YouTube and Instagram,
users create all the content, from which platforms profit enormously by selling advertisements.
However, the vast majority of creators are rarely compensated for their indispensable contributions to these digital platforms. In addition, when creators do get paid for their content, layers of
intermediaries siphon off a majority share. Creators are in a weak position and lack bargaining
power to negotiate equitable monetization and payout terms. It is not surprising platforms take
most of the revenue and creators only collect a small piece of the pie. For instance, when a song
is streamed, only about 15% of the sales income goes to its creators, the bulk goes to streaming
service providers and record label owners.
• Content consumers receive no compensation for their contributions. Consumers engage in
a wide variety of value-creating activities vital to content platforms, but are never financially
rewarded. Curation: users spend valuable time interacting with platform content (e.g., liking,
voting, flagging and commenting), filtering low quality from high quality content and receive no
payments for their participatory work. They are commercially exploited by powerful platforms
(e.g., YouTube) at the expense of users unknowingly providing free services. Share: sharing
within or outside a content platform (e.g., sharing a YouTube video with followers on YouTube or
Facebook) brings more visibility to content and attracts more traffic to the platform. Attention:
the Internet is flooded with all types of digital content with greatly varying qualities. Therefore,
content is no longer scarce, per se, but a user’s attention is. A user spending limited attention on
content, including advertisements, is valuable.
• Aggressive competition between content platforms. Since key user information and content
is locked in their proprietary data silos, it’s nearly impossible for the content platforms to build
mutual trust, which often leads to fierce competition in the digital content industry. It is not
uncommon that we see big content platforms bid for copyrights of popular content with insanely
high prices, driving up the cost of the bid winner and at the same time, leaving the small and
medium-sized platforms no choice but to turn to low quality or pirated content. And usually
these surging cost will be transferred to end-users through longer ad times or higher subscription

fees, eventually degrading the user experience.

A Blockchain-based Ecosystem
Our solution to the problems mentioned above is the ContentBox Platform, which aims to build a
blockchain-based ecosystem for the digital content industry of tomorrow. Under ContentBox, the
whole industry will gain three invaluable features: a shared content pool, a shared user pool, and a
unified payout system.
Unlike traditional open platforms such as the App Store or WeChat Open Platform1 , the ContentBox
Platform is fully decentralized, autonomous, and driven by the open source community instead of
an industry platform giant. ContentBox will help various web and mobile applications share digital
content and user bases in more efficient ways than before, and process payments swiftly without
ceding control to a third party.
In principle, ContentBox is designed to benefit all stakeholders in the content industry including but
not limited to, creators, consumers, advertisers, distributors, and application developers. ContentBox
allows them to collaborate, innovate, build, engage and transact with a new generation of digital
content applications that play on fair terms within the ecosystem.
For content creators, ContentBox’s payout system will allow them to get rewards every time their
content is consumed, motivating them to create more diverse and higher quality content. Top creators
of the most popular content still reap big rewards while everyone else now receives compensation in
proportion to their content popularity. In addition, ContentBox will connect creators directly with their
consumers by streamlining and automating business transactions without intermediaries chipping
away at a creator’s revenue share.
For consumers, they will be rewarded with tokens according to their contributions. Those contributions
can be social sharing, voting or commenting on content, or reporting spam content, as long as they
are beneficial and add value to the platform. They can spend their tokens on content consumption,
like viewing a movie or streaming a song. If a user has a stake in the success of the platform, they will
put more effort and research into curating and advocating for it, as evidenced in the rise of Bitcoin.
Advertisers also will benefit from the new ecosystem. With ContentBox, advertisers can tap into a
shared advertisement statistics ledger and pay by actual advertisement viewership automated by
smart contracts, instead of relying on opaque statistics reported by distributors. Since the ledger
is open, they can audit and verify it and have peace of mind. This can help them to build a unified
and coherent marketing strategy, instead of running paralleled campaigns on different platforms.
Furthermore, they can lower spending by leveraging a token-based bounty program.

For distribution platforms and social networks, they can together build a shared content and user
ledger which benefits everyone by lowering the traffic acquisition cost and IP purchase cost. They can
focus on improving user experience instead of competing with each other.
For application developers, they can leverage ContentBox’s blockchain-enabled token, the decentralized payment infrastructure and the identity services to build applications with a better user experience
and stronger monetization ability.
Overall, by opening the black box our digital content industry is today, the whole industry, including
all stakeholders, can flourish with cooperation and transparency by collaboratively building a new
content economy. To foster the collaboration of all stakeholders, ContentBox will introduce a new
token, named BOX, which will play a key role in the ecosystem’s economy.

About CastBox
CastBox is one of the most popular mobile audio platforms across the globe, ranked #3 in News &
Magazines on Google Play (Figure 1) along with TopBuzz and Twitter. It pioneered in-audio search
to deliver contextual recommendations for listeners of podcasts, on-demand radio, and audiobooks.
Today, CastBox has about 50 employees with offices in Beijing, San Francisco, New York, and Hong
Kong.

Figure 1: Rank in News & Magazines, Google Play, USA (Source: App Annie)
Founded in early 2016 by an ex-Googler, the application currently has over 50 million+ volumes of

CastBox.fm

ContentBox

2018-03-31

audio content available, with over 15 million installed users. It is also the winner of Google Global
Android Excellence Program 2017, the Most Entertaining of Best Apps by Google Play in 2016 and a
number of other awards. CastBox is listed as Editors’ choice in 135 of Google Play’s countries.

The Foundation
A non-profit organization, Contentbox Foundation Limited (“the Foundation”), has been established
to oversee productive and positive growth of the new ecosystem on the ContentBox Platform. The
Foundation will administer use of the proceeds and ensure healthy circulation of the BOX token. As the
ultimate goal of the ContentBox Platform is to build a fully decentralized and autonomous ecosystem
for the digital content industry, governance and operation of the Foundation will be kept as transparent
as possible. In the long run, the Foundation will be transformed into a totally software defined
organization.
As the founding member of the Foundation, CastBox will pioneer the transition from a centralized
app to a decentralized blockchain-based app and introduce BOX to its tens of millions of users to help
improve their experience and enjoyment with creating, consuming, and distributing digital content. In
the near future, CastBox will also open source the vast majority of its currently proprietary codebase
after BOX is successfully integrated into the app, encouraging the open source community to drive the
evolution of the ContentBox Platform.

Technical Architecture
Why A New Blockchain?
The digital content industry has unique requirements which warrant developing a dedicated
blockchain.
• High frequency. The digital content industry is quite different from the payment or e-commerce
world in terms of action frequency. Typically a person transfers his money or buy/sells goods no
more than several times a day. But on a digital content platform, it is not uncommon for a user
to stream a song, watch a movie clip, and tip an article author within a few minutes. Clearly we
expect much larger transaction volumes in the digital content world serving millions of users.
This requires the underlying blockchain to support high transaction throughput, potentially
hundreds or even thousands of transactions per second.
• High bar for privacy protection. The appeal of a public blockchain such as Ethereum partially
lies in its transparency: all smart contracts are stored publicly on every node and are independently auditable. However, users on digital content platforms often prefer to have confidential

CastBox.fm

ContentBox

2018-03-31

transactions. A podcast creator would not want his income information streamed to parties
outside the transaction. Privacy for competitive and regulatory reasons is even more critical for
enterprise user transactions. Furthermore, the visibility of increasingly complex smart contracts
brings severe security risks as demonstrated by The DAO2 and Parity3 .
• Prevalence of micropayments. It is expected the majority of content transactions will transfer
small denominations. For example, a user supports content creators with small donations, or
they pay for access to premium content like watching an episode of a popular TV show. The
industry needs a frictionless micropayment solution to foster a vibrant and healthy community.
This translates to a blockchain with minimal or even zero transaction fees.
Evidently, current mainstream blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are not a natural fit for the
digital content industry. Consequently, it leaves us no choice but to find novel solutions and build a
light-weight yet scalable blockchain. Admittedly, many nascent projects are claiming they can solve
the problems above, but none of them has proven mature in production or onboarded enough users
and developers to form a scalable, self-growing ecosystem.
To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an architecture consisting of three main
components:
• BOX Payout. A fast and secure blockchain to carry out multiparty contingent payments.
• BOX Passport. A blockchain-based identity and attribution service across multiple applications.
• BOX Unpack. A turn-key solution for small and medium-sized partners to setup a content
platform easily and quickly.
We elaborate on the components above in the following sections.

Design Goals and Principles
Before delving into the details of the core components, we would like to introduce the goals and
principles considered in the design of the ContentBox Platform.
To be concise, the major design goals of the ContentBox architecture are:
• Scale when content and users grow rapidly.
• Support most common smart contracts for the content industry.
• Protect transaction privacy.
• Support micropayments.
• Easily integrate with existing applications.

Figure 2: Overview of ContentBOX Architecture
Conceptually, all of the above goals can be achieved by designing a more powerful, fully-functional,
EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compliant blockchain. However, ContentBox plans to take the approach of not building a monolithic blockchain. The design of ContentBox follows the UNIX philosophy:
building a large system on top of a series of simple, modular, and reliable small parts, which can be
easily debugged and upgraded.
In addition, ContentBox attempts to make the whole system friendly to developers throughout its
design. An ecosystem cannot be successful just because of its technological superiority; more importantly, it needs to win the hearts and minds of users and developers. Therefore, another principle
applied throughout ContentBox is to avoid reinventing the wheel whenever possible and to reuse
proven, widely-used, state-of-the-art technology stacks.

Another important principle is to keep concepts orthogonal. Our goal is not to build a multipurpose
blockchain that’s difficult to build and hard to implement. Additionally, we do not want two components sharing common functionalities, which could confuse application developers. Orthogonality
makes it easier to reason about what happens when things combine.

BOX Payout
A Chain Without a Virtual Machine
BOX Payout is NOT a blockchain that supports a general purpose Turing-complete virtual machine. The
main purpose of the BOX Payout blockchain is to support fast and secure conditional transactions which
are of great importance in a digital content world. Undoubtedly, a Turing-complete virtual machine
similar to an Ethereum Virtual Machine (“EVM”) can carry out arbitrary conditional transactions and
ensure its execution and results, but it may not always be the optimal solution.

Figure 3: Traditional On-chain Smart Contract. Applications Interact with Blockchain through EVM
A simple example of conditional transactions in the digital content area is shown previously involving
a user, a piece of content, and a platform. To enforce such a multiparty payout, one can write a smart
contract to govern the token transfer to each party, let the EVM execute it and validate the result.

Obviously, this is a very resource-intensive approach. With the diversity of content comes the diversity
of smart contracts, thus bringing a heavy burden to the blockchain. This is because every contract will
be executed for every message on every node. But luckily, the advancements made in cryptographic
research and work spearheaded by Andrew Poelstra, a scientist at Blockstream, point to an alternative
way to achieve the same goal without a virtual machine, which we call Crypto Contracts:

Crypto Contracts
Essentially, Crypto Contracts are a kind of smart contracts that can be translated into a series of crypto
primitives. Developers can also think of them as off-chain smart contracts.
Since the birth of Ethereum, smart contracts have been an indispensable part for many blockchain
projects. However, most contracts need only one thing from the blockchain: an immutable ordering of
commitments to prevent double-spending. Therefore, instead of using complex and resource intensive
smart contracts to align the interests of stakeholders and automate payment related transactions, we
can aggregate simple signatures to achieve the same goal, but with much higher performance.

Figure 4: Off-chain Smart Contract. Applications Interact with Blockchain Directly
Basically, a set of parties can decide on some sort of contract or protocol that they want to execute, and
as a result of faithful execution they will produce a valid signature and the blockchain and its verifiers
can validate that the signature is valid. The blockchain does not need to know any of the details of the
original transaction. By using a signature itself as a witness, the bulk of transactions can be moved
off-chain and leave the blockchain to do what it is really good at: check a multi-signature. In other
words, a smart contract can be compiled into a series of cryptographic primitives; when someone signs

CastBox.fm

11

ContentBox

and validate an ordinary transaction with these primitives, it holds that a smart contract that is not
hosted on the blockchain still executes faithfully.
A crucial piece of this approach is Schnorr Signature4 . Unlike ECDSA signatures, Schnorr signature
has linearity in its math, which makes it ideal for creating “adaptor signature” that can be used in
settling off-chain transactions automatically. By replacing the signatures embedded in each input with
an aggregated single signature, a blockchain can save large amount of disk spaces and become very
lightweight, yet more powerful than before.
Consider a simple case: Alice wants to stream an online movie owned by Bob, and she would like to
pay Bob 1 BOX in exchange for a one-time access key to the movie. Now suppose Bob embeds the
access key in a secret t, and the process that Alice gets t can be described as follows:

Figure 5: Alice pays Bob to gain a movie access key with an adaptor signature
1. Alice and Bob construct joint key J(A, B) = PA0 + PB0 , where PA0 = H(H(PA ||PB )||PA ) ∗ PA ,
PB0 = H(H(PA ||PB )||PB ) ∗ PB (PA , PB are public keys)
2. Alice and Bob share PA , PB , RA , RB (random nonce points); Bob calculates T = t ∗ G, and gives

T to Alice
Alice and Bob therefore agree on random challenge e = H(J(A, B)||RA + RB + T ||m) (H
denotes hash algorithm, and these two steps not shown on the figure)
Bob provides adaptor signature s0 = rB + e ∗ x0B (shown on the upper-right corner of the figure,
x0B is the private key for PB0 )
Alice verifies: s0 ∗ G = RB + e ∗ PB0
If OK, Alice sends Bob her signature: sA = rA + e ∗ x0A (x0A is the private key for PA0 )
Bob completes, atomically releasing t: first, construct sB = rB + t + e ∗ x0B , then combine:
sa = sA + sB , sign the transaction and broadcast it on blockchain, then Alice sees sa
Alice subtracts: sa − sA − s0 = (rB + t + e ∗ x0B ) − (rB + e ∗ x0B ) = t

Consensus Mechanism
To further improve the scalability of the BOX Payout blockchain and make it mobile-friendly, a derivation
of Proof of Stake (“PoS”), named Proof of Network Effect (“PoNE”) will be adopted as the major
consensus mechanism.
PoS is a category of consensus mechanism for public blockchains which depends on a validator’s
proportion of the total number of tokens in the network. In Proof of Work (“PoW”) based public
blockchains, the algorithm rewards participants who solve cryptographic puzzles in order to validate
transactions and create new blocks. In PoS-based public blockchains, a set of validators take turns
proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator’s vote depends on the size of
its stake.
Because of the specific domain the ContentBox Platform is serving, PoNE has also been added on
top of a plain PoS. The probability of being selected as a validator will depend on the amount of the
validator’s deposit, the content creation and consumption of that particular node. Together with PoS,
the score of a node being selected as a validator will be as follow:
si
ci ∗ ωi
µi = P + P
s
(c ∗ ω)
µi denotes the score of a node
si is the stake of a node
ci is the contribution score of a node, affected by the quantity and frequency of content contribution
related this node
ωi is the weight value largely like the impact factor used in academia
In order to perform mining on the blockchain of BOX Payout, nodes will be bonded by the protocol
and make a security deposit. Every round of the block creation, a list of 5 ordered validators will be

CastBox.fm

13

ContentBox

2018-03-31

selected randomly with the score stated in the formula above. If the first selected validator is offline
and can not perform the validation, the second will substitute and take its place.
Significant advantages of this consensus mechanism include security, reduced risk of centralization,
and energy efficiency. Transaction throughput will also be improved and it will greatly affect the user
experience when consuming the content. For example, when a piece of audio is played, the time
should be recorded, and the relevant payment, either from advertising or subscription, should be
instantaneously be distributed back to their right holders. This is the whole premise for building BOX
Payout.
Since the ContentBox Platform is targeting the digital content consumption market which usually
happens on mobile nowadays, it is essentially targeting a large distributed validator population with
minimal resource consumption. The potential nodes will be established on mobile devices, given the
consumption pattern set forth above. The computation power may not be as strong, while the quantity
of nodes could number in the hundreds of millions. This builds the foundation for using PoS without
the concern of the initial distribution of token.

BOX Passport
With the growth of the ecosystem on the ContentBox Platform, a plethora of content applications are
expected to be built on top of it. A single user shall have a consistent identity across all of applications,
instead of having to create an independent identity for each of them. Therefore, ContentBox will
introduce a powerful decentralized interoperable identity service called “BOX Passport”. It allows a
user to transact frictionlessly across multiple apps or websites with a single digital identity and will
enhance the user’s privacy, security and control as well.
BOX Passport establishes this identity by extending the wallet concept to store personal information
such as reputation alongside token account. This identify service is not stored in any application’s
centralized databases and is inherently decentralized, thus less vulnerable to hacks. Users have full
control over their identity and decide who can access which part of it for how long. Furthermore, BOX
Passport will bind a creator to his artworks transparently and permanently, which helps him build an
ongoing reputation in the digital content world.
Based on BOX Passport, we will introduce a new feature for the ecosystem, named BOX Login, and
will open it to every developer in the community. Similar to Facebook Login in concept, Box Login is a
secure and convenient way for people to sign into any website, desktop app or mobile application in
the ContentBox ecosystem. However, BOX Login is implemented on the blockchain and will not be
controlled by any single company or organization, which will set it apart from any of today’s third-party
authentication system.

Third party identity services such as Keybase5 and uPort6 will be possibly integrated into the identity
service for broader interoperability.

BOX Unpack
Application Interface
BOX Unpack is the application interface of ContentBox, including a series of libraries, SDKs, command
line and web-based tools aiming to assist potential partners and general developers to build nextgeneration digital content applications. Unlike Ethereum, BOX Unpack does not require the developers
to learn a new programming language to write smart contracts, instead, it allows the developers to
integrate blockchain related services easily and intuitively with familiar languages: Java, Go, Python,
etc.
The major functionalities of BOX Unpack include: sign up and log in with BOX Passport, build and
commit transactions on BOX Payout, upload and register digital contents, account migration and
aggregation, and a set of tools to manage content on the blockchain. In particular, BOX Unpack also
encapsulates a few AI-based algorithms developed in-house at CastBox into reusable modules which
can help developers implement some advanced features on a decentralized application:
• In-audio Search. This is a novel search technology recently introduced by CastBox that allows
users to find content he/she wants to hear in a more efficient way. Traditionally, audio search is
implemented by crawling tags and title descriptions which are often manipulated by some savvy
podcasters (we can see similar things occurred in App Store SEO). But CastBox implements it in
a new way: it uses its Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm to transcribe spoken audio
content, combined with machine learning to surface personalized results tailored to each user’s
search and listening habits. By using this technology, ContentBox application developers can
develop a fast and intelligent search engine which can help users discover interesting contents
across multiple digital content platforms.
• Deep learning based recommendation engine. The recommendation engine in CastBox is
built on the basis of a wide & deep model used in Google Play7 along with a denoising autoencoder developed in house. Compared with traditional recommendation models, deep learning
techniques provide a better understanding of user’s demands and high-quality recommendations. Leveraging this technology, combined with the blockchain libraries provided by BOX
Unpack, developers can build an unprecedented recommendation engine for every user on the
ContentBox platform.

Turnkey Solution
In addition to the developer tools mentioned above, BOX Unpack also provides a turnkey solution for
small startups who want to provide digital content services to users but lack funding or technology to
set up a full-fledged online platform. Imagine a small team wanting to create a better video app with
an outstanding player they just built. Their first challenge is overcoming high copyrights purchasing
costs. With this turnkey solution, the team can overcome said copyright hurdle by setting up a revenuesharing scheme easily without programming any smart contract. We believe this turnkey solution will
dramatically lower the barrier to entry for potential partners to join and grow ContentBox.

Related Work
There are a plethora of projects currently working to solve scalability and privacy issues of current
blockchains. Unfortunately, none of them can be directly applied to solve the unique challenges
ContentBox aims to overcome. Nevertheless, there are many potential techniques to be leveraged,
and we are actively monitoring their progress.

Sharding
Similar to database sharding in traditional database software systems, such as MySQL, sharding on
blockchain is an approach to improve system scalability. The key idea to split the overall state of the
chain into different shards, and each shard only processes a small part of the state and does so in
parallel8 .
Many blockchain developers see sharding as a promising approach to solve blockchain’s scalability
problem, and many blockchain projects have based their solution on this technology. However, we
are a little bit more conservative regarding its full-fledged implementation on the main net in the
near future. Basically, in sharding, the blockchain wants to create a network where every node only
processes a small portion of all transactions, while still maintaining high security. A fast and secure
solution for this problem is not easy to find because a transaction executed on the blockchain can
depend on any part of the previous state in the blockchain, which makes it difficult to do things in
parallel. And inter-shard messaging compounds the complexity.
Overall, we believe sharding still has a long way to go before becoming a widely accepted solution to
scale the blockchain. We will pay close attention to the progress in this area but will not use it as a core
technology in our solution for now.

Lighting Network and Raiden Network
Basically, both the Lightning9 and Raiden10 networks rely on off-chain state channels. The core idea
here is that participants put some bitcoin or ether into a multi-signature address, open a payment
channel and then sign transactions without submitting to the blockchain. Payment channels can be
organized into a network and thus a payment between two parties can be conducted through multiple
hops. The payment channel can be closed by either party at any time, and the last-signed transaction
with the most up-to-date balances for both parties is the one that will be committed to the blockchain.
Both of these two approaches can increase transaction throughput and lower fees effectively in their
respective environment (one for Bitcoin and the other for Ethereum) if properly implemented. However,
there are still some limitations in practice. For instance, all participants of a transaction need to lock
up some tokens on-chain until the channel is closed, thus discouraging usage of the payment network.
Plasma
Plasma11 is one of the most promising proposals for scaling smart contract computations on the
blockchain. With Plasma, the blockchains are composed into a tree hierarchy, and each branch treated
as a blockchain with its own history and computations that are map-reducible. Therefore, the root
chain only needs to handle a small amount of merkleized commitments from child chains, which
results in high scalability.
Both authors of Plasma are masterminds in the blockchain field, and they proposed a novel solution to
the long standing problem of current mainstream networks. Ideally, it will be appropriate for the digital
content industry and could serve as the basis of ContentBox. However, this project is still in its infancy,
and some critical challenges need to be addressed, such as how to handle an attack occurring on a
child chain. The Plasma paper’s solution of moving participants to another chain is far from perfect
as moving funds smoothly cannot be easily implemented and guaranteed. And their entire system of
smart contracts is still prone to potential security breaches.
Therefore, we view Plasma as an upgraded and improved Ethereum which still requires time to demonstrate production level capability, so we will refrain from using it to lay the groundwork for ContentBox.
MimbleWimble
MimbleWimble12 is a new blockchain design proposed about a year and a half ago which can theoretically increase privacy, scalability and fungibility compared current main stream blockchains. The core

idea is that people can verify the state of the system without downloading all of the transaction data.
Instead, the chain can compact the transaction history efficiently and rely on cryptographic primitives
to achieve full public verifiability (which is very similar to our solution). The project has made great
progress recently by launching a testnet13 and integrating Bulletproofs14 .
However, a full node of MimbleWimble still needs a lot space on disk which makes it unfriendly to mobile
devices. And arguably, the design of stripping out the Bitcoin’s scripting system will make it hard to do
soft-forking and debilitate its power on enforcing contingent payments which is of great importance
in the digital content industry. Nevertheless, MimbleWimble is a promising solution towards scaling
blockchain and we can borrow a lot from its design and implementation. For example, the structure of
transactions, the cut-through used for packing block and its ASIC-resistant mining algorithm (Cuckoo
Cycle) that encourages mining decentralization.

Steem
Steem is a blockchain for producing Smart Media Tokens which facilitate a decentralized blogging and
social network: Steemit15 . By design, Steem leverages the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus
protocol to achieve a high throughput of transactions. In addition, it introduced several innovative builtin features, such as Reward Pool, ChainBase, and a stake-based voting and incentivization mechanism
to support the operation of Steemit.
Generally, Steem is a well-designed blockchain for a social media platform with great performance
and rich built-in features. However, as an infrastructure, Steem is too application-specific. While
supporting the operation of Steemit well, the reward and voting system also limit the use of Steem
in applications other than social blogging. For example, a mobile video app might not need a voting
action to determine a user’s interest on a video clip; they can learn by simply observing the user’s
behaviors like browsing, viewing, pausing, fast forwarding, etc. Actually, many startups are using users’
behavioral data and advanced AI algorithms to curate and dispatch personalized contents.
The basic design of Steem appears impressive but it’s not suitable for the Box core system. Instead, we
prefer to use the blockchain as a microkernel of the whole system and restrict the rewarding or voting
components to the application level to improve flexibility. Our architecture is a better way to develop
an open-source ecosystem that lays the foundation for ContentBox adoption by the digital content
industry.

Integration with CastBox App
Mobile Wallet
A light wallet will be integrated into CastBox application. With the built-in wallet, a user can instantly
see his balances and transaction history while using
the app, including token rewards for their contribution to the CastBox community. In the future, the
wallet will show balances across apps.
As a popular mobile app, CastBox is a logical host
for a mobile wallet of BOX tokens. By onboarding
millions of CastBox users and building an immediate online ecosystem, ContentBox will avoid the
cold start that plagues most startups. Additionally,
since CastBox is a frequently used app, users will
naturally interact with ContentBox multiple times a
day and become familiar with crypto token related
concepts. In the long run, as users become comfortable with BOX tokens and experience the benefits
of a new blockchain-based system, they will accelerate other applications working with ContentBox,
growing and expanding the ecosystem of players.
Figure 6: In-app light wallet

BOX Login
CastBox will migrate the opt-in accounts onto the
blockchain and grant users a secure universal BOX ID once the BOX Passport system is in production.
After the migration, CastBox’s backend servers will no longer store user account and credential information. Instead, the app client will access the blockchain to retrieve and verify a user’s identity during
the sign-in process.
Using BOX Passport will bring benefits to CastBox’s operator as well as its end-users. Given that user
authentication and authorization is moved from the app’s servers to a public blockchain, the operator
is no longer burdened with manually guarding against hacker attacks on user information. On the
other hand, the app users also gain back control of their own data, mitigating the risk of personal data
breaches.

In-app Token-based Reward System
Along with the light wallet, a token-based reward
system will be built into CastBox as well. The reward system serves mainly two goals: to incentivize
authors to create more valuable content and to motivate users to curate and spread good content. For
example, if a listener finds an interesting podcast
in CastBox, submits a comment, and then shares
it with his friends on social networks (such as Facebook or Twitter), he will receive BOX tokens as rewards.
Users can also gain tokens for helping filter spams.
Spamming is a challenge for every online community and results in reduced user experience if not
efficiently controlled. Usually digital content platform owners solve this problem by hiring more
Figure 7: Earn BOX by flagging spam
moderators or invest in the researching and deploying of AI-based algorithms for automatically filtering spam. However, both of these approaches are costly and inefficient in practice. Through the built-in
incentive system, CastBox users receive rewards for proactively flagging low-quality content.

Example Applications Beyond CastBox
When developers use BOX Unpack and BOX Passport, many new applications are created and deployed
on the ContentBox platform. The digital content open source software community we’re fostering
brings potentially unlimited use case possibilities. Here are a few high-level examples:

Content Marketplace without Middleman
Control of content distribution is concentrated in a few centralized marketplaces such as iTunes and
Google Play. These marketplaces unilaterally determine how creators are paid. As a result, the vast
majority of creators globally are greatly underpaid, if paid at all.
ContentBox allows for an open, fair, and creator-centric decentralized marketplace that enjoys many
advantages over a centralized one.

• Lower fees. Since there is no hyper-scale digital platform company between creators and consumers, taking a big cut, more revenue will flow to creators.
• More liquidity. In the music industry, for example, it could take six to eighteen months after a
song is released before the artist receives the first royalty check. In our new digital marketplace,
an artist can be paid automatically in tradable built-in tokens while her song streams anywhere
in the world.
• More Transparency. Since all critical information is logged in a public blockchain, an artist knows
exactly how many times and when her song is streamed and how much revenue it was generating.

Native Mini Crowdfunding Launchpad
Traditionally, content creators have very few ways to fund their creative projects and rely on powerful
intermediaries such as music labels and film studios, which take a significant cut of the whole pie. With
ContentBox, creators can raise funding truly independently. A filmmaker can pre-sell tokens to fans
to fund an independent film, which grant them access to the film once it is made. The crowdfunding
smart contract can also include advanced features. For instance, fans can share in a portion of the film
revenue per their tokens. Or fans can specify funds to be gradually released, contingent upon reaching
production milestones. The same applies to other forms of creative endeavors such as music and TV
shows.
Crowdfunding within the ContentBox ecosystem can leverage the network effect of a large captive
user base, which is more likely to support digital content projects than users on other crowdfunding
platforms. Also, these native tokens can be utilized frictionlessly on the ContentBox blockchain without
the additional cash out hurdles of running an external crowdfunding campaign.

Decentralized “AdSense” for Content Platforms
AdSense is a program run by Google that allows publishers in the Google Network of content sites to
serve automatic text or multimedia advertisements, that are targeted to site content and audience. On
the ContentBox Platform, we can run a similar program to AdSense which will facilitate transactions
between advertisers and content publishers. But unlike Google AdSense, this program is based on public blockchains instead of a central giant platform like Google. Advertising inventory can be organized
on a decentralized file system like IPFS, and the dispatch engine can be developed by leveraging the
modules provided by BOX Unpack. And the monetization and payments can be made via BOX Payout.
Compared with Google AdSense, this decentralized program can provide a more transparent and
reliable service. Without a central authority, all parties enjoy more flexibility; advertisers pay less in
fees, and publishers receive higher remuneration.

Cross-service On-demand Video Player
Usually a media player is just a desktop or mobile software that can decode many multimedia file
formats. However, a new type of player can be developed on the ContentBox Platform. Besides the
function to play a video clip on user’s device, this new player can allow its users to search on a wide
range of digital movies registered on ContentBox platform, although they will be potentially hosted
on different server farms owned by various partners of ContentBox. While streaming, the player can
also collect BOX tokens in real-time and automatically distribute them among the copyright owners,
streaming platform and storage providers according to a pre-defined smart contract.
The core functionality of this new player is to interact with our BOX Payout and BOX Passport. Aided by
these core components of ContentBox, the player can tap into the vast shared pool of genuine contents
and enhance the user experience in video-on-demand greatly. Without the infrastructure provided by
ContentBox, this innovative software idea would be inconceivable.

Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions
The regulatory status of BOX and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing
regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including
BOX and/or the ContentBox Platform. Regulatory actions could negatively impact BOX and/or the
ContentBox Platform in various ways. The Foundation (or its affiliates) may cease operations in a
jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to
operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s)
to operate in such jurisdiction.
After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and
legal structure of virtual currencies, the Foundation will apply a cautious approach towards the sale of
BOX. Therefore, for the crowdsale, the Foundation may constantly adjust the sale strategy in order
to avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible. For the crowdsale, the Foundation is working with
Tzedek Law LLC, a boutique corporate law firm in Singapore with a good reputation in the blockchain
space.
Competitors
It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same or similar code and
protocol underlying BOX and/or the ContentBox Platform and attempt to re-create similar facilities.
The ContentBox Platform may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could
negatively impact BOX and/or the ContentBox Platform.
Loss of Talent
The development of the ContentBox Platform depends on the continued co-operation of the existing
technical team and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may adversely affect the ContentBox Platform or its future
development.
Failure to Develop
There is the risk that the development of the ContentBox Platform will not be executed or implemented
as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any
digital asset, virtual currency or BOX, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development
funds for activities.
Security Weaknesses
Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with BOX and/or the
ContentBox Platform in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of
