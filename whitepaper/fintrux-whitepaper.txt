EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FintruX Network is the true P2P lending ecosystem built on the blockchain, powered by credit enhancements and no-code generation. The platform makes it
easy for borrowers to connect with reputable lenders and servicing agencies, save money with competitive interest rates, and get an affordable loan within
minutes in a fair and transparent process without physical collateral. FintruX Network aims to disrupt the way unsecured loans are being originated and
administered, making unsecured loans easy, fast, and highly secure.
An unsecured loan is a loan that is not protected or secured by any asset. In this case the lender is taking a lot more risk and would likely charge a higher interest
rate. The riskier the loan, the more expensive it will be. We are going to change that.
While pursuing traditional financing, small businesses do not have access to loans when they most need it. Banks prefer to lend cash on cash, and the loan
amounts requested are usually too small for financial institutions to do efficiently. If a loan is procured from alternative financing sources, the interest rate is
generally too high. Finance companies only utilize a few data sets to evaluate SME borrower worthiness resulting in poor representation of credit, and
traditional p2p lenders offer high interest rates due to private equity backing. Additionally, capital that could have been invested in small business credit has
been largely locked out of the market. Individual investors generally lack the size and access to directly invest in small business credit, and while institutional
investors have had some access to this market, they lack the tools to customize portfolios to their specific risk tolerance.
FintruX Network is comprised by a dynamic team of skilled professionals in strategy, commercial lending, operations, marketing, sales, and technology. Our
technology is supported by Robocoder Corporation, which has over 20 years of enterprise software development experience. The technology team has been
servicing the securitization industry in Canada since 1999, and is currently managing billions of dollars of assets for reputable banks and insurance companies.
Our team is complimented with advisors and directors ranging from esteemed individuals who have held prominent positions such as managing director of
Dun and Bradstreet Asia, and director of TNG Asia, chairman of the ELFA in USA, to leaders at various fortune 500 companies in the telecom, banking, and
technology sectors.
We leverage our extensive expertise and technology to create an ecosystem of lenders, borrowers, and service agencies operating in a true peer-to-peer
marketplace to reduce the friction of small business (SME) lending. Our platform makes unsecured financing easy, fast, and highly secure with credit
enhancements, no-code generation, and an open ecosystem.

STRATEGY
One of the most important motivations in securitization is cost reduction, often done via credit enhancements, historically only available to securitizations of
large portfolios. Our background and technology enables us to create novel credit enhancers for our true P2P lending platform, acting as cascading levels of
insurances to cover potential losses. This reduces the lender’s credit risk and interest rates for borrowers is lowered.
Our no-code generation technology enables us to simplify and streamline the loan application process, increasing efficiency and lowering costs. Borrowers and
lenders of various risk profiles and tolerances can easily find each other online. An open-source unique loan smart contract is automatically generated and
deployed by FintruX Network for each approved loan in real-time to provide unambiguous, immutable, and censorship resistant records where no arbitration is
required and expected obligations are transparent. Special instructions such as refinance, prepayment, end-of-term processing, are self-executing and
previously agreed upon.
To further enhance our offerings, we invite partners to join our open ecosystem such as fraud and identity (KYC/AML) service agents, credit scoring and
decision agents, escrow agents, collection and recovery specialists, wallets, exchanges, brokers, insurance companies and technology companies; to develop a
new generation of financial products and innovative new tools for use on our platform. By enabling borrowers and lenders direct access to a wide host of
financial services, we create maximized opportunities and freedom to make the right decisions.
Borrowers can choose to be scored by a variety of credit scoring agencies to build a more comprehensive and holistic view of their creditworthiness, unlocking
access to additional sources of funding. For the first time, lenders are able to choose from a variety of credit models from established credit decision agencies,
modify reference packages, or even build their own models from scratch. Incented guarantors improve overall interest rates by guaranteeing loans, earning a
portion of the interest for an incentive fee. Service providers are offered the opportunity to expand their offerings from a traditional wholesale model for
financial institutions, to a retail model selling directly to consumers. All participants can rate each other on a decentralized review platform, offering a reliable
source of comparability that can be used for trust, assessment of risk, and branding.
FintruX Network is making decentralized financing with trust a no-brainer for borrowers and lenders. Our vision is to build an ecosystem where transparency,
risk reduction, and efficiency is maximized to ensure all participants win.

MARKET OVERVIEW
Peer-to-peer (“P2P”) lending is also called
marketplace lending [2]. This type of consumer
lending in the UK grew at 81.2 per cent a year
between 2010 and 2015; SME lending growing
at 6 per cent a year during the same period;
the total number of active borrowers almost
doubled in 2015 alone [5]. According to
Morgan Stanley, while marketplace lending in
2015 was still ~1% of unsecured consumer and
SME lending in the US, it can reach ~10% by
2020 — and expect China, the UK, and
Australia to follow. The global market can grow
to $150-490 billion by 2020 [3].

Global debt rose to 325 percent of the world's gross domestic product in 2016, totaling US$215 trillion an Institute for
International Finance report released in April 2017 showed, boosted by the rapid growth of issuance in emerging markets.
Global debt grew by $7.6 trillion in 2016 compared with the prior year. Issuance rose from 320 percent of GDP in 2015 [7].

5
Traditional local banks and credit unions offer
unsecured loans. However, it is notably difficult to
get an unsecured business loan through
traditional lenders; especially if your business is
relatively young and hasn’t had enough time to
establish good credit. It can also take extensive
lengths of time to apply and get approved.
Generally, banks focus their operations in
determined geographic locations, which makes it
difficult for people in different areas to connect for
purposes of credit transactions.
Private lenders are few and far in between and
scattered throughout the country. There exists
tougher requirements to be approved for a private
loan, as the repayment method is not automated.
Alternatively, online platform lenders such as
direct and peer-to-peer lenders can offer a faster,
easier online application process [1].
Peer-to-peer platform lenders use other investors
to fund their loans. This means that the money for
your business loan might be originating from
dozens, or even hundreds of individual investors
all over the world. They usually offer more flexible
approval and repayment terms than either bank or
direct online lenders, but their interest rates are
generally a bit higher.

MARKET OVERVIEW
Just recently, Amazon announced that it has made $1 billion in small-business loans,
ranging from $1,000 to $750,000 for up to 12 months, to more than 20,000 merchants in
the United States, Japan and the U.K. during the past 12 months.

Direct platform lenders issue loans from their
own company’s capital, just like a bank, but
without some of the traditional requirements
and limitations of bank lending. As a result,
direct lenders are often able to issue loans more
quickly than a bank or even peer-to-peer
lenders, and can offer some of the best rates
available outside of traditional lenders.
However, something is still missing. Current
traditional P2P platforms are not true P2P
because they internalize and centralize the
decision making. Their operations lack
transparency and lenders are not provided the
tools to understand and protect their
investment. Additionally, these platforms
typically only utilize a few service providers to
score their borrowers, leading to situations
where creditworthiness may be under-reported.
Thanks to the rising power of decentralization
we can achieve much more and bring higher
benefits to both borrowers and lenders.

Since Amazon Lending launched in 2011, it has surpassed $3 billion in loans to small businesses
in more than 130 different countries across the globe. Furthermore, Amazon can do it without
the regulatory compliance that banks must meet [11].

WHY NOW?

“In the 80’s financing was done via faxing. In the 90’s we built a system using client/server technology to originate and administer
financing over dialup modem and private leased line. Later we rewrote the same application into interactive web-based solution on
Web 2.0. Today we are embarking on a new journey to enable financing on Web 3.0”

Nelson Lin has been wrestling with this concept for many years, waiting for the right technology and opportunity. He made his mark in the finance and leasing industry by
creating the market’s first online credit adjudication software, as mentioned in the book ‘Unstoppable’ published 2014 by Beth Parker and endorsed by the Canadian Finance
and Leasing Association (CFLA). In order to communicate with the remote mainframes of the credit bureaus, he simulated asynchronous call functionality before it even
existed. Nelson founded Robocoder Corporation in 1999, a reputable software design & development firm and continued to deliver successful solutions in the financial sector.
In 2000, Nelson invented the low-code development platform Rintagi - a proven tool that builds mission-critical custom enterprise applications with the ability to rejuvenate its
applications with latest user interface, experience, and technology with just the press of a button.
One of the Rintagi-built mission-critical applications delivered in 2003 is currently serving the pass-through securitization market in North America, managing several billions of
dollars of assets for reputable financial institutions. When the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) was brought to his attention in early 2017, he recognized the opportunity to
combine his experience and knowledge to turn his low-code development platform into a no-code development platform, with the ability to generate self-executing smart
programs (smart contracts) on a decentralized ledger. Intrigued by the potential, Nelson engaged several existing clients who agreed to further explore how this platform could
reduce risk and improve liquidity, security, administration and cost in the financing industry, especially between small businesses and investors.
These technologies combined with risk-reduction mechanisms utilized by securitization funders and an open ecosystem of sophisticated operators and agencies opened up a
golden opportunity to create a simple trustless world of borrowing and lending, starting with the simplest unsecured loan.

Marketplace Lending Still Has Problems

Traditional Systems are Inadequate

8

Lots of Intermediaries

P
R
O

M

Most financing is still originated via third parties such as
brokers and other intermediaries. They sell their contracts to
banks or originators who have credit lines obtained from
banks. The cost of the credit line is then passed on to the
borrowers. Only when their portfolios get to a very large size
the originators can securitize their contracts to get lower cost
of funding.

Fragmented and Inconsistent
Most systems employed are not fully automated, records are
mutable, censored, and subject to the patriot act of the country
of domicile. Furthermore, these islands of data do not
communicate with each other, making it difficult to
synchronize and collaborate through a shared process. This
adds tremendous complexity and cost for auditing.

Labor Intensive
Most financing contracts are difficult to understand and special
instructions such as refinance, prepayment, end-of-term
processing, etc. are largely manually performed on
spreadsheets.

Startups and Small Businesses Underserved
There is a growing number of small businesses, especially
startups, which fail to get loans from banks:
• The loan amount required is too small for banks to be
interested in.
• Loans are usually brought in by brokers who don't earn
enough incentives on the smaller loans to follow through.
• Banks usually take a long time to reach a decision.
• The bank's requirement for documentation is very high.
• Some small businesses do not meet the internal policy
parameters of the banks even though they are credit
worthy by other standards.

The new social technologies of the Internet have helped to expand the boundaries of
the traditional banking system by offering novel credit alternatives, such as
marketplace lending. These technologies helped the credit system to move forward on
the following key points:

•
•
•
•
•

the networking effect in modernizing the whole credit-granting
process increased;
the segment of the population covered by the marketplace credit
system increased;
the localization issue was mitigated – to certain extent;
the intermediation costs were reduced, to the extent that the P2P
interest rates were less than most traditional bank lending rates; and
the shift brought better conditions for both borrowers and lenders
for evaluating creditworthiness.

BUT…
Credit risk is generally still assumed by
the lender, and not by the P2P platform.
Credit risk evaluation process, though
improved, remains centralized and nontransparent to the lenders.

The lender has limited tools to manage
and understand their investments.

If the company behind the P2P platform defaults
or declares bankruptcy, the lender has limited
recourse with respect to the borrower.
Money is transferred with the P2P platform as the
intermediator, and thus may be susceptible to
misappropriation.

Small Business Financing Is Essential to the Economy.
Cash flow is an issue for many businesses, and while the cash fluctuations may be small they can have a huge
effect on a business’ ability to run. This is where an unsecured loan comes in. The ability of small businesses to
access affordable credit is essential to stimulating and sustaining a healthy, diverse and innovative economy.
According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as of March 31, 2014, there were $292 billion of
commercial and industrial loans outstanding under $1 million.

Borrowers Are Inadequately Served by the Current Lending System.
Due to its high fixed cost of underwriting and servicing, the traditional banking system is ill-suited to meet small
business demand for financing and the possibility of incurring additional fees and penalties. Online financing
portals attempting to bypass the intermediaries have failed to address these issues.

Lenders Have Limited Options to Participate in Small Business Financing.
As individual investors generally lack the size and access to invest in structured products directly, they are unable
to invest in small business credit. While institutional investors have had some access to this market, most have
lacked the tools to customize portfolios to their specific risk tolerance, and banks accessing this market generally
hold the loans they generate on their balance sheet. As a result, we believe additional capital that could be
invested in small business loans has largely been locked out of the market.

Value is in the Network Effect.
From a lender’s perspective, the importance of the return of principals and interests cannot be overemphasized. The ideal scenario is to choose from an abundant supply of rated agencies with fixed costs
providing services such as fraud & identity detection, credit scoring decisions, etc.

Being the first to create online credit adjudication in Canada in 1994, if not the world, and working with reputable
funders managing billions of dollars of securitized assets, we are well positioned to create a new, alternative
marketplace and automated administration platform for peer-to-peer lending with credit enhancement as a backbone to protect lenders’ interest.
In addition, our experience in creating a low-code self-generating development platform enables us to generate
robust smart contracts based on selected legal terms and administrative options. Programs are generated and
deployed instantly online and real-time via drag & drop and point & click easy-to-use interfaces with user-experience
as our number one priority for both borrowers and lenders.

In recent years, the economic powers of
disintermediation have materialized. Uber has
disrupted the transportation industry and achieved a
valuation of $69B [9]. Airbnb has disintermediated the
lodging sector and become the largest “hotel chain” in
the world without owning a “hotel”, giving them a value
of $31B [10]. 88% of the Fortune 500 companies were
too late to realize that value is in the network effect of
their users, not the cost of physical assets they own,
and as a result they disappeared [6].
P2P lending platforms built from the ground up on
blockchain technology are starting to emerge,
particularly with technologies such as Ethereum,
however, any asset locked up as collateral would have
to be equal or larger than the loan, complicating the
decision-making process. These platforms are still at a
very early stage.
There is an opportunity for the online marketplace
model to make unsecured loans as risk-free as
possible, due to its simplicity as compared to its titleloan alternative with assets as collaterals. We believe a
transparent and open marketplace with fully
automated administration is necessary.
Borrowers and lenders can have access to secure and
transparent information, complemented by advanced
technology and tools to enforce immutability. This can
make credit more affordable, less confusing, more
confident, and redirect existing pools of capital
trapped inside the banking system while attracting
new sources of capital. Marketplace lending has the
power to facilitate more efficient deployment of capital
and improve the global economy.

In sum, FintruX Network offers a disruptive environment which will be beneficial to the global economy.

Our mission is to make decentralized
financing with trust a no-brainer for
borrowers and lenders.

Our vision is to create an ecosystem where
transparency, risk reduction, and efficiency is
maximized and all participants win.

Participants in the FintruX Network ecosystem
can configure and construct each open-source
loan smart contract in real time and expected
obligations are transparent to all involved
parties. Trust is amplified by increasing the
freedom of choice. SMEs have the opportunity
to select from a list of rated lenders matching
their criteria, and ordinary citizens or accredited
investors can make their own credit decisions to
maximize control over their investments.
By providing our lenders access to risk-reduced
lending with novel credit enhancers, investors
have peace of mind and interest rates for
borrowers is lowered. Borrowers can choose to
be scored by a variety of credit scoring agencies
to build a more comprehensive view of their
creditworthiness and unlock access to
additional sources of funding.
Our platform removes the need for physical
infrastructure and brings out convenience and
total
automation;
increasing
efficiency,
reducing manual processes and improving the
overall user experience. Borrowers and lenders
of various risk profiles and tolerances can easily
find each other online. Special instructions such
as
refinance,
prepayment,
end-of-term
processing, are self-executing and previously
agreed upon.
The net result is faster growth of the small
business sector, a major driver in any economy;
through greater employment and innovation,
ultimately
driving

BUSINESS MODEL

FintruX Network is a multi-sided platform[13] and
ecosystem that delivers value not just to
borrowers and lenders, but also to incented thirdparty guarantors and partnered agencies.

Lenders verify funds they wish to lend, and are
credited on an FRX ledger* in their account. They
can then either choose a credit decision package
curated by a rated agency for a fee, modify from
reference credit decision packages, or create their
own.

*In order to facilitate payments within seconds, FintruX Network will introduce an FRX ledger to represent 1:1 of
the local currency, honored by lenders. FRX can be sent to borrowers within seconds. Only lenders can create and
destroy FRX ledger in exchange for fiat currencies.

Borrowers will go through popular identity
verification and credit scoring services paid for by
FintruX Network, and be instantly matched to
appropriate lenders. If they do not find a
preferred match, borrowers can choose to pay
for additional scoring services for extra datasets,
increasing the chances of a positive match with a
lender. Additionally, they can invite or choose an
incented third-party guarantor to compliment
their application and lower interest rates for a
fee. Borrowers can be represented by affiliate
marketing agency partners or brokers.
After due diligence, the smart contract is
deployed and funding is provided via FRX
automatically sent from lender to the borrowers.
Borrowers can now present FRX to the lender to
receive their funds in the required currencies.
Subsequently, lenders receive the invested
principal and/or interest upon payments made by
the borrowers.

BUSINESS MODEL
Credit Enhancers

12
We apply four (4) cascading levels of credit
enhancements to provide unprecedented risk
reduction towards unsecured loans:
Level #1: Over-collateralization (security deposit) of
10% held back on every loan, immediately covers the
delinquent amount;
Level #2: Cascading owner and incented guarantors
covers delinquent amounts over 10%;
Level #3: A cross-collateralization pool (credit risk
pool) made up of all over-collateralization amounts
of the same class covers additional delinquency;
Level #4: Failing all of the above, 5% of all FTX
tokens (FintruX Reserve) has been reserved to cover
remaining losses.

The implementation of incented guarantors
provides an unique situation where it is possible
for loans to be significantly lower risk.
As the platform operates, there will be a
continuous injection of security deposits into the
credit risk pool from new loans; creating a
buffering effect and making it a safe insurance
to neutralize the credit/default risk for lenders.
Performance statistics on each pool will be
transparent to the lenders involved.

13

CREDIT ENHANCERS
Security Deposit

Guarantor Protection

Level #1:

Level #2:

10% protection.

Since the security deposit is one-tenth of the loan, it is capable of
covering one out of ten bad loans from the same borrower.

Complete protection by owner
and incented guarantors.

For loans under their protection, the owner and incented guarantor(s) are responsible for
losses over 10% in a cascading manner. The company owner is always the first guarantor
to be responsible.
©2018 FintruX.com. All rights reserved.

14

CREDIT ENHANCERS

Cross-collateralization is a term used when the collateral for
one loan is also used as collateral for another loan.

Cross-Collateralization (Credit Risk Pool)

FintruX Reserve

Level #3:

Level #4:

Additional protection via
credit risk pool.

The cross-collateralization pool is made up of the security deposits (10% hold back) of
loans in the same class (risk & currency). The class of any particular loan will be verified
by FintruX Network’s internal reference score. If all guarantors for a loan default, then the
respective pool can cover additional losses, neutralizing the risk for lenders.
Continuous injection of security deposits from new loans and recovery from defaulted
loans will make this pool one of the safest insurance mechanisms.

Ultimate reserve protection

Failing all previous credit enhancers, 5% of all FTX Tokens has been reserved to
cover remaining losses. This scenario is extremely unlikely in a healthy ecosystem of
reasonable actors, incented guarantors, and loan volume.

15

BUSINESS MODEL
Trust-Institution

A trust-institution is a reputable, prominent and progressive commercial financial
institution that acts as a trusted escrow agent for lenders. Upon funding, the lender
automatically sends 90% of the loan in FRX to the borrower, and 10% of the loan in fiat
(security deposit) must be transferred to the trust-institution to participate in the
over/cross collateralization pool.
At the end of the loan term, provided there are no delinquencies in the same credit risk
pool, the lenders would receive the security deposit from the trust-institution.

Incented Guarantor

An incented guarantor is an investor who takes on potential risk of guaranteeing loans as
a third party for a share in the reduced interest.
Incented guarantors can sign up, be credit scored, and indicate the class of loans they’d
like to participate in. When borrowers are applying for a loan, they are able to select from
a list of incented guarantors with various credit ratings and incentive appetite to lower the
risk of their loan application, and thus reducing overall interest rates. Borrowers can also
directly invite friends and family to be their incented guarantors.

up their risk and compensation profiles;
• Pays a percentage of their incentive fee to
FintruX Network;
• Pays for ID/KYC/Credit Scoring services to
agency;

TOKEN UTILITY
Planned benefits for FTX Token holders (if held on FintruX Network or in synchronized wallets) include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Discounts on FintruX Network service fees;
Exclusive access to features and products;
Enhanced service and benefits;
Ability to refer friends and family to be users to get rewarded;
Improved loan terms (borrowers only);
Collateralize loans with FTX to lower interest rates (borrowers only);
Access to additional classes of loans (lenders only);
Additional reputation for risk assessment (borrowers, lenders, service providers);

Automated Gas Fee Handling:

Even though the deployment of each smart
contract is performed by and gas fee paid
for by the FintruX Network, participants on
the FintruX Network are required to
maintain a small amount of Ether in their
accounts. These Ether will pay the gas fees
charged by the Ethereum Virtual Network
for the execution of the actions within these
smart contracts.

Function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool) {
require(canTransferTokens());
// Team tokens lock 1 year
if (_value < token4Gas) {
revert();
// do nothing if less than allowed minimum
}
if (balances[msg.sender] >= _value && balances[_to] + _value > balances[_to]) {
balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);

FintruX Network would reimburse these tiny
gas fees to top up the participants’ accounts
if they happen to fall below a required
minimum. Nevertheless, it is generally a
good practice to avoid these tiny
reimbursements to avoid unnecessary
increase in block sizes.

}

// Keep a minimum balance of gas. Won't execute if the account has enough ETH.
if (msg.sender.balance < minGas4Accts) {
// reimburse gas in ETH to keep a minimal balance for next transaction.
if (!msg.sender.send(gas4Token)) {
GasRebateFailed(msg.sender,gas4Token);
}
}
if (_to.balance < minGas4Accts) {
// reimburse gas in ETH to keep a minimal balance for next transaction.
if (_to.send(gas4Token)) {
GasRebateFailed(_to,gas4Token);
}
}
return true;
} else {
revert();
// Caller may not check "return false;"
}

17
The FintruX Network is powered by FTX (“or ꭍ”),
a utility token that rewards participation in the
marketplace. Activities on the platform have
costs that are specified in FTX, but tied to fiat.
This enables a self-regulating mechanism — if
FTX becomes more expensive, the amount of FTX
required for services will automatically reduce.
All participants on the ecosystem will pay and be
paid for their services in FTX token. These would
include:
• ID/KYC/Credit scoring;
• On-time payment (good behavior) rewards and
late fees (punishment);
• FintruX Network service fees;
• Principal and interest payments (optional);
• API licensing;
• Additional services to be offered;

The FintruX 5% Reserve acting as the ultimate
level of credit enhancements is held in FTX. Over
time, the operation of the business should drive
this reserve pool to grow in value, providing
greater levels of security for the lenders and
lower overall interest rates.
The ownership of FTX Token does not have any rights
other than the rights to exchange and claim them on the
platform. To be certain, FTX has no ownership rights or
equity or security or equivalent, intellectual property rights
or any other form of control or revenue sharing relating to
the FintruX Network.

Configure Financing Parameters

Instant Matching

Lenders pre-define their parameters based on a set of decision tables
available on a list of packaged classes provided by rated agencies. The
package may include their choice of fraud, identity, and credit scoring
agencies. Alternatively they can construct their own or modify from a
reference credit decision package. Lenders pay a fixed fee to FintruX Network
as setup fee for each lending instruction (changes are free).

PROCESS ANALYSIS
The following high-level process charts are representative diagrams and final process may differ.
Get Funded

Collateralization

After a due diligence process, the application is approved, a fully customized and
simplified smart contract is generated for the participants, with detailed information.
When the borrower confirms the application, this smart contract will be added to the
distributed ledger.

As part of the credit enhancements, there is a security deposit of 10% per loan. It will be stored with
the local trust-institution in the respective cross-collateralization pool (credit risk pool) determined by
FintruX Network. Both borrower and lender each pays ~2% fee to FintruX Network for loan
maintenance upon funding.

Funding is immediately triggered as all relevant and required documents/images are
already captured and verified by the selected fraud and identity agent.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Decentralized
Rating & Review

We provide and maintain a decentralized review platform for borrowers, lenders and all service agencies on the blockchain. In contrast, reviews
written on a third-party website are subject to change by the site owner – there is no integrity in the current non-blockchain based systems. The need
of gaining qualified feedback/market research data to enhance the quality of risk assessment, service and transparency cannot be over-emphasized.
On the other side, we see borrowers, lacking a reliable source of comparability between different lenders as well as the possibility to give unfiltered
feedback to share their opinion and thoughts. The same for lenders who can now rate and write reviews on their borrowers and agencies;
subsequently these can be used as part of the credit scoring mechanism for assessment of credit risk.

When the borrower has selected the package and is ready to commit, a list of documents will be requested by the selected fraud and identity agent.
Both personal and business documents are required. Examples of know-your-customer (KYC) documents are:

Business:

Due Diligence

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Business name, address, email address, phone number
What your business does
How long the business has been open
Annual sales
Annual business profit before taxes
The type of legal entity your business is
The percentage of the business you own
How you plan to use the money
If your business has any outstanding debt
How many employees you have
Whether you own or rent your office space
If you have property or liability insurance

Personal:
•
•
•

The value of your personal bank and retirement
accounts
Household income
If you have personal life insurance

As all the required documentations are submitted, the fraud and identity
agent will coordinate the validation and either approve the transaction,
request for more information or decline the application.
With the permission of the borrower, these documentations can be made
into a KYC profile so that it can be reused, simplifying future due diligence
processes.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES
FintruX Network initially introduces two asset classes of loans:

Growing
Asset Classes

- $5,000 to $250,000 based on borrower (SME) credit, financial & business scores + guarantors credit & financial scores;
- $250,000 to $500,000 based on borrower (SME) credit, financial & business scores + guarantors credit & financial scores + lender’s option to convert loan
into X% equity any time during the term of the loan (to come in phase II);

Self-serve options such as prepayment and refinance are available for the convenience of borrowers if selected by the lenders. Prepayment is necessary
when the small business can afford to pay back the loan earlier to save on the interest cost. On the contrary, when times are tough, refinancing can avoid
delinquency which can affect ratings and incur extra penalty charges.

Post Funding
Administration

Each funded transaction is represented by a smart contract generated by FintruX Network based on the agreed upon configurations by both parties. This
smart contract is visible and transparent to parties involved. It is immutable and censorship resilient. Selected administrative options are all executable
based on this smart contract which will last through the life-time of the financing.

Automated messaging delivered via text to mobile, email, social media, etc. are available on many occasions such as funding, payments, delinquency,
collection, expiry, etc..

Portfolio
Management

Our portfolio functionality provides a summary view of
key metrics as customizable to individual borrowers,
lenders and service agencies. Not only can they get an
overview of the transactions they have or have not
executed, performance indicators are displayed and
complex structures simplified.
High-level information such as delinquency, defaults,
and other performance information is available and
can be visualized and exported.

Market
Insights

FintruX Network has the ability to aggregate statistics to provide
more relevant and exceptional view of the financial market.
Summary overview with drill down of market activity across
countries, market sectors, exposures, etc. will be displayed.
The dashboard to individual borrowers, lenders and service
agencies displays selective market data and user notifications
with customization to their preferences.

BENEFITS TO USERS
Benefits to Borrowers

Benefits to Lenders

Access to Affordable Credit. Our innovative marketplace model, online delivery, process
automation, and credit enhancements enable us to offer borrowers interest rates that are
more competitive than the rates charged by other financial companies offering unsecure
loans such as traditional P2P lending platforms and banks, not to mention credit cards.

Access to Risk-Reduced Investing. Credit enhancements historically only available to
securitization funding of large portfolios is now available to lenders on FintruX Network. By
applying cascading credit enhancements, FintruX Network seeks to neutralize the lender’s credit
risk and, in the case of a default, provide cascading levels of insurance to cover the loss.

Superior Borrowing Experience. We offer a fast and easy-to-use online application process
and provide borrowers with access to live support and online automation throughout the
process and for the lifetime of the financing. Borrowers can choose to be scored by a variety
of credit scoring agencies to build a more comprehensive and holistic view of their
creditworthiness and unlock access to additional sources of funding. Our goal is to form
long-term relationships with borrowers, facilitating their access to an array of financial
products that meet their evolving needs over time.

Branding Opportunity. All participants can provide ratings and transparent reviews on the
blockchain to establish trusted lenders, borrowers, and service agents within the ecosystem.
With better ratings, borrowers can save on interest rates on subsequent loans. Moreover,
borrowers can take this opportunity to give unfiltered feedback to share their opinion and
provide a basis of comparability between different lenders.
Transparency and Fairness. Each customer contract is generated as a self-executing fullycustomized smart contract on a blockchain. It is secure, transparent, immutable, and
censorship resilient. Historical data and expected obligations are at borrower’s fingertips.

Lowered Transaction Fee. Consequently, since each smart contract is fully-customized and
simplified for each loan, it is much easier to understand and without ambiguity. No more "if
... then ... else" statements and unnecessary code. Smaller programs lead to lower
transaction fees (gas); in fact, this is paid for by FintruX Network.
Super-Fast and Efficient Funding. We leverage online data and intelligent technology to
instantly match risk, credit rating and any unique parameters pre-determined by lenders in
decision tables. Borrowers can evaluate options and are instantly matched to lenders of
their choice without impacting their credit score.
Self-Service. All available options such as refinance, prepayments, etc. can be done online
within minutes, on all devices including mobiles and tablets.

Superior Lending Experience. We offer a fully automated application process and provide
lenders with access to live support and online tools throughout the process and for the lifetime
of the financing. Our goal is to form long-term relationships with lenders, facilitating their
relatively risk-free offerings to their borrowers.
Branding Opportunity. Borrowers can provide ratings and transparent reviews on a blockchain
to establish trusted lenders within the ecosystem. With better ratings, lenders can build up their
brand and reputation. Moreover, lenders can gain access to qualified feedback and market
research data to enhance the service they provide to borrowers.
Transparency and Fairness. Lenders can make their own credit decisions based on facts,
market insights, and/or third-party analysis for the first time, thus giving them more control over
their investments.
Access to a Network of Expertise. A network of rated agencies such as fraud, identity, credit
scoring and credit decision are readily available.
Attractive Returns. By having access to lower risk of funding and cutting major costs associated
with administering the financing, these savings become additional profit margins. Once their
decision tables are chosen and configured, the whole lending process is automated.
More Satisfied Customers. Self-service increases customer satisfactions. It is fast, efficient,
transparent and expectations are met easily. Saving the lender’s time means they can service
their borrowers better. More satisfied customers can turn into more business.

REAL WORLD USE CASE 1

Paul, an airline pilot domiciled in Singapore, has S$500,000 extra savings that he is not planning to spend for a while. He decides to invest that money in a P2P
loan, so he signs up to FintruX.com stating that he is a lender. He verifies that he has S$500,000 ready to lend, and is issued 500,000 FRX. After customizing two
different credit decision packages of different risk profiles to split up his funds, he pays FintruX Network S$500 for each package in FTX. The credit decision
packages also come with reputable fraud, identity and credit scoring agents. He signs the power of attorney for FintruX Network to execute lending transactions
on his behalf based on his rules defined in those packages.
Paul is now ready to engage in automated matching to borrowers. Upon funding, he will pay ~2% maintenance fee in FTX to FintruX Network.

REAL WORLD USE CASE 2

29
Jane, the owner of ABC Ltd, a company from
San Francisco, California, wants to borrow
US$20,000 to pay for an unbudgeted
marketing campaign. She requests an
unsecured loan from FintruX.com. Knowing
that there is 10% hold-back as security
deposit, she would receive only US$18,000
when successfully funded.
She filters through a set of parameters
including a range of interest rates and the
number of installment payments she will
make. After answering some preliminary
questions, she is pre-approved. To find the
optimal interest rates she now goes through
the most popular identity and credit checks
which will be paid for by FintruX Network. If
she wishes to retrieve the details of her score,
she can pay to receive the specifics. If she
wants to explore more opportunities to reach
additional lenders and lower interest rates,
she has the option to pay for service agents
for additional credit checks, and invite
incented guarantors to join her loan
application.

Jane is now committed to return a debt of US$18,000 in 24 monthly installments of US$989.07. US$18,000 in FRX is immediately
deposited to Jane’s account. She may present that at her own discretion to the lender for the exchange of fiat currency. The lender
deposits US$2,000 directly with the local trust-institution to the appropriate cross-collateralization pool (credit risk pool) to cover
credit/default losses. If Jane pays back her loan gracefully over the course of her term, and there are no defaults in the same risk
pool, the lender will receive his security deposit of US$2,000.

She finalizes her decision, including selecting
her favorite lender. The partner due- diligence
service agents selected by her lender verifies
her
information
and
completes
the
documentation and due diligence process. An
open-source smart contract is generated. She
is satisfied after reviewing and the loan smart
contract is deployed.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
We believe the following strengths differentiate us and provide us with competitive
advantages in realizing the potential of our market opportunity.
True P2P Lending

For the first time, lenders are able to choose from a
variety of credit models from established credit decision
agencies and evaluate which ones fit best for their needs,
modify reference packages, or even build their own
models from scratch. Ordinary citizens have the
opportunity to tap into small business credit and make
their own credit decisions based on facts, market insights,
and/or third-party analysis; giving them unprecedented
control over their investments. Payments are transferred
directly between the participants, and FintruX Network is
not a party of the loan agreement.

Unprecedented Risk-Reduction

Our background and technology enables us to create
novel credit enhancers for our true P2P lending platform,
acting as cascading levels of insurances to cover potential
losses. This reduces the lender’s credit risk and interest
rates for borrowers is lowered. This unlocks tremendous
liquidity for small businesses, who typically do not have
the adequate collateral to obtain a secured loan.

Token as Transaction Fee

Many service agencies are still charging an upfront
licensing fee, annual maintenance fee, and hourly
customization fee. FintruX Network will pay them in fiat or
a combination of fiat / FTX while collecting all fee
payments in FTX tokens. This simplifies the onboarding
experience by removing the barrier to entry. Eventually,
service providers will directly charge FTX to their users
per use in a retail model.

Decentralized Ledger Technology (Blockchain)

Using blockchains such as Ethereum provides high availability. It is decentralized
and its hashing provides immense security on identification and privacy. Smart
contracts are not prone to failures such as power cuts, node failures etc. There is
no risk of misplacing or losing the customer contract as the contract is saved on a
distributed ledger. Data records are immutable and censorship resilient. All
activities and documentations relating to each financing is locked-down with full
audit, even locations and conditions of items if requested. The lending process is
transparent and fraud is minimized.

No-Code Generation and Instant Deployment

Our smart contracts will not be hand-written. Transitioning Robocoder’s low-code
development platform into a no-code development platform enables all possible
contract combinations to be presented as user interface to borrowers and
lenders. Codes with the latest technology are generated and deployed at real
time. Special instructions such as refinance, prepayment, end-of-term processing,
are self-executing and previously agreed upon. Each financing on FintruX Network
is regulated by its self-executing smart contract and automates administration
which increases efficiency, eliminates human error, and reduces risk.

Many Systems-as-a-Platform Architecture

Smart contracts provide transparency to both borrowers and lenders. It is
unambiguous and choices made are visible on a user-friendly interface. Both
parties can examine each contract at a granular level and continue to monitor
ongoing performance. Instead of one huge program to process millions of
borrower contracts, our platform is comprised of millions of small smart
contracts, fully-customized and simplified for each borrower contract. No
arbitration is required, and expected obligations are transparent. Highly reduced
"if ... then ... else" statements and unnecessary code. Smaller programs lead to
lower gas fees.

Open Ecosystem

FintruX Network partners with rated agencies such as
fraud/ID/KYC/AML service agents, credit scoring and
decision agents, escrow agents, collection and
recovery specialists, wallets, exchanges, brokers,
insurance companies and technology companies. By
enabling borrowers and lenders direct access to a
wide host of financial services, we create maximized
opportunities and freedom to make the right
decisions.

Decentralized Reputation Ratings

We provide a decentralized review platform for all
participants recorded on the blockchain. Borrowers
can now rate their lenders and have a reliable source
of comparability between different lenders. Lenders
can rate and write reviews on their borrowers; which
can be used for additional assessment of credit risk.
Service providers can also be rated, offering a new
retail branding opportunity.

These provides tremendous time and cost
advantages over other P2P lending platforms.

31

RISK ADDRESSED
Below is a demonstration that FintruX Network has evaluated all risks and concluded that unsecured
loans offered to SMEs in the ecosystem should enjoy lower rates due to the risk-reduction
mechanisms introduced.
Identity Risk. Only reputable fraud and identity agencies will be allowed to
operate on FintruX Network.
Credit Risk. This is managed by each credit decision package provided by rated
agents to a level commensurate with the return. Higher risk higher return.
Risk of Loss. This is significantly reduced, if not neutralized, through four (4)
cascading credit enhancers.
Locked-in Risk. Liquidity is important to a lender. Since lenders only need to
disperse funds per loan commitment, uncommitted funds are available for use at
any time. For the committed funds, FintruX Network will provide a trading platform
available to lenders to trade and securitize their loans with each other as part of
phase II.

Risk of Multiple Borrowing. FintruX Network discourages lending more than the
borrower can afford. It can be difficult to prevent borrowers from the practice of
taking loans from different sources within the same period. Some borrowers may
also borrow from one account to cover another. We will work with partners (credit
bureaus, etc.) to determine if the same borrowers have other obligations.

Devaluation Risk. Since credit risk pools are held with the trust-institution
for the duration of their terms in its original currencies, there is no
devaluation risk to worry about.
Lack of Information Risk. Each borrowing is one unique smart contract –
unambiguous, immutable, no arbitration required.
Prepayment Risk. A reasonable fee can be charged by the lenders for each
early prepayment to compensate for the opportunity loss in interest
charges.
Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the possibility that a fixed-rate debt
instrument will decline in value as a result of a rise in interest rates. This is
out of the scope of FintruX Network.

Risk of Delinquency. This risk is mitigated by self-serve refinance option
and guarantors. We also recommend texting, email, rating, reviews, rewards,
late charges, etc. as tools to deter delinquencies. For small businesses,
delinquency will negatively affect owner’s credit and company reputation.

LENDING BEST PRACTICES
1. Fraud and Identity Management - all fraud and identity
service agents will be screened to make sure proper due
diligence are implemented to prevent fraud and identity
scam. For small business borrowers, not just the business
identity will be checked, the identity of the business owner
will be checked as well. In addition, the name of the bank
account where funds will be transferred must match either
the owner name or the business name.
2. Credit Score Management - all credit scoring service
agents will be screened for professionalism. For small
business borrowing, both business and owner(s) will be credit
checked. For example, if the borrowing business is a startup,
that is, the company is less than one (1) year old, the owner
must have over 650 FICO score.
3. Credit Decision Management - all credit decision service
agents will be screened for best practices. FintruX Network
will provide reference scores developed by our in-house
experts to determine the appropriate credit risk pools which
can be used as a reference opinion for lenders to compare
against their own or third-party credit decisions.

With the above due diligence we trust that we can successfully keep FintruX Network running as a healthy lending
highway for all legitimate participants.

32

Now that we are capable of making unsecured
loans highly secure, the onus is on FintruX Network
to prevent abuses. These best practices describe
how we can keep borrowing scams and
unreasonable lending away from our ecosystem.
In addition to having built-in credit enhancers to
protect lenders, collection will be handled by
partnered collection agents.
Notifications will be sent to borrowers when they
miss a payment. The partnered collection agents
chosen by the lender will step in when
delinquencies is over six (6) months. Any recovery
amount we receive from the collection process are
payable to FintruX Reserve, credit risk pools,
guarantors, and lenders in that order.
In the case of a delinquent/default loan having a
incented guarantor, collection will be performed by
this guarantor.

In our experience in applying credit enhancements
such as security deposit and credit risk pools to
securitization funding, the cost of fund (interest
rate) can be typically reduced by 100 basis point for
investment grade portfolios. We expect the
application of incented guarantors and token
collateral reserve should further enhance this.

ARCHITECTURE
Blockchain
FintruX Network marketplace leverages decentralized
blockchain technology which offers a completely
trustless interaction between parties, minimizing third
party verification costs and commissions. It allows
consistent, shared and secure access to all participants.
Our no-code development environment generates smart
contracts onto various blockchains, including but not
limited to Ethereum - leveraging the benefits and
strengths of concurrent blockchain technologies.

Private, High-Performance Storage
In order to process certain transactions, private
and confidential information is required to be
stored and exchanged. Our storage is a secured
SQL database. It complements the blockchain
network by providing fast access to data such
as borrower records or other confidential
information. Multiple levels of security, external
authentication and strong usage profiling are
involved.

33
The FintruX Network architecture is a highly
automated, scalable and robust combination of
the latest advances in blockchain technology,
decades of user-experience, and most efficient
computation and data management in the
appropriate layers of client, web-services, and
server tiers.
The user interface (“UI”) is implemented using
ReactJS which is fast and responsive to handle
client-side logics. JSON web services will connect
ReactJS to Node.js which handles backend
business logic. Combining ReactJS, JSON and
Node.js has proven to be very fast, lightweight
and robust architecture.
This web-app renders responsively on desktop,
tablets and phones. We also plan to develop
special mobile apps to utilize native phone
capabilities and create unique user-experiences.
The backend composes of three databases:
Ethereum blockchain, MSSQL, and Firebase.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine handles

NO-CODE GENERATION
“In algebra, we turn 5(2+x) + 3(5x + 4) – (x2)2 into a simpler form 20x + 22 – x4 before solving for x. It is much easier to
understand and much easier to solve.

In writing, we turn “you’ll hear from me coming back to this point again and again” into a simpler form “I’ll keep
coming back to this point”. That is, we are constantly simplifying constructs to communicate more effectively.”

All the code is specifically catered for
one fully customized event.

Smaller programs lead to lower gas
fees and faster transactions.
Simplest is best.

Robocoder Corporation provides the infrastructure
and low-code technology to build the no-code
generation for FintruX Network, providing
immense benefits. In addition to generating the
architecture for the system, it also enables instant
deployment of unique loan smart contracts.
Traditional automation is one system for all
varieties of transactions – lots of “if-then-else”
statements, very complicated. We are shifting the
programming paradigm with FintruX Network. We
enable the generation of one unique program
(“Smart Contract”) for each borrower contract to be
deployed at real-time on the blockchain via
configurable user interfaces for the platform
participants. By generating a new contract for each
individual use case, each program is in its simplest
form, no more if-then-else statements.
What it means to our programmer: before, we
used to make all programs flexible, no hardcoding; now it is just the opposite - all hard-coding
to make sure it is in its simplest form and fully
customized for one scenario, one situation, one
event.
The Smart Contract becomes a binding agreement
between the participants - unambiguous,
immutable and no arbitration required on the
terms and conditions, and status of repayment at
any time.

BIG DATA

FintruX Network will generate large amounts of
data which will be of huge value to our customers.
The data will provide a market insight which does
not exist today. Partners and external companies
are able to utilize this anonymized data as part of
their solutions, even if they are not directly using
the FintruX marketplace. Parts of our software will
be open source, available to other financing
solution vendors to use. By doing this we aim to
create a strong ecosystem with an active
community of adopters.
FintruX Network will gather all data from the
platform and all available API, service agents, etc.
We are leveraging key partnerships with Robocoder
Corporation,
Enterprise
Ethereum
Alliance,
Microsoft and various universities to conduct
research for the purpose of improving credit
decision making, fraud, identity management, and
risk reduction in the industry.

BIG DATA ANALYTICS
Collecting all data from FintruX platform, partners, and
available API

Utilizing big data analytics, we can provide AI advice
to lenders on how to improve their credit model
over time, and in timely response to market
movements and relevant news. In doing so, we
enable lenders the power to ensure that they are
providing services to the best borrowers for their

EVOLUTION OF PLATFORM
Phase I: CREDIT-ENHANCED FINANCING
Using the credit enhancement principles of securitization, we deliver highly secure
unsecured loans to benefit the small businesses borrowers, investors, and financial
institutions of the world.

Phase II: ADDITIONAL LICENSED FEATURES
FintruX Network will provide a trading platform for lenders to trade and securitize their loans
in licensed jurisdictions. Additional enhancements such as convertible bonds, crowdfunding, AI
advice, etc. can be applied.

Phase III: EXPANDED ASSET CLASSES
FintruX will invite many innovative asset classes created by other network partners to
prosper in this ecosystem so it becomes the go-to financing hub of the world.

Phase IV: ONE WORLD
The interest rate of one country can be as high as 40 times than another. For instance, the prime rate
of Madagascar can be as high as 60% while Japan can be as low as 1.5% [4]. Though there are
currency controls, exchange rate risk, and other regulatory and localization issues to resolve, FintruX
will use its best effort to enable cross-countries financing by partnering with wallets, exchanges, and
regulatory bodies. Ultimately, small business borrowers from higher rate countries can take
advantage of lower rates offered by lenders located in lower rate countries.
