DETERMINATION OF PRODUCT
SHELF LIFE AND ESTABLISHMENT
OF EXPIRATION DATES
by Will McHale - Life Sciences

Abstract:
One of the requirements of ISO Guide 34 accredited reference material
manufacturers is to perform comprehensive stability studies in order to
ensure that the best products possible are available to customers. A
stability study looks at many quality factors in an effort to determine
how long the product will maintain its integrity once it is out of the
controlled conditions of the laboratory. Ultimately, it allows the
manufacturer to accurately determine shelf life. This short paper
highlights the process ERA follows in determining a product shelf life
and how expiration dates are selected and defended.

Stability studies may include a number of different types of physical, chemical and microbiological tests, with the focus in the case
of certified reference materials (CRMs) being on analyte certified values. In early stages, accelerated stability testing (at relatively high
temperature and/or humidity) can be used as a “worst case” evaluation tool. Testing under more gentle conditions (those recommended
for long-term shelf storage) are used to determine a product’s shelf life and expiration dates. Control dates dictate when products should
be removed from a manufacturers’ active inventory, while stability dates dictate when products should no longer be used by customers.
For ERA single-use TOC products (30-60 mL), we use the following product example to illustrate the determination of stability date
(actual data from components of a single-use 40 mL USP system suitability test kit; USP Sucrose and USP 1,4-benzoquinone):
Data collected beyond 90 days individually for sucrose (Fig. 1)
and 1,4-benzoquinone (Fig. 2) and for the ratio test itself
(Fig. 3) are shown to be excellent. In this case, where the
expiration period is less than one year, the control date would
equal the stability date. For this 40 mL system suitability
product shelf is defensible at 120 days – twice the stated shelf
life of 60 days.

Understanding that customers must comply with the USP
acceptance criteria of 100% ± 15% as set forth in USP chapter
<643> for system suitability test results, acceptance criteria for
sucrose and 1,4-benzoquinone is set at ± 5% of made-to values
to remain within 10% when compounded.

For ERA bulk TOC products (125-1000 mL), we use the following product example to illustrate the determination of stability date (actual data
from components of a single-use 125 mL USP system suitability test kit; USP Sucrose and USP 1,4-benzoquinone):
Again, data collected beyond 180 days individually for sucrose
(Fig. 4) and 1,4-benzoquinone (Fig. 5) and for the ratio test itself
(Fig. 6) are shown to be excellent. With an expiration period
of less than one year, the control date would again equal the
stability date. For this 125 mL system suitability product, shelf
life is defensible beyond 360 days – twice the stated shelf life of
180 days.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, ISO Guide 34
accredited reference material producers must conduct long-term
stability testing programs that include the determination of
stability/expiration dates (the date after which the product should
not be used by the customer) and the setting of control dates
(the date after which a product should not be sold) for products.
T he calculation of stability dates requires creating a process
that includes components such as determination of the scope
of data collection, establishing a testing schedule, collecting
data, statistical analysis of data and the determination of data
acceptance limits.

In the process of selecting a provider of CRMs, understand that using
their products and services means you will be integrating their
quality levels into your laboratory processes as well. You should be
discriminating in your evaluation process and consider seriously
their demonstrated commitment to quality. Accreditations like ISO
Guide 34 and ISO 17025 are excellent indicators of commitment to
quality and overall scientific capabilities.

Control Date:

The date after which a product should not be sold.

Stability Date:

The date at which the best graphical line for the
stability data crosses the acceptance criteria.

Shelf Life:

The time between manufacturing of the product
and the stability date.

Expiration Date: The date after which the product should not be
used by the customer.

ISO 17025:2005 certification, covering the
competence of testing and calibration laboratories,
ensures that a company’s laboratory tests are
performed correctly, and that attestations of product
quality are appropriate and defensible. All aspects of
raw material, in-process and final product verification
are covered by this accreditation. It certifies the
company’s ability to demonstrate the robustness of
their quality program through comprehensive and
accurate product testing.

ERA’S ACCREDITATIONS
ERA is accredited as a provider of proficiency testing and certified
reference material products.
Our two facilities in the U.S. and UK are registered to ISO 9001:2008
and accredited to ISO Guide 34, ISO 17025 and ISO 17043.*

ISO 9001
ISO 9001 is a quality management standard that
applies to all types of organizations regardless of size
or function. This international standard helps both
product and service oriented organizations achieve
standards of quality that are recognized and respected
throughout the world. This is accomplished mostly
through quality management practices that extend
into all areas of an organization. ISO 9001 registered
companies must have written procedures and training
documentation in the areas of customer service,
complaint handling, product design, purchasing,
manufacturing, product evaluation, packaging
and shipping. Included on our ISO 9001:2008
accreditation scope are Synthetic Reference Materials
and Quality Control Standards.

ISO 9001:2008
CERTIFICATE NO. 10551

Our ISO Guide 34:2008 accreditation is targeted
specifically to Certified Reference Material (CRM)
manufacturers. For a manufacturer to become ISO
Guide 34 registered, the policies and processes
employed to design, manufacture and certify
reference materials must be validated and proven
to be accurate and robust. For CRMs, ISO Guide 34
also requires that each Certificate of Analysis
(C of A) include an uncertainty statement that reflects
all sources of error involved in certifying the standard,
including measurements and material purity; it
must allow for complete traceability of the CRM.
In fact, the C of A itself must also conform to a strict
set of criteria.

ISO 17043 is designed specifically for
Proficiency Testing providers. ISO 17043 specifies
the essential activities that need to be evaluated when
conducting inter-laboratory testing comparisons. ISO
17043 defines the criteria related to study design,
sample manufacture and the ensuring of homogeneity
and stability, which must be taken into account in the
design and execution of proficiency testing schemes.
