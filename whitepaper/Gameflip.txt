Crypto-token for buying and selling
gaming digital goods
Executive Summary
This whitepaper describes a new decentralized ecosystem where digital goods on all gaming
platforms – mobile, PC, console, and VR/AR – can be sold as liquid assets using trustless (i.e., fully
secure) smart contracts executing on blockchain technology. The digital goods transactions will take
place using a crypto-token called “FLIP”.
The new decentralized ecosystem is founded by Gameﬂip, a venture-backed technology company
which operates a robust digital goods marketplace with millions of users. Gameﬂip is a corporation
based in Silicon Valley, California, USA. The company is managed by gaming industry experts with
decades of combined experience, and funded by top tier venture capital investors. Established in
2014, Gameﬂip has already been at the forefront addressing the largely unmet demand for liquidity for
digital goods. Prior to the advent of blockchain technology, we have already built the most
comprehensive centralized digital goods marketplace platform and have witnessed tremendous
growth in the platform for the last two years. Now, with blockchain technology, our new decentralized
ecosystem will enable ubiquitous liquidity for digital goods, unlocking exponentially more value for the
gaming market and its participants.
In decentralized networks, economic value and governance are distributed among the network
participants, not concentrated in a single organization. Here, the participants are primarily game
developers, publishers and gamers, plus digital goods marketplaces, transaction enablers, and other
contributors. In this ecosystem, economic value is distributed among all participants, ensuring that
they are compensated for the value they bring.

The new decentralized ecosystem will create tremendous beneﬁts for both gamers and game
developers and publishers. (In this white paper, we sometimes refer to game developers and
publishers together “game publishers”.)
●

Gamers will have unprecedented ﬂexibility to buy, sell and trade the digital goods at the
peer-to-peer level (i.e, with other gamers), unlocking signiﬁcant value for gamers from their
hard-earned digital goods. Importantly, they will transact in a zero-fraud environment, one that
never existed before the availability of blockchain technology.

●

Game developers and publishers will generate signiﬁcantly more revenue for a number of
reasons:
○

First, the new ecosystem encourages gamers to purchase substantially more digital
goods, and at higher prices, than they do today, knowing that they can recoup their
investments later by selling them freely and securely in a large liquid marketplace.

○

Second, game publishers will enjoy a brand new revenue stream – whenever gamers
transact using blockchain smart contracts, game publishers will receive a commission.

○

Third, under our unique network growth model, game publishers that help drive
adoption of FLIP will be rewarded handsomely – with tangible economic beneﬁts – as
described more fully later in this white paper.

The importance of the point above – the tangible beneﬁts for game publishers – cannot be
underestimated. Game publishers will play a very key role in this ecosystem, and each game
publisher will have to choose which crypto-token(s) to adopt. FLIP is the only crypto-token
with an ecosystem with built-in, concrete, and generous beneﬁts for game publishers. As
such, we are conﬁdent that FLIP will be adopted quickly and will emerge as the dominant
crypto-token for the gaming industry.
Indeed, the new ecosystem will likely create a paradigm shift for the gaming industry. Demands for
digital goods will increase, gamers will gain trust in the network and buy and trade more, multiplier
effects will kick in, and the overall market will grow exponentially. Studies have estimated that gaming
revenue will grow to $128.5 billion by 2020, but that number does not even include the trading of
digital goods on the blockchain. We estimate that the value of digital goods transactions via the
Gameﬂip decentralized ecosystem, using FLIP, will eventually top $20 billion.

1. The Market
1.1. Overview
The global gaming market is enormous. According to Newzoo's latest study, 2.2 billion gamers will
generate $108.9 billion in game revenues in 2017. This represents an increase of $7.8 billion, or 7.8%,
from the year before. The growth will continue, with 2020 revenues projected at $128.5 billion.1

Within the global gaming market, digital game revenues account for about 87%, or $94.4 billion in
2017. The free-to-play model of gameplay, with revenue derived from the sale of digital goods, has
emerged as the dominant framework. For example, Supercell, the maker of mobile games like Clash
Royale and Clash of Clans, generated $2.3 billion in sales in 2016. Even though gamers can play
Supercell's games for free, they purchased $2.3 billion of digital goods to level up and compete with
each other.2

1.2. Direct-from-Publisher Digital Goods vs. Gamer-Earned Digital
Goods

Figure 1.2(a)

Direct-from-Publisher Digital Goods
The estimated $94.4 billion of 2017 digital game revenues in Newzoo’s study is comprised of only the
digital goods sold by game publishers directly to gamers. Under the dominant free-to-play model,
these direct-from-publisher digital goods typically take the form of “keys” or “consumables”:
●

As an example (Figure 1.2(a) above) , a gamer purchases a “key”, and then uses the key to
unlock a “mystery box” that he acquired in the course of playing. Inside the mystery box, he
would ﬁnd digital goods like weapons, armors, or cosmetic skins.

●

As another example, instead of using a key to unlock the mystery box, the mystery box would
simply unlock itself, except that it would take time and the gamer would need to wait many
hours or even days. There, the gamer may purchase “consumables”, like gold coins, and then
he would pay the gold coins to accelerate the waiting time.

These are most often mystery boxes in the sense that the digital goods to be released will be random,
based on probability. This has proven to be the most successful monetization technique for
free-to-play games.

6

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

Gamer-Earned Digital Goods
As indicated in the example above, the gamer did not purchase the weapons, armors, or cosmetic
skins directly from the game publisher. He purchased the key directly, but he had to earn the rest (i.e.,
acquire the mystery boxes by playing through the game, leveling up, and/or defeating other gamers or
monster bosses). Further, because of the randomness built into the mystery boxes, chances are that
he would need to invest a lot of time, efforts, and money in order to acquire and unlock many mystery
boxes before he ﬁnally earns the desired and rare digital goods. For gamers, these earned digital
goods carry signiﬁcant intrinsic values. Depending on their rarity, some of them can become very
expensive, and examples from PC games include the following:
●

In CS:GO, a StatTrak M9 Bayonet Doppler skin sold for $23,8503; and

●

In Dota 2: a Pink Ethereal Flame Wardog sold for $38,0004.

As large as the dollar ﬁgures in Newzoo’s study are, they do not fully reﬂect the potential of
gamer-earned digital goods. This potential cannot be understated. Gamer-earned digital goods are
signiﬁcant because:
(i) due to the need to balance free-to-play games, the volume of gamer-earned digital goods is
much higher than direct-from-publisher digital goods;
(ii) these gamer-earned digital goods aggregate within the game economy;
(iii) trading gamer-earned digital goods within a single game is a core gameplay feature required to
advance; and
(iv) gamer-earned digital goods, on average, are worth a lot more than direct-from-publisher digital
goods.
At Gameﬂip, we have been witnessing ﬁrst
hand the rapid growth of this market, and we
estimate that it will eventually eclipse the
market for direct-from-publisher digital goods,
especially with the adoption of the new decentralized ecosystem. The potential market for the trading
of gamer-earned digital goods is a trillion dollar opportunity.

2. The Opportunity
The digital goods market is large despite the fact that the current ecosystem is far from optimal.
While healthy revenue is generated from the sale of direct-from-publisher digital goods, the huge
potential from a liquid market for gamer-earned digital goods remains untapped (and the latter could
also create more opportunities for direct-from-publisher digital goods). Gamer-earned digital goods
aggregate over time, and they tend not to degrade. Yet, in most cases, gamers cannot cash them out
for value at all, resulting in tremendous loss to them eventually.
From gamers’ perspective:
●

They have a huge demand for the ability to sell their digital goods for value (i.e., for liquidity),
but this demand has been largely unmet to date.

●

To the extent a small subset of digital goods from a handful of games can currently be traded,
most marketplaces are problematic and non-transparent, and fraud is prevalent.

From game publishers’ perspective, while this may not be a “problem” per se, the existing environment
is obviously suboptimal for them:
●

Without readily available liquid markets for gamer-earned digital goods, game publishers are
selling a much smaller amount of digital goods than they otherwise could, as we will explain
further below.

●

With respect to some marketplaces that do exist today, game publishers do not receive any
beneﬁts at all from the transactions that take place there. To the contrary, the all-too-often
fraudulent transactions cost the game publishers their gamers, as the defrauded gamers are
likely to leave the game.

2.1. Unmet Demand to Sell Digital Goods
Currently, most digital goods are locked within a single game. Gamers may have spent hundreds or
thousands of dollars on keys to unlock mystery boxes, plus countless hours of playing time to earn
rare digital goods. However, when they eventually stop playing that game, the value of all of their
investments will be zero, for they cannot sell any of these digital goods, nor can they transfer their
8

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

investments to another game (except with very limited exceptions within a single platform). The
demand to be able to sell digital goods is huge, but so far this demand has been largely unmet.

Figure 2.1. Currently, most digital goods are locked within a single game, with no liquidity.

2.2. Limited and Problematic Existing Marketplaces
With respect to a small subset of digital goods (e.g., those from games like CS:GO, Dota 2, and H1Z1,
etc.), certain markets do exist where gamers can sell them for cash. These markets include (a)
forums, (b) Steam Community Market, and (c) third party trading sites. However, each of these
markets present its own challenges, and gamers face signiﬁcant friction when they transact there.

Forums Market
Some gamers buy and sell digital goods on forums (e.g., Reddit), which are unoﬃcial marketplaces. A
key drawback, however, is that gamers "trade at their own risk" there. These forums do not offer the
buyers or sellers any protection. Fraud is prevalent. A seller may simply not deliver the item after

9

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

receiving payment. Alternatively, a buyer may pay via Paypal, but then ﬁle for a chargeback after he
has received the item, leaving the seller empty handed.
Scamming Scenarios When Buying and Selling in Forums

Seller sends the digital goods but Buyer
does not send the funds or ﬁles a
chargeback.

Buyer sends the funds but Seller does not
send the digital goods or sends the wrong
digital goods

Figure 2.2. Gamers buy or sell at their own risk in forums

Steam Community Market
Valve Corporation's multiplayer gaming platform, Steam, operates a Community Market trading
platform where gamers can sell and buy digital goods for games like CS:GO, Dota 2, and Team
Fortress 2. Steam is a robust gaming platform, and as a whole generated $3.6 billion in revenue in
2016.5 Although revenue for the Community Market by itself is not available, it appears to be a very
active market with hundreds of thousands of postings at any given time. As this is an oﬃcial
marketplace where gamers transact using Steam Wallet, there are fewer problems with fraud than the
unoﬃcial forums above mentioned. Nonetheless, the Steam Community Market still has substantial
shortcomings:
●

It does not offer sellers any real cash out at all. After a seller has received payment into his
Steam Wallet, he can only use the Steam Wallet for other games on the Steam platform. He
cannot convert anything to real cash.

10

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

●

Steam imposes a high transaction fee, as much as 15%.

Third Party Trading Sites
A number of third party trading sites have attempted to address some of the above issues. These
sites connect to Steam and facilitate transactions for the same digital goods, except that gamers can
sell them for actual cash. OPSkins, the largest and probably oldest marketplace in this category,
performs well ﬁnancially, reportedly processing as much as $120,000 worth of transactions a day.6 As
a class, however, many of these third-party trading sites are problematic themselves:
●

Many of them operate with no transparency into their owners and managers. A number of
them were allegedly associated with supporting illegal gambling, and many allegedly operate
with questionable tactics.7

●

They only support Steam digital goods, leaving the problem with much of the gaming digital
goods universe unsolved.

4. The Solution – FLIP Token and Decentralized
Ecosystem
While the Gameﬂip platform is already succeeding and growing quickly, we have only begun to scratch
the surface. The new FLIP token and decentralized ecosystem will further advance our vision for a
fully transparent and frictionless infrastructure for transacting digital goods. Blockchain will provide
the safest storage for virtual assets, and smart contracts will create a transparent public ledger.
FLIP is a crypto-token of ﬁxed supply. It
is fractionally divisible, and units of FLIP
are fungible and transferable.

4.1. Overview of FLIP
The Ethereum blockchain will serve as the backbone for FLIP. We have chosen Ethereum because of
its ﬂexibility and wide spread adoption. Gamers can easily send digital goods and FLIP to each other,
as long as both the sender and the recipient have an Ethereum compatible wallet. Game publishers
can incorporate this function – for gamers to securely transfer digital goods outside of the game –
with minimal integration efforts. The blockchain will act as a multi-game database, securely storing
all digital goods and FLIP and tracking who owns them.
With the new FLIP token, we aim to shift the paradigm for the industry by unlocking digital goods from
each individual game and creating liquidity for them via trading in the decentralized ecosystem.
Blockchain technology allows such trading to take place not only on the Gameﬂip platform, but also
universally across any and all marketplaces, safely and securely. In turn, this will advance the entire
digital goods ecosystem.

25

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

4.2. Implementation using Ethereum and ERC-20
FLIP will leverage the Ethereum blockchain, the current industry standard for issuing custom digital
assets and smart contracts. By conforming to the ERC-20 token interface, FLIP will be compatible
with the existing Ethereum infrastructure, such as development tools, wallets, and exchanges. At the
heart of the Ethereum blockchain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows the deployment and
execution of smart contracts, enabling complex issuance rules for crypto-currencies like FLIP and
automating incentive structures. In short, the EVM eliminates any question of trust and protects the
transacting parties against fraud. These powerful features and dynamic ecosystem make Ethereum a
strong ﬁt for FLIP, and we are conﬁdent that this will translate to quick adoption by game publishers
and gamers.
For game publishers, we will provide plug-ins and software development kits (SDKs), all open-sourced,
so that their games can recognize the transfer of digital goods to and from the gamers’ blockchain
wallets. These could be digital currency within the game, or in-game items, which could be a weapon
or armor. They could also be different cosmetic skins, additional content, special game edition, or
even collectible badges, with the blockchain network tracking the ownership of all such digital goods.
Gamers can simply use off-the-shelf Ethereum wallets to hold their FLIP and digital goods, and to
freely trade them with each other anywhere. Gamers can send FLIP and digital goods using familiar
mechanics like how users of Wechat Wallet, Paypal and Venmo send value to one another. All
transfers and ownership data will be securely kept on the blockchain, with smart contracts
safeguarding against fraud.
Game publishers or third party tool developers can also provide their own branded wallets that allow
gamers to more easily navigate and manage their inventory. With blockchain technology, the
ecosystem is opened up for innovation.

4.3. Roadmap
As mentioned earlier, the current Gameﬂip platform is already the most comprehensive centralized
digital goods marketplace platform. Now, as an active participant of the new decentralized
ecosystem, the Gameﬂip platform will be transforming and transitioning in a measured and
responsible process over time.

4.4. Business Model
The Gameﬂip decentralized ecosystem will have a scalable and straightforward business model to
drive adoption. When any digital goods are traded among gamers using FLIP, the publisher of that
game and any applicable marketplace / transaction enabler will take a small percentage of the FLIP.

27

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

4.5. Economic Model
The supply of FLIP will be capped at 100 million. After all 100 million tokens have been issued, new
ones will not be created. Increases in demand will not be met by any additional supply, and the value
of the FLIP will adjust accordingly.

4.6. Network Growth Model
The importance of the network growth model cannot be understated. While gamers will naturally be
attracted to liquidity for their digital goods, game publishers will also play a very key role in this
ecosystem. Arguably, game publishers are even more important than gamers in driving network
growth. More than one crypto-token will be available for the gaming market, and each game publisher
will decide which crypto-token(s) to implement for its games and digital goods.

28

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

Leveraging the Gameﬂip team’s in-depth insight from decades of experience in the gaming industry –
previously as game developers and publishers with a platform serving 40 million gamers, and now as
digital goods marketplace operators, we have designed a powerful network growth model to drive the
adoption of FLIP:
●

Out of the 100 million total supply of FLIP, up to 40 million will be reserved to incentivize game
publishers to promote network growth. After FLIP has become fully utilizable, these reserved
FLIP will be gradually released over time, via sales that are facilitated by game publishers, as
set forth in Table 4.6 below.

●

Game publishers participate in the network growth model by integrating FLIP and facilitating
the sale of these reserved tokens to their gamer communities as the tokens are released over
time.

●

Game publishers who are early participants will receive, as incentives, all proceeds from such
sale. Later adopters will also be rewarded handsomely, but their percentage share of the
proceeds will be reduced over time, as set forth in Table 4.6 below.

Any portion of these proceeds that are not allocated to game publishers as their incentives will be
reinvested towards additional network growth, which could be in the form of incentives for game
publishers, third-party marketplaces and transaction enablers, gamers and gamer communities,
third-party development, or marketing, among other things. These proceeds will not be retained by
Gameﬂip.
As far as we know, the design for FLIP is
the only one with built-in, concrete, and
generous beneﬁts for game publishers.
As such, we are conﬁdent that FLIP will
be adopted swiftly and, importantly, FLIP
will emerge as the dominant blockchain token for the gaming industry.

5. Technical Considerations
The Ethereum blockchain isn’t without limitations. Currently, the Ethereum network operates on a
proof-of-work consensus algorithm to conﬁrm transactions, and this design places a hard limit on
throughput and scalability. The current average conﬁrmation time, or block time, is approximately 25
seconds8. Future version of Ethereum may enhance throughput by switching to a proof-of-stake
consensus algorithm.
Until these limitations are addressed by the Ethereum network, a purely-on-chain solution may not be
optimal, for there are two issues. The ﬁrst issue is the lengthy Ethereum transaction conﬁrmation
time, a signiﬁcantly delayed responsiveness that gamers typically do not expect. The second issue is
that the Ethereum blockchain requires fees to be paid in Ether for every transaction, creating an
adoption barrier for the average gamer.
Given these barriers, the initial implementation will most likely take the form of a semi-centralized
hybrid on-chain and off-chain transaction service, or a partial blockchain implementation described on
our road map. At the core, the transactions using FLIP will be settled on the Ethereum blockchain.

30

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

However, prior to the settlement, the Gameﬂip platform may still provide the needed service to (1)
improve user experience by reducing latency and (2) avoid network fees when transacting between
users.

5.1. The “Trusted Providers”
The Ethereum blockchain solves a lot of the “trust” issues by making transactions secured, with smart
contracts in a trustless environment. However, for practical and complex apps, such as video games,
the Ethereum network still has many limitations. For example, smarts contracts must be created,
certiﬁed by the game, and deployed to the Ethereum network. With block time often facing some
delays, responsive experience can only be achieved by using off-chain notiﬁcations.
Trusted Providers, such as the Gameﬂip platform, will be authorized to provide off-chain services such
as notiﬁcations or creating and conﬁguring smart contracts, on behalf of game publishers or gamers.
In our example above, the Gameﬂip platform can facilitate the listing contract and send instant
transaction notiﬁcations to the game service or the gamer's wallet for conﬁrmation, similar to how the
Gameﬂip platform functions today by sending notiﬁcations to its users on mobile apps when a
transaction takes place.
As the Ethereum network evolves and develops more capabilities, we expect the use of Trusted
Providers to be diminished and eventually removed.

5.2. Listing Game Items “For Sale” on Blockchain
While blockchain can store data, it cannot function as the complete game database for a multitude of
technical reasons, particularly the rapidly changing state and processing of data during gameplay.
The natural use of blockchain is to store data that can certify the ownership, and transfer of
ownership, of an item so that it can be sold and accepted by the game. We can think of the
blockchain as an escrow service where gamers can use for changing ownership, and the smart
contract will guarantee item delivery and payment.

31

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

The subsequent diagram describes the ﬂow for a gamer who wishes to list a game item for sale. In
this use case, the game service simply allows a request from the gamer to place the item into a vault
or bank, or a similar storage structure, for escrow when creating and deploying a smart contract for
listing the item in the blockchain.

Most games already have item trading or transfer, solely within that game, as part of its in-game
economy. Utilizing a similar mechanism, placing the game item in a vault would take the item out of
the gameplay, guaranteeing that the gamer will continue to possess the item until it’s sold. The item
can only be returned to the gameplay from the vault when either (1) its current owner cancels the

32

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

listing smart contract or (2) the new owner claims the item after successful execution of the smart
contract.
Once in the blockchain, the seller will have the freedom to create and conﬁgure the smart contract as
to how he wants his item to be sold, such as direct buy, bidding, or other means. Further, he can
subsequently post and promote his listing on marketplaces such as Gameﬂip or directly to other
potential buyers.

5.3. Purchasing Items Using Smart Contract
Once the listing smart contract is created on the blockchain, any gamer with FLIP can purchase the
item using his wallet.

After the purchase, the smart contract will automatically change the item ownership in the blockchain,
distribute the FLIP tokens to the seller and commission to the game publisher, any trusted provider,
and/or third party enablers such as listing service. When the new owner claims the item within the

33

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

game, the item is then transferred back into the gameplay from the vault and its associated data is
removed from the blockchain.
Technically, gamers can use any ERC-20 compatible wallet client, but it would be diﬃcult to use in the
context of gaming application. Therefore, we will develop and provide a Gameﬂip wallet client that is
gaming friendly, one that can enable gamers to view and manage their game item inventory. Not only
will it be easy to use, but also it can directly connect to the Gameﬂip platform for other services, such
as listing on the Gameﬂip marketplace, item store management, and sale promotion.

5.4. Publishers Can Customize and Control
Few, if any, game publishers would want all game items freely tradable or transferable. The desire to
control what items can be traded or sold is more pronounced for games that rely on having a healthy
and balanced in-game economy. Game publishers also need to constantly protect their games from
bad actors, security exploits or ﬁnancial frauds. Having the appropriate controls on items ﬂowing
in/out of the game is absolutely essential for game publishers to both protect their business and
provide the entertainment for their gamers.
Having developed and published many PC and mobile games before, this Gameﬂip team understands
this need very thoroughly, and better than any other providers of gaming cryto-tokens. With our
solution, game publishers can design and conﬁgure the criteria for listing game items on the
blockchain. The criteria can include, but are not limited to, the type of items, the player level,
outstanding number of listings, etc.

5.5. Game Integration
The smart contracts will be the core engine that conducts the transactions securely. However, game
integration will also be necessary to ensure that the game can fulﬁll the contracts off-chain, interface
with blockchain, and provide good user experience. Our approach toward game integration consists
of two primary criteria:

34

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

1. Least invasive and highly decoupled - As a former game publisher, we know that drastic
changes to the game would be undesirable, especially if it can alter the user interface or the
gaming experience.
2. Trusted Provider is optional - The role of the trusted provider should be optional so that game
publishers can work with any provider who can add value to their service or develop their own
solution to avoid being “locked in”.
We will provide game publishers with access to our Gameﬂip platform API9, along with a set of SDKs
in popular programming languages (e.g. C#, Java, NodeJS, etc.) to facilitate function calls to smart
contracts, including monitoring and receiving notiﬁcations from the Ethereum Network. The SDKs will
be open source and actively updated.
Game publishers will have a wide range of choices to customize the user experience for their games.
Sophisticated game publishers with their own platform can also choose to provide their own API and
SDKs to independently service their gamers without working with Gameﬂip.

5.6. Smart Wallets and Decentralization
Gameﬂip will provide gamers a smart wallet client that can greatly enhance user experience for buying
and selling in-game items on Gameﬂip marketplace. Gamers can still use any other ERC-20
compatible wallet to buy and sell on other marketplaces of their choice. Game publishers can also
choose to develop their own smart wallet that directly integrate into their game.
As the ecosystem matures, we anticipate that many developers will create more sophisticated wallets,
tools, and apps to support gamers.

6. Beneﬁts for Game Publishers and Gamers
FLIP will dramatically expand the overall size of the gaming digital goods market by creating
signiﬁcant beneﬁts for both gamers and game publishers.

6.1. Gamers
Having the ﬂexibility to sell, buy and trade their digital goods, of course, will be a key beneﬁt to
gamers. Importantly, the Gameﬂip decentralized ecosystem will also remove much of the friction in
the limited existing marketplaces, as smart contracts will eliminate fraud.
The ability to sell, buy and trade securely will create a multiplier effect: gamers will buy more and pay
higher prices. Gamers will have much more of a sense of ownership over digital goods, and therefore
they will be willing to pay more for them. Further, knowing that they can retain the value of their
investments and sell them later, gamers will also acquire more digital goods than they do today –
more skins, more powerful weapons, etc. In turn, this will have a viral effect, as gamers who have not
yet adopted FLIP will need to keep pace – they will also need to acquire more digital goods in order to
stay competitive or have unique skins that are as "cool" as their friends’. This will powerfully drive
adoption of FLIP on gamers’ end and, indeed, the overall growth of the digital goods market.

6.2. Game Publishers
Game publishers that adopt FLIP will beneﬁt from:
●

being able to sell more digital goods at higher prices;

●

increased longevity of their games; and

●

signiﬁcant brand new revenue streams.

Given the beneﬁts for gamers as described above, and how gamers will buy more digital goods at
higher prices, this will translate directly to more revenue to game publishers. Game publishers will
adopt FLIP to enjoy "a slice of this bigger pie."
36

Crypto-token for buying and selling gaming digital goods

Indirectly, when gamers buy more digital goods, they will also stay in the game longer. From game
publishers’ perspective, retention metrics will improve and gamers’ lifetime value (LTV) will increase,
boosting the longevity of their games.
Importantly, these game publishers will also receive brand new revenue streams. As mentioned
above, (i) in Section 4.4 (Business Model) above, whenever gamers buy and sell digital goods with
FLIP, a small percentage of each transaction will be commission for the applicable game publisher,
and (ii) in Section 4.6 (Network Growth Model), whenever game publishers facilitate the sale of those
reserved tokens, a signiﬁcant portion of the proceeds will be allocated to them as incentives. Even
better yet, these revenues will basically be pure proﬁts to game publishers, as their cost to generate
these revenues will virtually be zero.
