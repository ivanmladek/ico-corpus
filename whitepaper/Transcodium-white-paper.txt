ABSTRACT
Transcodium aims to provide the first peer-to-peer blockchain based and
decentralized media transcoding, editing and distribution platform with
high quality and reliable computational power at a very affordable price.
This will create a global market for users, willing to rent their idle machines
to be used as workers (miners). Further, at the end of the transcoding
process, the worker (processor) will be rewarded with the TNS token.
Transcodium started as medianap in 2015 with a visual cloud transcoding
and media editing platform, but went out of business due to the high cost of
cloud servers, we could not compete with the existing platforms and had to
switch to another business. In 2016, our team decided to look into the
project again but this time using the blockchain and decentralization
technology. Unlike the previous platform, Transcodium’s network will be
fully automated without human intervention. ​Click here to try our product
or ​Click here to track our existence since 2015
Transcoding is the process of converting from one file format to another
desirable and compatible format. Before your favourite social media
platform or streaming site such as YouTube or Netflix makes a video
available to you, they need to convert this video into multiple formats in
order to support different devices such as smartphones, laptop and desktop
computers, TVs and more, since each of them have different capabilities.
Some videos might even fail to play over a slow internet connection, these
type of videos will also need to be converted into a lighter format for a
smooth streaming.
Workers are idle devices on the network waiting to process a transcoding
request.
Initiators are customers or users who needs their files to be transcoded or
converted into another format.
Processors, this is a collective term denoting master nodes and workers.

4

The global video streaming software market size is
expected to grow from USD 3.25 Billion in 2017 to USD
1
7.50 Billion by 2022
Transcodium will tackle all the 3P’s (Privacy, Pricing, and Processing
Power) in an instance, there will be no limit on how much processing
power Transcodium will be able to generate from its network.
Transcodium network will be available to its target customers in a more
cheaper price than the current market price.
Transcodium's unique algorithm will enable the conversion of media files
in a supersonic speed by splitting large media files into very tiny chunks
and thereafter will be encrypted, compressed and sent to workers (idle
devices) to process. Due to the lightweight of each chunk, these tasks will
be transferred and processed at a very fast speed, even smartphones will
be capable of processing them. Tokens will be rewarded to any worker who
completes its task before the allocated timeout.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, the world has seen a remarkable improvement in the media
industry, i.e. from video advertising to media streaming, however, due to
the high cost of cloud transcoding services, it has been very challenging for
startups and companies on a low budget who needs these services.
Since the emergence of cloud technology, the transcoding industry has
grown at a very large scale. We are well known to companies like Netflix,
Amazon Prime, Vimeo, Youtube, and e.t.c, who transcodes terabytes of data
on daily basis, investing a large amount of their revenue on media file
conversion. The current report also predicts that, by the year 2019, the
transcoding market will grow by ​15 percent CAGR globally​, which reflects
a huge scope to flourish.
The concept of transcoding has always been limited to the conversion of
video and audio files, however, it has the larger extent to take any type of
file like PDF, HTML, Word Document and converts it into any possible
preferred format.
Transcodium will provide APIs, Console and GUI Applications for
customers to aid in a rapid transcoding process. Before processing starts
for each transcoding request, the initiator (customer) will be provided with
the estimated cost for approval, once approved, the initiator's wallet will be
debited for the processing to commence.
The file transcoding process includes two parties, master nodes, and
workers. Master nodes receive the transcoding request, they then split
large media files into chunks when necessary, encrypts these chunks and
forward them to workers.
Workers, on the other hand, are responsible for converting the file into the
new format. Any device can be a worker, but not a master node. A master
node must have a faster processing power and a strong internet
connection. A master node can also serve as a worker simultaneously.
Master nodes are rewarded with 20% of the transcoding cost whilst 80% is
shared amongst the workers. The master nodes are also responsible for
joining the chunks when needed.
Multiple master nodes may process the same request for the sake of data
loss. Master nodes have another opportunity to earn from the distribution
7

of the final output to multiple social media or storage platforms which the
initiator (customer) will be charged for.

Did You Know: One-third of online activity is spent watching

a video.

IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS
With the current cloud transcoding platforms, the following problems and
limitations were identified:
● Cloud transcoding platforms are too expensive and are scaring away
startups, who require their services. Existing companies have to
spend more than half of their income just for processing these media
files, which is not encouraging.
● Long processing time due to limited hardware. Cloud transcoding
platforms has a hard limit on hardware, therefore, all the files to be
processed are queued, until their time is due for processing, which
causes frustrations on the customer’s side waiting for processing.
● Due to the centralized nature of the platform, a server outage or
downtime can cause failure of the whole transcoding process wasting
time, money and resources.
● Most transcoding platforms are limited to only media file formats,
making it very difficult to convert other formats such as images and
documents formats.

OUTLINED SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS
Here are the proposed solutions to the problems above:
● The blockchain and decentralized technology model enables the
provision of a cheaper and reliable alternative to cloud transcoding.
● Due to the unlimited processing power, all thanks to the workers,
files will be transcoded in a very fast speed, eliminating long queues
and waiting time.
● A single transcoding request will be processed by multiple nodes and
workers, so the outage of one node or worker will have no effect on
the process, making it more efficient and time-saving.

● Transcoding will not be limited to audio and videos only, but also
other file formats such as images and documents.

Did You Know: By 2019, internet video traffic will account
4
for 80% of all consumer Internet traffic
GENERAL STRUCTURE
The integrity will be maintained by the proof of conversion. To get the
reward, the peer has to submit a proof of conversion before the assigned
timeout else the network will mark the task as aborted. Human interaction
is not required for completion of the entire transaction.
The transcoding process starts when a master node receives a request from
the initiator, the master node will then analyze the file, split large media
files into smaller chunks, encrypt them and distribute them to idle workers
with instructions.
These chunks will be so small that they will be transferred to the worker in
a little amount of time even on a slow internet connection. Due to the little
size of this chunk, smartphones will be capable of processing them.
Data transfer between the master node and a worker will have an end to
end encryption for maximum privacy and security.
The workers will process the file based on the instruction attached to the
file or chunk. After the processing is done, the worker will send the
processed file or chunk to the master node to join if required.
The master node will then execute its final task by exporting the output to
it destination. Multiple destinations are supported. The first destination
will always be free, but an additional destination will attract a fee which
will be rewarded to the master node.
The pricing system on the Transcodium network is maintained by the TNS
regulation. The TNS regulation is an autonomous algorithm which brings
balance between processors and initiators thereby making both parties
happy.

Workers periodically send updates to the master nodes about their status,
this information sent includes their processing power, internet speed,
conversion time and device information. The TNS regulator uses this
information together with proof of stake and other factors to randomly
select idle workers for processing data. This also enables the network to
group workers based on their performance.
Initiators have the free will to select from a price range of $0.006 to $0.01
per minute for an SD quality video output and $0.008 to $0.020 per minute
for an HD video quality output. Prices may be subject to change in the
future due to the following but not limited reasons such as: network
growth, total capacity/load, etc.
Non-video files such as audio will have the price range of $0.006 to $0.001
per minute of output.
Files such as images and documents (PDF, word and etc) cannot be
measured in time (minute), so they will be measured according to their size
in megabyte. A megabyte of a file will have the price range of $0.006 to
$0.01 per output unit.
To enable fairness on the network, the highest paid task will be assigned to
the best performing workers to help provide the initiator value for the
money paid.

TRANSPARENCY
The use of smart contract will enable transparency on the network, vital
information such the file duration, the amount the initiator was charged
and the amount paid to workers will all be on the public ledger. Customers
and workers can always check how much they have been charged or paid
respectfully for a specific task on the network.

PROOF OF STAKE
To achieve a better-decentralized consensus, the Transcodium network
employs the proof-of-stake type of algorithm where workers are randomly
selected based on their wealth and age of account. This helps in selecting
workers with quality processing power thereby saving time and money.

PROOF OF CONVERSION
The proof of conversion agreement between the master node and a worker
states that, a worker has to complete its task within the given time range
to receive the reward, during processing of data, the worker sends progress
update to the master node, the worker must complete processing the data
before the assigned timeout else the network will mark the task as aborted
or inactive and will award that same task to the next available idle worker.
A dynamic timeout is set on all transcoding activities based on the
performance of the worker and the size of data to be processed. The
contract pays a worker after a successful transcoding and submission of
file. A task is deemed completed after the processed file is uploaded and
verified by the master node. The proof of conversion will be backed by a
smart contract. The proof of conversion together with the proof of stake
makes the TNS regulation which is responsible for making a smart random
selection of workers and bringing balance between initiators and
processors.

WORKERS
Workers are idle devices responsible for processing data on the network.
Any device with an internet connection and capable of installing our
application can be a worker. A worker can earn more rewards if it has
higher specifications such as a multi-core device or GPU based devices.
Once a device installs the Transcodium app, it becomes part of the
Transcodium network, an initial device assessment will be made to help
rank the device as part of the TNS regulations.

After a successful task, workers are rewarded with 80% of the total amount
paid in TNS token whilst 20% goes to the master nodes responsible for
processing the final output and distribution.

CUSTOMERS
Transcodium network will enable customers to avail unlimited processing
power in a very cheap compensation for the task. Customers will be able to
select a price from the range of prices provided by the TNS regulation, the
higher the price the faster the file conversion and vice versa.
Customers or initiators will have three types of interface to ease the
conversion process:
1. An API interface to help developers integrate into their projects or
apps,
2. The command line interface will be for basic functionality and
3. The advanced visual studio media editing app for complex media
editing needs.
The customer can select where to export the file after processing,
destinations such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, SFTP, Amazon AWS,
Google Drive and etc will be supported. Multiple destinations are
supported. The first destination is always free, other subsequent
destinations will attract a fee which will be rewarded to the master node
processing it.
Before processing of any file commence, the application will compute the
total cost for the initiator to approve, once approved, the initiator’s wallet
will be debited. The debited amount will be refunded if processing fails.
Customers will need the TNS token in order to pay for any transaction on
the network.

TRANSCODIUM ( TNS ) TOKEN
TNS token is an ERC-20 compliant Ethereum based token which is designed
to work on Transcodium network. The token will be a mean of payment
within the network.
The total supply of the TNS token is 120 million and has a maximum of 18
decimal places. This is a fixed supply and will not decrease or increase, the
decision of the total supply was made by the Transcodium team and
founders.

EACH TOKEN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING RIGHTS TO ITS HOLDER:
1. Right to transaction
Each token holder holds the right to send or receive tokens between
one to another. Tokens can also be sent to the third party to a
supported digital wallet.
2. Right to services
Each token holder holds a right to get the services made available by
the company for the token, such as media transcoding, file
distribution etc.

TOKEN SALE
Transcodium intended to use funds received during TNS token sale for
further development of the project, payment of salaries and future
expenses. This will help accelerate development and also enable the team
to work full time with total commitment.
During TNS token sale, purchasers will be provided with the TNS token
within two weeks after the end of Token sale; provided, that this term
maybe extended due to unforeseen circumstances. Payment method will be
in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin or other currency (cryptocurrency) as
may be additionally introduced by the Transcodium.

15

The TNS token may be used as a medium of payments for services on the
Transcodium platform and other Transcodium based products. After token
sale & distribution, the TNS token will have an immediate usage on the
cloud transcoding platform until the the decentralized version of the
transcoding platform is completed.
The cloud transcoding platform will stop working after the decentralized
transcoding platform is completed and has started production, users and
token holders together with their TNS token balance will be migrated to the
new decentralized platform automatically to continue usage.
The presale starts on January 7th, 2018 and ends on February 28th, 2018.
During this period early purchasers will be given a discount of 30% for the
first 5,710,000 tokens to be sold.
Any unsold tokens after presale will be moved to the main Token sale and
will have the same bonus terms as the main Token sale.
Moreover, all the remaining tokens meant for sale after the main token sale
will be burned or destroyed.
Purchasers will be refunded if the soft-cap is not reached after the main
Token sale. The smart contract will handle all refund operations to
purchasers who contributed using Ethereum, for non-Ethereum
purchasers, we will manually send the refunds to the addresses from which
we received the funds.
Tokens reserved for team members will be locked until 3 months after
main Token sale. Also, team members will receive only 25% of their tokens
after every 3 months interval.

Risk Factors
The purchase of TNS token (hereinafter in this article “Risk Factors”
referred to as the "Token" or "Tokens") may be associated with a high
degree of risk. To protect the interests of Tokens’ potential purchasers, the
Transcodium (hereinafter in this article “Risk Factors” referred to as the
"Company") team conducted an analysis of such potential risks and
outlined the result of this analysis in this chapter of the Whitepaper.
IMPORTANT: THE LIST OF RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED BELOW IS NOT
EXHAUSTIVE. IN ADDITION TO THE RISKS DISCLOSED IN THIS
WHITEPAPER, THERE MAY BE EXISTING OTHER RISKS WHICH THE
COMPANY'S TEAM AT PRESENT CAN NOT REASONABLY FORECAST. These
risks can materialize in other forms of risk than those specified here. Prior
to acquiring Tokens, each potential Token purchaser is advised to carefully
review all the information and assess the risks of such purchase, including
but not limited to, the risks set forth in this Whitepaper and to decide upon
purchase of Tokens based on such assessment.

23

1. Technical and technological risks.
1.1. ​Risks of the blockchain​. Tokens are released on Ethereum blockchain.
In this regard, any malfunction of the Ethereum protocol may lead to a
restriction in the use of Tokens, and / or to the fact that Tokens or the
platform will function in an unforeseen manner.
1.2. ​Risk of hacker attacks on the platform, smart contracts, or Tokens​.
Tokens can be expropriated and / or stolen, by hacking Tokens, or
otherwise. Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to
intervene in a smart contract or Tokens in various ways, including, but not
limited to, virus attacks, DDOS attacks, concerted attacks, network attacks,
and denial of service attacks, and others. In addition, since the Ethereum
platform is based on open source software, there is a risk that Ethereum
smart contracts may contain intentional or unintentional errors or
shortcomings that could adversely affect Tokens or lead to loss of Tokens,
or loss of access or control Tokens. In the event of such an error or
weakness of the software, there can be no remedy, and tokens owners are
not guaranteed any compensation or compensation.
1.3. ​Risk of hacker attack on the computer of tokenholder, or loss of
passwords / of private keys​. Purchased Tokens can be stored by the
tokenholder in her\his digital wallet or safe, for which a password, a digital
key or a combination of digital keys is required. Accordingly, the loss of the
necessary keys associated with such digital wallet or safe, can lead to loss
of access to Tokens. In addition, any third party that gets access to such
passwords and / or private keys (by way of getting (through hacking, or
negligence of tokenholder) access to login credentials of tokenholders'
hosting-wallet, or otherwise), will be able to use Tokens of the tokenholder.
Company assumes no liability for such losses.
1.4. ​Risk of using new technologies, and changes in technology in the future​.
Tokens and blockchain are fairly new and relatively untested technologies.
Although at the moment they have largely proven their efficiency,
reliability and security, there is no guarantee that in future these
technologies do not fail in any way. Further, as technological progress
develops, flaws can be found in these technologies, which flaws will
prevent their functioning in the way that they function at the moment.
Finally, there is no guarantee that these technologies will be compatible
with any new technologies invented in future. In the event of such
24

incompatibility, use of Tokens and blockchain can be found unreasonable
and stopped.
1.5. ​Risk of incompatibility of the cryptowallet service​. An electronic
cryptowallet or wallet service provider that tokenholder has chosen \ will
choose for obtaining and storing Tokens, must be technically compatible
with Tokens. Failure to comply with this condition may lead to the fact that
the tokenholder will not be able to get access to her\his Tokens.
Tokenholders must independently determine the fact of the compatibility
of the cryptowallet she\he registered, with the Tokens. Company assumes
no responsibility for any errors related to wrong determination of the
above fact.
2.

Regulatory Risks.

2.1. ​Risk of regulatory uncertainty​. Regulatory status of cryptographic
tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology, is unclear or not defined
in many jurisdictions. It cannot be excluded that such technologies, and, in
particular, Tokens, will in future become subject to one or more (adopted
or new) interpretations of laws (or other regulations), court judgments, or
actions by various regulatory bodies around the world, including, but not
limited to, the imposition of restrictions on the use or possession of digital
tokens, such as Tokens. Such changes can adversely affect Tokens in
various ways, including, for example, by determining that Tokens are
regulated financial instruments that require registration or compliance
with other legal requirements and procedures. Company may stop
distributing Tokens, developing a platform or terminating operations in a
particular jurisdiction if the actions of regulatory authorities of the relevant
jurisdiction make it illegal or not commercially viable to proceed.
2.2. Risk ​of inability to obtain, maintain or renew licenses and permits​. As
of the date of Tokens sale, there are no statutory requirements requiring
Company to obtain any licenses and permits necessary for the sale of the
Tokens, but the risk that such legislative requirements may be enacted in
the future cannot be ruled out. In this event, possibility of sale and further
use of Tokens will depend on the procedure of issuing such licenses and
permits, and on compliance with their terms. We cannot exclude that
requirements of the law will be technically or economically unachievable
for Company. Company may stop distribution of Tokens, develop a
platform or terminate operations in a particular jurisdiction in the event of
economic, technological or other inability to obtain the required licenses or
permits under such jurisdiction.
25

2.3. ​The risk of governmental action​. The industry of blocking and reversing
tokens is new, and simply by virtue of novelty can be subject to increased
supervision and regulatory control, including investigations or
enforcement actions. There can be no guarantee that the government will
not study the activities of the parties. All this can be investigated, which in
turn can have a significant negative impact on Tokens and / or platform
development.
3. Business risks.
3.1. ​Risk of failure in development​. It cannot be excluded that for various
reasons, including but not limited to, for reasons of insolvency of business
or technological strategies or business arrangements, technological
problems, emergence of new technologies, etc., that the model that
Company developed and described in this Whitepaper, will not achieve the
desired functionality, be inoperative, or work in a way different from what
developers designed it for. Also, we cannot exclude the risk that for these or
different reasons, development and implementation of the model can take
longer than Company predicts at the moment, and when the model is ready,
it will appear to be outdated and\or irrelevant.
3.2. ​Risk of insufficient implementation​. It cannot be excluded that, for
various reasons, including, but not limited to, for reasons of insolvency of
marketing strategies, external constraints, or competitors' actions, the
model developed by Company and described in this Whitepaper model may
appear to be unpopular and\or unclaimed, lacking use and application.
3.3. ​Risk of dependence on third parties​. Even after the launch, the model
developed by Company and described in this Whitepaper will rely, wholly
or partially, on third parties, for adoption and implementation of certain
functions, as well as for continuing its development, maintenance and
support. Though above-mentioned third parties are carefully selected by
Company's team, there is no insurance or guarantee that these third parties
will do their job properly, or otherwise meet users' needs, and this can
have a significant adverse impact on the platform.
3.4. ​Risk of loss of cash​. The project described in this Whitepaper, the
model developed by Сompany, the platform being created, as well as any
funds collected within the framework of the Token sale described, are not
insured. In case of failure of the project for any reason, loss of functionality
26

of the Token or platform, there is no private or public insurance
representative to whom token holders can apply for reimbursement.
3.5. ​Risk of force majeure​. In the future, there may be extraordinary
circumstances that Company cannot reasonably anticipate or prevent and
that may be subject to restrictions or impediments to the operation of the
Company or Token platform. Company performance may be interrupted,
suspended or delayed due to force majeure circumstances. For the
purposes of this Whitepaper, force majeure shall mean extraordinary
events and circumstances which could not be prevented by Company and
shall include: acts of nature, wars, armed conflicts, mass civil disorders,
industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts, slowdowns, prolonged shortage or
other failures of energy supplies or communication service, acts of
municipal, state or federal governmental agencies, other circumstances
beyond Company's control, which were not in existence at the time of
Whitepaper release.
3.6. Value of Tokens. Once purchased, the value of Tokens may significantly
fluctuate due to various reasons. Company does not guarantee any specific
value of the Tokens over any specific period of time. Company shall not be
held responsible for any change in the value of Tokens.
4. Other risks.
4.1. Taxes. Token holders are solely responsible for determining if the
transactions contemplated herein are subject to any applicable taxes
whether in their home country or in another jurisdiction. It will be the sole
responsibility of Token holders to comply with the tax laws of any
jurisdictions applicable to them and pay all relevant taxes.
4.2. Disclosure of Information. Personal information received from Tokens
holders, the information about the number of tokens owned, the wallet
addresses used, and any other relevant information may be disclosed to
law enforcement, government officials, and other third parties when
Company is required to disclose such information by law, subpoena, or
court order. Company shall at no time be held responsible for such
information disclosure.
4.3. Risk of Insufficient information. Tokens are at a very early
developmental stage and its philosophy, consensus mechanism, algorithm,
code and other technical specifications and parameters could be updated
and changed frequently and constantly. While the Whitepaper contains the
27

up-to-date key information related to Tokens at the date of the Whitepaper,
it is not complete nor is final and is subject to adjustments and updates that
Company may make from time to time. Company is not in a position, nor
obliged to report on every detail of the development of Tokens and other
elements of the system presented by Company and therefore will not
necessarily provide timely or full access to all the information relating to
the Tokens, but will use reasonable efforts.
