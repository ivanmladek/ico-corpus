CHAPTER 1.0

Shping’s Objectives
Our goal is for Shping Coin to evolve into a new token of
exchange that incentivizes consumers, brands, retailers and
associated organisations to work together to create a safer,
smarter way for consumers to shop and share information
about products in the market.

Our aims are powered by four interlocking strategic pillars that Shping aims to achieve
simultaneously.

1.

To develop the world’s largest, trusted Global Product Database through blockchain
innovation. The database will be perpetually updated by brands and users who will
be incentivized to access, add to, review and verify information about products available in the market.

2.

To provide full traceability and auditability of the supply chain for consumers, brands,
retailers, distributors, certification and governing bodies so that they may validate
whether any given product is safe, authentic and meets their standards.

3.

To empower and incentivize consumers to instantly and conveniently assess the
quality, authenticity and suitability of the products they are purchasing by scanning
product barcodes with their mobile device.

4.

To enable brands, retailers and associated organisations to incentivize consumers to
engage with them in a manner which is non-disruptive and customer-driven (i.e by
consumer’s scanning products), and which aids in the purchase of their products, and
strengthens brand loyalty and reputation.

Shping Coins are central to the incentive
mechanism that Shping will activate to ensure
we meet our objectives.

CHAPTER 2.0

The Market Opportunity
The following market conditions have inspired the development
of the Shping Platform.

2.1 The rise of omnichannel shopping experiences
According to forecasts by eMarketer 1, eCommerce sales will account for just 10.1% of
total, global retail sales in 2017. By 2021, the proportion of online sales as a portion of
total retail sales is forecast at 15.5%. This indicates that as pervasive as e-commerce
feels, the overwhelming majority of shopping experiences will still occur in physical retail
environments in the short term.
In spite of the growth of e-commerce channels, the mobile-internet revolution has not made
brick and mortar retail stores obsolete. On the contrary, customers seem to be using mobile
devices to enhance their in-store shopping experiences in increasingly greater numbers.
For example, in Australia, 65% of customers reported using a digital device to assist them
before they go shopping while 31% of customers reported using a digital device to assist
them while they were shopping in the store². Similar trends are echoed around the world.
A report by Euromonitor International 3 suggests that “customer demand for omnichannel
shopping is unlikely to slow down, and retailers operating in different regions of the world
will need to overcome the technical and branding challenges of seamlessness to become
truly omnichannel.”
As a result, retailers and brands are creating unique and interesting in-store activations
to entice customers to share their shopping experiences on social media, or subscribe to
owned-marketing channels and apps to help sustain the brand’s reach. As the competition
for consumers grows, the omnichannel sales approach is expected to become a more
prolific feature of the future retail experience.

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.4 - FEB 2018

2.2 The information-on-demand paradox
In a world of increasing choices, consumers today demand more details from the brands
and products they purchase. Aware of this, brands are interested in providing more
information about their brands and products to influence consumer choices, resulting in
exponential growth in the discipline of direct response, content and mobile marketing.
While the internet has made a range of product data available to everyone, often, this
useful information is spread so broadly across many different channels that consumers
are often not aware of it, can’t find it, or mistrust the source of information and ignore it.
Mobile applications have become an increasingly efficient self-service channel to satisfy
consumer appetite for more information, consideration and services. However, the cost
of creating these systems is out of reach for many brands and retailers. Accordingly an
opportunity exists for Shping. The Shping Platform aims to use integrated blockchain
technology to enable customers to access verified and useful product information simply by
scanning a GS1 product barcode or datamatrix. Furthermore, it incentivises customers to do
so.

2.3 The growth of “self-service” advertising and marketing
The internet has democratized advertising media buying forever. Digital advertising has
evolved to become dynamic, automated and programmatically coordinated, booked and
scheduled through sophisticated self-service advertising management systems such as
Google Adwords, Facebook Advertising and a multitude of trading desks.
While increasingly powerful consumer mobile technology has opened brands up to new
possibilities to reach consumers, these advertising solutions are often complex, costly to
implement, and are typically unfit for the direct purpose of influencing purchase behaviour
in immediate retail situations.
There are many marketing platforms geared towards influencing e-commerce sales, yet,
there is no pervasive, self-service equivalent to reach consumers for the majority of
purchase occasions which still happen in-store. This creates an opportunity for a simpler,
more flexible self-service mobile-marketing model to be deployed. Shping has designed
such an ecosystem.

7

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.4 - FEB 2018

2.4 The changing shape of loyalty programs
Globalisation has increased competition for brands locally and internationally. As a result,
brands are seeking more opportunities to add customers to their loyalty programs to
assist with customer retention and improve their sales performance.

Customers understand the value exchange of these
loyalty programs and are subscribing in healthy volumes
to access exclusive offers, discounts and rewards being
offered by their favourite brands.
For example, 62 percent of US consumers surveyed in 3C’s 2017 Mobile Loyalty Report 4 said
that they make more visits to the store because of mobile-enabled loyalty programs. The
report also revealed that 64% of surveyed brands claimed an increase in loyalty program
membership over the previous year, with a majority citing mobile loyalty programs as the
biggest contributor to this increase. According to the 2017 Colloquy Loyalty Census, more
than half (54 percent) of US loyalty program memberships are inactive 5. This creates an
opportunity for a single sign-in mobile loyalty platform that all brands can easily adopt
and which is more convenient for consumers to use across borders. The design of such a
loyalty management system is one of the core features of the Shping Platform.

2.5 Counterfeiting is still a growing problem
Globalisation has created complexities for brands, manufacturers and retailers as well
Counterfeit goods, and fraud continues to present significant challenges to retailers
worldwide, and it is not uncommon to see retailers deploying extra measures to protect
their products from counterfeiters, including increasing security presences in-store.
While the precise size of the problem is difficult to assess, the Economic Impacts of
Counterfeiting and Piracy 6 report prepared for the International Trademark Association
and the International Chamber of Commerce BASCAP projects the total international trade
of counterfeit and pirated goods will be $922 billion by 2022.
The cost to brands to audit their supply chains and introduce solutions to ensure
products sold in retail stores are genuine can be exorbitant. An opportunity therefore
exists to make brand protection much more accessible through the Shping Platform.

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.4 - FEB 2018

2.6 Increasing regulation for traceability compliance
As a result of increasing safety concerns in industry verticals such as pharmaceuticals
and food manufacturing, a number of governments are introducing new regulations for
serialisation of products at the saleable unit level to enhance traceability, safety and
assist in faster product recalls. For example, China has already introduced pharmaceutical
and food safety laws7 and increased penalties for manufacturers who do not comply to
the serialisation and traceability protocols. India8 now also requires companies to provide
unique serial numbers for pharmaceutical products at the tertiary (case), secondary
(saleable unit), and mono-carton packaging levels.
With the USA9 and the European Union10 also moving towards requiring unique serialisation
at the package level for pharmaceuticals, it is expected that by the end of the decade, this
type of measure will become a standard requirement for global pharmaceutical supplies.
This shift creates an opportunity to create a new traceability and validation mechanism
that can be universally adopted, and further transformed into an investment in marketing
and brand protection at the saleable unit level. Shping has developed such a solution.

2.7 The increasing popularity of mobile payment platforms
Mobile phones have long been used by consumers to provide them with information and
research to make pre-store and in-store decisions. Today, mobile payments are common
fixtures among retailers who have accommodated contactless payment systems that are
compatible with Digital Wallet technology embedded into new smartphones.
As the world moves closer to a
cashless society, mobile payments
are expected to become more
common in retail transactions.
With greater travel and population
movement, this opens the doors for
a retail-ready, globally accepted
cryptocurrency system to be
created. This could be Shping Coin.

CHAPTER 3.0

Introducing Shping
Shping is the brand of Authenticateit Pty Ltd (Authenticateit) which delivers and provides
the Shping Platform. The Shping Platform connects brands, retailers, consumers, and
other associated stakeholders like government institutions (e.g AsureQuality), certification
agencies (e.g Organics Australia) and customs (e.g World Customs Organization). It is the
first platform of its kind, and will enable practical and simple communications between
consumers and other stakeholders making it a powerful resource to assist consumers with
purchase decisions.

Central to the Shping ecosystem is a Global Product Database which is supported by
a growing number of reputable, validated data sources such as GS1 (the organisation
responsible for managing global barcode standards), product recall portals from around
the world and Everledger (a digital global ledger that tracks the provenance of high-value
assets such as diamonds in an authenticated immutable manner) and others. Shping
consolidates and distributes the information shared by these groups in the common
pursuit of creating safer, more informed shopping decisions to benefit consumers and

10

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.4 - FEB 2018

brands. The public interface to the Shping Platform is the Shping App - a smartphone
application which acts as a mobile product search engine. The Shping App enables anyone
to scan a product’s barcode to learn more about products and the brands that make them
before, during and after making a purchase.
Shping is also a marketing and consumer engagement platform that enables participating
brands and associated organisations to incentivize consumers who scan their products.
This becomes a sustainable mechanism for brands to maintain customer loyalty, to
provide rich product and promotional information to influence purchase decisions, and
to communicate with consumers in relation to after-sales services such as warranty
registration and product satisfaction surveys.
In the near future, Shping also plans to enable retailers to use the Shping Platform to
communicate to customers, in order to encourage them to visit their store and a host of
other useful features (see page 17). Brands, retailers and associated organisations will
acquire Shping Coins and allocate these to consumers as incentives to facilitate the desired
engagements and actions they wish for consumers to take. Shping Coin will fuel engagement
and incentivize information exchanges between parties, and in doing so, will power the
constant refresh of information on the Shping Platform.

3.1 Features & benefits for consumers
3.1.1 Shping App
By scanning regular barcodes already on
packs, the Shping App enables consumers to
tap into Shping’s Global Product Database to
extract useful information to support them
with their shopping choices. In exchange for
scanning products and engaging with brands
through the Shping Platform, consumers will
earn rewards in the form of Shping Coins.
The rewards will be set and provided by brands and retailers who have acquired
Shping Coins to incentivize consumers to scan and engage with their products.
As such, the number of Shping Coins provided as rewards to consumers may fluctuate

11

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.4 - FEB 2018

based on the market value and demand. Shping will also incentivize users who fuel
the growth of the platform by scanning and validating product information, adding
“Shping Buddies”, adding reviews and adding details about products that are not
found in the Global Product Database.
Further, through Shping’s App and Platform, consumers will have access to an
increasingly useful resource, which enables consumers to:
→→ Look up a product’s ingredients, including information relating to the product’s
nutritional value, origin and composition in more detail
→→ View interesting additional information that brands may want to share such as
videos, “making-of” documentaries, advertisements, product manuals and recipes;
→→ Contribute details to the Global Product Database, especially for items that are
not yet listed in the Shping product database or do not have sufficient records
→→ Rate products for the benefit of other Shping users
→→ Read and write product reviews
→→ Complete questionnaires and surveys from brands
→→ Determine if a particular product has been recalled
→→ See which certifications the product has secured (if this feature is activated by the
certification authority)
→→ Verify a product’s authenticity (if this feature is activated by brands)
→→ Register the product for warranty (if this feature is activated by brands)
and more.

Shping App users will be incentivized by brands, retailers and associated
organisations to participate in certain actions by being rewarded with Shping Coins.
As Shping grows in usage and popularity, it is expected that the list of available
actions that will allow users to receive Shping Coins will also grow.

12

3.1.2 Shping Status
Shping App users will progress through five tiers of status - Basic, Bronze, Silver,
Gold, and Platinum. Each status change will be triggered by specific achievements
and milestones as users become more active and frequent users of the Shping App
(see Table 3.1.2).

Additionally, Token Buyers who meet certain conditions during the Token Sale will be
eligible for Platinum Status for Life. This will be the only time this exclusive privilege
will be offered. See Page 30 for details.
Shping App users will be able to upgrade their status by scanning a predetermined
number of product barcodes regularly, inviting and adding “Shping Buddies”, or
accumulating and maintaining a high volume of Shping Coins in their linked Digital
Wallets to maintain Gold or Platinum status. These membership levels then act as a
multiplier effect enabling Shping App users to earn higher Shping Coins per average for
each action. Users can only upgrade or downgrade one tier at a time, once a month.

13

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

Users who are regular contributors to the Global Product Database, will have
accuracy ratings assigned to them. Users with higher accuracy ratings may earn
Shping Coins from Shping based on their accuracy rating, and be given special titles
within the Shping community. All information entered by contributors is verified
by Shping’s moderation team, who will manually check information from the public
domain to ensure it matches the information entered by the contributor.

If 100% of the information has been verified correctly, the contributor will receive
100% of the Shping Coin allocated as a reward for this action. If 70% of the information
is correct, the user would only receive 70% and so on. The system would average the
score for all contributions in order to calculate the contributor’s score. For example, if
a contributor enters information in relation to 10 different products, where 5 of those
products receive a rating by the Shping moderator of 100% and 5 products receive a
rating of 80% the average rating for the contributor would equate to 90%.

3.1.3 Shping Buddies
Shping App users will have the option of inviting others to use the Shping App and
adding them to their network as a “Shping Buddy”. Inviting and adding Shping Buddies
will entitle users to earn bonus Shping Coins from Shping including the opportunity to
receive additional Shping Coins on a monthly basis for each active Shping Buddy in their
network.

14

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

3.2 Features & benefits for brands
3.2.1 Shping Marketing Module
The Shping Platform will provide brands and marketers with a new and highly targeted
channel to send useful messages to consumers when they scan their product’s barcodes
with the Shping App. It will also provide brands with access to valuable aggregate data
about these consumers’ buying habits through the Shping Marketing Module.
Shping Marketing is both a unicast and multicast communication platform for brands
to program and automate messages to reach consumers at a granular level. Through
this powerful channel, brands have access to a suite of useful features including:
→→ Direct-to-consumer communication - enabling brands to deliver messages to their
consumers at critical stages of their buying journeys.
→→ Consumer demographic and behavior analytics - offering an advanced analytics
suite that provides brands and retailers with access to comprehensive consumer
patterns and trends.
→→ Targeted, personalized marketing - giving brands a powerful tool to market
to consumers of their products, based on time, location and behavioural and
demographic criteria provided by consumers.
→→ A ready-made loyalty program - enabling brands to reward consumers in the form
of Shping Coin for engaging with their products on the Shping Platform
e.g. leaving reviews and engaging with information about the brand’s products.
→→ Social media integration - allowing brands to encourage their consumers to
subscribe and interact with their social media channels.
→→ Rich automation marketing features - provides marketers with the ability to
create and layer sequenced, highly relevant communications which are aligned
to consumer’s behaviours and the brand’s understanding of their buying journey.
These features include our own artificial intelligence interface, Shping Bot.

3.2.2 Shping Security Module
Another unique feature of the Shping Platform is that it provides brand owners the
ability to activate powerful brand protection and security features. Using a serialized
global trade item number (SGTIN), and a unique datamatrix code, manufacturers
will be able to identify and track each individual product through the Shping Platform.
The Shping Security Module enables brands to physically track their products
through their supply chain; with auditability and traceability from the point of
manufacture to the point of sale, enabling brands to:
15

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

→→ Track and Trace - enabling brands to track all electronic product code information
information services (EPCIS) events, and track the product through its chain of custody.
→→ Add to the Global Product Database - enables brands to store detailed information
about their products in Shping’s database in order to make that data accessible to
consumers and stakeholders who wish to access it.
→→ Activate product authentication - allows customers to verify the authenticity
of a product and confirm its location which in turn enables brands to identify
anomalies in the supply chain .
→→ Activate grey import monitoring - brands can be alerted to grey imports (also
known as parallel imports) such as where products are being delivered to retail
outlets through channels outside of a brand’s official distribution channels.
→→ Raw material traceability - enables manufacturers to track their stock of raw
materials, and provide data structures linking the use of specific raw materials to
their products, giving a granular understanding of a product’s composition.
→→ Product recall management - enables brands to identify if a product has any
components for which a recall has been issued and alert consumers if a given
product is under recall as soon as they scan the product, or if they have scanned
the product previously.
→→ Activating warranties - enabling customers to register their product warranties
within the Shping Platform. This feature also provides brands with fraud
protection, as brands are able to limit warranties for grey-imports, for example.
Shping also allows brands to sell extended warranties on the Shping Platform.
→→ Activate traceability and serialisation to comply with new regulations - providing
unprecedented visibility of the location of products in the supply chain, enabling
brands to quickly pinpoint items down to the saleable unit and activate product
recalls efficiently and proactively. This is very useful for meeting food and
pharmaceutical serialisation compliance protocols rolling out internationally.
→→ Take advantage of traceability regulation - brands can use the new serialisation
protocols to offer information about a product down to the saleable unit level
meaning that promotions on specific products in certain locations, stock
replenishment and recalls affecting small batches can be issued faster.

16

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

3.3 Features & benefits for retailers
3.3.1 Shping Retail Module
Shping Retail closes the loop between brands, the retail outlets who stock the
brand’s products and the consumers who are buying these products at the retail
outlets. This module will assist retailers to establish a direct channel with consumers
who have scanned products in their stores, resulting in a cost-effective marketing
tool that can be used to personalise and target marketing messages. The Shping
Retail Module is currently in development and Shping plans to deliver the module by
the end of the first quarter of 2018.
Through the Shping Retail Module, retailers will have the opportunity to access
the Shping Platform to influence foot traffic to their stores, mobilise flash sales on
certain products, drive ongoing interest, preference and loyalty for their outlets, and
even offer augmented reality experiences to make the shopping experience more fun.
The following features are a small sample of what can be implemented for Shping
retailers in the future. Shping will enable retailers to:
→→ Provide product information to consumers that is relevant to their store e.g to
alert customers to a fresh shipment of a particular product.
→→ Incentivize customers to leave store reviews, purchase products or subscribe to a
retailer’s digital channels to receive special offers.
→→ Support consumers with in-store navigation to their favourite products
→→ Learn more about their customers through an analytics suite.
→→ Launch augmented reality (AR) style product promotions and gamify
the shopping experience.
→→ Track products from the point of manufacture all the way through to placement
at the store.
→→ Confirm a product’s authenticity before they accept it into their warehouse
or outlet.
→→ Interact with brands to assist with their sales promotions.

The Shping Retail Module will be developed with safeguards and transparent rules
for participating retailers to ensure the system is respectful of consumers. For

17

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

example, retailers will only be permitted to use the platform to communicate with
customers about products that they have scanned with the Shping App and have
been purchased in their retail store. There will also be limitations on the amount of
times a retailer is permitted to communicate with a single customer over a specific
time period.

3.4 Features & benefits for the industry
A wide range of stakeholders from manufacturers to certification authorities and custom
officials will benefit from the Shping Platform. These benefits include;
→→ Auditing a product’s chain of custody through the supply chain.
→→ Identifying instances where certifications may be misused or counterfeited.
→→ Enabling product messages to be pushed to customers that promote or enhance the
certifications (e.g Certified Organic Australian produce).
→→ Incentivizing customers to purchase products, add reviews, or subscribe to other
digital channels such as email lists or social media.
→→ Meeting new compliance and industry regulations for traceability down to the
saleable unit, especially in regulated markets such as food and pharmaceutical
industries.

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

CHAPTER 4.0

How Shping works
4.1 Building a Global Product Database.
The Shping Ecosystem is built on product information provided by a number of data
sources including consumers, brands, retailers, manufacturers as well as governmentowned and independent certification bodies and agents acting within the supply chain.
Shping collects information from these sources into a continuously updated, distributed
product database (the Global Product Database). Using the Shping App, anyone can scan
a product’s GS1-compliant barcode or datamatrix code to access the synthesized product
information in the Global Product Database to help them make smarter and safer buying
choices through the Shping App.

Fig 4.1.1

Shping’s Global Product Database is continuously updated by trusted and

validated sources, including from the consumers themselves.

Our socially-engineered validation process ensures that trusted information will be
continuously updated by brands, retailers and consumers, helping to make the world’s
largest, Global Product Database trustworthy and accessible to all (see Fig 4.1.1.). Shping
supports all GS1 product identifiers, barcodes and datamatrix codes.

19

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

A common form of Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) is the code printed at the bottom
of a traditional EAN barcode. Developed by GS1, GTINs identify tradeable items. These
GTIN identifiers are used to look up product information in a database, usually through
carrying out a barcode scan. The unique nature and universality of GTINs make them
useful in establishing corresponding links between product listed in disparate databases.
Serialized global trade item numbers (SGTIN) are uniquely applied codes, usually in the
form of a datamatrix code, and are typically used by manufacturers to help identify and
track individual units. Unlike GTINs, SGTINs are only applied to an individual item rather
than all items of the same type of product.
SGTIN codes are expected to become a more prolific feature of products in the future
as traceability compliance regulation is enforced in countries around the world. Shping
offers serialisation for manufacturers to meet traceability compliance as part of its Shping
Security offering (see page 15).
The Shping database architecture uses GTIN as the key index to allow it to link to other
product-related data including SGTIN data. By scanning GTIN and SGTIN barcodes, Shping
users can reveal valuable information about products to help them feel safer about their
product choices (see figure 4.1.2).

Fig 4.1.2

Shping links information from GTIN barcodes and SGTIN datamatrix to

provide Shping users with access to a rich array of product information, which is
accessible through the Shping Platform.

4.2 Blockchain Integration
The Shping Platform is powered by Ethereum smart contracts, a next generation
blockchain protocol, and manages product traceability on the back of hyperledger and
GS1 standards. Shping combines the GS1 EPCIS standards (https://www.gs1.org/epcis) with
powerful blockchain technology. Shping has also partnered with Everledger to help create
a private blockchain based on the Hyperledger Fabric (https://www.hyperledger.org) to
play the role of a register for EPCIS events, allowing information to be exchanged quickly
and securely such as the serialization of products, items movement through the supply
chain, sales, and product recall alerts. All brands, distributors and retailers can become
a member of this network, start their nodes and use EPC Codechain. Shping’s blockchain
integration agent will provide blockchain information to consumers and third parties via
EPCIS SOAP service.

Fig 4.2.1

Shping Architecture

NB: Figure 4.2.1 show’s Shping’s architecture. Everything contained within the lower-shaded area is a work in progress
i.e Everledger integration. The information contained in the top-right shaded area is part of our future plan i.e
integration with more certification organisations.

21

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

4.3 Trusted Data Sources
Shping has a number of data sources that feed into its Global Product Database, which
Shping aims to use to develop a unique, trusted and reliable source of valuable information.

4.3.1 Data from Brands and their Supply Chain
The dataset collected from brands and their supply chain may include a product’s
point of origin, as well as records pertaining to the chain of ownership throughout
the supply chain, shipping and consignment details. It may also include information
on the raw materials contained in the product, information on how the product was
handled to the point of sale and even temperature logs. Through the Shping Security
Module, brands can track, audit and trace their products through their supply chain
from the point of manufacture to the point of sale. This data can also be of use
to manufacturers, retailers and consumers to ensure that a product has met the
requisite conditions and has been authenticated throughout the supply chain to
ensure that the product in front of them is genuine. Finally, this data source also
includes information created by brands and added to the Global Product Database
for consumers to discover when they scan products with their Shping App. This data
may include product fact sheets, marketing messages, product promotions, videos,
warranty details and more (see Shping Marketing Module on page 15).

4.3.2 Data from GS1 Local Members
Shping has set up partnerships with GS1 in Australia, Singapore, Russia, Malta and
Azerbaijan with more negotiations in progress. GS1 is a global, independent, non-profit
organisation responsible for the development and upkeep of supply chain standards
that enable organisations to store, transfer and exchange data and information
smoothly and universally. Its most well-known standard is the barcode which was
introduced in 1974 and has revolutionized data and supply chain management across
the retail, healthcare, transport and logistics industries. GS1 tools help organisations
exchange critical data - from manufacturing all the way to the point of purchase creating a common language that underpins systems and processes all over the world.
At the core of GS1’s trusted data is the National Product Catalogue, GS1’s renowned
product and item data synchronisation service. Since 2000, the National Product
Catalogue has been used by thousands of organisations, now including Shping.

22

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

4.3.3 Data from Certification Authorities
Certification Authorities are recognized accrediting bodies that can validate,
audit, confirm and award endorsements to brands and products that meet the
requirements of a particular standard. Common certifications include those that
represent safety standards, ingredient standards, sourcing and manufacturing
standards.

4.3.4 Shping has partnered with:
→→ Australian Certified Organic (Australia’s largest organic certification body)
→→ AsureQuality (owned by the New Zealand Government)
→→ The National Farmer’s Federation (Australia)
→→ Rosselkhoznadzor (Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary
Surveillance
→→ The Asia Food Safety Zone in Changchun (China).
Shping is currently in negotiations with more authorities around the globe. Shping’s
partnership with Certification Authorities enable it to integrate certified data and
test results about millions of different products, and links these to the product’s
GTIN in order to make this information accessible on the Shping App and Platform.

4.3.5 Data from Recall Portals
Shping sources information from official Product Recall authorities from around the
world to distribute product recall notices for products with specific batch numbers
through the Shping Platform. The Shping App instantly notifies users who are
scanning or who have recently scanned a product that is the subject of a product
recall. This provides a fast way to prevent more purchases of the defective product
from occurring and aids in the rapid return of products to the point of purchase for a
refund, exchange or service.

23

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

4.3.6 Crowdsourced Data
Shping incentivizes users to create and verify product information, product location
and the appeal of products in their possession, using the Shping App by rewarding
them with Shping Coins.
Additionally, every time a Shping App consumer scans a barcode which does not yet
appear in the database or, finds a discrepancy in the product information, consumers
will earn bonus Shping Coins helping to further add a layer of trust and verification
of data to the Global Product Database.
Shping App users can also contribute product reviews and rate products through
the Shping App, adding another layer of useful, real-world experience to the data
available on the Global Product Database for other users to access.
As users will have the ability to write product information to the Global Product
Database, Shping will implement a verification system to ensure that the information
supplied is genuine. In cooperation with brands, manufacturers and other users,
Shping will collaborate to safeguard and verify the information contained in the
database in a similar method to how Wikipedia works. Users who have demonstrated
honest behavior will be assigned a higher degree of credibility, potentially allowing
them to increase their Shping Status and earn more tokens per contribution. For
more information, please see the Shping Status section on page 13.

4.3.7 Government Data
Shping has entered a partnership with IPM - the system used by the WCO (World
Custom Organization) which enables customs officers to access records pertaining to
the full chain of custody of a product. Customs Officers can use the Shping Platform
to validate if the sender and receiver of the consignment note matches the track and
trace data store, thereby speeding up the clearance for the brand.
Shping has integrated with CIQ (China Inspection and Quarantine) to provide a system
of information on the shipment of food products in China where temperature logs,
chain of custody information, test results and other documentation are required.

24

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

4.3.8 Data from Everledger
As set out in section 4.2, Shping has partnered with Everledger, a London-based
company that uses blockchain, smart contracts and machine vision to assist in the
reduction of risk and fraud for banks and insurers. Everledger has also created a
global, digital ledger that tracks, protects and stores the provenance of valuable
assets.
Everledger is best known for enabling diamond suppliers, border agents and other
intermediaries to replace the paper process of certification with blockchain ledger.
To date, Everledger has placed more than 1.6 millions diamonds on a blockchain.
The company is also moving into luxury goods, wine and other industries where
provenance holds great importance. The partnerships enables Shping to publish
data from the state of the art blockchain network built by Everledger (see fig 4.3.8).
Shping App users are then able to use the app to verify the provenance, characteristics and authenticity of the many products recorded in the Everledger Hyperledger
Blockchain.

4.4 Marketing & Consumer Incentive System
Shping’s goal is to promote engagement between data sources so that users can access all
of the useful product information from a single interface in order to help them make safer
and smarter product choices. To encourage this engagement, Shping is introducing an
ERC20 compliant, Ethereum-based, smart contract currency called Shping Coin. The Shping
Coin will be created and distributed by Shping Pty Ltd (Shping Co), and will be integrated
within the Shping Platform through an agreement between Authenticateit and Shping Co.
Shping Coins are the reward that Shping App users may earn by scanning product barcodes
and connected datamatrix codes on products in order to access this rich product data
source. Shping Coins will be awarded to Shping App Users by brands, retailers, authorised
associated organisations and Shping itself from their own Shping Coin reserves.

It pays to shop smart
As the Shping App accesses a Global Product Database which is continuously being
enhanced by our data sources, users will undoubtedly discover the benefits of the Shping
App as a mobile search engine of products. Shping Coins simply accelerates usage and
adoption of the Shping App by rewarding consumers for certain actions.

Users can earn Shping Coins through the Shping App in a number of ways, including:
→→ Scanning or entering barcodes or serial numbers through the Shping App
→→ Registering as new users
→→ Rating products
→→ Reviewing products (with text, video or photos)
→→ Viewing product information, photo galleries, videos and advertisements
→→ Completing missing information in the Global Product Database
→→ Adding new products and information to the Global Product Database
→→ Interacting with brands and retailers through the Shping App
→→ Subscribing to brand’s social media accounts e.g Facebook, Twitter and Instagram
→→ Registering products or activating warranties.

26

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

Earning Shping Coins will be subject to the terms and conditions of use of the Shping App,
and brands’ use of the Shping Marketing module.

All business-to-consumer transactions through the
Shping Marketing module will be conducted using Shping
Coin.
Brand owners, retailers and other authorised system participants can incentivize Shping
App users with Shping Coins to view their product information
Brands and retailers will be able to give Shping Coins as rewards for consumers who
complete product-specific actions, thereby creating a powerful combined marketing and
incentive tool. Brands can use Shping Coins to incentivize customers to engage, take
actions, or simply integrate Shping Coin as part of an in-built loyalty program. This reward
model incentivizes users to interact with brands and continually redeem and spend Shping
Coin where appropriate.
This means that brands, retailers and authorised participants who wish to use the
platform to promote to Shping App users pre and post-purchase, will be required to have a
sufficient balance of Shping Coins in their digital wallets in order to reward Shping App users.

Shping Coins will be used to encourage Shping App
downloads, activation and adoption.
Until Shping reaches a critical mass in both our client and user base, in the early stages,
Shping will be using a reserve of Shping Coins to incentivize Shping App users to scan
products, rate products, upload reviews and complete other desirable actions (the Shping
App incentive Reserve). This is to ensure we create a consistently rewarding experience for
the consumer from the outset, and encourage usage while more brands and participating
parties are onboarded. Shping Coins can be easily stored in any ERC20 compliant digital
wallets and can be transferred and traded in a manner similar to any other digital
currency.

27

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

CHAPTER 5.0

The Shping Coin Economy
Shping Coins will be used by brands, certification authorities and retailers to incentivize
Shping App users to engage with product information and participate in other pre and
post-purchase activities through the App.

Fig 5.1

The Shping Coin Economy

NB: This diagram is for the purpose of detailing the potential interactions and flow of Shping Coins through various users. Actual
movement of Shping Coins will depend on a number of factors, including brand and user uptake. Shping makes no representations that
any of the users described will accept Shping Coins, that there will be any market or liquidity for the Shping Coins, or that any user will
realise any benefit or gain from trading, exchanging or using Shping Coins. Neither Authenticateit nor Shping Co makes any warranties
whether the Shping Coin may be listed on any cryptocurrency exchange.

Shping Co will initially allocate 42% of the total pool of Shping Coins (the Shping App
Incentive Reserve) for use by Authenticateit to incentivize users and to fuel the growth and
performance of the Shping Platform (e.g by scanning and validating product
information and adding valued details about products that are not found in the Global
Product Database). Shping Coins that are unsold during the Token Sale will also be added
to the Shping App Incentive Reserve.

28

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.3 - JAN 2018

30

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.ࠁ - `D# 2018

Shping Coin information for Brands
→ As brands will require Shping Coins to activate campaigns through Shping, brands will
nominate and link a digital wallet containing a sufficient balance of Shping Coins to
the Shping Marketing Module to commence their campaigns.
→ Brands can purchase Shping Coins from Shping Co during the Token Sale. Once the
Token Sale is complete, brands may be able to purchase Shping Coins from third parties
who make them available for sale. Neither Authenticateit nor Shping Co makes any
warranties as to whether the Shping Coin may be listed on any cryptocurrency exchange.
→→ Brands can then offer Shping Coins as incentives for Shping App users (consumers) to
engage with marketing messages, activations and promotions.
→→ The Shping Platform tracks each campaign and makes a record of the Shping Coins
earned and owed to Shping App users for participating in campaigns.
→→ As the Shping Coin is an ERC20 Ethereum token, any transaction or transfer of Shping
Coins involves verifying blocks of the blockchain. As such, this incurs a transaction on
the Ethereum network (Ethereum Transaction Fee). Users are required to cover the cost
of Ethereum Transaction Fees for transferring Shping Coins to their digital wallets.
To mitigate this, instead of brands depositing Shping Coins directly into individual
recipient’s digital wallets, a Shping Transit Account will be created to minimise the
incremental cost of these micropayments.
→→ As customers will be able to transfer Shping Coins to their Digital Wallet at any
time, they have the choice to ration the amount of times they choose to perform the
transfer in order to minimise Ethereum Transaction Fees.
→→ At the end of each calendar month, Shping will debit the brand’s accounts for the
amount of committed Shping Coins and store these amounts in the Shping
Transit Account.

Shping Coin information for Shping App Users
→→ The Shping App will show its users the amount of Shping Coins they have earned and
are owed and will allow them to transfer their Shping Coins from the Transit Account
to their own digital wallets at any time at the cost of an Ethereum Transaction Fee.
→→ By allowing users to choose when to transfer volumes of Shping Coins to their digital
wallets, users can choose to ration the amount of times they transfer, therefore
minimising the Ethereum Transaction Fees they are required to pay.

5.1 Structure of Distribution
Shping Co nor Authenticateit will never create additional Shping Coins outside of the
initial Token Sale and distribution.

CHAPTER 6.0

Shping’s Current
and Future Plan
6.1 Current Snapshot
The latest version of the Shping Platform is operational. It was launched in public beta on
the 30th June, 2017.
Shping is already generating revenue. Since it was founded in 2012, Shping Platform (www.
shping.com) has evolved from the Authenticateit (www.authenticateit.com) and currently
has 24 brand partners. (http://authenticateit.com/partners/).
Approximately 50,000 users have downloaded our initial iteration of the App (Authenticateit).
A marketing campaign to recruit Shping App users has been commissioned and is ready to
be activated with proceeds from the Shping Coin Token Sale.
Shping has offices in 4 major countries. It is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia and
has three international offices in Singapore, Beijing (China), and Moscow (Russia). Each
office participates in regional business development, educational seminars, onboarding
participating businesses, local promotion, and marketing. Shping currently employs 14
people, including 7 developers.
Shping has strategic alliances with a number of global partners:
→→ GS1: Australia, Singapore, Russia, Malta, Azerbaijan, Australia
→→ Certification bodies: Australian Certified Organic, AsureQuality
→→ Institutional bodies: National Farmer`s Federation, WCO (World Custom Organization)
CIQ (China Inspection and Quarantine), Rosselkhoznadzor (Russian Federal Service
for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance) and the Asia Food Safety Zone in
Changchun (China)

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.ࠁ - `D# 2018

6.2 Shping Milestone plan
Shping have laid out a roadmap that proposes each milestone of funding, and what
Shping aims to accomplish with those funds. Each of Shping’s milestones builds upon the
opportunities offered by the previous milestone. The milestone plan sets out Shping’s
indicative goals and targets only. Shping does not promise to fulfil any or all of the actions
detailed in this section.
While simultaneous deployment of cash and resources is possible, Shping believes that a
planned and structured expansion strategy is the best way to achieve optimal expansion.
Every incremental step provides more resources and structure for Shping, in order to
provide the best user experience possible. The achievement of phases listed below are
contingent on the amount received in the Token Sale. For example, if the amount sold in
Phase 3 is received, Shping is expected to complete the scope of work indicated within the
timeframes to undertake these activities in addition to the two preceding phases.

CHAPTER 9.0

Conclusion
Shping started out as a mission to protect brands and consumers from counterfeit goods
and has evolved into something much more robust, more pervasive and more powerful
- the Shping Platform. We are now on the verge of a future where brands, retailers,
authorities and consumers can work together to ensure that the products that are
available for sale are fit for purpose, richer in detail and safe.
In this whitepaper, we have explored how recent market and regulatory trends have
pushed manufacturers and retailers to improve transparency, traceability, protection
and accountability for their supply chains. We have also explored the changing consumer
behaviors that influence choice and the desire for brands to play a more proactive role in
influencing these choices before, during and after the purchase of consumer products.
Shping aims to provide consumers, brands and associated organisations with an
innovative shopping experience. Shping aims to address the challenges of the new
market systematically, sustainably and with the potential to scale for the betterment
of consumers, brands, retailers and associated businesses. Central to our belief is a
fundamental paradigm shift that sees recipients of the communication rewarded directly
for their vigilance, loyalty, engagement and attention with Shping Coin.
Rather than bolstering the coffers of just a handful of media giants, through Shping Coin,
we expect to see the birth of a global platform that businesses can use to connect with
millions of consumers. This Token Sale represents an opportunity to fuel the development
of Shping’s Global Product Database, and sustain the development of the Shping Platform
in order for businesses and consumers to interact with this database. This Token Sale will
also fuel Shping’s expansion and adoption to more countries around the globe.
Beyond the expansion of the Shping Ecosystem, this Token Sale offers individuals a chance
to be among the first to purchase Shping Coin in a new economy - one which is based on
connecting consumers, brands and businesses in mutually beneficial and exciting ways. The
future of shopping, we see is incentivized and rewarded with Shping Coins. A future where
it pays to shop smart.

Appendix
The History of Shping
Shping’s founder, Gennady Volchek became deeply interested in product safety and
authenticity during an attempt to purchase a safe, validated-genuine device-charger while
on holidays and finding the process untrustworthy and difficult.
In 2012, Mr Volchek founded Authenticateit with the goal of preventing the counterfeiting
of products in the retail market. His original idea was to implement EPCIS industry
standards into a cloud-based solution that could be offered to organisations as a
software as a service (SAAS). The platform began by supporting a product management
database which held a complex list of barcodes/Serialised Global Trade Item Numbers
(SGTIN) which were attached to specific products. The list was capable of storing
additional information (in the form of text, image, or even video) about each product
and had a unique marketing profile attached to it. Since the database was based on
international GS1 standards (EAN-13), a user was able to receive all of this additional
information from the database by scanning the barcode through the mobile application.
With the product database set up, AuthenticateIt was also able to issue serialized
GTINs (SGTIN) in order to track individual products. Track & Trace allowed brands and
users to track changes of custody as the product moved through the supply chain. For
manufacturers, this also meant that they could use the feature to manage the distribution
of products in specific geographies.
After 2 years in development, Authenticateit launched a proof of concept pilot project
with two Australian brands. Upon the completion of the proof of concept in late 2014, GS1
Australia published Authenticateit’s case study as a successful example of an “end to end
traceability deployment” using the GS1 standards.
For the first time, the Authenticateit solution made it feasible for businesses of any
size to adopt the industry standards for traceability. As a result, GS1 Australia selected
Authenticateit as a technology partner.

52

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.4 - FEB 2018

From 2014 to 2015 Authenticateit has implemented full traceability and serialisation
solutions in over 20 businesses in different verticals, including dairy, meat, clothing,
footwear, watch, wine and beer manufacturers.
AuthenticateIt added raw material management to the database. This allowed
manufacturers to link materials and suppliers to each product. That way, if one material
was recalled, any product using that material would automatically be issued a recall alert.
If any product was recalled, users were notified through the mobile application after they
scanned the product barcode.
Authenticateit also partnered with the World Customs Organisation (WCO) and integrated
its solution with the WCO’s IPM platform which saw the Authenticateit border protection
features rolled out to 68 countries. Finally, Authenticateit developed several features
that were focused on the end-users. These included the potential for a rewards program,
socialization, and reporting. The rewards program allowed brands to create campaigns
that rewarded users with points for viewing product information. The socialization engine
allowed for interaction and communication between brands and consumers using Live
Chat or messages. This also included an additional feature where users could register
warranties for purchased products. The Reports Module allowed for brands to access data
in relation to the products being authenticated and being purchased by users.
In 2016, Authenticateit decided to rebrand the company and its platform to Shping. The
base of the platform has been redeveloped to make the system more universal and
tolerant of increased volumes for long term and sustained use. Shping is being refined to
build on Authenticateit’s legacy and will maintain a continuing level of client service.
In addition to the company’s rebranding effort, Shping has refined its offerings and added
new features to the Shping Platform (as detailed in the roadmap). The product database
now allows for customizable fields of data entry for each product, including geography
and language. There will be a number of new widgets and data fields which can be applied
to products. All participants in the platform can provide additional information for each
GTIN in the database and more.
Individual modules such as Track & Trace and Raw Materials will be combined into Shping
Security. The rewards, socialization, and reports modules will be combined into Shping
Marketing. Shping has made and will continue to make a number of refinements to the
existing modules so that the user experience is much more useful, intuitive, and fluid.

Case studies
Koalabi Ugg Boots

Koalabi Ugg Boots is an Australian brand that manufactures and supplies high quality,
sheepskin Ugg boots. Since 1989, the company has been successfully wholesaling and
retailing their products locally and internationally.Some of Koalabi’s Eastern European
distributors were taking advantage of lower wholesale prices to create unauthorised
overruns and versions of Koalabi Ugg boots that were exported to local retailers in
Australia and New Zealand.
Local retailers of genuine Koalabi boots were struggling to compete with the lower prices
of these fraudulent products, and were forced to reduce their own prices.
Shping was contacted by Koalabi to identify counterfeit or grey market goods, educate
unaware retailers, and help grow the company’s existing supply chain by including
retailers that were unwittingly engaged in selling Koalabi counterfeit or grey market
goods.
Shping implemented a system that allowed Koalabi to restrict overseas imports of their
products and confined distributors to supply products to specific regions. By scanning
the consignments with Shping’s serialised codes, retailers were able to identify if the
imported goods were legally saleable in Australia or not.
Within 30 days of implementing Shping, Koalabi identified 12 retail outlets that were
selling counterfeit boots to consumers. The retailers themselves were unaware that the
products being sold by them were not genuine.
In the first month after implementing Shping, 2% of Koalabi’s customers were scanning
barcodes and authenticating their products prior to purchase. That number jumped to 18%
within 6 months. For the same time-frame, Koalabi Ugg Boots sales have increased by 3%.

57

Shping Coin: Token Sale Whitepaper, Ver 1.4 - FEB 2018

Norco
Australian dairy manufacturer, Norco, teamed up with Shping to prevent counterfeiting of
Australian milk in China. Norco was looking for a solution where customers could easily
verify the authenticity of the milk they were buying and confirm if the products were
compliant with Chinese food safety regulations.
Once Shping was implemented into Norco’s production and sales process, Norco noticed the
following:
→→ 72% of customers who authenticated Norco milk at least once, would regularly use
the app to verify the authenticity of Norco milk;
→→ 67% of customers who scanned any of Norco’s products also accessed product
insights (a marketing tool used by Norco);
→→ 99% of customers who scanned Norco’s products checked on the product recall status.
Shping’s product serialization system was an integral component of Norco’s “paddock to
plate” quality assurance guarantee. The system’s ability to precisely validate provenance
and physically track the location of the milk shipments was so precise, that it allowed
distributors and Norco to secure expedited border clearance (5 days or fewer) in China for
their products. The trial shipment was such a huge success now allowing Norco to use this
expedited pipeline to deliver over 20 million litres of fresh milk into China in just the first
year of partnering with Shping alone.
