Abstract: ​Switcheo is a Decentralized Exchange to be built on top of multiple popular blockchains to
facilitate the exchange of digital assets. It will first be launched on the NEO blockchain and will include
digital assets such as NEP-5 tokens (e.g. RPX, QLC) and future NEP-X tokens, and NEO’s system assets
such as NEO and GAS. Trade settlements are done peer-to-peer via interaction with our smart contract(s).
Switcheo aims to achieve a network of DEX with cross-chain swapping capabilities between multiple
popular blockchains such as QTUM (QRC20) and Ethereum (ERC20), with more research being done for
upcoming blockchains like Stellar.

1. PREFACE
We saw the opportunity to develop a decentralized exchange (“DEX”) with the increasing popularity of
projects built on the NEO blockchain, and the difficulty of listing such NEP-5 tokens on credible
exchanges. We want to reduce the dependency on centralized exchanges for the listing of NEP-5 tokens.
Switcheo participated in the first City of Zion’s NEO dApp challenge and clinched the 1350 GAS prize.
[1] Switcheo aims to be the first DEX launched on the NEO platform, and our future roadmap includes
working on cross-chain swaps for QRC20 tokens on the QTUM blockchain and ERC20 tokens on the
Ethereum blockchain.

2. INTRODUCTION
With the increasing popularity of blockchain technologies fuelling the price of cryptocurrencies, a
majority of these trades are done via traditional centralized exchanges. Centralized exchanges fall into two
categories: those that accept fiat currencies (government-backed currencies), and those that do not.
Switcheo will initially not accept fiat currency transfers and will first work towards a ​multi chain
decentralized cryptocurrency exchange​ platform where users may perform trades of virtual tokens and
assets trustlessly (i.e. without the need to trust a centralized third party).

3. PROBLEMS WITH CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES
3.1 SECURITY
An immediate disadvantage when using a centralized exchange is the security risks arising from the
centralization of funds. As all funds sent in by users for trading are stored and secured by the exchange,
the funds are prone to a single point of failure. For example, the exchange servers could be breached by
attackers, or the exchange’s wallet private keys could be lost, resulting in a loss of funds.

These failures are completely out of the control of the individual user, regardless of how secure their
passwords are, and they have to trust that the centralized exchange have done what is necessary to secure
their funds. There have been major breaches of users’ trust, evidenced in past exchange hacks which have
amounted to billions of dollars in value lost over the last few years. A prime example of this would be the
USD 500 million lost in the recent Coincheck breach. [2]
Decentralized exchanges solve this problem by letting the blockchain and the user handle the security of
funds from start to end. A DEX is therefore as secure as its smart contract, and most existing DEXs have
been running for a long time with no core breaches (e.g. EtherDelta).
3.2 CONTROL OF FUNDS
When users deposit their funds into a centralized exchange, their funds are under the control of the
exchange. The exchange may be able to withhold funds from users[3] or remove funds from users’
accounts[4] at any time. In general, a user has to trust that a centralized exchange will always act in good
faith for the user. This is in contrast to cryptocurrency’s spirit of decentralization and trustlessness.
3.3 EASE OF TRANSFER
Users may also be unable to withdraw assets in small numbers from centralized exchanges[5], or it may
not be viable to withdraw often due to high withdrawal fees. This hurts the user’s security even further as
they are at the mercy of the centralized exchange while their funds remain there. Furthermore, a high
number of confirmations are typically required when depositing funds. These issues make trading on
centralized exchange a hassle —
​ ​ moving funds from a wallet to an exchange to trade and then back is
generally slow and tedious and subject to unanticipated delays.
As all exchange interactions for Switcheo are done via a smart contract (i.e. code on the blockchain), users
can buy or sell tokens directly from their wallet, without additional transfers. Users can also withdraw any
amount of tokens from their balance at any time, and this is guaranteed by the code of the smart contract.
When not actively trading, users’ funds are always secured by the same mechanism - their own wallet
contract, or Switcheo’s smart contract.
3.4 IMMEDIATE LISTING
A big issue with the acquisition of tokens of an early stage blockchain startup is finding exchanges that list
the wanted tokens. On the other hand, users who have purchased tokens during an Initial Coin Offering
(ICO) also have to wait for the token to be listed on an exchange before being able to sell it. This leaves
many users stuck with the token even though they may no longer want it.
With the increasing popularity of projects developed on the NEO Blockchain, Switcheo will strategically
start trading NEP-5 Token contracts for the NEO Blockchain first, before moving on to QRC20 Tokens
(QTUM). Using the dynamic call functionality of the NEO blockchain, users will be able to list and buy
tokens the moment they are available for transfer on the blockchain.
3.5 EXCHANGE FEES

While centralized exchanges like Binance and Gate.io charge exorbitant rates for withdrawals for small
amounts of cryptocurrencies, there will be no withdrawal fee for Switcheo’s smart contract. Users will
only pay the standard network fees, and not be charged additional amounts should they decide to withdraw
their balance. The maker and taker fee for Switcheo is capped at 0.5%, and is guaranteed by the smart
contract.

4. PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING DECENTRALIZED
EXCHANGES
While a DEX has clear advantages over a centralised exchange in the security & control of funds, ease of
transfer, immediate token listing, and lower fees, Switcheo’s true priority is to overcome the shortfalls of
existing DEXs.

4.1 ​USER EXPERIENCE
Order mistakes, wrong trades and mis-clicks are the hallmarks of current DEXs. While a true DEX will
inherently have different performance characteristics from a centralized exchange, we believe this problem
can be overcome by a well-thought-out UI & UX. Switcheo’s DEX will allow for ​partial filling ​of offers,
auto-retrying​ of failed orders, and ​order batching​ within a single transaction. This provides the user the
experience of using a traditional exchange while allowing them to remain in control of their funds through
the Switcheo smart contract. Exchange of Tokens is done without delegating any key component (such as
order matching) to an off-chain service where unseen shenanigans that compromise the integrity of the
entire exchange may happen.

4.2 ​SMART CONTRACT SECURITY
As the security of a DEX is only as good as the security of its smart contract, we hope to run an aggressive
bug bounty campaign​ over a minimum of 1 week on top of external audits, to minimize the possibility of
any critical bugs in our smart contract. More details on this will be announced soon.

4.3 ​KYC / AML REQUIREMENTS
Many governments have KYC/AML laws and requirements, in addition to regulations for the trading of
securities. We aim to implement D-KYC whitelists on our exchange so that users can trade on our
exchange in compliance with the relevant legislations. Furthermore, we intend to monitor transactions on
the Switcheo DEX for suspicious transactions, such that we can assist legal authorities in tracing and/or
tracking illegal activities conducted through the blockchain.

4.4 ​LOW EXCHANGE VOLUME
We hope to overcome the problem of low liquidity / exchange volume through strong credibility, market
presence and a state-of-the-art ease-of-use platform, such that using Switcheo’s user experience is
preferred even to popular centralized exchanges.

5. ​NEO FRAMEWORK
5.1 GAP
NEO is a good first blockchain to enter the market with. The NEO blockchain has recently garnered
international attention, and is growing at an enormous rate. Since the first ICO on NEO in October 2017
(Red Pulse, $RPX) there has been 6 more NEP-5 based ICOs with a total raised amount of $184,990,000,
and 6 more ICOs planned in the near future[7]. However, there has yet to be an avenue where users may
sell their NEP-5 tokens after they are made tradable without waiting for a centralised exchange to list
them. This gives us a first-mover advantage in launching a DEX on NEO.

5.2 RESEARCH
The cumulative valuation of all ICO funding reached $3.775bn [6] in November 2017. 24 hour trading
volume for all exchanges can reach billions of dollars for a single token or asset. Switcheo just needs to
capture a small segment of this market to be profitable. For comparison, the combined trading volume for
DEXs on Ethereum (EtherDelta + IDEX) is currently $6m. This is already a $60,000 daily revenue.
However, Switcheo’s goal is not to compete with existing DEXs. We aim to compete head-to-head with
centralized exchanges such as Binance and Kucoin, such that we may attain similar volumes to them. This
is why Switcheo focuses fundamentally on 3 things:
1. Volume & Assets Available - Switcheo seeks to gain users by offering a viable option for buying /
selling tokens that cannot be found elsewhere.
2. User Experience - By having an excellent UI/UX, retail traders are more likely stick to the
platform, and hence more likely to grow its usage through word of mouth.
3. Scalability - At high transactions rates, DEXs perform suboptimally compared to centralized
exchanges; Switcheo is commited to constantly refining, optimizing and improving its architecture
to support increasing user loads to the best of its abilities.

6. SWITCHEO ARCHITECTURE
On centralized exchanges, most of the functional logic and data are performed and stored on their own
servers. Switcheo’s main operations, however, are mainly executed by a smart contract residing on NEO’s
decentralized blockchain.
There are 4 core components that make up the Switcheo DEX:
● A front facing user interface that interacts with the smart contract
● Custom blockchain nodes to log smart contract events and interactions
● Off-chain order history database and API
● Broker smart contract

6.1 FRONT-FACING USER INTERFACE (UI)
From the user’s point of view, the Switcheo DEX operates almost identically to traditional exchanges that
users are comfortable with. Where required however, we always remind users of the possible differences

when performing an action. For example, trades are asynchronous, may fail and have to be re-submitted.
Other differences include the fact that a user account is not required. We also “login” using the user’s
wallet instead of an email-password pair, and can display their wallet balance, transaction history, etc.
immediately.
Features:
● Market buy/sell
● Limit buy/sell
● Login through JSON Wallet, WIF, Private Key, Ledger
● Client-side matching and filling multiple offers within a single offer
● Automatic retry of failed fills
● Personal transaction history
● Trading charts (via tradingview)
The Switcheo UI is built on React.js.

6.2 CUSTOM BLOCKCHAIN NODE
The Switcheo smart contract will raise events when you perform certain actions using the user interface.
These events are emitted as smart contract event notifications which contain details of the interaction with
the contract. Depending on the trigger of the event, the payload contains different information:
●
●
●
●
●

Created (Maker Address, Offer
Amount)
Filled (Filler Address, Offer
asset id, wanted amount)
Failed (Filler Address, Offer
Cancelled (Canceller Address,
Withdrawal (Withdraw Address,

Hash, Offer Asset ID, Offer Amount, Want Asset ID, Want
Hash, Filled Amount, Offer Asset ID, Offer Amount, wanted
Hash)
Offer Hash)
Asset ID, Withdrawal Amount)

We subscribe to these events using a full node. These events are stored and used for the presentation of
auxiliary information (e.g. transaction history, trading chart) to improve the UI/UX of the user of the
Switcheo UI. These events are informational and are not essential to the trading or operation of the
Switcheo smart contract.

6.3 ​OFF-CHAIN ORDER HISTORY DATABASE AND API
We have developed an API which can retrieve and present data about orders and transactions on the
Switcheo DEX in an easy-to-use JSON format. This API is used by the Switcheo UI and can be used by
external applications which require the current and/or historical data from Switcheo (e.g. coinmarketcap).
6.4 SWITCHEO BROKER SMART CONTRACT
The Switcheo Broker Contract is the core engine that runs all asset swaps and handles deposit and
withdrawal of assets through transaction invocations. An in depth description is given in the following
section (Section 7).

7. SWITCHEO BROKER SMART CONTRACT
The current smart contract is written in C# using the NEO framework. Any NEP-5 token and System
Asset (NEO, GAS) are currently supported as trading pairs. ​The latest smart contract can be viewed here:
https://github.com/ConjurTech/switcheo/blob/master/switcheo/BrokerContract.cs
7.1 OPERATIONS
There are 4 primary operations used for trading:
❏ makeOffer
❏ This allows users to make an asset swap offer on the contract.
❏ The params required are:
❏ Script hash of the offer maker (invoking user)
❏ Script hash of the asset being offered
❏ Amount of asset being offered
❏ Script hash of the asset wanted in return
❏ Amount of asset being wanted
❏ SystemAssets (NEO/GAS) must be attached if they are part of the fill.
❏ Once invoked, the offered amount will be transferred to the smart contract, and the offer
will be placed on the blockchain for anyone with the corresponding assets to fill.
❏ fillOffer
❏ This allows users to fill an offer on the contract.
❏ The params required are:
❏ Script hash of the offer filler (invoking user)
❏ Offer hash of the offer to be filled
❏ Amount of offered asset that should be filled
❏ SystemAssets (NEO/GAS) must be attached if they are part of the fill.
❏ Once invoked, the offer corresponding to the correct offer will be filled. Partial filling is
possible.
❏ Amounts will be transferred to the maker and filler for withdrawal in a second transaction.
❏ cancelOffer
❏ This allows a user to cancel a previous offer that has not been completely filled.
❏ The params required are:
❏ Offer hash to be cancelled
❏ Once invoked, the offer will be cancelled and any remaining balance will be credited to
the user balance for withdrawal in a second transaction.
❏ withdrawAssets
❏ This allows users to withdraw their balance in the smart contract.
❏ The params required (NEP-5) are:
❏ Script hash of the user to withdraw balance from
❏ Script hash of the asset to withdraw
❏ Amount of asset to withdraw

❏ For SystemAssets, params are not required, but the transaction must be invoked with a
TransactionAttribute of Usage 0xd1 and Data 0x01. We chose an implementation which
uses transaction attributes instead of "method arguments" to prevent double withdrawals
before main net deployment.
❏ Our implementation currently does not allow a transfer trading of this balance and this
operation must always be called to make use of the swapped asset.
There are other operations available for getting data about the Switcheo DEX, such as ​getOffers ​and
getExchangeRate​. There are currently 26 operations that can be performed on the Switcheo smart contract.
We will detail the full ABI of the Switcheo smart contract at a later date.
7.2 OFFER LISTINGS
In order to find offers on the blockchain, list traversal can be used. By querying the contract's storage with
a concatenation of the offered and wanted asset script hashes, the head of the list can be obtained.
This will give the offerHash of the latest offer on the trading pair. This allows the offer information to be
queried and deserialized. Each offer contains the offerHash of the next offer. In this way, the list can be
traversed entirely, and an order book can be displayed and/or cached.

8. SWITCHEO (SWH) TOKEN
Switcheo team will launch the token contract for Switcheo (SWH) Tokens no earlier than the 16 March
2018 on the NEO Blockchain as a NEP-5 Token.
1,000,000,000 SWH Tokens may be minted in total, and no additional tokens will be minted in future.
The allocations for SWH are as per follows:
20% ​(200,000,000 SWH Tokens) will be allocated to the Public Sale;
48.3% ​(483,000,000 SWH Tokens)​ ​have been allocated to Strategic Partners;
25% ​(250,000,000 SWH Tokens) will be reserved for the Switcheo Team to further incentivize
development of the Switcheo DEX, and the tokens will be vest monthly on a 2 year schedule with a 3
month cliff; and
6.7% ​(67,000,000 SWH Tokens) will be reserved for Marketing Campaigns & Official Partnerships.

8.1 BASE TRADING PAIR
SWH Tokens will be added as a base pair while trading on the Switcheo DEX through the Switcheo UI.

8.2 SUBSIDISED TRADING FEES
SWH Tokens can be used to subsidise trading fees on the Switcheo DEX by 50%. Users may toggle this
option in the trading UI. SWH Tokens will be burnt when they are used to pay trading fees.

8.3 USED FOR CROSS SWAP
SWH Tokens will be used as the base token when doing cross swaps to other chains in future.
