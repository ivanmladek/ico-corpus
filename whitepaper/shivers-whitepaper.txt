WHITE PAPER
1. OVERVIEW
Elevator Pitch
Shivers Media, LLC was created for the purpose of developing software which uses the
internet and blockchain technology to deliver horror films. Along with our distribution
platform, we are also using cryptocurrency to create a fund for creating a slate of unique
and exclusive horror films as a way to attract users to our platform.
The main points which we would like to convey include:
Our partnership with Infamous Horror.
Infamous Horror is a Facebook page with 1.7 Million Followers. The page is dedicated
to horror films.
Team and partner experience
Our team has produced over 50 films, including films which have starred celebrities
such as Val Kilmer, Rose McGowan, Steven Seagal, Danny Trejo, David Hassellhoff
and others. We are avid cryptocurrency enthusiasts who have been involved in all levels
of the cryptocurrency world, including mining, token development, trading, and
networking with like-minded individuals and communities.
Purpose of the token
Many cryptocurrency projects provide a token which can be used for trading on
exchanges, and not much more . We designed our token as a pass-key to our products,
providing a utility. Think of Shivers as Movie Tickets to watch our future films.
Long term effects of our token
Due to the nature of our token, as a pass-key, over time the supply of the token shall
decrease as they are used by consumers of our products. This provides our long term
holders with exclusive access to long-term content.

The Product
Shivers cryptocurrency is an ERC20 compatible token.
The Shivers Token is to be used as a key to unlock products developed by Shivers
Media LLC and other film distributors which may adopt the cryptocurrency. These
products include Horror Films, Digital Media, and Software. More detailed information
about the products we will create is discussed below in Section Two (2).
Due to the use of Shivers Tokens as passkeys to products, the supply of Shivers
Tokens shall decrease over time as their use on our products increases. We will provide
a built-in method for measuring the price variants for the Shivers Token to
accommodate for changes in prices as a way to assure our products are sold at
reasonable prices.
Shivers Media is active in the development and creation of a software distribution
platform for future products, and the production of a slate of horror films. To ensure the
adoption of our cryptocurrency and the long-term life of the company, the company
intends on creating as many products as possible.

The Blockchain Opportunity
“Blockchain” products have become popular over the past two years, creating a vast
and large financial market. The majority of these financial instruments and products
have two common attributes; anonymous transactions and an unregulated trading
environment. Few blockchain companies create products tied to their cryptocurrency.
We have set out to create a product, which utilizes the technology of “the blockchain” to
support independent films. The use of blockchain allows us to create and foster a
community, which is able to participate in the creation of high quality and niche films by
filmmakers that have loyal followings, but may have struggled with the studio system.
Using Shivers Tokens as opposed to regular cash for our products also allows us to
develop software and technology, which can support and enhance our consumers
experience with our product.

Why Use the Blockchain?
There are a few perks that come with utilizing blockchain technology to develop the
Shivers platform, including:


Content purchased automatically: The use of smart contracts will guarantee that
content is automatically paid for and distributed when a member decides to
watch the content.



Resistant to hijacking: The films will be distributed through blockchain nodes.
These nodes will act as a network of replicated databases, thus providing an
added layer of security.



Constant Availability: Due to our films being distributed on a decentralized
network, it will be impossible for the content to be blocked by other parties. This
is especially important due to unforeseen regulatory forces which may alter the
way people interact with the internet.

Why horror films?
We have selected Horror Films due to the deep relationships we maintain with the
horror film industry and our industry reach. Our partnership with Infamous Horror
provides us with a direct outlet for marketing to a hungry audience of over 1.7 Million
horror fans.

Why this Team?
The Shivers Media Team consists of an eclectic group of individuals which have
excelled in their field and have shown consistent and performance and success. Our
team is experienced in software development, film production, cryptocurrency, and
business administration.
The team includes but is not limited to the following individuals:

Dar Warison
With a background in entrepreneurship that stretches over a decade, Mr.
Warison took the initiative to finance and develop a documentary on Hurricane
Katrina. His first successful venture was developed as a non-profit corporation,
for which he raised private funds. His role as producer and director, guided the
project from production through distribution. Dar continued to raise equity for
feature films and private business. Mr. Warison was the center of several
business deals, including optioning a TV show to USA Network and purchasing a
restaurant via leveraged buyout.

Benjamin Sacks
Benjamin is the President of Production and COO at Hollywood Media Bridge. While
being charged with overseeing the operations at Hollywood Media Bridge, Benjamin has
at times overseen as many as 5 concurrent productions. He has successfully brought in
difficult projects with stars such as Val Kilmer, David Hasselhoff, and Steven Seagal.
Benjamin has produced, managed and overseen over 50 feature films, scripted
television, commercials and music videos. He has a complete understanding the film
making process with a master knowledge of how to deliver a project on time and on

financial was forged through many years of learning the business from the ground up;
from a Production Assistant all the way to the President of Production. Benjamin was
Born in Los Angeles, CA and graduated from Pepperdine University with a bachelor's
degree in Political Science. He served in the United States Marine Corps and was
honorary discharges in 1998. Afterwards began pursuing a career in the film industry

Samuel Gauvin
Samuel is a social media expert and has handled many high profile Horror Film-related
campaigns. Most recently he was in charge of promoting the limited theatrical release of
Jeepers Creepers 3, which was able to sell out all of the theaters which it played. He
manages the Infamous Horror Facebook group which has over 1.7 million followers.
In addition to a strong core, we have established an advisory board to assist with
developing products. These advisers include:

Eduardo Sanchez (Adviser)
Eduardo is best known for co-creating the horror hit “The Blair Witch Project.” He acted
as co-writer and co-director on the legendary film. Eduardo has numerous feature films
and television shows under his belt and serves Shivers as an adviser.

Gregg Hale (Adviser)
Gregg is an accomplished film producer who is also known for his work on “The Blair
Witch Project.” He has produced numerous feature films and works closely with
Eduardo.

Amber Hartley (Adviser)
Amber currently serves as the Chief Corporate Development Officer for BurstIQ (a
blockchain based healthcare company). Amber serves as an adviser on blockchain
related issues.

2. THE FILMS
Filmmaker Qualifications
The main priority of Shivers Media is to create content that is appealing to our audience.
This means working with filmmakers who have demonstrated the ability to create
content which has generated a large following or has performed well in the Box Office.
An example of this would be a filmmaker who has directed a film that has grossed over
$50 Million dollars in the box office, many of whom we are in direct communication with
to finance and distribute their films.
Another example would be a filmmaker or writer who created a film which has gone on
to become a “cult classic.” While this filmmaker may not have generated a large box
office draw, they have over time built a following that we would like to foster by
developing products for them to enjoy.
We are currently in negotiations with filmmakers who have generated over $1 Billion in
total in their careers at the box office.

Management and Organizational Details
Shivers Media, LLC is a Delaware based LLC. The Managing member is Dar Warison,
the founder.
All film-related products are overseen by Benjamin Sacks, an accomplished film
producer with over 44 credits to his name and currently serves as the COO of
Hollywood Media Bridge.
All non-film related projects, including the development of the software platform, as well
as many of the business choices are overseen by Dar Warison.
In addition to the core team and our advisers, Shivers Media has retained outside legal
counsel, which has a specialty in cryptocurrency and tax law.

3. DISTRIBUTION PLATFORM
The goal of the company is to develop a unique software application that utilizes
blockchain technology as a way to distribute films. This comes with some challenges
but also provides us with a great opportunity to use emerging technology to pioneer a
new platform for our consumers.

Distribution Options
To effectively get our products into the hands of our customers, we will have to maintain
a clear delivery channel that provides ease of access, ease of use, and awareness to
our consumer.
Providing ease of access can be accomplished via allowing our products to be
accessed via existing methods, such as Smart TV's, smart Phones, Tablets, PC's, and
Game Consoles. Obtaining Shivers Tokens must also be easy to obtain, as our content
requires tokens as keys. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, including
allowing the purchase of our products on a subscription basis and providing content,
which we previously unlocked via a company pool of Tokens.
To ensure the direct profitability of our content, it is the intention of Shivers Media to
seek out and negotiate Theatrical Distribution for all of our content. This will allow us the
ability to provide our content creators with a greater share of revenue than they would
normally be accustomed to as well as providing the company with revenue to generate
additional content.
All home-media distribution will go through the Shivers platform or shall require direct
payment of Shivers Tokens from home-media distributors as a way to compensate for
the potential loss of Shivers Tokens being burned by their use as keys.

MARKETING OPTIONS
Marketing of a motion picture is normally the sole responsibility of the distributor. We
happily take on this responsibility and shall utilize our advertising partnership with
Infamous Horror and other social media outlets. These outlets combined have close to
Two Million people watching.
Our primary outlet for marketing is Infamous Horror, a Facebook page which focuses on
the niche genre of Horror Films. Infamous Horror is managed by Samuel Gauvin and is
based in Canada.
On top of marketing with Infamous Horror, we have several other methods of generating
buzz for our projects. This includes and is not limited to advertising with horror-centric
film websites, interactive websites that promote our films, and software such as games
or video game DLC.

4. THE INDUSTRY
Movie Industry Overview
Traditionally, an independent film is defined as a film that finds its production financing
outside of the studios and is free of studio creative control. In recent years, the line has
been blurred between independent and studio films as all of the majors have
established ‘independent’ or specialty film divisions such as Universal Studio’s
subsidiary Focus Features or Walt Disney’s Miramax Films. Regardless of how films are
financed and made, the studios still largely control the theatrical distribution of films.
Independently produced films are able to avoid the high overhead costs of the studios
by putting together the personnel and other required elements of production on a film-by
film basis. Their budgets can range from the hundreds of thousands of dollars to a
hundred million dollars. Independent films normally offer more creative freedom than
studio controlled films, often leading to more intelligent and original films than the
standard Hollywood fare.
The basic stages of making motion pictures are: development, pre-production,
production, and post-production. Development consists of the writing or acquiring of a
script, preliminary casting considerations, and the acquisition of financial backing for the
film. Pre-production involves the budgeting and scheduling of production, location
scouting, set construction, the hiring of various creative and technical personnel, as well
as the finalization of casting. Production begins when principal photography
commences, and generally lasts between four and twelve weeks. During the postproduction phase, the film is assembled and edited.
Once the picture is “locked”, the audio goes through a sound mix where the dialog is
“sweetened” and music and sound effects are added. The final film is then digitally color
corrected and makes its way to a finished medium that you see projected in theaters.
The entire post-production phase typically requires six to eight months. The costs up to
this point are referred to as the film’s production or “negative costs”.

5. MILESTONE PROJECTIONS (ROADMAP)
Background and development
The Milestone projections for SHIVERS assume a conservative level of success for
deals negotiated with talent. Many factors affect the success of any business and we
will make adjustments to our road-map to overcome unforeseen circumstance, including
the following:
• Innate commercial appeal
• Funding
• Negotiations
• Timing of release
• Cohesive workforce
Maintaining a cohesive and focused workforce is the single most significant factor in
determining the success of a business's ability to create proposed products. This is
closely followed by the agreement that the company has with its talent. However, all
these factors affect the eventual bottom line. For the purposes of this document, we are
displaying a timeline of eight months for the initial release of our products.

Projections
This section contains the SHIVERS ROADMAP beginning with the initial Token Sale.
The projections are based on estimates provided by independent contractors and
software development companies which we may enter into negotiations, as well as
current trends in the industry.
Initial Legal Formation (November 2017)
This stage includes incorporation and the initial agreements between founders.
Business structure is decided and the business plan is created.
Industry Partnerships (November 2017)
Partnership deals, both public and private, are created. Including our agreement with
Infamous Horror and others.
Private Sale (December 2017)
Tokens are sold to the earliest of adopters with deals negotiated individually.
Pre-Sale (Janurary 2018)
The selling of our token. The price lasts for one month and allows us to prepare our
promotional reach in anticipation for the Public Token Sale.
Token Sale (Februrary 2018)
Sales of Shivers Tokens are offered at four different price ranges depending on the
week of the month.

Software Development (March 2018 – Continuous)
A portion of the proceeds is converted into USD and used to hire a development team
to begin the initial steps towards creating the software proposed in this document.
Initial Film Production (March 2018)
The production of our selected horror films begins at this time. This includes breaking
down the script, scheduling, budgeting, and setting in motion the production of our films.
Beta Release (Software) (July 2018)
The initial Shivers distribution platform should exist in a basic form and released to the
public as a way to test it's functionality and to provide feedback to the development
team for desired changes and features.
Initial Film Releases (July 2018)
The earliest possible releases of our films shall occur in July. This is strongly dependent
on the software functionality and our ability to maintain our production schedule.
Public Release (Software/Film) (August 2018)
The public release of a first version of the software along side the release of our first
major film.
All of the items are subject to change and may be extended at any time.

6. LEGAL IMPLICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS
Regulatory Uncertainty
Shivers Media, LLC has consulted with legal advisers about the potential implications of
Shivers Tokens being considers as Securities and have taken extra steps to distance
our product from being considered a security. No part of our White Paper or any
company-created material should confuse the product that we are offering as a security
as we are not offering equity ownership, a right to profit, no payment (direct or indirect),
or facilitating a “reasonable expectation of profits” from Shivers Media, LLC.
No part of this document describes the speculative nature of cryptocurrency or
reinforces a speculative approach to Shivers Tokens. Buyers of this token are expected
to purchase the Token for the purpose of use on the platform which we are developing
and receive future products which we create, such as horror films.
While we have designed our product to comply with the SEC rules via the Howey Test,
there is no guarantee the SEC or any unforeseen entity or regulatory body will change
regulations regarding cryptocurrency.
We are also working with a tax attorney to ensure our tax liability is satisfied and meets
existing laws.
Please consult with a tax attorney regarding the implications related to purchases of
cryptocurrency and the trading thereof.

Cryptocurrency Laws
Amongst world economies and governments, cryptocurrency has been a topic of
continual debate. Many governments feel that allowing cryptocurrency for legal
transactions and use would ultimately result in loss of economic power and a shift
towards decentralized economies globally.
Even though many countries across the world permit cryptocurrencies, they have been
under scrutiny and seen with skeptical eyes in many others. Certain countries have
gone to the extent of banning the currency, making its use, possession, and trade
illegal.
According to The Columbia Science and Technology Law Review, the regulatory
responses to emerging technologies, and to blockchain in particular, range from
excitement to suspicion to indifference.
The law review states that the U.S. federal government has not exercised its
constitutional preemptive power to regulate blockchain to the exclusion of states (as it
generally does with financial regulation) or even expressed intention to do so,
regardless of the interest of federal agencies. And so the states remain free to introduce
their own rules and regulations. As an example, although New York did not enact statewide legislation recognizing blockchain for record-keeping purposes, in June 2015 it
became the first state in the U.S. to regulate virtual currency companies through state
agency rulemaking.
In 2017, at least eight U.S. States have worked on bills accepting or promoting the use
of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, while a couple of them have already passed them
into law.
