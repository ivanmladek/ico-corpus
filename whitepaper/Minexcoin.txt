Abstract
MinexCoin is a global payment system built on the eponymous low-volatility crypto-asset
regulated by an autonomous algorithm with methods proven in traditional financial markets.
MinexCoin asset is a low-volatility cryptocurrency with predictable and dirigible price
development. It may be employed both as a means of settlement and a means of saving. The
long-term value of the coin is based on its annual growth of 33.6%. In order to reduce its volatility,
such supply/demand regulation tools as market interventions and coin parking are used.

Addressed Issues
Cryptocurrency is a decentralized blockchain-based financial system, immutability, and autonomy
being its most celebrated features. Cryptocurrencies enable one to bypass intermediaries and
remain independent from traditional financial institutions. However, neither cryptocurrency,
including Bitcoin, managed to become a commonly used monetary asset. Merchants and service
providers are reluctant to accept cryptocurrency payments as it involves additional risks of
exchange losses and regulatory issues.
An instrument capable of becoming a perfect global payments system is commonly used as a
speculative asset. This project is devised as a solution for the fundamental problem in question
and takes into account the problems and challenges faced by the global financial system.

The Three Whales
We distinguish three kinds of crypto-market actors.
The first is traders or people making short and medium-term investments in cryptocurrency in
order to quickly make the profit from exchange margin.
The second is investors. Investors are interested in cryptocurrencies as a means of long-term
storage and growth of their capital.
The third is users or those using cryptocurrencies for routine economic activities like remittances,
purchases, etc.
We believe that users are quite an important group as they make the cryptocurrency sufficiently
liquid. However, existing cryptocurrencies hardly meet their demands. As a result, the lack of
merchants and service providers causes the numbers of medium and long-term investors to
grow slowly because of minor involvement of cryptocurrencies in the real economy. The lack of
long-term investors not interested in exchange gambling, in turn, enables traders to manipulate
currency’s exchange rates thus aggravating its volatility. This vicious circle prevents any cryptoasset from becoming an established means of payment.

Volatility is a Problem
High volatility is amongst the biggest disadvantages of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies.
It hinders it from becoming a means of storage and exchange of value on the global market.
Seasoned traders may get high profits from speculating on exchange margins, yet the risks
pertaining to uncontrollable price fluctuations scare rookie users and online businesses away
from cryptocurrencies.

Stability as an Answer
Stable cryptocurrencies are the solution enabling merchants to enjoy all the advantages of
blockchain technology while keeping away from losses caused by major price fluctuations.
A stable cryptocurrency is a coin whose price is kept within a certain range with a set of financial
mechanisms and algorithms. Existing solutions employ various means to maintain stable prices
of their cryptocurrencies.
DigixDAO backs every DGX token with an equivalent amount of gold physically stored in a
Singapore vault. For that reason, the token’s price correlates with the price of gold.
ChronoBank creates its own labor market where each LH token is pegged to the average worth
of a work-hour.
Tether tokens are backed with U.S. Dollars kept on a private company’s bank account.
MakerDAO maintains a stable price of its DAI tokens with a complex red-tape system hardly
comprehensible for those lacking profound cryptocurrency savviness.
In our opinion, the existing projects all feature several fundamental flaws. They’re either pegged
to an unstable asset, and therefore can’t be considered currencies with stable and predictable
purchasing power; or backed by an immovable asset, and therefore are of no interest for traders
and investors; or, while promising some predictable profit to their investors, lack transparency; or
make it too hard for an average user to assess their price growth.
MinexCoin offers an innovative solution which creates an autonomous financial system that
meets the demands of all three kinds of market actors.

MinexCoin: a Unique Innovative Solution
There are two factors that make MinexCoin unique:
— Low volatility of the coin (within a five-percent range) achieved autonomously with
traditional financial tools;
— Predictable and controllable annual growth of the coin’s price which correlates with 		
average annual price growth calculated for a portfolio of most popular altcoins (around
33.6 percent).
Thanks to its unique features, MinexCoin is a multi-purpose tool equally useful for trading, longterm investment, and routine financial operations.
Traders, whose speculations often tend to destroy cryptocurrency ecosystems, have a
constructive role in the MinexCoin’s system. Encouragement of trading activity will become a tool
that the coin’s autonomous algorithm uses to keep the token’s price within a certain range.
Controllable price surge over time will make the coin a profitable asset for investors. Coin
parking, which is the second volatility control tool in MinexCoin, meets the strategy of medium
and long-term investment.
Finally, thanks to price predictability, easy conversion and high-speed transactions, regular users
and online retailers will be able to use MinexCoin as means of payment and value storage.
MinexCoin excludes both exchange losses and service payments.

MinexBank: Smart Algorithms
MinexCoin tackles the issue of high volatility by automatically regulating demand and supply at
exchanges. To do that, it uses certain algorithms that encourage coin holders to buy, sell or keep
their assets depending on the balance of supply and demand at the given time. Those algorithms
resemble activity of central banks that maintain the cost of their national currency, so they are
collectively known as MinexBank.
For the functioning of an algorithm of modifying interest rates on “parking” operations, in real-time
the following steps are to be completed:
1. To determine an average weighted cross-rate of MNX/$ to a basket of 10 currencies, 		
which are in the top as for the capitalization level, in real-time.
2. To correlate an average weighted cross-rate of MNX to the capitalization level and a 		
share in total capitalization of each of 10 specified currencies.
The formula for determining an average weighted cross-rate of MNX to the basket of currencies
is as follows:

Where y is an average weighted cross-rate of MNX/$.

5

Under revision and editing.

A simplified version of the formula is as follows:

Where y is the weighted average cross-rate of MNX / $,
M is a current exchange rate of BTC / MNX
C1, C2 … C10 are current exchange rates of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to BTC.
X1, X2… X10 are current exchange rates of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to USD
Q1, Q2... Q10 is a current market capitalization of each of the top 10 cryptocurrencies in USD
Q is a total market capitalization of the top 10 cryptocurrencies in USD
In such a way we get unbiased cross-rate of MNX to USD. The change of this rate is influenced
not only by the price of Bitcoin, but also by prices of all other highly liquid cryptocurrencies.
In addition, in real time an average weighted rate of MNX is correlated to the change of
capitalization of each currency separately, and the total capitalization of these cryptocurrencies.

6

Under revision and editing.

In fact, we are locking the MNX rate to a basket of cryptocurrencies; that is more unibased
marker of MNX price, compared to locking using cross-rate of Bitcoin only.
3. To set index of the estimated value of MNX at the time, on the basis of the increase
of МNX estimated value by 47,2% per year. Since it is necessary to calculate the 		
estimated cost of MNX with a frequency of 1 second, the calculation of the change in
price per second is calculated by formula as follows:

Where Z is the current estimated cost of MNX to the US dollar.
Z0 is MNX’ exchange rate to the US dollar based on the results of the second round of ICO
m - is the number of seconds in a year m = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 31,536,000
n - is the number of seconds elapsed since the start of trading until the current moment.
4. To enable the algorithm to compare two indexes and change “parking” operations 		
discount rates in case of deviation of current price from the calculated one.
5. Changes of “parking” operations rate will be carried out taking into account such 		
market figures as quantity demanded, quantity supplied and price velocity, rather
than using the positive correlation principle.
MinexBank is a closed source app, though some of its features are accessible to users via the
official website. At MinexBank users may browse existing interest rates for parking payments and
file up a request to receive interest for coin parking operations. In order to protect the assets, the
bank’s reserve is stored in cold wallets.

Hybrid Governance
At present stage, MinexBank uses hybrid governance, which implies that the algorithm’s
decisions are monitored by a group of professional economists. At early phases of the system’s
operation, the team reserves the right to introduce amendments to the algorithm’s parameters in
order to promptly prevent emerging risks and guarantee steady work of the entire system.
Once the algorithm is fine-tuned, MinexBank will become a decentralized autonomous
organization. At final phases, the platform’s financial activity will be completely free of human
involvement, and use algorithms set earlier.

Main Exchange
While assessing market conditions, MinexBank will invoke asset price at the main exchange,
which is the exchange where MinexBank stores, buys and sells its assets. The selected
exchange will have to be the most secure of all currently in existence. Prices for assets traded
elsewhere will correlate with those at the main one thanks to trader arbitration.

How It Actually Works
The main purpose of MinexBank is to stabilize the exchange rate within the range of no more
than 5% of the previous day’s closure price. The five percent growth owes to the practice of
global stock exchanges. Once the values are reached, stock markets halt the trading, thus
preventing speculators and misguided investors from dictating their own prices.
Once the limit values of the five per cent range are reached, MinexBank has two options: it
either changes interest rates for parking payouts or intervenes to keep the price within the preset
range. Coin parking and intervention are the basic financial instruments used by MinexBank.

Parking
Parking means that coins are voluntarily withdrawn from the market by a user who temporarily
suspends them in their wallet. The ‘parking’ user is eligible to receive interest. Users will be able
to choose the type of parking depending on the time they undertake to store coins in their wallets
without using them online. There are three kinds of parking:
Day (24 hours): for short-term impact
Month (30 days): for medium-term impact
Annual (365 days): for long-term impact.
Average reference rate for parking payouts will gradually go down, yet, thanks to MinexCoin
price’s growth, the actual parking revenue will only grow over time.

Under revision and editing.

Average basic rates for parking payouts:*
2017: 70%
2018: 45-55%
2019: 25-40%
*The values are determined by default and may be altered by MinexBank algorithms, either way,
depending on market conditions. If a user withdraws all money from their wallet, MinexBank
does not award interest regardless of how much time there is until parking ends. If, after parking
their coins, the user withdraws a part of their money, the system awards interest for the parking
contract concluded first in case its amount does not exceed current balance of the user’s wallet.

Interventions
Intervention means that MinexBank buys or sells MinexCoin to keep the exchange rate within the
predetermined range.
Initially, MinexBank has an MNX reserve with an option of continuously filling it up so that the
system could work on a long-term basis and suppress possible speculative attacks.
The initial reserve is formed by premining 1,500,000 coins. Once there are more MinexCoins
on the market due to additional issuance (miner work rewards), the reserve will have to be
replenished and eventually expanded. The growth will be ensured by the progressive percentage
of payments to MinexBank for each block solved by miners.

10

Blocks 1 - 900 001

= 20%

Blocks 900 001 - 1 800 000

= 30%

Blocks 1 800 001 - 2 700 000

= 40%

Blocks 2 700 001 - 3 600 000

= 50%

Blocks 3 600 001 - 4 500 000

= 60%

Since block 4 500 001

= 70%

The bank takes the commission both from the awards of the miner and from his commission for
transactions. After completion of the issuance of coins, the commission will be 70% only from the
transaction commission.

Incentivizing Miners
Miner reward for each formed block comprises 2.5 MinexCoin. Miners will make progressive
payments to MinexBank until block 5,400,000 is reached. Considering the coin will be
worth more over time, fiat equivalent of miner reward, notwithstanding the continuously growing
payments to the bank, will grow. This will result in the increase of the system’s overall capacity,
and therefore, its complexity.

Market Behavior
In practice, the MinexBank algorithm uses a simple and efficient pattern. As there are three
possible options for market behavior (excessive demand, excessive supply or supply/demand
equilibrium), there are three strategies for MinexBank behavior as well.

12

Under revision and editing.

Excessive demand

In case of excessive demand, the interest rate for parking payments will decrease. This will
cause asset holders to enter the market, which in turn will cause the price to go down. In case
this method fails to work effectively enough, MinexBank starts selling the assets itself in order to
subdue pressure from buyers.

13

Under revision and editing.

Excessive supply

In case of excess supply, the interest rate for parking payments grows, thus withdrawing the
excessive amount from the market. In case this method fails, MinexBank buys the assets to
subdue pressure from sellers.

14

Under revision and editing.

Supply/demand equilibrium

In this case, MinexBank does nothing as the price remains within the predetermined range.

Crowdsale Summary
MinexCoin (MNX) is based on Bitcoin’s source code. We chose bitcoin’s code base due to its
proven reliability. In order to accelerate transactions, block formation time is reduced from 10 to 3
minutes.
Most stable cryptocurrencies use two kinds of assets in overall turnover: traded token shares
and a stable coin. During initial coin offerings, investors are commonly offered to buy shares, not
stable coins.

16

Under revision and editing.

MinexCoin will use a single coin employed both as a means of payment and as a share. This
approach further protects MinexCoin system from speculator interference. Another important
advantage for investors is that they receive a reliably stable asset over the ICO, not yet another
highly volatile token.
MinexCoin’s ICO campaign incorporates two phases:
Phase one (Subscription) is set to determine applicability, importance and value of the very
concept of creating a low volatile and steadily growing asset, and inviting prospective users to
discuss the matter.
Cost of coins/Bonuses for early participants of Phase One (Subscription):

17

The purpose of Phase Two (Pre-sale) is to determine the market price of the coin immediately
before entering the exchange. The same price is the basic value in MinexBank’s policy, and is
calculated as follows:
Y = ( X + Х1 ) / Z
where Y stands for market exchange rate (basic value in the bank’s algorithm); X for volume of
involved investor funds; X1 for absolute volume of bonuses accrued by early participants; Z for
the amount of coins available for the ICO. Phase Two (pre-sale) terms: May 15th, 2017 to June
13th, 2017.
Bonuses for early participants of Phase Two (Pre-sale):

All money raised over the first two phases of the ICO will be spent on development and
marketing of the product. The coins are subject to distribution among investors the day after the
ICO’s completion.

The Future of Minex
MinexBank’s monetary policy serves the main purpose of making MinexCoin a global reserve
cryptocurrency. In order to attain it, MinexCoin will have to meet the following principles:
-

Simplicity and high speed of transactions

-

Exchange rate stability and predictability against U.S. Dollar

-

Market cap of $1 trillion

MinexBank will consistently administer the policy of increasing MNX price against USD on the
basis of the growth rate of 33.6% annually. Once MinexCoin issuance is over at block
5,400,000, its price will reach $52,600, and market cap $1 trillion.
This market cap will allow for using MNX as a global payment unit as the volume of available
dollars will have comprised 4.5 to 5 trillion at the time in question, should the existing trend
persists.

Minex Ecosystem
The Minex Systems team intends to implement the extended functionality of Minex Ecosystem
by incorporating such applications as Minex Market, Minex Exchange, and Minex Platform.
Implementation of those products seeks to expand the coin’s sphere of circulation, thus driving
demand for it.
