Rotharium ICO Whitepaper

Initial Token Offering
of up to 67.9 million Ethereum-based 'Rotharium' tokens
Crypto Future GmbH, a limited liability company pursuant to Austrian laws, registered with the
Commercial Court of Vienna under registration number FN 478323 t, having its registered seat in
DC Tower Vienna, Donau-City-Stra√üe 7, DC Tower, 30th Floor, 1220 Vienna, Austria (the
"Developer") intends to offer for exchange up to 67.9 million units of a new Ethereum-based
token named 'Rotharium' (the "RTH(s)") during a limited offer period (the "Offer Period")
beginning on 16 November 2017 20:00 CET and ending on 14 January 2017 13:30 CET (the
"Initial Token Offering" or "ITO"). The period starting on 16 November 2017 20:00 CET and
ending on 12 December 2017 24:00 CET is referred to as the "Pre-Sale Period". RTHs are not
securities and do not carry with them any rights as may be commonly associated with securities.
RTHs are ERC20 tokens based on the Ethereum platform serving as vouchers to be redeemed with
the Developer for the use of the Rotharium Platform as described in the Token Offer Document.
This whitepaper ("Whitepaper") gives an overview of certain aspects of the RHTs and their
intended use. This Whitepaper and the information stated herein is not legally binding. The Initial
Token Offering is only made on the basis of a separate document, the Token Offer Document which
will be published alongside this Whitepaper. This Whitepaper does not constitute an offer of RHTs
nor an invitation for an offer to exchange any amount of Ether for RHTs.
The Developer intends to have RHTs listed on a number of virtual currency exchanges. Due to the
properties and mechanics of the RHTs as described herein, the Developer also aims to have the
market value of RHTs increase over time. However, there is no guarantee that an increase in the
market value can be achieved by the Developer.
If you decide to participate in the Initial Token Offering as a form of investment, the
Developer expressly warns you that an investment in RHTs carries a high degree of risk.
For a description of the risks associated, see the chapter "RISK FACTORS" in the Token
Offer Document.

Executive Summary

Abstract
Blockchain is a relatively new technology, but we truly believe that it is the future internet
technology. Designed to be a decentralized system, blockchain provides an optimal basis for
developing extraordinary, spectacular and user-friendly applications.
Our solution will connect blockchain with existing IT solutions to create maximum benefits. To
achieve this, we will develop a decentralized business-to-consumer (B2C) platform which will
contain blockchain and additionally developed services for different types of businesses. We will
call it Rotharium platform.
Our platform will be the first B2C blockchain system which allows direct interaction between
consumers and business providers (without middleman) using blockchain-based interaction
between applications, business services and common databases.
By design, our platform will also be the first blockchain system which allows the integration of
legacy applications and databases. It will help customers implement our solution as an
interface between previously implemented solutions and save customers from investing the
same amount of money again.
In additional to the decentralized B2C blockchain platform, we will also develop our own
business applications. Due to the fact that our platform will support all B2C models, the
integration of new business applications will be extremely easy. To help understand how our
platform will help simplify business processes using blockchain, we have provided detailed
information for two business applications: Booking App and Sportsbook App.

The Developer
Crypto Future GmbH (The Developer) is the company leading the Rotharium project. The
founders of The Developer have been in the blockchain business since 2013 and have
considerable experience in this area. Within the context of the Rotharium project, we are
leveraging our experience to improve existing or create new B2C solutions which can be used
by anyone in the world.

Initial Coin Offering
Due to the fact that we are creating new solutions for the community, we aim to provide the
possibility for the community to be a part of our project. We will develop a new crypto currency
on the Ethereum network and create the possibility to acquire our crypto currency for a defined
amount of Ether (the crypto currency of Ethereum).
In this whitepaper, you will find a detailed description of the so-called Initial Coin Offering
(ICO) process, which explains how to participate and be a part of the Rotharium project.

Blockchain Background

The development of Bitcoin Core and the launch of Bitcoin as a digital payment system in
November 2008 are regarded as the beginnings of the blockchain technology.1
What blockchain generally does is to store data in one decentralized database and prevent
manipulation of the data. Data is stored in data blocks, which always contain information about
the previous block. In order to have an exact connection between the blocks, the system
creates the hash value of the previous block and saves this information in the following block.
In the event of data manipulation in one block, the hash value of the next block will
automatically change and, therefore, the entire chain will change.
Although it may seem that blockchain is a completely new technology, the blockchain principle
has already been in use for many years. Good examples are enterprise resource planning
systems, which store the entire accounting data of a company. The final balance is based on
many transactions performed during the business year and, if somebody were to change only
one of the postings, the final sum would also change.
The big difference between such systems and blockchain is the access to the data. While the
accounting data of a company is stored in one central database and only permitted users can
access the data, the data in the blockchain is stored in the form of a decentralized database
and everybody can see and check the data integrity.

2.1 Ethereum Blockchain
Ethereum blockchain was described by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 and implemented in July
2015. By introducing the Ethereum blockchain, a new crypto currency called Ether was also
introduced.2
Ethereum blockchain is a distributed system and all participants in the Ethereum blockchain use
a peer-to-peer network to transfer the data. In order to be able to do so, the clients have a full
copy of the blockchain.
While Bitcoin was designed to be used as a worldwide digital payment system, Ethereum was
developed as a platform for distributed Apps. Distributed apps are built on so-called smart
contracts. By using smart contracts, developers can create new applications such as virtual
organizations, sports betting platforms, booking exchanges, document management systems,
etc.
Using smart contracts to create new apps on the Ethereum blockchain opens up new
possibilities for developers to create extraordinary and spectacular applications.

Platform Model

3.

The Rotharium platform will have two primary layers: Blockchain and Services. In order to have
a full operating system, two additional layers are connected to the platform: Database and
Application.

Application

Services

Cloud

Figure 1: Platform Model

The main reason separating the Application and Database sections from the Rotharium
platform is to be able to create a more flexible and reusable solution framework which can
cooperate with different apps and databases. The Rotharium platform is intended to provide
easy integration and maximize the subsequent use of legacy applications by connecting these
applications to the Blockchain.
IMPORTANT NOTICE: Rotharium platform will be a collection of development tools and

program libraries needed to implement foreign applications or databases provided as an
GPL-licensed SDK.

3.1

Applications

In additional to the Rotharium platform, we will develop our own apps to provide all the
requirements for a single business solution. So far, we have defined the functional design
6

specifications for following apps: Smart Wallet App, Sportsbook App, Booking App, and Storage
App. We are currently working on the Booking App.
IMPORTANT NOTICE: The applications connected to the Rotharium platform will

enable normal users to create smart contracts on the blockchain!
No sophisticated IT knowledge will be required.

One additional reason for placing the application section on top of the Rotharium platform is
because we plan to create a solution delivery platform which is useable also with existing
customer applications. This means that if a company already has an app for its specific
business, our platform will provide integration interfaces to allow the integration of the app.

3.2

Services

The main purpose of platform services is to support interconnection between apps, the
blockchain and databases. In some cases, the entire business logic can be so simple that no
additional services are needed and the apps work directly on the blockchain.
If business requirements are complex and require considerable computing resources, the
business logic will be created in the Services section, so that applications can run faster and the
user app experience is not affected by the business logic.
So far, we have completed the functional design specifications for the following services:
Encrypted Protocol and Data Management Service.

3.3

Blockchain

All the advantages of the blockchain (decentralization, smart contracts, data integrity, etc.) will
be considered so that we can reduce additional development work in the Service section.
Depending on the functional specification and the business requirements, the decision as to
which part of the solution is created on the blockchain will be made on a case-by-case basis.

3.4

Database

To create a boundless platform which is capable of being used for various business
requirements, there should not be a restriction on how to save critical data. Our platform will
support common cloud-based and on-premise database solutions. If an application can work
without storing the data, the solution can also be implemented without a database.

4.

Rotharium Applications and Services

In this section, we will provide a detailed description of the Booking App. Other applications like
Sportsbook App and Storage App are working in a similar way, so that these Apps can be build
up on the same Rotharium platform and some platform services can be used for those
applications too.

4.1

Booking App

4.1.1.

Requirement / Problem

Consumer:

Good platforms for hotel bookings provide an incredibly high number of hotels
and rooms. However, if you have a specific wish: a hotel with pool and gym, in
the city center, and not so far from the next underground station, you have to
set up search filters and check the availability and rate. In some cases, you will
find suitable rooms, available at the time you would like to travel, but the rate is
too high. Unhappy with the rate, you start to change the search filters: remove
the pool and check again; remove the gym and check again, etc. If the search is
not immediately successful, you will probably try on the next day, the day after
and so on.

Business:

All hotels set their room rates according to their pricing strategy. They can
reduce the rates if too many rooms are not booked, but they can also increase
the rate in case of high demand. Companies can collect and analyze user data in
order to be able to create appropriate offers, but they can‚Äôt exactly say how
much consumers are willing to pay. In some cases, hotels react too late and
rooms remain unused.

4.1.2.

Solution

By means of our Booking Application, we will reduce the time necessary to find an appropriate
hotel room. The user will be able to set up the search filter within seconds, define the rate they
are willing to pay and send the information to the blockchain. As soon as a suitable room is
available, the smart contract will execute the room reservation and send a confirmation to the
consumer. This could happen just a few seconds after the reservation request, but it can also
happen hours later ‚Äì the user doesn‚Äôt have to be online all the time.
The advantage for the hotels (business) will be that they are able to see all reservation
requests with the exact rate the customer is willing to pay (please read Section 4.1.3. Booking
Exchange). In the event that only a few rooms are booked, hotels can reduce the rate to
match the requirements of customers. If there is a match, the Rotharium platform will confirm
the reservation request and the customer (consumer) will receive a written confirmation.
Detailed descriptions of both processes can be found on the next page:

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
Booking App can be used for any type of reservation: table reservations in
restaurants, car reservations at rent-a-car providers, flight reservations, etc.
Interfaces provided by the Rotharium SDK will allow easy integration of foreign
booking applications (or just reservation forms) into our booking system.

As we have learned in the blockchain section, information stored on the blockchain is
decentralized and unchangeable. However, if the smart contract (reservation request/offer) is
defined and saved on the blockchain, what happens if the consumer or business would like to
change/cancel the reservation request or offer?
Solution: Some parameters can be changed if this is permitted by the original code! One
method could be to assign the logic code to the library and use the CALLCODE function to call
the code located at a specified updatable address. By means of this method, two versions of
the data exist.
‚ÄúStarting with the Ethereum Homestead release, there is now a DELEGATECALL opcode. This
allows you to essentially forward calls to a separate contract while maintaining msg.sender and
all storage. For example, you could have a contract that maintains the same address and
storage, but forward all calls to an address stored in a variable‚Äù.3

Figure 3: Smart Contract.sol

See below for an extract from the Ethereum Homestead Release:
‚ÄúEIP 7: DELEGATECALL: Add a new opcode, DELEGATECALL at 0xf4, which is similar in
idea to CALLCODE, except that it propagates the sender and value from the parent scope to
the child scope, i.e. the call created has the same sender and value as the original call. This
means contracts can store pass through information while following msg.sender and
msg.value from its parent contract. Great for contracts which create contracts but don‚Äôt
repeat additional information which saves gas.‚Äù4

4.1.3.

Booking Exchange

To provide an overall solution, we will also develop a completely new booking exchange, which
will become a part of the Booking App solution (e.g.: This exchange could be placed on
www.b2c-exchange.com and have different blockchain booking areas ‚Äì for hotel bookings, car
rentals, table reservations, storage bookings, etc. = every type of reservation in one place).
On the one hand, this new exchange will show all business offers (hotel rooms, restaurant
tables, rental cars, etc.). On the other, consumers will see all reservation requests. Our booking
exchange will work in a similar way to an exchange for crypto coins, but with one key
difference: exchanged goods are not coins, but booking assets (rooms, cars, tables, etc.). The
visibility of the offers and requests mentioned above will help businesses to change their offers
on time if there is a risk of having unreserved assets. Also, consumers will have a better
overview of business offers and can place new orders if they have changed their opinion (e.g.
are willing to pay higher rate/price).
Our Booking App will be automatically connected to our Booking Exchange and all offers and
requests will be visible there. For exchange maintenance and support reasons, we will charge
successfully executed bookings with a maximum 5% of the booking amount and 1% if the
payment is transacted in our crypto currency. (Other booking platforms charge between 15%
and 35%).

4.1.4.

Business Model for Booking App and Booking Exchange

The travel and tourism industry is one of the world‚Äôs largest industries, with a global economic
contribution (direct, indirect and induced) of over 7.6 trillion U.S. dollars in 2016. The direct
economic impact of the industry, including accommodation, transportation, entertainment and
attractions, was approximately 2.3 trillion U.S. dollars that year. A number of countries, such as
France and the United States, are consistently popular tourism destinations, but other, less
well-known countries are quickly emerging in order to reap the economic benefits of the
industry. 5
To present a more concrete example of how the Booking App and related Booking Exchange
will generate income, we will take the Priceline Group (products: booking.com, priceline.com,
agoda.com, rentalcars.com, etc.) with revenues of 10.743 billion USD and net income of 2.134
billion USD in 2016 as a basis. 6 If we consider just 0.1% of Priceline Group‚Äôs revenue as the
goal for our booking exchange, we are talking about 10.743 million USD.
Since all the major booking providers charge between 15% and 35% commission per booking,
depending on the location, number of rooms, room rate, and competition in the area, we will
provide a booking exchange with lower commission fees (5%). For all business users which use
our crypto currency for fee payments, we will charge just 1%.
On the one hand, this approach of course reduces the revenue, but it creates an incentive to
use our booking exchange. Business customers can save up to 34% (if the maximum fee is
35%) and provide booking assets with lower rates/prices for the end customer. On the other, it
will create additional demand for the Rotharium coin. Instead of paying in bitcoin or Ether,
users (businesses) can just do the conversion to the Rotharium coin, pay the exchange fee and
5

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Priceline_Group

11

save an additional 4%. rotharium coin demand would also support the increase of the
Rotharium coin price in the future.

4.2

Smart Wallet App

Our vision is that, in the future, everybody will have a smart wallet and will use it online when
shopping and paying for all online services. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether they are buying books,
making hotel reservations, booking flights, paying for storage space or sportsbook betting, our
smart wallet will enable every user to completely replace a hard wallet. In combination with the
rotharium platform, the relevant amount will be automatically credited/debited to your smart
wallet.
If our smart wallet is used in connection with the Rotharium platform, we will use encrypted
protocols to ensure secure communication between the application, services and database.

4.3

Sportsbook App

The main difference between existing betting applications and our Sportsbook Application will
be the decentralization. On a decentralized platform like Blockchain, odds can be
communicated without a middleman.

Consumer:

Instead of using credit cards, bank account consumers will use the smart
wallet to place bets on the betting platform.

Business:

The betting provider will have a direct relationship with the consumers
(via the blockchain and their smart wallet), so that the risk of losing
customers‚Äô money or data will be dramatically reduced.

Figure 4: Sportsbook process

12

Current process: On the left-hand side of Figure 4., you can see the current process for
sportsbooks. By using a credit card, consumers can transfer an amount of money from their
bank account to the account on the sportsbook portal. With this starting balance, consumers
can place bets and wait for the result. If there is a win, the consumer‚Äôs account on the
sportsbook portal will be credited with the relevant amount.
Blockchain solution process: On the right-hand side of Figure 4., you can see the
blockchain solution process for sportsbooks. Due to the fact that the consumer already uses a
smart wallet (e.g.: to buy books on the internet, for reserving hotels and flights, etc.), the
consumer can use the same smart wallet for placing bets on the sportsbook platform. In doing
so, the consumer creates smart contracts and forwards these smart contracts to the blockchain
platform. When the bets are concluded, smarts contracts are executed and the amount of
money from winning smart contracts is credited to the consumer‚Äôs smart wallet (wager + win)
and the money from losing smart contracts is credited to the smart wallet of the sportsbook
provider.
The advantage for the consumer is that, after bets finish, the money is always sent back to
smart wallet and is therefore available for other payments, not only for sportsbooks. The
provider has the advantage of not being responsible for the money which is not used for bets.
(Under existing solutions, the provider is responsible for the money until it is transferred back
to the bank account).

Annex:
As you can imagine, considerably more services and interfaces are needed to provide the full
blockchain sportsbook solution (Figure 4. shows just an extract of the full sportsbook
processes). Our Rotharium platform will provide the basis for such services and interfaces.
Our platform will allow the adding of functions, services and interfaces to meet the
requirements of further applications. However, it is very important to mention that the
completion of one application (e.g. Booking App) and related services and interfaces for this
app, will not mean that the services for other applications are necessarily also completed. As
each app has its own specific requirements, further services and interfaces might be necessary
in order to be able to create other applications (e.g. Sportsbook App).

4.4

Storage App

When you have some property that you don‚Äôt use every day and you don‚Äôt have enough space
in your home or flat, you may store them in a storage space provided by space providers.

Consumer:

To avoid some unnecessary steps, our application will provide the option
to reserve suitable storage space online and to perform the related
payment using the smart wallet.

Business:

With additional hardware devices (mounted directly on the door), access
to the storage area can be controlled via the smartphone application (QR
code), so that consumers can use the storage space immediately after
13

online reservation. No staff will be needed to hand over the key ‚Äì the
key will be on the consumers device.
The advantage of using blockchain smart contracts is that smart contracts are designed to
automatically initiate transactions when conditions are fulfilled. No manual intervention is
needed.
In our use case, as long as the contract is not canceled by the consumer or business party, the
smart contract will initiate daily/weekly/monthly payments (money transfers from the
consumer‚Äôs smart wallet to the smart wallet of the business partner) and access to the storage
space will be granted. If the payment is not possible, the smart contract will lock the space and
the consumer will not be able to access their storage area.
Also in such cases there will be no need to involve the staff of the business party. The only
thing the consumer should do is to transfer some money to their smart wallet and initiate the
payment. This action will automatically unlock the door and the consumer can remove items
and cancel the contract or keep using the storage space. The only reason for the business
party to do some manual work is when the consumer is unable to pay and, after a defined
period, clear and clean the space.

4.5

Encrypted Protocol Service

To achieve maximum security for users of the Rotharium platform, we will develop our own
encrypted transfer protocol.

4.6

Data Management Service

In some business processes, basic data (e.g. customers, items, assets, etc.) must be saved
permanently. In cases where data should not be visible to everyone (e.g. customer data of the
Sportsbook Application), data will be stored in common database solutions provided by the
business party. This database can be a cloud-based or on-premise solution. In order to be able
to use common database solutions, the Rotharium platform will provide the necessary data
management services and interfaces.

Rotharium Token

5.1. Name, Symbol and Logo
The token described in the following section of this document is known as a Rotharium, or
RTH.
Rotharium is an Ethereum-based token based on smart contracts which apply the ERC20 Token
Standard.

Figure 5: Token Logo

5.2. Purpose
Rotharium token will be created on the Ethereum blockchain by November 11th, 2017 at the
latest.
The purpose of the token is to be a digital exchange asset for the token presales phase starting
on November 16th, 2017 and the initial coin offering (ICO) starting on December 13th, 2017.
Furthermore, the Rotharium token will be used as a digital crypto currency. Rotharium tokens
will also be the main payment token for applications developed for the Rotharium platform
(e.g. payments on www.b2c-exchange.com).

5.3. Supply
Rotharium token will be sold during the token presales phase and the token ICO. The total
supply of RTH is limited to 100,000,000 tokens.

15

6.

ICO

Rotharium ICO will be launched on December 13th, 2017. Please check the Rotharium website
www.rotharium.io for the latest information. For early bird investors, we will start the token
pre-sales phase on November 16th, 2017.

6.1. Token Sale Overview
The total supply of RTH is limited to 100,000,000 tokens. These tokens will be allocated to the
founding team, advisors, early bird investors, integration partners and the community. Details
of how many tokens have been reserved for each group can be found in the following chart:

Figure 6: Token Allocation

Since crypto currencies are very volatile and the exchange rate EUR/ETH changes every
second, we can‚Äôt show how much (in EUR) investors have to spend to acquire a Rotharium
token. What we can do is to fix the exchange rate between Rotharium tokens and ETH, so all
participants receive the Rotharium tokens at the defined sales price.

2017. During this period, early bird investors can apply to receive Rotharium tokens. (The exact
application procedure will be described on the ICO website www.rotharium.io). For the early
bird investors, we have defined the price and the minimum amount of Ether for a successful
participation in the Rotharium token pre-sale auction:

Price: The price for the Rotharium token in the pre-sales phase is: 1 RTH = 0.003 ETH
E.g.: If an early bird investor spends 300 ETH, they will receive 100,000 RTH tokens.

0.003 ùê∏ùëáùêª

Minimum Amount:
To become an early bird investor, pre-sales participants must invest a minimum 100
Ether.
Due to the fact that ETH transactions are always associated with some fees, returning
amounts lower than 100 ETH would create additional costs and administration work on
our side. Therefore, during the pre-sales period, we will not return amounts which are
below 100 ETH. These amounts will be treated as a project donation.

6.3. Token ICO
The token ICO (Initial Coin Offering) phase will start on December 13th, 2017 and end on
January 14th, 2018. During this period, the community can apply to receive Rotharium tokens.
(The exact application procedure will be described on the ICO website www.rotharium.io). For
the community, we have also defined the price and the minimum amount of Ether for a
successful participation in the Rotharium token ICO:

Price: The price for the Rotharium token in the ICO is: 1 RTH = 0.005 ETH
E.g.: If a community member spends 1000 ETH, they will receive 200,000 RTH tokens.
ùëÖùëáùêª ùëáùëúùëòùëíùëõ ùëÑùë°ùë¶ =

0.005 ùê∏ùëáùêª

Minimum Amount:
Only Ether amounts of 1 Ether or higher will be accepted.
In order to ensure an advanced KYC process, additional administration work is
necessary: collecting additional customer information, direct contact by email or phone,
etc. In order to reduce administration work and costs on our side, we will treat all
amounts lower than 1 Ether as a project donation.

6.4. Founding Team
To demonstrate project responsibility, commitment and our determination to ensure the
success of the project, we will reserve 30% of the total token supply for the founders, which is
equivalent to 30,000,000 Rotharium tokens.
The Developer commits itself to sell or exchange Rotharium tokens after the ICO only to ensure
the funding of the project (to pay employees, for technical investments, software solutions,
etc.) and to use numbers of tokens which will not have a noticeable impact on the market
value of Rotharium tokens.

6.5. Advisors
We will reserve 0.01% of the total token supply for the advisors, which is equivalent to
100,000 Rotharium tokens. After the pre-sales phase and with the start of ICO, each advisor
will receive 10,000 Rotharium tokens.

6.6. Integration Partners
We have reserved 2,000,000 Rotharium tokens for our integration partners. Integration
partners are companies which can support us by delivering software development,
infrastructure support, hardware, etc. Instead of receiving money for the services provided,
these companies will receive Rotharium tokens in the amount representing the amount in
Ether.
The integration phase will start on October 1th, 2017 and end on December 31st, 2018. During
this period, IT companies can apply to become integration partners. For the integration
partners, we have also defined the price and the minimum amount of Ether:

Price: The price for the Rotharium tokens for integration partners is: 1 RTH = 0.004 ETH
E.g.: If an integration partner provides services for 1000 ETH, they will receive 250,000
RTH tokens.
ùëÖùëáùêª ùëáùëúùëòùëíùëõ ùëÑùë°ùë¶ =

0.004 ùê∏ùëáùêª

Minimum Amount:
Only services provided equivalent to Ether amounts of 10 Ether or higher will
be accepted.

If there are any unused tokens from the integration purpose, these tokens will be burned when
the integration period is over (After December 31st, 2018).

6.7. Remaining Quantity
In the event that some tokens reserved for the community are not subscribed (e.g. the
community requests the exchange of 50,000,000 tokens during the pre-sales and ICO phases
and 7,900,000 tokens remain on the smart contract), we will burn the remaining tokens. In
order to retain keep the defined percentage for founders, we will also burn tokens from the
founder‚Äôs allocation so that, at the end of the ICO, the founders will hold only 30% of all
Rotharium tokens.

6.8. KYC
To comply with the KYC process defined by Austrian legal requirements, if The Developer does
not receive the required information from the customer, The Developer will be allowed to
return Ether amounts to the original Ether Wallet addresses without any justification. More
details about the KYC process can be found in the Coin Offer Document.

6.9. Use of Proceeds
As we strongly believe in crypto currencies and expect the exchange rate EUR/ETH to
continuously increase in the coming months, we will sell only that amount of the Ether
received which we need in order to ensure healthy project development. We will use the
exchanged money in the following way:
50 % - Development ‚Äì rotharium platform
15 % - Solution acquirement (acquirement of solutions developed by third parties)
15 % - Marketing
10 % - Administration
10 % - Risk Management (unforeseen costs)

Figure 7: Use of Proceeds

For The Developer, there is no legal obligation to use the proceeds as described above!
