Establishing a Blockchain-Based Open Platform
for the Television Ecosystem
The Token for Television
TV-TWO Team
team@tv-two.com

April 20, 2018
Executive Summary
The current Television Ecosystem is broken. TV networks around the world are
abusing their market power as gatekeepers to increase prices for advertisers, lower
payouts to content creators and drive up subscription costs for consumers. They
actively hinder innovation in content delivery and advertising technology in order
to sustain their oligopolistic position and benefits. Many consumers are rightfully
frustrated with the state of broadcast television. They enjoy the lean-back nature of
a fixed program schedule, but would like to see more premium content personalized
to their viewing patterns and interests. At the same time, tech giants like Google,
Facebook, Amazon and Netflix are looking to build their walled garden around
the television ecosystem, eager to acquire more power through data and access to
consumers. TV-TWO o↵ers the community a solution in form of an Open Platform
for those who are curious about cutting the cord. This includes:
First, an application for Connected TVs that blends traditional television with
a personalized video stream o↵ering premium content at no subscription costs.
The video stream can always be opened with just one click of a button. Second,
the Token for Television (TTV), an ERC20 token that administers the exchanged
value between consumers, content providers and advertisers. We propose a new
ecosystem, where the trustless nature of the Ethereum blockchain makes it possible
for market participants to interact directly without having to rely on middlemen.
Consumers get to watch curated videos while receiving TTV for choosing to see
sponsored messages from advertisers. Content creators are rewarded by users with
TTV for their quality productions. The Token for Television will be o↵ered to the
community in a crowdsale. The TTV crowdsale is especially relevant for advertisers that are looking for sponsored reach on the Big Screen. The Network Utility
Expansion Mechanism is inherent to our model. Since no additional coins will be
issued after the Token Crowdsale and each token has the reserved right to show
ads to a fixed portion of the TV-TWO user base, each consumer that comes to the
platform boosts the utility of the token.

Overview

This paper will review the current state of broadcast television and propose TV-TWO,
a blockchain-based Open Platform that helps to decentralize the TV ecosystem in order
to spread the oligopolistic surplus of TV networks among Consumers, Content Creators,
and Advertisers.

1.1

Value Proposition

TV-TWO will bring the digital age to millions of living rooms around the world. We
o↵er the community:
1. An application for Connected TVs that blends broadcast television with a personalized and ad-supported video stream o↵ering premium content on the Big
Screen. While watching linear television through TV-TWO, the video stream can
be accessed anytime by pressing Enter on the remote control. The application establishes a new standard for TV advertising. Consumers are empowered to share
data with advertisers on their terms. Advertisers can utilize user data and usage
insights to reach consumers with more personalized and relevant messages that
result in higher user satisfaction and return on ad spend.
2. The Token for Television (TTV), a token that administers the exchanged value
between consumers, content providers and advertisers. Advertisers give tokens to
users for watching sponsored videos and sharing anonymous user data. Content
Providers get tokens and insights from users for o↵ering premium video content.
Consumers accumulate tokens that they can store in their wallet and o↵er on
exchanges.
We aim to establish a direct relationship between consumers, content providers and
advertisers (see Figure 1). The individual players are empowered to pursue direct interactions on the blockchain, decentralizing the ecosystem as well as disarming oligopolistic
TV networks, broadcast providers and tech giants, as they are actively hindering open
innovation. In section A.1, we validate our claim that TV networks are organized as
oligopolies. Based on learnings from the programmatic advertising space that is plagued
with fraud, limited viewability and brand safety issues, we will leapfrog TV ahead by
building transparency right into the core of the model.
1.1.1

Consumers

• Get to use a platform that blends linear TV with a personalized video stream
curated by a supervised learning algorithm, enabling more organic content variety
and relevance without having to pay a monthly subscription fee
• Experience the freedom to skip videos and ads as well as the chance to select ad
frequency

3

Figure 1: TTV Ecosystem
• Receive rewards for watching relevant sponsored messages as well as sharing
anonymous data with advertisers through the TTV
1.1.2

Content Providers

• Receive the chance to generate reach on television sets without having to sign a
contract with a TV network, giving small creators that focus on quality videos an
equal share of voice as determined by watch statistics instead of clicks
• Get full transparency on watch statistics for their videos without having to trust
a single centralized platform
• Can refinance their content more easily by profiting from high media spends that
go towards TV
1.1.3

Advertisers

• Receive targeting and attribution features as well as the automated media booking
on TV that they know from digital advertising
• Get per user reporting on ad engagement and organic video context without falling
victim to fraud or non-transparent KPI reporting
• Can address users on the basis of their first-party data without having to hand
over data to TV-TWO or a third-party

1.2

Interaction between Market Participants

Before the first implementation of the blockchain, an ideal TV ecosystem would have
consisted of four parties (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Current TV Ecosystem
Content providers and advertisers deliver organic and commercial content that is
curated by TV networks and transmitted to consumers by broadcast providers that
typically belong to the same parent company. However, TV networks are exploiting
their gatekeeper status:
• Advertisers: TV networks possess direct consumer access, which allows them to
set prices and generate high profits
• Content Providers: The direct consumer access, allows TV networks to discriminate against individual content providers. Networks produce most of the
content in-house, which further hurts independent creators
• Users: TV networks select the content that makes it on air. User have no choice
but to watch the delivered content. Neither organic nor sponsored clips are personalized
Given the status quo, TV networks act as middlemen between three parties that
should have direct relationships among each other for a fair and transparent exchange
of value. The trustless nature of the blockchain makes it possible for market participants
to disintermediate the oligopolistic TV broadcasting industry.

1.3

The Center of the Living Room

Overall, television consumption has remained steady in the recent years. While the
use of Netflix and other streaming services has exploded - with 50% of US households
subscribing to at least one streaming service - they usually act as add-ons to broadcast,
not substitutes.[1] Users are still addicted to broadcast television. The consultancy
Accenture explains that “most broadcasters have been at the heart of their national
cultural life for decades, and audiences have grown up with them in their lives.“[2]
Nielsen’s “Cross-Platform Report“ from 2014 illustrates how the time spent in front
of the television increases proportionally with the age of the user.[22] Taking the demographic shift in the western world into account, this will cement the importance of the
TV. Especially consumers with a high disposable income are glued to their television
sets. The baby boomer generation, meaning users born between 1946 and 1964, control
70% of the disposable income in the US.[23] For this generation, Netflix and YouTube
are no alternative. Baby boomers are used to enjoying the lean-back nature of broadcast
television, in which they do not actively have to choose the program. A personalized
and automatically curated video stream on the Big Screen is the way to go.
On mobile devices, Facebook has perfected the system of an infinite video stream.
Nowadays, more and more consumers are watching videos on their smartphones. However, a Yahoo survey finds two major disadvantages, which hinder a seamless video
experience on mobile: screen size and battery time were criticized by more than half
of the respondents (see Figure 3).[24] Especially, the screen size is an inevitable downside. We as TV-TWO are certain that the television will remain a centerpiece of our
living rooms for years to come. This is the place where people gather and look for
entertainment. Despite centralized markets, an undemocratic distribution of power,
non-transparent reporting and inefficient targeting methods, television can currently
sustain its position. If the extensive inefficiencies are tackled with the right set of new
technologies, television will retain its position as the central entertainment hub in the
living room and remain the most important marketing channel.

The Future of Television

TV-TWO is an application for Connected TVs that o↵ers regular consumers of broadcast television an easy way to transition into a world with a personalized video stream.
A major part of the solution is the fact that the traditional broadcast signal is watched
through the app. Firstly, allowing an overarching analysis of behavioral patterns across
all linear channels - including channel selection and dwell time. Secondly, enabling easy
access to the video stream. By pressing Enter on the remote control, a layer is inserted
over the TV content. For the user it is the same experience as changing the channel. The
video stream itself blends organic content with relevant ads. Based on in-stream behavior, preferences in linear TV, surveys and other data, a supervised learning algorithm
selects suitable videos from a broad selection of high quality content. The videos vary
6

Figure 3: Users’ Dislikes about Video on Smartphones
by language and the following categories: Movies, Music, News and Politics, Travel and
Nature, Food and Beverages, Fashion and Beauty, Sports, Cars, Technology, Gaming,
and Education.
In order to facilitate the new ecosystem, market participants are coming together
on the Ethereum blockchain to manage their interactions in a trustless manner. The
blockchain technology enables TV-TWO to circumvent the complexity and privacy issues of programmatic advertising. Instead, a decentralized platform with full transparency and security is o↵ered. Likewise, for both content providers and advertisers
the market is democratized with simplified access to the Big Screen. At the same time,
the user is rewarded with TTV for watching sponsored messages. If the user is looking
to earn even more TTV, he can opt-in to sharing anonymous data with advertisers and
content providers. This makes it possible to target based on a complete behavioral
profile. Booking inventory on television no longer requires a direct interaction between
media seller and media buyer. For all Samsung, LG, Toshiba, TP Vision and Panasonic TVs with TV-TWO, advertisers can simply use TTV and the TV-TWO campaign
platform to reach consumers.
Having carefully weighed the pros and cons, we are convinced that an application
for Connected TVs is the best option to launch TV-TWO. Nevertheless, the approach
involves dependency on the manufacturers. Therefore, to further decentralize the ecosystem, shipping open TV-TWO set-top boxes and televisions will be evaluated in Q3 2018
(see section 5).

2.1.1

The User Interface

TV-TWO is divided into two layers. The first layer, which is entered after starting the
application, consists of the broadcast signal with all standard TV functionalities. The
second layer, reached via pressing Enter on the remote control, displays the personalized
video stream.
For the first launch of the application, an onboarding is displayed to explain the
basic functionality. After that, starting the application directly leads the user to the first
layer - the current channel displayed in the TV window. While the viewing experience
is unchanged, Hbb banner ads that are sold by TV networks are hidden for the user.
Occasionally, a reminder on how to enter the TV-TWO video stream is displayed. The
user has the following navigation options inside the first layer of the application:
• Guide displays the program guide, the return to the application is performed
once the guide is closed
• Channel List displays the channel list, the return to the application is performed
once the channel list is closed
• Channel Up/Down allows to tune up and down, while showing the TV window
with channel information
• 0-9 allow to jump to a distinct channel number directly
• Right on the D-pad minimizes messages from TV-TWO
• Return/Exit closes the application
• Enter allows to switch between the broadcast TV layer and the video stream
layer
Accordingly, pushing Enter brings the user to the second layer that is inserted in
front of the broadcast signal. The layer shows a video stream that is automatically
tailored to the user. On the first use, navigating the video stream is explained. On the
fourth use, a survey on genre preferences is conducted by pushing left or right on the
remote. Similarly, at di↵erent points during the video stream, short questions are posed
to the user for additional TTV (e.g., asking the user for an age bracket). If none of these
special situations occur, a suitable video link is requested and played. Once a video is
completed or skipped, the progress is documented in the TV-TWO ledger system. The
process is automated through a supervised learning algorithm. Occasionally, a reminder
to check back on the broadcast signal is shown. In the video layer, the controls are as
follows:
• Enter allows to switch between the broadcast TV layer and the video stream
layer. In the video’s navigation bar it allows to select elements
• Channel Up/Down allows to switch to the next, respectively the previous, video
in the stream
8

• Up/Down on the D-pad activates and closes, the navigation bar with controls
for the current video and information on the video length as well as play position
• Left/Right on the D-pad allows to move in the navigation bar of the current
video to play, pause, stop, fast forward, rewind or skip. TV-TWO messages can
be minimized and short, surveys can be completed
• Play/Pause/Stop/Fast Forward/Rewind control the video without the navigation bar
2.1.2

Usage Scenario

Today, Smart TV owners use the Live TV application to watch the broadcast signal
on their television. TV-TWO serves as a substitute for the Live TV application by
o↵ering a gateway to traditional TV. Users can watch the standard broadcast signal
through TV-TWO and experience an extra channel tailored to their interests beyond
the traditional o↵ering. A log-in or tedious activation is not required. Upon the start of
the app, a short logo lead-in is displayed. Once the user is bored with the TV content,
wants to skip a commercial or simply prefers the TV-TWO o↵ering, pressing Enter
on the remote control leads to the second layer of the application - the individualized
video stream, blending organic and ad content. If the user would like to return to the
broadcast signal, simply pressing Enter performs the task.
2.1.3

Prerequisites and App Download

The TV-TWO application is designed for Smart TVs with an active Internet connection. All Samsung, LG, Toshiba, TP Vision and Panasonic TVs from 2012 onward will
be supported. The product demo (see section 2.2) shows a version of the application
running on a Samsung TV with the Tizen operating system including blockchain interactions on the Ropsten Testnet. Further models and manufacturers will follow (see
section 5). The TV-TWO app can be downloaded free of charge.

2.3

Partnerships

TV-TWO aims to establish a new form of entertainment on the Big Screen. An adequate
strategic network will help with decentralizing the market.
2.3.1

Content Partners

TV-TWO is an open platform for content providers from every genre. Participants
in the decentralized ecosystem can be traditional players like major movie and music
producers, online-only players, like sport and independent news platforms, and small
creators, like travel blogs and food reviews.

Technology

3.1

Front-End

TV-TWO is based on the open source project TOAST for TV Web Application development. The application utilizes open web standards to play a personalized video
stream for the user and to engage with the smart contracts as well as state channels
(see section 3.2.2). This makes it possible to track exchanged value between the user,
content providers and advertisers on the Ethereum blockchain without having to trust
the reporting of TV-TWO as the central entity.
When watching television through the TV-TWO app, the user can start the personalized video stream with just one click on the Enter button. Each time a sponsored
video finishes playing, the user is shown the current balance of TTV as determined by
the combination of the contents of his Ethereum wallet and the balance of the open state
channel with TV-TWO that has not been settled on-chain, yet. To spark brand recognition and gamification, the logo of the advertiser and and a pile of coins is displayed
in the animation that shows the current TTV balance.

3.2.1

Back-End
Supervised Learning Algorithm

By deploying a supervised learning algorithm, we can ensure that small creators with
quality content get their voices heard on our platform. While the predominant videosharing website YouTube puts significant emphasize on video clicks, our algorithm approximates the perceived quality of a video based on watch statistics as an input. For
each individual video, the TTV balance between users, content providers and advertisers is updated. In case of an organic video that is provided by a content partner, the
user automatically transfers a share of his TTV that is proportional to the watch time
of the video to the creator. In case of a sponsored message, the advertiser transfers
TTV corresponding to the watch time of the ad to the user. By manually choosing
the desired amount of ads of between five and fifteen clips per hour and by having the
possibility to skip messages, the user is in complete control. At the same time, the
advertiser can be assured that he compensates consumers in-line with their interest for
the advertised product. As elaborated in section 3.2.2, the transfer of TTV will initially
happen in state channels between TV-TWO and the market participants with all transactions logged in the TV-TWO ledger. If a user decides to skip a sponsored message,
no TTV are transferred from the advertiser. Furthermore, TV-TWO ensures through
occasional surveys and on-screen dialogs that users are engaged.
For determining the next video that is shown to the user, a neural net is trained
with watch times from all users for all videos that they have watched. We are utilizing
the Apache MXNet library. Additional input parameters for the algorithm:
• Title of the video
• Main-category of the video (e.g., sports or travel)
10

• Sub-category of the video (e.g., basketball or drone footage)
• Up to ten descriptive video tags
• Keywords that have been extracted out of the thumbnail of the video using a deep
learning image recognition algorithm
Subsequently, the model is used to predict the watch time for all videos that the user has
not seen yet. The videos are sorted by the predicted watch time in a descending order
and the first video with an organic tag is played. Dependent on the ad ratio that the
user has selected during the first start of the application, five to fifteen sponsored videos
are shown in one hour of the personalized video stream. Sponsored videos are blended
with the organic content during training of the supervised learning model. This way, the
estimated watch time can also be predicted for sponsored messages, giving TV-TWO
an indication of the relevance of the video for the consumer, which maximizes value
to the advertiser and enjoyment for the user. The amount of TTV that the advertiser
pays for the sponsored view is dependent on the relevance of the clip, as measured by
the predicted watch time.
Content creators on YouTube regularly employ tactics of shock and deception in
their video titles and thumbnails to artificially inflate their number of views. This
phenomenon is known as clickbait. YouTube as the central platform owner encourages
clickbait with its algorithm that promotes videos with a high number of clicks in a short
amount of time to its trending section. Since YouTube profits from every video click,
due to the mechanism of pre-roll ads, they are sub-optimally incentivized. TV-TWO
does not utilize pre-roll ads and is thus only incentivized to show quality content to keep
consumers on the platform as long as possible. From an economic standpoint, YouTube
prioritizes short-term revenues for its platform and its content providers over long-term
value for consumers and advertisers. This is illustrated by the concern of advertisers
with brand safety on YouTube and users leaving the platform due to declining content
quality.
A pivotal element of our model is that we disregard the amount of video views as an
input parameter for our algorithm. Instead, we rely on the watch time. In the first order
condition we maximize the total utility of consumers, content providers and advertisers,
resulting in a pareto efficient state. As a second order condition, we specify that the
utility is best split equally among the three parties. Optimizing for short-term revenue
to TV-TWO is not desirable. We strongly believe in delivering value to the ecosystem
first, before extracting revenue from it.
3.2.2

Blockchain

Blockchains combine concepts of peer-to-peer networks, asymmetric cryptography, decentralized computing and smart contracts into a new technology platform. In short,
blockchains are distributed peer-to-peer systems which implement a trustless shared
public append-only transaction ledger.[26]

11

“The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions
that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually
everything of value.“
— Don and Alex Tapscott [27]
The immutability and transparency of blockchain transactions plays a critical role in
the decentralized TV ecosystem that we as TV-TWO are building. The underpinning of
the new marketplace for consumers, content partners and advertisers will be the Token
for Television (TTV). It is based on the public open-source platform Ethereum that
facilitates blockchain-based distributed computing and smart contract functionality.[28]
The following interactions in our model are based on TTV:
1. Advertisers give TTV to users for watching sponsored videos
2. Content Providers get TTV from users for o↵ering premium video content
3. Consumers accumulate TTV that they can store in their wallet and o↵er on
exchanges
The first time, the user starts the video stream inside the application, a new wallet
is generated. The private key is saved locally on the device. On screen, the BIP39
mnemonic that was used for the creation process is displayed. The user is asked to
save the mnemonic. The phrase can be used to manage the wallet for example through
MetaMask or imToken. In order to overcome the currently limited scalability as well
as increasing latency and transaction fees of Ethereum, we are employing o↵-chain
signature patterns. State channels are used to facilitate interactions between market
participants. The term state channel refers to the concept of exchanging signed o↵-chain
transactions though a peer-to-peer communication channel. This eliminates the need
to executing every single transaction on-chain. In the context of o↵-chain value transfer
between market participants, the term payment channel may be used interchangeably.
To gain a more in depth understanding, let us consider a case in which an advertiser
would like to play ads through TV-TWO with TTV that they are holding in their
Ethereum wallet hosted on the TV-TWO platform. The advertiser and TV-TWO are
entering a smart contract that includes a function, which applies an external state in the
TV-TWO ledger system as an argument to the contract state. The function includes
a signature check to ensure that both the advertiser and TV-TWO agree with any
state changes. When entering the smart contract, the advertiser has to commit a fixed
amount of TTV as a deposit as well as define targeting criteria and campaign creatives.
The contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.
Every time a video of the advertiser is shown to a user, the state is recorded in the
TV-TWO ledger system. The transaction is updated locally, signed and sent to the
advertiser through the Whisper protocol. Subsequently, the advertisers also signs it the
transaction. This is done for every view, until either the deposit is fully used or the
state channel timeout is reach, which will update the on-chain balance in TTV to reflect
the o↵-chain transactions. See Figure 4 for an illustration. At the same time, TV-TWO
12

has open state channels with users and content providers on the platform. While for
the state channel with a content provider only TV-TWO commits a deposit, both the
users and TV-TWO commit TTV in their channel. The smart contracts that govern
the state channels are stored in the Ethereum blockchain. TV-TWO will use tokens
from the pool of the team for the deposit. When the user watches an ad, TV-TWO
first pushes the updated balance to the state channel with the advertiser. Next, the
change in tokens is pushed to the state channel with the user. TV-TWO keeps a share
of 10%, which helps run and improve the platform. When the user watches an organic
video produced by a content provider, the user automatically commits TTV through
the state channel with TV-TWO. Subsequently, the token balance between TV-TWO
and the content provider is updated. For details on the economics of the transactions,
see section 4.3. With both the user and the content provider, the state channel is kept
open, until the deposit of TV-TWO is used up or either party decides to settle on-chain.
For any following interaction between TV-TWO and the market participants, another
state channel with a new deposit is opened. TTV that users and content providers have
received in their Ethereum wallets are directly transferable. This fact makes the two
parties direct participants in the ecosystem and increases token velocity (see section
4.2).

Figure 4: Illustration of State Channel between Advertiser and TV-TWO
For increased transparency and decentralization, it is critical to move a larger share
of the TTV transactions on the Ethereum blockchain itself. The vision of TV-TWO
is to disarm the oligopolistic TV networks, not to build a monopolistic position itself.
There are a number of concepts inside the Ethereum community that are working on
increasing scalability to make this possible:
• Sharding will scale transactions by partitioning state over multiple chains
13

• Plasma will scale transactions by using hierarchical trees
• Raiden will scale transactions by using state channel technology
Apart from accounting for the exchanged value between users, content providers and
advertisers, the blockchain helps us with the following use cases:
1. Advertisers can use first-party data for targeting, without having to send it to
TV-TWO or a third-party for blind-matching
2. Consumers can anonymously share personal information with advertisers and
content providers without having to compromise their privacy
As mentioned above, the advertiser specifies targeting parameters for a given ad
campaign in the smart contract with TV-TWO. In case the advertiser is looking to
target users on the basis of first-party data, they encrypt said data with the public key
of TV-TWO and include it with the contract. To minimize costs associated with storing
large amounts of first-party data on-chain, it is advisable to put the encrypted data in a
content-addressable storage system that stores files by their hashes o↵-chain. The data
stays encrypted on the server of the advertiser and a hash of the file is included with the
smart contract. Using the hash value, TV-TWO can access the file, decrypt it with its
private key and use it for targeting in the campaign as specified in the smart contract.
By default, advertisers and content providers only see the TV-TWO ID (resettable)
of a user that has just watched their content as documented in the TV-TWO ledger.
However, users can decide to enable advanced data sharing with advertisers and content
providers in order to receive additional TTV. While protecting the privacy of users is of
ultimate importance to TV-TWO, we believe that data sharing on a fully transparent
and opt-in level can strengthen the ecosystem. Advertisers and content providers can
use additional information about the users to plan more relevant campaigns and to
create more tailor-made content. Ruling out data sharing by design, puts all market
participants at a disadvantage. In case a user decides to share data, TV-TWO encrypts
the data with the public key of the advertisers or content partner and includes it in the
TV-TWO ledger. Subsequently, advertisers and content providers can encrypt the data
using their private keys.

The Token for Television
Token Network E↵ect

TV-TWO is introducing the Token for Television (TTV) as the currency in a new,
globally decentralized TV ecosystem.
“A token is just another currency used in the economy that specializes in the
exchange of a particular service.“
— Primoz Kordez [29]
14

Figure 5: The Bootstrapping Challenge [30]
Transactions between advertisers and users as well as between users and content
providers are always tied to the Token for Television. Other cryptocurrencies and fiat
can not be used to exchange value between market participants. Advertisers have to
acquire TTV during the crowdsale or on exchanges in order to sponsor messages. The
decision to design the ecosystem in a way that it is reliant on the TTV helps to leverage token network e↵ects in order to overcome the bootstrapping challenge of initially
limited application utility (see Figure 5). Each token has the reserved right to show
ads to a fixed portion of the TV-TWO user base, each consumer that comes to the
platform boosts the utility of the token. All token holders are aligned towards the common goal of growing the user base, be it through word of mouth or through uploading
premium videos on the platform. With more users and quality content providers in
the ecosystem, an increasing number of advertisers see relevance in sponsoring videos
on TV-TWO. What is great for advertisers: If the price per TTV should increase, the
price of reaching one individual on the platform does not increase in line. Over time,
one TTV simply buys more sponsored views than in the beginning. This is where the
divisibility of the TTV to 18 decimal places becomes relevant. It also gives advertisers
and their agencies a reason to purchase tokens during the crowdsale and hold them to
reach even more viewers at a later point in time. Finally, the TTV is a better currency
for the ecosystem than any fiat, since it facilitates transactions across boarders and
without any fees.

4.2

Token Economy

The following section explores the longevity of the TTV-based economy by analyzing
market dynamics. The pivotal aspect that will ensure the value of TTV in the future
is its utility. In his Medium article, William Mougayar elaborates on three tenets to
the utility of tokens: role, purpose, and features.[31] Table 1 details the four roles and
purposes as well as all features of the Token for Television:

15

Table 1: Utility of the TTV

4) Earnings

Earnings, distributed benefits

1. The first role of the TTV is to exchange value inside the ecosystem. The decentralized television economy is created on the basis of the Token for Television.
Advertisers use the TTV to buy views for their sponsored videos. Users are rewarded for watching sponsored messages. Content providers are rewarded by TTV
for o↵ering organic content inside the TV-TWO video stream. As detailed in section 3.2.2, the TTV balance with advertisers, content providers and consumers is
managed through state channels. Once the balance of the state channel is settled
with the content provider or the user on-chain, the TTV are available inside their
Ethereum wallets. The parties can become active as an advertiser on TV-TWO
themselves, which gives them the possibility to sponsor their video content. It
especially gives content providers the chance to increase the amount of views on
their videos. For many consumers and advertisers, TTV will be the first token
that they have owned. For advertisers, the process of acquiring and spending
TTV is completely seamless on the campaign management platform. For users,
it is easy to import their wallet created on the TV into MetaMask through the
BIP39 mnemonic.
2. The second role of the TTV is to function as an enrichment to the user experience
of the application and the ecosystem. Content providers are motivated by TTV
to use the network. Advertisers use TTV to connect with users. Consumers are
incentivized for the usage of the personalized video stream through the Token for
Television.
3. The third role of TTV inside the decentralized television ecosystem is to make it
possible for market participants to administer payments across borders without
any friction. Transactions between advertisers and users as well as between users
and content providers are dependent on the Token for Television. As with any
currency, the equation of exchange can be used to understand the flow of money
in the economy [32]:
MV = PQ
where:
16

(1)

M is the size of the TTV asset base.
V is the velocity of the TTV.
P is the price of booking ads on TV-TWO.
Q is the quantity of ad inventory on TV-TWO.
Both too high and too low token velocity are detrimental to the decentralized TV
ecosystem. Too high velocity could exist, if market participants would not see any
value in holding TTV. In order to facilitate payments to users, they would convert
fiat or any cryptocurrency to the Token for Television. Content providers and users
would directly convert TTV to other currencies for storing value. On the other
end of the spectrum, token velocity could be lower than desired. Contributors and
market participants could hold on to TTV for extended periods of time, without
spending it in the economy. Drawing from the M1 money supply (most liquid
portions) of the US economy, the velocity of the TTV should ideally remain in
the moderate range between 4 and 15.[33]
TV-TWO will continuously monitor the velocity of the Token for Television in
the market. Due to the mechanism of Network Utility Expansion, we expect the
velocity of the Token for Television to be low in the beginning. Since the size
of the TTV asset base is fixed after the crowdsale, the available tokens access a
defined percentage of consumers that watch television through TV-TWO. If the
absolute number of consumers using TV-TWO grows over time, the amount of
utility per token increases. The anticipation of greater utility in the future will
cause market participants to hold on to TTV, reducing the velocity of the token.
After receiving tokens from the advertiser or the user, the market participants
will either have to hold the TTV for a period of time before they can convert it
to another currency, or spend it on the TV-TWO platform itself.
4. The final role of the Token for Television deals with earnings. The TTV helps
with distributing benefits generated by the newly decentralized ecosystem to all
market participants. The oligopolistic surplus of TV networks - the honeypot now goes directly to consumers, content providers and advertisers. Consumers get
a share of the TV ad cake for the first time at all. Content providers are rewarded
more generously for their quality videos and at the same time, advertisers get to
pay a lower price for showing their sponsored videos in a premium environment.

4.3

Token Transactions

The following section will elaborate on the transactions between advertisers and users
as well as between users and content providers. Advertisers can transfer Tokens for
Television (TTV) to users in order to reward them for watching sponsored messages.
The amount of TTV the advertiser needs for one view is dependent on the relevance of
the video for the user, which is measured with the help of the predicted watch time as
calculated by the supervised learning algorithm (see section 3.2.1). The relevance is a

17

fraction that is plugged into the following function to calculate the price in TTV:
p(r) =

M
· (1 + e
↵N

r

)

(2)

where:
M is the size of the TTV asset base,
N is the number of users on the platform,
e is Euler’s number,
↵ and

are scaling factors,

r is the relevance score between 0 and 1.

Figure 6: Plot of equation 2
The function aligns interest between advertisers and users, making the promotion
of more relevant videos substantially cheaper for the advertiser. Figure 6 shows the
ecosystem in a state with an asset base of 7,500,000 TTV and a user base of 3,000,000
with scaling factor ↵ set to 125 and set to 3. Both scaling factors will be algorithmically adjusted over time until the ecosystem is in a steady state, where the total utility
of consumers, content providers and advertisers is about equal. Major determinants are
the amount of ads the average user is willing to see and the number of organic clips, an
average user watches per hour. The duration of the sponsored video does not influence
the price paid. If the users skips the video during the first ten seconds, no payment
between the advertiser and consumer is administered. Fraud, in which the user simply
turns on the TV and walks away in order to earn TTV is mitigated through a dialog
that appears, if no action has occurred for some time. Additionally, the user is identified during the registration process (KYC), which limits the viability of fraudulent TTV
farming. TV-TWO keeps a share of 10% of the TTV transferred from the advertisers,
18

which helps run and improve the platform. The tokens are stored in a wallet that is kept
separate from the ones used in the crowdsale. 90% of the TTV is credited to the user.
In the state described above, viewing an ad with a moderate relevance score results in
0.0225 TTV for the user. The user can choose to watch between five and fifteen ads per
hour. For an individual in the United States with 4.5 hours of television consumption
per day, fifteen ads per hour result in an accumulation of around 550 TTV in one year.
While the absolute number of TTV that the user can gain by watching commercials decreases with more consumers on the platform, the equivalent in other currencies remains
constant. When the user watches an organic video produced by a content provider, the
user automatically commits TTV according to the following sigmoid function:
✓
◆
M
1
M
t
con(t) =
·
=
· 1 + tanh
(3)
N 1+e t
2 N
2
where:
M is the size of the TTV asset base,
N is the number of users on the platform,
is a scaling factor,
t is the number of minutes watched.
Figure 7 shows the ecosystem in a state with an asset base of 7,500,000 TTV and
a user base of 3,000,000. The scaling factor is set to 275. Here, content providers
receive 9 TTV for 1,000 engaged video views. If the user has fewer TTV in his wallet
than calculated in equation 4, he is potentially unable to pay the content provider for
the next video. In this case, a sponsored video is played. In the state described above,
the limit is around 0.009 TTV. Users and content providers can hold the Token for
Television in their wallets.

Frequently Asked Questions
1. How is the Token for Television (TTV) structured?
The Token for Television is an ERC20 token that is divisible to 18 decimal places.
2. How do I participate in the crowdsale?
Please subscribe to our newsletter on https://tv-two.com to receive a video before
the start of the crowdsale that describes the process of purchasing tokens in detail.
3. Can other cryptocurrencies or fiat be used in the decentralized television ecosystem?
Transactions between advertisers and users as well as between users and content
providers are always tied to the Token for Television (TTV). Other cryptocurrencies and fiat can not be used to exchange value between market participants.
Advertisers have to acquire TTV during the crowdsale or on exchanges in order
to sponsor messages. This fact will sustainably protect the value of the Token for
Television.
4. Will additional TTV be issued after the crowdsale?
No additional TTV will be issued after the crowdsale. We will make the Smart
Contracts for the operation of the ecosystem open source. This way, participants
are able to validate this claim.
5. What sets the Token for Television apart from the Basic Attention
Token (BAT)?
Both the Basic Attention Token and the Token for Television are transnational
units for advertisers, content providers and consumers. While the team behind
the BAT concentrates on managing this triangular relationship on the blockchain
for desktop and mobile devices, we work on the Television ecosystem. A market
that is equally large, but much less digitized. In contrast to BAT, we believe that
the consumer should be able to sell the tokens he or she acquired through the
application in order to monetarily profit from the transaction. This will increase
the velocity of the TTV and strengthen our token economy. On the topic of
privacy: While we personally sympathize with BAT’s focus on protecting personal
data of users, we feel that it is wrong not to provide market participants with the
chance to opt-in to data sharing that improves relevance of sponsored videos and
increases the utility for advertisers, content providers and consumers. Despite the
di↵erences, we feel that the BAT team and we are fighting the same battle: for a
better user experience, more quality content and higher relevance. Therefore, we
want to ask supporters of BAT and those who were looking to participate in their
crowdsale to consider TV-TWO.

Appendix

A.1

Structure of the TV Ecosystem

In our Value Proposition, we have made the claim that TV networks are entrenched
in oligopolistic structures. In this section, we will validate this claim. According to
the online investment encyclopedia Investopedia, “an oligopoly consists of a select few
companies having significant influence over an industry. While these companies are
considered competitors within the specific market, they tend to cooperate with each
other to benefit as a whole, which can lead to higher prices.“[3] We have selected two
methods for analyzing the structure of the industry.
First, we utilize the checklist from “Microeconomics“ by Je↵rey M. Perlo↵ of the
University of California, Berkley to check for an oligopoly (Table 3).[4] TV networks
are assumed to o↵er commercial inventory, which many advertisers are interested in
purchasing. The demand curve for commercial slots is downward sloping. The fewer
commercials can be booked, the higher the price. This makes broadcasters price-setters.
Advertisers are in a position where a prevailing price must be accepted (Criterion 1).
To test for market power, the price and marginal costs of the television department of
NBCUniversal are analyzed:
p > MC

(5)

where:
p is the price of one 30 second commercial,
M C is the marginal cost to the TV network for one 30 second commercial.
The marginal costs are calculated by taking the total television costs of NBCUniversal, found in the annual report of Comcast, divded by the total amount of commercial
spots aired in the timespan of one year on the network.[5]

This leads us to believe that NBCUniversal incurs marginal costs of approximately
USD 6,100 per 30 second commercial. At the same time, the average price for a 30
second spot on national TV during prime time was USD 112,000.[6] Even when taking
high discounts for placements during the day into account, marginal costs stay below
the price (Criterion 2). For the US market “one condition for a new entry is that the
potential station be able to obtain a license from the FCC. The lack of such a license is
an absolute (legal) barrier to entry in any television market.“[7] Accordingly, the entry
is limited (Criterion 3). A common American terminology with regards to television is
“The Big Four“. It refers to the dominating TV networks, namely Disney-ABC, CBS,
NBCUniversal and Fox, owned by News Corporation (Criterion 4). Daniel M. Kimmel
outlines the introduction of the Fox network and how it changed the industry.[8] He
names sport broadcasting rights and cartoon Saturdays as examples. Although ideas
and concepts of the TV networks may depict di↵erentiated products, players adapt
to success stories (Criterion 6 and 7). Additionally, the TV networks enforce their
powerful position and gather long-run profits: “Over the past few decades television has
developed one of the most lucrative business models in entertainment history“ (Criterion
5).[9] Therefore, all seven criteria indicate that TV networks form an oligopoly.
Second, concentration indexes are utilized to indicate the state of competition in
a market. For the concepts, we refer to the CR6 index and the interval estimation of
the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index adapted by Naldi and Flamini.[10] The most common
approaches to calculating the concentration ratio are the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
(HHI) and the Six-Firm Concentration Ratio (CR6 ). Due to 3,768 firms contributing
to the US television landscape, calculating the HHI with the market shares of all individual players is impractical. Instead the CR6 was selected as a measure of industry
contraction, looking at the market share of the six largest companies. The index is
computed by calculating the sum of market shares:
CR6 =

6
X

si

(6)

i=1

where:

si is the market share of firm i in the market.
In the United States six companies, namely Comcast (NBC), News Corporation
(Fox), Disney (ABC, ESPN), Viacom (MTV, Nick Jr.), Time-Warner (CNN, HBO)
and CBS (Showtime, Smithsonian Channel), possess a market share of 70%. Data
on the US TV market is retrieved from Business Insider.[11] This indicates a highly
concentrated market with weak competition between the largest players.
Both analyses underline the oligopolistic nature of the broadcast industry. This is
an undesirable state for users, advertisers and content providers. For users, the strong
concentration reduces choice and the access to objective journalism. Advertisers are
reduced to price-takers and deprived of innovative ad format. Content providers face
high entry barriers with quality not being the most important determinant in the fight

30

for airtime. Regulators and TV networks have no interest in a broader, more diversified
market. Instead, they focus on exploiting their predominant position.

A.2

Current state of the TV Advertising Market
“Marketing departments might collect voluminous statistics on television
program ratings and on coupon redemptions and carefully compare the costs
of marketing with total sales. But none of this data measures what is really
important: the incremental sales of a product.“
— Magid Abraham and Leonard M. Lodish, June 1990 [12]

This quote describes the challenges of TV advertising in 1990. One would expect the
digitalization to have changed attribution models for broadcast television. Yet, program
ratings rain supreme. While Connected TVs have the technology in them to turn TV
to the most important channel for digital advertising, broadcast networks are slow to
adopt the new technology. Instead of focusing on the user, TV commercials are still
booked on a contextual basis - just like 27 years ago.
A.2.1

A European e↵ort for change: HbbTV

Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) is an initiative aiming to combine the advantages of the Internet with TV in the form a new industry standard for Smart TVs.
It was launched by leading European players from the television industry in 2009. In
the press release at the time, it is announced that “through the adoption of HbbTV,
consumers will be able to access new services from entertainment providers such as
broadcasters, online providers and CE manufacturers.“[13] However, HbbTV does not
seem ready for a world-wide rollout. After eight years HbbTV still did not arrive in the
three biggest TV advertising markets - the US, China and Japan.
A.2.2

Addressable TV

Programmatic is the ultimate form of digital advertising on desktop and mobile devices.
It automates as much of the process of booking media as possible. In the past, both
media sellers and media buyers had to pick up their phone to negotiate placements and
prices. Today, impressions are traded on Ad Exchanges in a matter of milliseconds.
The increased flexibility leads to higher revenues for publishers, improved targeting
and attribution capabilities for advertisers, as well as a higher relevancy of ads for
users. Although most consumers already have Connected TVs in their home that are
addressable, much of the TV ad buying is still done on a traditional direct deal basis.
Advertisers and TV networks agree on commercial slots by consulting Nielsen GRP data
and all viewers of a program see the same ad. Contrary, Addressable TV describes the
concept in which commercials are selected in real-time on a per-device level. Advertisers
can target appropriate audiences according to location, demographics, and behavior.[14]
Nevertheless, certain obstacles persist:

• Online, the high complexity of programmatic advertising o↵ers great opportunities
for fraud, non-transparency and inefficiencies. The same issues might arise on
Addressable TVs. Therefore, transparency is needed right from the start
• Privacy laws will require TV networks to get an opt-in from users [15], which
poses a technical challenge
• Behavioral targeting can only be done on a per-channel basis, since user data is
kept in silos between the individual networks
• The legal status of location-based targeting on TV is questionable in some geographies (e.g., regional TV ads are against the law in Germany) [16]
• Addressable TV only makes the sponsored but not the organic content more relevant for viewers. Features like skipping individual clips are not supported by TV
networks
• Booking volumes on Addressable TVs are still small, since TV networks are incentivized to sustain the status quo of traditional booking, where ad performance
remains opaque [17]
• Inventory from addressable campaigns is often traded on private exchanges, which
still require a direct relationship between advertiser and TV network
In 2016, the budget allocated to addressable ads represented 1.1% of the total television market and “will remain a small portion of total TV spend for the foreseeable
32

future.“[18] Without a major shift in the ecosystem, TV networks will stay oblivious
to technological progress. While the demand for new media formats is understood,
TV networks feel no need to adapt. Market participants will have to rely on a more
decentralized system to attack the oligopolistic honeypot.

Overview on Global Advertising Industry

In the “Global Advertising Forecast“ from MAGNA, a division of the marketing agency
IPG Mediabrands, the world’s ad figures of 2016 are gathered (Table 4).[19] Linear
television advertising revenues grew 3.8% to USD 186 billion in 2016. Digital ad sales
increased by 16.9%. The growth of print and radio is negative. To increase growth
rates, television needs to get out of the o✏ine bracket and embrace its digital future.
A.2.4

Market Study: Germany

The German market is the biggest European TV advertising market (see Figure 10).
It is known to be strong and estimated to grow over the coming years. A single digit
growth has been observed since media markets recovered from the financial crisis of
2007/2008. This rise is estimated to continue beyond 2020.[20] ProSiebenSat.1 Media
and RTL Group are the two leading German commercial networks, owning fourteen
individual channels. Likewise, the television ad pie is divided between the two players.
The state-owned channels, ARD and ZDF, and independent sports and news networks
only posses a minor share. ProSiebenSat.1 Media and RTL Group account for almost
85% of the entire market (see Figure 11).[21] Accordingly, the German market su↵ers
from a duopoly.

Legal

Legal Situation
The TV-TWO team will always work with highest diligence and best e↵orts to achieve
the stated goal. However, certain internal or external contingencies cannot be influenced. Thus, we feel obliged to elucidate some of those imponderables. A contribution
constitutes a voluntary contribution to realize the outlined vision. TTV are Ethereumbased tokens, which depict vouchers that may be redeemed in a given timeframe for a
given service inside the TTV ecosystem. The purchase or possession of TTV must not
be mistaken with a security investment or any associated rights. Likewise, TTV must
not be graded, interpreted or treated as any sort of currency, part of an investment
scheme, part of a business trust, derivatives of a part of a business trust, debentures,
derivative of debentures or any class of security. The TTV does not entail any equity
stake, nor right to dividends or any payments, nor right for vote or any decision-making.
The TTV does not include ownership right or claim of TV-TWO, the platform, intellectual property or revenues, today or in the future. Reduction of the ETH exchange
amount or warranty rights are precluded. Redemption rights are not given. The TTV
can only be used inside the TTV ecosystem. Contributions are not refundable. The
associated hazard is accepted through the participation.
Risk Factors
For participants deciding to contribute to TV-TWO, we would like to further illustrate
the associated risks. The following factors must be observed with full attention and
considered in combination with all other information provided in this Whitepaper. If
one or more risks, regardless if listed or not, materialize, loss of full contribution is
possible. Each risk must be examined independently with equal thoroughness. Risks
can combine and intensify. We have prepared this list to the best of our knowledge, but
cannot guarantee its completeness.
• Risks associated with Personal Decisions:
– Without professional advice from legal, tax and economic or other experts,
important aspects of this token sale might not be evaluated properly.
– Restrictions deviate from government to government. It is the participants’
responsibility to investigate locally whether the token sale constitutes a violation of law. If token crowdsales or the trade of cryptocurrencies are illegal,
criminal charges are possible. To protect our participants, we entitle ourselves to make contributions subject to compliance regulations, like KYC or
AML. Despite of believing the TTV does not qualify as a security, we soundly
follow the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission new regulations. As an
extra precaution for us and the contributors, we do not accept participants
from U.S. in the public crowdsale. Accredited American Investors are permissible in the pre-sale.
35

• Risks associated with Cryptocurrencies:
– In case the TTV ecosystem will fail, independent of the cause, no third party
would exchange TTV for goods or services. Accordingly, the value of TTV
is strictly dependent of the success of TV-TWO.
– TV-TWO relies on the Ethereum blockchain technology. Therefore, the future development of this blockchain heavily influences the success of TVTWO.
– Ether has been subject to strong market fluctuation in the past. Since the
TV-TWO financials rely on Ether as currency, a price decrease might negatively a↵ect operations.
– TTV will be listed on one or more cryptocurrency exchanges. TV-TWO can
neither guarantee the continuous operations of those platforms, nor guarantee
secure deposit.
– Single contributors may possess large portions of TTV. If tokens are sold in
bulks, this could have negative e↵ects on the market value of TTV.
– Token Holders’ mistakes, including but not limited to loss of private keys or
performing of unintended transfers, lie in their own responsibility.
• Risks associated with Regulations
– An institution positioned to supervise, stabilize or control does not exist.
The lack of constitutional presence might negatively influence TTV in times
of crisis.
– Future regulations cannot be predicted. Changes could possibly lead to the
depreciation of TTV or the cease of TV-TWO.
The Tokens are intended to be used solely within the ecosystem and TV-TWO
will not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation
of Tokens. This restricts the contemplated avenues for using Tokens to use in the
ecosystem, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to any Tokens you
own. Even if secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such
exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making
them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third
parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a
digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.
Forward-looking statements
All statements that do not relate to historical facts must be regarded as forward-looking
statements. This holds for this Whitepaper, as well as any statements by anyone acting
on behalf of TV-TWO. These statements may be identified by forward-looking phrases
and terms such as “if“, “may“, “possible“, “probable“, “would“, “could“, “should“,
36

“anticipate“, “believe“, “estimate“, “expect“, “intend“, “aim“, “target“, “plan“, “can“,
“will“ and similar terms. It is important to note that this is not an exclusive list for
forward-looking statements.
The use of forward-looking statements indicates a prediction, as opposed to a historical fact. Forward-looking statements represent analyses and estimates that are based
on known, as well as unknown risk, uncertainties, and other factors of internal or external origin. They may negatively influence future results, as well as business success
of TV-TWO, and are partially included in the list of risk factors.
