Hcash will create an all new platform that links to major
blockchains, allowing value and information to circulate between
the different blockchains, hence redefine the value of blockchain.
Below are some important features of the Hcash platform.

1.1 Hive. Composed of Blockchain and DAG systems

Blockchain-Based

Blockless-Based

Hcash platform is designed to be the side chain for both
block-based and blockless-based blockchains. Hcash will be the
value and information carrier for all blockchains to enable the
exchange of value and information possible for between the
systems.

Address Definition
In order to implement with another important feature which we will
mention later, Hcash is
designed purposely
have both public and
private addresses to be
compatible with Zcash
and Byteball address
systems. In the near
future, it is expected to
directly send and
receive ZEC or GBYTE in the Hcash system. Meanwhile, it is also
possible to achieve the fully encrypted communication based on
Zero Knowledge Proof technology between the Hcash nodes and
clients, as well as a range of other exciting new features.

About Directed Acyclic Graph
Directed acyclic graph is a finite directed graph with no directed
cycles. That is, it consists of finitely many vertices and edges, with
each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that there is
no way to start at any vertex v and follow a consistently-directed
sequence of edges that eventually loops back to v again.

The DAG graph is a special but more general directed graph
compares to the directed tree. The following figure shows the
examples of directed trees, DAG graph, and directed graph. In the
Big Data industry, DAG is usually used for Big Data structural level,
such as the execution engine of Hadoop, Storm and Spark.
The following graph shows the operating architecture of Spark:

h.cash

There is a dependent relationship between the RDD objects which
forms a DAG situation. The DAG scheduler will split DAG into
‘Stages’. The rules for splitting are simple: scanning through from
back to front, whenever DAG scheduler encounters a narrow
dependence the current ‘Stage’ will be added in whereas a wide
dependence will be split. After completing the division of the
‘Stage’, DAG scheduler generates the ‘TaskSet’ based on each
‘Stage’

and

submit

the

‘TaskSet’

to

‘TaskScheduler’.

‘TaskScheduler’ is responsible for the specific task scheduling, to

As blockchain technology develop, many new blockchain data
structure are now developed base on DAG, for example IOTA [4].
IOTA’s core data structure, called ‘Tangled’, is trying to resolve
existing issues in the ‘Internet of Things’ industry such as massive
data storage and distributed computing. In addition, it provides a
good solution for the micropayment in the IOT industry.

Traditional blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are using
binary tree data structures such as the Merkel tree:

Hcash attempts to establish a channel between the systems, on
top of two completely different data structures, so that it can be
compatible with the current mainstream blockchain technical
standard

while

allowing

the

new

blockchain

technology

communicate with the current blockchain system. Hcash’s
technical development team consists of technical experts from the
world’s

famous

academic

institution

of

cryptography

and

blockchain industry, as well as the experts in Big Data and Cloud
Computing. All these expert will ensure the Hcash project meet its
original system design goals.

1.2 Hybrid .POW+POS Open-Governance Model
The consensus across digital currency communities has always
been a difficult problem to solve. As we all know, the struggle to
upgrade the Bitcoin has been affecting the development of the
community over the past two to three years. And yet the
over-centralisation by Zcash-like digital currencies has certainly
deterred active participation across the community.

Hcash, has incorporated partially the philosophy of Decred and
Dash, introduces Instant-Open-Governance, which allows all
holders to participate in community decisions through the PoS
mining mechanism, including protocol updates and upgrades.
Hcash is more advanced in the sense that it provides smoother
execution. Once the vote is passed, all decisions will be recorded
in the blockchain and enforced, thus avoiding the consensus
problem induced from miners, mining farms, exchanges and wallet
service providers. The PoW mechanism is set to prevent pre-ICO
investors occupying an excessively large portion of rewards in a
PoS distribution. It also has been proved to be the most effective
security mechanism to protect the blockchain system.

h.cash

Although an inevitably large amount of energy will be consumed,
we believe such setting is still worthwhile in comparison to the
security benefits it brings to system. Moreover, it is possible to
have the PoW and PoS mining process combined together to
ensure the security of the system.

First, we start mining in a traditional PoW way where the miners
compete to solve for a cryptographic hard problem. According to
this implementation, the blocks being mined do not contain any
transactions (they are more like templates), so the winning blocks
will only include a header and the miner's reward address. At this
moment, the system will switch to PoS. Based on the information of
this header, a set of random validators is selected to sign the new
block. The higher the number of coins a validator is holding, the
higher the probability of being selected. Once the selected
validator completes the signature of the block, the template
becomes a complete block. If some of the validators are not
available for signing the block, they will be selected to sign the next
block and a new set of validators will be selected until the block
gets the correct number of signatures. The fee will be assigned to
the miner and the validators who participate in the signature of the
block.

h.cash

For PoW [6], qualified blocks can be expressed as:
F(Nonce) < Target
‘Nonce’ is a random element, ‘Target’ is the quantization of the
qualified block, and the ‘Target’ of each accounting node is
consistent. In addition, successful operation of PoW also requires
the cooperation with the following two principles:
1.Best chain principle: the longest chain is regarded as the
right chain.
2.The incentive principle: reward income will be given to those
who have found qualified blocks.

Principle 1 is a mandatory rule meaning everyone must obey the
rule. The common goal is to find a consistent ledger, and the
longest chain represents the greatest workload. If there is no such
agreement, everyone will only construct their own chain and no
agreement can be reached. Principle 2 is for the workload of
incentives. Since it occurs a cost for supporting the network, the
only way to encourage people to do so is to provide the incentive
according to the workload.
Participation in the accounting blockchain becomes an investment
behavior.

h.cash
11

The cost, output value, and risk form the game under the
constraints of Principle 1, which drive all nodes in accordance with
the rules for the real structure of the block, and ultimately to
achieve Nash equilibrium.

For PoS [7], the qualifying block can be expressed as:
F(Timestamp) < Target * Balance
The above PoS scheme is currently used by nxt [8] [9] and
Blackcoin [10] to take the PoS mechanism. The simplest version of
the PoS mechanism can easily lead to a wealth of centralization
issues, also has a significant impact on the entire system security.
Compared to PoW, the search space on the left side of the formula
is changed from ‘Nonce’ to ‘Timestamp’, the ‘Nonce’ range is
infinite, while the ‘Timestamp’ is extremely limited. The block time
of a qualifying block must be within the specified range of the
previous block time, blocks that are too early or too advanced will
not be accepted by other nodes.

h.cash
12

The target value on the right side of the formula introduces a
product factor balance. The larger the balance is, the larger the
equation for (Target * Balance) will be this makes it easier for a
block to be found. Because ‘Timestamp’ is limited, PoS Casting
Block success rate is mainly related to Balance (Stake). Hcash's
PoS mechanism will draw on the existing PoS mechanism to
improve the efficiency of PoS under the premise of ensuring the
security of the system, and focus on improving the security of the
digital currency when the PoS mechanism is used.

1.3 Hierarchy. DAO Governance
The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is the ideal
product of the cryptography technological revolution. The source of
the Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC) can be traced
back to the decentralized organization described by Ori Brafman in
"Starfish and Spider" (2007) [11], and "peer production" portrayed
by Yochai Benkler in “Web Fortune” (2006) [12]. But these two
concepts are linked with techniques related to cryptocurrencies,
and Dan Larimer put forward the concept of a DAC, which regards
Bitcoin as a DAC also.

h.cash
13

About DAC
In order to have a clear definition of the DAC, we summarize the
seven necessary features of the DAC:
•

Openness: The design of the DAC system is transparent. Open
transparency is the cornerstone of the entire DAC system. A
black-box operated organization cannot be treated as a DAC.
Nowadays the open source software spirit becomes a typical
example of openness.

•

Decentralization: No centralized individuals or organizations
can control the entire DAC. This feature determines the
self-similarity. The decentralization characteristics of the
system ensures the vitality of the DAC system.

•

Autonomy: Everyone can participate the DAC system. All
participants are either DAC system subsidiary or sub-unit, and
from their own point of view to promote the development of
DAC. The spontaneous behaviour of the participant guarantees
the operation of the DAC.

•

Value: The DAC system must be of value, such as the
international payment network, anonymous transactions, tax
avoidance,

value

storage,

non-freezing,

unregulated

characteristics of the Bitcoin system, which determines the
profitability of the Bitcoin DAC system.

h.cash
14

•

Profitability: DAC participants will receive rewards for DAC
system development, and profitability is determined by the
value of the DAC itself.

•

Self-similarity: Even in the case of only some DAC nodes exist,
the DAC system can still function and develop normally. The
destruction of some unit nodes will not affect the development
of DAC, which is guaranteed by the decentralization property.

•

Democracy: Changes in the core system of the DAC system
require the voting from the overwhelming majority of units to be
completed, and the decentralization and autonomy determine
that the DAC must be a system capable of democratic voting.

Vitalik extends this concept and brings forward a more common
DAO

concept.

Unregulated

crowd

funding

and

service

segregations are components of a DAO, as well as cryptography
technological management and trust-based automation. Both of
which allow the DAO to run, as Stan Larimer said "under the
control of a set of business rules without any human participation."
However, if there is no strict control during the system design
stage. This ideal state of the autonomous organization will also
cause serious consequences [13].

h.cash
15

In June 2016, The DAO, the largest crowdfunding program in the
history, raised more than US$150 million for the distributed
autonomous organizations. Nevertheless, due to the code
loopholes, it was attacked by hackers and lost more than 3.6
million ETH. At that moment, the value of loss exceeded US$60
million. Consequently, the ETH community split, resulting in the
existing ETC and ETH double-stranded coexistence situation.

In the Hcash system, 5% of the coins will be sent to a DAO.
Holders of Hcash determine the use of funds in a real-time
dynamic voting system, for example, developing wallets and other
infrastructure construction, or public promotion and other public
relation activities. A DAO is the driving force behind future
advancement and provides the Hcash community with continual
vitality. At the same time, the code for Hcash DAO will go through
rigorous audits and adds the necessary human intervention at the
initial stage (by a third party for code security audits). This is to
protect DAO in the early stage of fund operation and ensure there
will be no major mistake.

h.cash

1.4 Hidden. Zero Knowledge Proof
Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP), also known as zk-SNARK, is the
core technology behind the anonymous characteristics of Zcash.
ZKP allows the prover to convince the verifier that a certain
assertion is correct without providing any useful information.

Taking into account the massive amount of Hcash data interaction,
we use an identification scheme in which its security is based on
the hardness of solving the discrete logarithm problem. The
scheme can be pre-computed to reduce the amount of real-time
calculation and the amount of data required to be transmitted. In
order to generate the key pair, we first select the parameters of the
system: prime p and prime q, where q is the prime factor of p - 1. p
≈ 21024, q> 2160, element g is with order q, where l ≤ g ≤ p - 1.
The system parameters (p, q, g) and the verification function (that
is, the public key of the trusted third-party T) are distributed by T to
verify the signature of the message.
Given a unique identity for each user, user A (with identity IA)
selects the secret key s, 0 ≤ s ≤ q - 1, and calculates v = g-s mod p;
A sends IA and v reliably to T and obtains a certificate from T. We
let CA = (IA, v, ST (IA, v)), where ST(.) is the signature generated
by T.

h.cash
17

The agreement is as follows:
(1) Select the random number r, 1 ≤ r ≤ q - 1, calculate x = gr mod
p, which is a pre-processing step that can be done before B
appears;
(2) A will send (CA, x) to B;
(3) B verifies ST(IA, v) with the public key of T, realizes the identity
IA and public key v of A, and sends a random number e between 1
and 2t - 1 to A, where t is a security parameter;
(4) A verifies 1 ≤ e ≤ 2t - 1, calculates y = (s e + r) mod q, and
sends y to B;
(5) B verifies x = gy ve mod p, if the equation holds, then recognize
the identity of A is legitimate.
The security is based on the parameter t, where t is chosen to be
large enough so that the probability of guessing e correctly 2-t is
small enough. The suggested value for t is 72, the suggested
length for p (that is, |p|) is about 512 bits, and q (that is, |q|) is 140
bits.

18

Hcash will be motived from the Zero Knowledge Proof technique
from Zcash. It will not only be used to achieve bi-directional
encryption in the process of asset transfer, but also be deployed to
many other areas demanding transactional privacy. Hcash has
integrated real-time communication function within the client, which
can support multiplatform token transfer via a black address in
order to preserve privacy in daily peer to peer communications,
through the technique of Zero Knowledge Proof. It further realises
multiplatform encrypted communication such as from Hcash client
to the Byteball client.

1.5 Hard. Quantum Resistance
Currently within the blockchain systems represented by Bitcoin,
SHA-256 hash calculations and ECDSA elliptic curve cryptography
serve as the most basic security protection along the Bitcoin
network. However, with the advancement of quantum computer
technology,

especially

within

Shaw's

algorithm

(a

typical

representative of the quantum algorithm), related operations can
be achieved from the index level to the polynomial level in theory.
Problems that are difficult for a classical computer in the
foreseeable future can certainly be solved by practical quantum
computers.

h.cash
19

Post-quantum cryptography, also known as quantum-resistant
cryptography, is able to resist the attacks by quantum computers.
The development of such encryption technology takes a more
traditional path, based on difficult problems in specific mathematics
fields. Through researching and developing algorithms, the
post-quantum secure encryption technology can be applied in the
network, and to provide the highest level of data security.

The application of post-quantum cryptography does not rely on any
quantum theory phenomenon, but its computational security can
defend against any form of quantum attack that is currently known.
In 1997, IBM researchers proposed an encryption scheme called
Learning With Errors (LWE)[14][15], which means to learn with
error. As it takes a long time to find the nearest lattice, it can resist
attacks from the quantum computer.

Ring-LWE-based public key encryption scheme:
Related parameter selection and operation rules
The main parameters of the program are n, p, q.
n: the maximum number of polynomials in the encryption scheme.
In the guarantee of efficiency and security standard, it should be
2k.

h.cash
20

q: a large modulus, which is a positive integer. The value of q is
related to the specific case. The q value should be large enough to
ensure that the security is high, but the greater the value of q, the
more system resources will be consumed and the computation will
be increased as well.
p: a small modulus, usually a small positive integer.
Let R = Z
q［x］ /( xn + 1) ，the two polynomial f and g in the ring are
expressed as follows
f( x) = f0 + f1( x) +… + fn－1xn－1，g( x) = g0 + g1( x) + … + fn－
1xn－1，k ∈ Ｒ，
Define the following operations:
k · f( x) = kf0 + kf1x+ …kfn－1xn－1

Private Key Generation
In this scheme, the encryption public key is h (x), the decryption
private key is f (x) and fp (x). The selection method is as follows:
f( x) ·g( x) = 0 mod q
f( x) ·fq( x) = 1 mod q
h( x) = fq( x) + 1
The public key is ( h( x) ，g( x) ), and the private key is ( f( x) ，fp( x) ).

h.cash
21

Encryption process
In the scheme, the random error polynomial is introduced when
encrypting, e( x)∈ Ψα,
Ψα is a Gaussian distribution with the parameter α, and the
plaintext is converted to the polynomial m( x). The ciphertext is:
c( x) = h( x)·m( x) + g( x) ·e( x)

Decryption process
The received ciphertext is c (x), and the steps for decrypting the
ciphertext using the private key f (x) and fp (x) are as follows:
α( x) = f( x) ·c( x)
= f( x) ·h( x) ·m( x) + f( x) ·g( x)·e( x)
=［f( x) ·fq( x) + f( x) ］·m( x) + f( x) ·g( x) ·e( x) mod q (1)
= f (x) · m (x)
Fp (x) · α (x) = fp (x) · f (x) · m (x) mod p = m (x)

(2)

In the decryption process of steps (1) and (2), there may be a
decryption failure. When the coefficient of step (1) is not in the
interval (- q2, q 2) or Step (2) coefficient is not in the interval (- p2, p
2), there will be decryption failure. But as long as the selection of
the appropriate parameters, the possibility of decryption failure is
still very small. We also can be use the algorithm similar to NTRU
to avoid decryption failure.

h.cash
22

Hcash will develop a Ring-LWE key exchange protocol that
works with OpenSSL to achieve post-quantum secure in
blockchain.

1.6 Handy. Limited Blockchain with Unlimited
Transaction
The DAG technology itself is not based on blocks and therefore is
not subject to block validation time constraints (for example, the
confirmation time for Bitcoin is 10 minutes and for Ethereum is 15
seconds). In its auditing procedure Hcash system is designed to
take into consideration the interaction between DAG-based
blockchain system thus some of the advantages of DAG will be
reflected by Hcash. The confirmation time of the transaction in the
Hcash system is almost instantaneous. As DAG is not based on
block, there is no so-called block size limit. In theory, the amount of
transactions that can be accommodated per unit of time is very
large (HTPS, Hyper Transaction Per Second). At the same time,
Hcash needs to consider interaction with block-based blockchain
systems. Therefore it is possible for Hcash to realize a mass
number of transactions per unit time under a limited block volume.
That is the real realization of the "HyperCash" function.

h.cash
23

1.7 Haven. Limited Token Supply
Hcash has a finite supply of tokens. The supply closes to 84
million, and will be separated into six channels:
•

21 million (25%) will be created by PoW;

•

21 million (25%) will be created by PoS;

•

ICO and free distribution will account for 21 million (25%);

•

Pre-ICO investors will hold 12.6 million (15%);

•

4.2 million (5%) will belong to the development team & Hcash
fund,

•

4.2 million (5%) will be allocated to Hcash-DAO.

h.cash
24

Hcash addresses are divided into white and black addresses,
corresponding to the transparent address of Zcash and Whitebyte
of Byteball, and the Z-Add of Zcash and Blackbyte of Byteball,
respectively. Hcash users can convert their white addresses to
black addresses or vice versa within their own wallets, provided
that the total number of Hcash tokens remains the same. In the
system default definition, the 21 million tokens generated by the
PoS stream will all go to the dark address. We call this part of the
currency Hidden coin. Similarly, the 21 million tokens generated by
the PoW stream will also go to the dark address as Hidden coin.
For the remaining 50% of the other Hcash, all will go to the white
address, including the portion from the ICO and free distribution,
early investors, development team and Hcash Foundation holdings
and Hcash-DAO. The token can be changed across the two
opposite side (white to black or black to white) during the
conversion between different systems or transmission between
different users.

2. Development Roadmap
As Hcash is focused on building new technical standards and
redefining the value, the technical challenges are unprecedented.
The expected development roadmap is shown as below:

h.cash
26

Hcash and Hshare
Since it takes time to implement Hcash code and feature
development, after the end of the ICO all investors will get Hshare
which is based on current mature UTXO blockchain as a token
first. After the Hcash main line is on the line, you can redeem any
Hshare exchange or Hcash official team with Hcash on any on-line
Hshare exchange. And after about 10 months to complete all the
acceptance and replacement. The Hcash team will use technical
means to destroy all Hshare. All Hshare will be permanently
destroyed after the deadline. Hshare's open source code Under
Hcash's GitHub page, everyone can read and review the source
code for Hshare and confirm that the total number of Hsahre
releases is the same as the Hcash number specified in the Hcash
white paper.

3. Project Risk and Risk Management
3.1 Related risks of Hcash project
Policy risk
At present, although many governments hold a positive attitude
and encouragement policy towards blockchain-related industries,
there are still many uncertainties due to the decentralization
property of public blockchain and the existing centralized
government regulations.

The management team will use the following ways to manage the
policy risk:
•

The team will set up a separate public relation department,
which will actively communicate with the government and
industry practitioners, and to cooperate in the legal framework
for the design of digital asset issuance / trading / financial
blockchain / blockchain applications and related business.

•

The Hcash does not involve currency exchange business. But
the team will not interfere with third-party exchange to carry out
Hcash trading business with existing currency. Hcash team only
focus on technology.

h.cash
28

Market risk
The ultimate goal of Hcash is to achieve the value of the
decentralized free flow in the blockchain system. But since the
blockchain industry has just emerged, the future of the project will
face a variety of market tests.
The operation team will use the following ways to manage the
market risk:
The Hcash operation team will regularly participate in industry
meetings and regularly or occasionally hold project progress and
conference to communicate with relevant developers regarding the
current market needs and prospects. This can ensure that the
project is able to respond to the community and market voices.

Technical risk
Hcash will establish a cross-platform new technical standard,
which is a very difficult task in terms of technology development.
Therefore, it requires top technical talents and large research
involvement. If the control is not good, it will definitely affect the
progress of the project and even eventually lead to the failure of the
project.

h.cash
29

The operation team will use the following ways to manage the
technical risk:
Closely rely on the top domestic and foreign universities and the
blockchain community, and to build blockchain technology
innovation joint laboratories with top universities. The Foundation
will also regularly allocate funds to support the Hcash community
and collaborates with other blockchain communities to ensure that
the project technical risks can be controlled.

Financial risk
Financial risk refers to the significant loss of project fund, such as:
fund stolen, development progress incompletion within the
scheduled time because of personnel and financial problems and
so on.

The operation team will use the following ways to manage the
financial risk:
All large amount of digital currency storage are multi-signature
wallet + cold storage by the Foundation directors. In the 3/5
multi-signature mode, we can effectively reduce the risks of fund
stolen and privately misappropriation.
