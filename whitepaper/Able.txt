00 VISION
The ABLE project will create a solution to problems with traditional
bank lending-deposit spreads, and nontransparent and centralized
cryptocurrency financial services, basing the solution on the
transparency and reliability of a blockchain system. The ABLE
project is the cryptocurrency-specific financial solution that provides
cryptocurrency financial products through person-to-person loanmatching systems and decentralized exchanges.
The ABLE project will create a platform that enables cryptocurrencybased financial activities to center around the ABLE account,
emanating from the fact that banking activities are carried out primarily
through bank accounts. Users propose loan interest rates through a
matching system, eliminating the lending-deposit spread by directly
connecting users on a peer-to-peer basis. The ABLE project supports
decentralized exchanges and provides decentralized cryptocurrency
wealth management services through smart contracts. Ultimately the
project aims to evolve into the ABLE Ecosystem through its integration
with external systems, including simple payments.

Decentralized Cryptocurrency Platform

FIG. BASIC STRUCTURE OF ABLE

ABLE PROJECT:
DECENTRALIZED
CRYPTOCURRENCY
PLATFORM

The ABLE project has been proposed to provide an alternative to banks’ conventional lendingdeposit spread structure, and to solve problems with initial cryptocurrency banking services.
1) Banks have a business model based on a lending-deposit spread (i.e., the difference between
lending and deposit interest rates), in which the bank acts as an intermediary between depositors
and borrowers. This structure allows banks to receive deposits at low interest rates and lend
money at high rates, profiting from the difference.
2) Existing cryptocurrency-based banking services are provided through a centralized structure.
The combination of unsustainably high interest rates and centralized services renders banks
directly vulnerable to managers’ moral hazard and the hacking of central servers. The lack of
integrated solutions in the crypto market withholds users from experiencing diverse banking
services.

FIG. CONVENTIONAL BANK
LENDING-DEPOSIT SPREAD

FIG. ABSENCE OF INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS IN THE CRYPTO MARKET

The ABLE project aims to solve these problems by applying decentralized blockchain technology.
By developing a matching engine that connects investors and borrowers on a peer-to-peer
basis, the project directly connects investors and borrowers without any intermediaries. With
intermediaries and lending spreads eliminated, cryptocurrency interest rates will be determined
by mutual agreement between users in a free market, and said rates will serve as market interest
rates. Investors can receive higher interests than they would in a centralized market, while
borrowers can lend money at lower rates, creating a win-win scenario. Since investing and
lending occur governed by smart contracts, the project will eliminate exposure to managers’
moral hazard and the risk of central-server hacking.
Current cryptocurrency banking services provide deposits and loans separately rather than
linking depositors and borrowers. The services have shortcomings such as inability to provide
high deposit interest rates in a sustainable way. Such services cannot mitigate or eliminate
intermediary risks because their structure is based on a centralized model. On the other hand, the
ABLE project directly links users, primarily through an account, and enables a variety of financial
activities such as payroll and investment, based on smart contracts.
The ABLE project primarily aims to apply decentralized blockchain technology to financial and
wealth management features; to directly link demand and supply through an account on a
peer-to-peer basis; and to establish a reliable system. It aims subsequently to build an in-house
decentralized exchange, and then to evolve into a platform on which to develop and use smart
contracts for finance and wealth management services.

BACKGROUNDS
TRADITIONAL BANK
LENDING-DEPOSIT SPREAD
AND CRYPTOCURRENCY
BANKING BUSINESS
MODEL

Traditional banks serve as intermediaries and profit from differences between deposit and loan
markets (lending-deposit spreads). The ABLE project will create a system that enables investors
and borrowers to share the value generated by eliminating such intermediaries.
Currently, cryptocurrency banking businesses provide piecemeal services such as high-yield
deposits and loans involving intermediary risks. The ABLE project creates a sustainable business
model that enables direct account-based linking of users through smart contracts, and through
decentralization solves the problems of managers’ moral hazard and the hacking of central
servers.

2.1 MARKET SIZE OF
BANK LENDING-DEPOSIT SPREADS

FIG. LENDING-DEPOSIT SPREAD OF 2016

FIG. BANK PROFITS FROM
INTEREST INCOME AND NON-INTEREST-RATE INCOME

As of 2017, the average deposit-lending spread of banks was recorded at about 6%, thus explaining
the 80% of their gross income. The non-interest income (e.g., service charges, trusts, securities,
foreign-exchange income), on the other hand held a small proportion of 20%.
The decentralization of financial businesses eliminates operational risks that occur during bank
operations. Since investors are directly linked to borrowers without banks as their intermediaries,
they can use services without being burdened by banks’ operational risks.
2.2 CASE STUDIES OF
CRYPTOCURRENCY
BANKING SERVICES

2.2.1 CASE STUDY OF LOAN BROKER RISK: SALT

FIG. SALT MULTI-SIGNATURE WALLET STRUCTURE AND INTERMEDIARY RISK

SALT is a banking service cryptocurrency solution that lends money in fiat currency backed by
cryptocurrency as collateral. Using the multi-signature technology that only allows a withdrawal
with the signatures of both intermediaries and borrowers, this solution alleviates intermediary
risk and thus distinguishes itself from existing solutions. However, the SALT structure stipulates
that without signatures, users cannot receive ownership of cryptocurrencies in return. While
the platform uses smart contracts, until it becomes decentralized it cannot be an ideal solution
to intermediary problems. Most lending platforms are also vulnerable to managers’ moral hazard
because intermediaries retain customers’ cryptocurrency assets.
2.2.2 PONZI-SCHEME TYPE CRYPTOCURRENCY DEPOSITS
There are cryptocurrency deposit services in the form of Ponzi schemes that pay unsustainably
high deposit interest rates. These services attracted customers by providing interest rates as high
as 10% per month in the six months following launch. The Government of the United Kingdom has
imposed sanctions on Ponzi-type fraudulent cryptocurrency financial services. Ponzi-scheme
type cryptocurrency services that collect money on an arbitrage profit-sharing model also have
emerged.
2.2.3 CONCLUSION FROM ANALYSIS OF CASE STUDIES OF
CRYPTOCURRENCY BANKING SERVICES
Cryptocurrency banking services are still in their infancy and do not have established business
models. Most attempts to solve their problems have separated deposits from loans. This
mechanism was not sustainable under the weight of high deposit rates and failed to solve the
intermediary-risk problem caused by centralization.
The ABLE project aims to create a solution to existing problems and a better system through the
investing-lending matching engine and various financial services that provide account-based links
between investors and borrowers.

ABLE
PROJECT:
FINANCIAL
SERVICES

The ABLE project, in its initial stages, provides: 1) investing/lending – investing-lending matching
engine; 2) payroll and credit score/ loan – cryptocurrency salary- payment service and credit
scores to support loans; 3) simplified payment and remittance service – simplified account
address service and reserve remittance; and 4) investment – account-based Initial Coin Offering
(ICO) investment governed by a smart contract. The project offers an account-based finance
experience that encompasses, loans, remittance, payroll, and investment.

3.1 ABLE INVESTING/
LENDING MATCHING
ENGINE

FIG. EXAMPLE OF INVESTING-LENDING MATCHING-ENGINE-BASED ORDER BOOK-INTERFACE

The fundamental principle of decentralization is to share value among actual participants while
eliminating unnecessary intermediaries in a given business model. The matching engine that
directly links investors and borrowers on a peer-to-peer basis allows investors and borrowers
to share actual value. Whereas in the traditional banking system, banks determine deposit and
lending rates as intermediaries, the ABLE investing-lending matching engine allows a variety of
investors and borrowers to participate in the process of determining appropriate rates.
Since the existing cryptocurrency banking market tended to focus on either deposits or loans, it
was difficult to secure sufficient liquidity and trading volume. However, the market that enables
direct linking on a peer-to-peer basis can increase liquidity and trading volume. Generating
great amounts of various currency data made available to users, such as cryptocurrency shortterm rates, long-term rates, and trading volume, reduces volatility and helps create a stable
cryptocurrency market environment.

3.1.1 INVESTING-LENDING MATCHING ENGINE AND SMART CONTRACT

Investing

Investing

FIG. INVESTING-LENDING MATCHING ENGINE AND SMART-CONTRACT PRODUCTION

Investing

FIG. INVESTING-LENDING MATCHING ALGORITHM

An order book for investing and lending is created based on investing and lending demand from
users. Once an invest or lending transaction is carried out based on the order book, a smart
contract is created to execute the investment or the loan. The borrower’s cryptocurrency will
be set up as collateral and the contracted loan will be given. Then the investor will receive
corresponding interests.
3.1.2 INVESTING-LENDING MATCHING-ENGINE PRODUCTS
Investing-lending matching-engine products are created to increase liquidity and trading
volume. Offering too many products prevents banks from securing sufficient liquidity and trading
volume, and offering too few prevents them from meeting various demands. Considering that
the cryptocurrency market cycle is shorter than the cycles of traditional financial markets, the
solution will include products with relatively shorter cycles in its initial stages.
We plan to increase the number of cryptocurrencies supported (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin) just as the
Atomic Swap feature is introduced.

3.1.3 INVESTING-LENDING MATCHING-ENGINE BUSINESS MODEL
The entire investment process—investment money transfer, interest payment, and investment
return at maturity—is carried out through smart contracts.
Collateralization of cryptocurrency, loan payment, and interest payment are also carried out
through smart contracts. Users can invest any cryptocurrency set up as collateral in mutual funds
listed on the ABLE network and various investment products, but cannot make withdrawals. Any
investments made by cryptocurrency collateral can be automatically liquidated through smart
contracts to preserve the value of collateral, in case value of the investments declines.
If the asset set up as collateral is PoS(Proof of Stake), users can use external master node
services based on a smart contract.

3.2 CRYPTOCURRENCY
PAYROLL AND CREDIT
SCORE/LOAN

FIG. INVESTING-LENDING MATCHING ALGORITHM

GMO, a Japanese Internet-based conglomerate, has paid some of its employee salaries in
cryptocurrency. Growing interest in the cryptocurrency industry is expected to result in an
increase in payments in cryptocurrency for some salaries or project costs.
Typically, loans are divided into secured loans backed by assets, and credit loans based on
income. Currently, there are only few credit-loan services in the cryptocurrency space, because
salary payment in cryptocurrency has received little consideration. However, as more salary
payments are made in cryptocurrency, credit lending based on cryptocurrency also becomes
possible. Salaries can be paid based on project progress or hours of work done, and credit
assessment and credit lending can be serviced based on cumulative salary-payment data.
3.2.1 SALARY PAYMENT SMART CONTRACT
Personal labor can be assessed largely based on hours of work and performance. Initially, the
salary payment system will focus on assessing hours of work. Then salaries can be paid on a
yearly, monthly, or weekly basis.
3.2.2 CREDIT ASSESSMENT
Credit assessment can rest on the fact that blockchain data cannot be manipulated. In initial
stages, credit scores are generated based on the history of completion of salary-payment smart
contracts and consistency of cryptocurrency income. Then, based on the credit scores, the
option to allow salary advance payments will be added. Credit scores will be refined by creditassessment technology based on big data and external credit-score data.
3.2.3 CREDIT LOAN BASED ON SMART CONTRACT FOR SALARY PAYMENT
Adding the option of making a credit loan to the cryptocurrency salary payment system allows
users to take out a credit loan based on existing smart contracts for salary payment, using the
credit-score data within the account.

3.3 CONVENIENT CRYPTOCURRENCY ADDRESS AND
SCHEDULED REMITTANCE
SERVICE

FIG. EXAMPLE OF CONVENIENT ABLE ACCOUNT ADDRESS

The address lengths of cryptocurrencies are typically 34 characters for Bitcoin and 65 characters
for Ethereum, to prevent hash collisions and hacking. However, a remittance service that requires
long addresses is a hassle for users. Making cryptocurrency remittance more accessible means
making cryptocurrency addresses convenient, a principle similar to that by which web-based
applications use easily remembered domain URLs instead of IP addresses.
We provide convenient addresses within the ABLE account to boost remittance activities,
including small-amount payments. Additionally, we provide the option that allows users to cancel
remittance at any time before the reserved time through the scheduled remittance service.

3.4 ACCOUNT-BASED ICO
SMART CONTRACT

Investing

FIG. ABLE-ACCOUNT-BASED ICO SMART CONTRACT

Currently, solutions must provide a variety of data for KYC/AML(Know-Your-Customer/Anti Money
Laundering) to be effective in ICO. Files and personal data can be stored in the ABLE account
through encryption so that users can invest in ICO on the ABLE account using personal data and
an ICO smart contract.

ABLE
ECOSYSTEM
DEVELOPMENT PLAN

The ABLE Ecosystem largely comprises the ABLE account and support for third parties providing
finance, wealth management, and micropayment services. We will add the decentralized
exchange (DEX) feature to store smart contracts based on various cryptocurrencies. Operating
on DEX, we will distribute the framework to allow production of wealth management and
finance smart contracts, creating an environment where a wide array of product developers can
develop financial products. Thus, users can access a variety of financial products, and through
API development the ABLE project can evolve into a cryptocurrency finance platform and an
ecosystem enabling communication, including micropayment, with outside parties.

4.1 ABLE DEX
Investment

Financial

FIG. ABLE DEX

We need a decentralized exchange through which cryptocurrency assets can be traded in order
to develop wealth management and finance smart contracts. Currently, most cryptocurrency
investments are made through arbitrage trading at centralized exchanges or ICO participation
with personal wallets. However, through ABLE DEX, we can eliminate the risks of centralized
exchanges and allow for wealth management.
Through the ABLE account, we can create a platform that makes a variety of investment products
accessible. On the ABLE network, we will create an environment where various smart contracts
and Decentralized Applications (DApps) can enable the development of the ABLE Ecosystem.

4.2 ABLE FINANCIAL
PRODUCTS

Financial Template

FIG. ABLE FINANCIAL SMART-CONTRACT TEMPLATE AND FRAMEWORK

Utilizing various smart-contract frameworks and templates, users can develop cryptocurrency
investment products. Using these templates, financial-product developers can create a variety of
wealth management and finance smart contracts without having to learn difficult programming
languages. Users can access various investment products through the ABLE account.
4.2.1 SMART CONTRACT FOR WEALTH MANAGEMENT
We develop the smart contract frameworks necessary to manage funds, such as trading strategy
generators, and portfolio analysis tools. Fund-management service fees will attract investmentproduct developers and create an ecosystem that will:
1) Allow creation of a variety of technical indicator-based trading strategies.
2) Create a systematic wealth management environment by providing smart contracts that enable
portfolio construction and performance analysis tools.
4.2.2 FINANCE SMART CONTRACT
While the investing-lending matching engine carries out most loans, demand for various financial
services will be met through finance smart contracts that include long-term loans, large-amount
loans, P2P loans, secured loans, and credit loans.
Secured loans, and credit loans based on external ABLE data will be carried out through various
integration mechanisms, following the development of the ABLE main network.
Initially, ABLE will produce finance smart contracts; then ABLE will gradually provide an
environment in which various financial-product developers can produce finance smart contracts
based on the finance smart contract framework.

4.3 MICROPAYMENT/
THIRD PARTY

A big portion of financial activities such as credit-card payments, automatic transfers of utility and
service charges, and mileage programs will be integrated into the cryptocurrency space.
Extending the scope of practical application based on a variety of partnerships with third-party
services, including micropayment, will strengthen the ABLE ecosystem. In the future, a majority of
economic activities will be integrated into the cryptocurrency space by cryptocurrency finance.

All the services of the ABLE system will operate on smart contracts based ABLE User and ABLE
Account. The ABLE User can have one or more ABLE accounts, depending on the purpose. The
ABLE User data includes user information, a list of accounts held, fund/loan subscription details,
payment history, and creditworthiness. The ABLE Account encompasses deposit account, loan
account, collateral account, free account, fund/finance account, and credit score. Each ABLE
Account includes account information, account holder, account number, password, e-mail
address linked to the account, account type, deposit coin, and balance.
Upon creation of the ABLE account, the user can transfer and withdraw money through the ABLE
free account, and utilize various products based on smart contracts.

5.3.1 ABLE COIN/ABLE DOLLAR
ABLE currency consists of ABLE Coin and ABLE Dollar. ABLE Coin is used as a service charge for
using the ABLE system, and ABLE Dollar is used for interest payment. ABLE Coin and ABLE Dollar
can be exchanged.
5.3.2 ISSUING ABLE COIN/ABLE DOLLAR
The amount of ABLE coins initially issued is 25 billion, and the token decimal unit is 18. Validation
nodes will be operated on a PoS basis. The additional inflation rate through initial PoS-based
operation is 15%, which will converge into 5% in the long run. Of the outstanding tokens, 15 billion
will be distributed to the general public and 10 billion will be assigned to related parties.
The initial amount of ABLE Dollar issued is 1 billion. To ensure minimum volatility, no additional
ABLE Dollar will be issued.

5.4 ABLE CONSENSUS
PROTOCOL

ABLE adopts the PoS consensus protocol. The minimum number of ABLE coins preserved to
operate validation nodes will be 20 million.

6.1. ARCHITECTURE OF
ABLE SYSTEM

The development of ABLE system goes through three stages. At the first stage, we first develop
ABLE account, investing-lending matching, and convenient cryptocurrency address services
through solidity-based ABLE smart contract technology on the Ethereum blockchain and then
provide ABLE service through the ABLE web page. At the second stage, we develop ABLE DEX
and design various ABLE financial products that interact with ABLE smart contracts and provide
them to users through the web page. At the final stage, we create a dedicated blockchain main
network for ABLE that allows us to provide credit services and personalized financial products by
gathering and analyzing user patterns of using financial products.

The ABLE system has the following architecture: it is made up of infrastructure layers, ABLE
framework layers, and application layers, and members have limited access to the respective
layers depending on their access level.

INFRASTRUCTURE
The layer consists of blockchain systems for managing shared log and executing smart contracts.
In the initial stages of the ABLE project, Ethereum blockchain will be used and then replaced
by dedicated ABLE blockchain. In the infrastructure layer, ABLE accounts, investing-lending
matching engines, the DEX, and cryptocurrency gateways are designed, forming the foundation of
the ABLE system. Access to the infrastructure layer is limited to the ABLE system, but the layer is
maintained and repaired at the request of users.

ABLE FRAMEWORK
The framework provides cryptocurrency gateways and the DEX to allow for exchange of
cryptocurrencies between different blockchain systems and offers finance solutions for investinglending matching engines and ABLE products. Smart contracts of ABLE financial products are
designed based on their characteristics. Access to the framework layer is limited to the ABLE
system which validates and distributes such financial products.

ABLE APPLICATION
The application introduces how to transfer money, create an account and use products designed
based on smart contracts and delivers user requests to the framework. Using account smart
contracts, users can create their own ABLE account, transfer money, and use financial products
through distributed product smart contracts. The application layer provides web sites and
smartphone apps for users to easily use the ABLE system. Access to the application layer is also
given to users, and they can access the ABLE finance and financial products through the web and
applications.

FIG. ABLE SYSTEM LAYER

The figure below represents the structure of the ABLE system, which will be realized on ABLE
blockchain, and the API relationships among the layers. Users can use the ABLE system through
the website and mobile applications in the ABLE application layer. All the actions requested by
users are delivered to the ABLE Framework through public APIs, and smart contracts are called at
such requests. All requests among smart contracts within the ABLE framework layer are carried
out through protected API. The ABLE system builds finance and account smart contracts which
are responsible for ABLE account-related processing, transfer, and remittance transactions. Then
smart contracts are designed to provide services for investments, loans, and financial product
transactions. The ABLE infrastructure layer manages all smart contract codes working on the
ABLE framework and users’ account transaction details, remittance details, and financial product
details in blockchain. The ABLE blockchain learns users’ service details through big data analysis
and recommends financial products tailored to users’ patterns.

FIG. ABLE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

6.2. APIs OF ABLE SYSTEM

Since the ABLE system architecture is layered, and levels of access vary depending on the layer,
all respective layers and components communicate through standard-based ABLE APIs. The
respective APIs are divided into public API, protected API, and private API, and levels of access to
respective APIs are divided into users and the ABLE system.

PUBLIC API

REQUEST_DEPOSIT(COIN TYPE, AMOUNT)
Used when users deposit cryptocurrency money. Deposits are made based on the type and the
amount of coins deposited.
REQUEST_WITHDRAW(COIN TYPE, DESTINATION ADDRESS, AMOUNT)
Used when users withdraw cryptocurrency money. Withdrawals are made based on the type of
cryptocurrency withdrawn, the address of cryptocurrency to receive, and the amount of coins.
REQUEST_TRANSFER(SOURCE COIN TYPE, DESTINATION COIN TYPE,
DESTINATION ADDRESS, AMOUNT)
Used when users transfer cryptocurrency money between accounts. Transfers are made based
on the type of cryptocurrency transferred, the address to transfer cryptocurrency to, and the
amount of coins. Exchange between different cryptocurrencies will be made at the exchange
rates and service charges set by the ABLE system.
REQUEST_SMARTCONTRACT(COIN TYPE, PRODUCT ADDRESS, AMOUNT,
PARAMETERS)
Used when users apply for financial products. Request for financial products is made based
on the type of cryptocurrency sent, the address of the smart contract for chosen products, and
quantities.

PROTECTED API

START_SMARTCONTRACT (COIN TYPE, SOURCE ADDRESS, SMARTCONTRACT
ADDRESS, AMOUNT, PARAMETERS)
When users request financial products, it sends the type and the amount of coins requested for
the smart contract in question. When the smart contract expires or Stop_Fund occurs, End_Fund
will be executed.
STOP_SMARTCONTRACT (COIN TYPE, SOURCE ADDRESS, SMARTCONTRACT
ADDRESS)
When users cancel financial products, the coins put into the product will be returned through
smart contracts. Interim payments will be made under the agreement for the product.
END_SMARTCONTRACT (COIN TYPE, DESTINATION ADDRESS, AMOUNT)
When smart contracts expire or are terminated, the result will be sent based on the type of
products to the account of users who requested the products.
EXCHANGE_COIN(SOURCE COIN TYPE, DESTINATION COIN TYPE, AMOUNT,
SOURCE ADDRESS, DESTINATION ADDRESS)
Used for transfer of cryptocurrency between accounts or used to exchange cryptocurrency when
smart contracts expire.
SET_SMARTCONTRACT(SMARTCONTRACT NAME, SMARTCONTRACT
DESCRIPTION, SMARTCONTRACT ADDRESS)
Used when registering financial product smart contracts designed with the ABLE system. The
product thus registered is made accessible to users through the application layer.
DELETE_SMARTCONTRACT(SMARTCONTRACT NAME)
Used to delete any expired financial product smart contracts.

PRIVATE API

ETHEREUM APIs
These APIs are fundamental to the Ethereum blockchain, and the ABLE Framework is created
using Ethereum APIs. Ethereum APIs are called by requests.
ABLE APIs
These APIs are dedicated ABLE blockchain APIs and basically include the same functions as
Ethereum APIs. They include additional APIs that can process personal data and details of
customers that are difficult to register with the public Ethereum blockchain.

6.3. ABLE COIN
ON ABLE SYSTEM

ABLE coins are designed to maintain the ABLE system and used by vendors. When a new
financial product smart contract is registered with the ABLE framework, ABLE coins are used
as a Gas fee, which is a registration fee. Thus to release new financial products, ABLE coins
should be continuously purchased from users and vendors, and the continuous purchase of
ABLE coins to maintain the system prevents dumping of ABLE coins. Next, when users exchange
cryptocurrencies through the ABLE DEX, ABLE coins are used as service charges. Lastly, users
can use ABLE coins to pay for products or services offered by ABLE vendors.

produces a wide array of services including finance, investment products, and payment that the
user can utilize, and receives service charges. The master-nodes ensure stability in operating
a decentralized ABLE network based on PoS consensus algorithms, and receive networktransaction service charges.

CONCLUSION
Investing

FIG. ABLE ECOSYSTEM SCHEME

The ultimate goal of ABLE is to provide users with a great user experience, while simultaneously
allocating value to ABLE through all the benefits described above. In finance, the project aims
to create a systematic ecosystem and develop a better user-accessible system by applying
blockchain technology to any area deemed necessary. ABLE intends to integrate into one system
all the financial solutions currently dispersed across the blockchain market, by offering a solution
to existing banks’ problems, and an alternative to centralized deposit-lending systems.
The P2P investing-lending system, which is the core of the ABLE project, is particularly significant
because it creates personalized accounts for cryptocurrency assets. Existing micropayment and
fund solutions suffer from numerous shortcomings due to the lack of an integrated account, and
users have substantial trouble using those solutions. Additional solutions will be created in the
integrated system to provide various services to users through their account designed for them.
The ABLE project aims to improve accessibility for the general public to easily use institutionalgrade products with low service charges and high returns on investments, as well as low lending
rates, by utilizing the benefits of blockchain technology. Personal accounts will enable users to
receive transparent services difficult to earn through personal wallets. Through the account and
micropayment system, cryptocurrencies can be used to make actual payments, and users can
participate in smart contract-based financial products. Financial products provided by ABLE offer
increased access to products in which individuals have difficulty making investments. ABLE plans
to allow users to use products to which access is typically limited, such as the presale of unlisted
coins with relatively high minimum-investment amounts; and intends to provide users with the
opportunity to actually utilize cryptocurrencies.
By applying blockchain technology to various financial services, such as depositing
cryptocurrency, using cryptocurrency coins in real life, and making investments with
cryptocurrency, we will create a system that meets the expectations of those anticipating the
fourth industrial revolution in this age of blockchain.
