The Celsius Wallet
The Celsius Wallet will be one of the only online crypto wallets designed to allow members to use coins as
collateral to get a loan in dollars, and in the future, to lend their crypto to earn interest on deposited coins (when
they’re lent out).

Crypto Collateral
Members will be able to borrow USD against their
crypto holdings in their wallet which will be used as
collateral. Our goal is to allow anyone who’s in need
of cash to easily borrow from the Celsius platform
without having to sell their crypto holdings. The ability
to take loans in dollars against your cryptocurrency
will be available after the Celsius tokens are issued.

Crypto Interest
In the future, through the Celsius Network,
cryptocurrencies deposited by members into their
Celsius Wallet will earn POS fees and be available on the
network for immediate borrowing and shorting for a
fee. Coins that are lent from member wallets or used as
POS collateral will begin to accrue interest in the form of
Celsius Tokens (CEL), allowing members to earn up to 9%
annual interest*.

* This functionality is not yet available and will be rolled out in future. This functionality may be conditional on
regulatory approvals, which Celsius will obtain as a condition for rolling out these features.

Introducing: The Celsius Token (CEL)
In conjunction with the launch of the Celsius Crypto Wallet, we’re excited to introduce the Celsius Token
(CEL). After our Token Generation Event, members will be able to use their CEL tokens to secure access
to loans in dollars using their crypto as collateral. In the future, members who deposit coins in their
Celsius Wallets will also be able to earn CEL Tokens as a reward for lending to the network.
We’re designing CEL (ERC20 Token) to be the backbone of the Celsius Network, creating
a value-driven lending and borrowing platform for all our members.
The Celsius Token (CEL), at the moment of the Token Generation Event (TGE), will have utilities including:
• the ability to become a member in the Celsius platform and community
• the ability to deposit your cryptocurrencies in the Celsius wallet
• the ability to apply for dollar loans with cryptocurrencies as collateral
• the ability to pay interest on these loans at a discount
In the future, the CEL token will have additional utilities including:
• allowing members to lend cryptocurrencies in order to gain interest
• achieving seniority in the platform which will impact the interest rate gained
• get interest rewards on cryptocurrencies lended

Celsius’ community will continue to grow as more
and more people are able to get loans in dollars
using their crypto as collateral or as they lend
their unused coins as credit to other members.
Crypto assets holders can get more CEL tokens the
more they loan and borrowers pay less to hedge
their positions. As more people join the Celsius
ecosystem, the more everyone benefits.

Banking is Broken
Celsius is driven to create a financial platform where your interests are our top priority.

1

Sometimes You Just Need Cash
Members may be holding crypto, but now they need to buy a car or pay down
expensive credit card debt. Unfortunately, most car dealerships or banks still don’t
want cryptocurrency. We believe crypto assets hold real value, and it should be
easy for crypto holders to leverage this value to borrow cash.

Crypto Collateral = Cash in Hand
We want to make borrowing cash a whole lot easier. Celsius’ goal is to allow its
members to use their crypto holdings as collateral in order to secure low interest
loans in dollars. Rather than selling their crypto (pay taxes and forfeit potential
future gains), with Celsius they can leverage their cryptocurrency to borrow the
cash they need today, while still maintaining their crypto portfolio for future
value.

2

Wallets Without Interest, Nobody Wins
Anyone with cryptocurrency sitting in cold storage or on some exchange or wallet,
is earning exactly zero interest. We believe there should be a way for crypto
holders to HODL coins while still leveraging their crypto assets and helping other
crypto holders.

Crypto Interest
By depositing coins on the Celsius Network, crypto asset holders will be able to

earn up to 9% interest for their lent coins. We plan to offer a large array of lending
options, from one-day to one-year contracts, all with highly competitive interest
rates. With Celsius, members will be able to easily earn interest on their crypto
assets the same way they earn on the savings in the bank - but with much better
rates.

The 99% Not The 1%
Most financial institutions still don’t get cryptocurrency. They want to short the
market because they’re blinded by being so late to the party on this one. Right
now, there’s no good place for them to go to bet against the cryptocurrency
market other than expensive futures markets like the CME and centralized
exchanges.

Sure, Go ahead and short
Hedge funds, family offices and crypto funds still want to play in the world of
cryptocurrency. Fortunately for us, they are willing to pay high fees to do so,
so many of them want to short the market. After the Token Generation Event is
completed, we will begin working on our platform that will allow us to make the
most of their greed by taking up to 50% cash deposits and charging them interest
when they hedge. This lets us pass most of the earnings back to the community
and lend more dollars to the rest of the Celsius community.

Cryptocurrency prices are volatile, and we get
that. Like any market, prices are going to jump
up and down due to a number of factors. While
many of us are excited about the rising valuations,
some believe many coins are overvalued and are
interested in shorting. With Celsius, we will make
it easy for those people to borrow coins from our
community and short them on the market. Celsius
will never take a position or trade against its coin
holders or Lenders. Our interests are aligned with
our lenders to charge the borrowers looking to
short as much as possible to grow the community.

Members who want to borrow dollars against their crypto coins will be
charged interest below 10% to further grow the community and invite
outside people to buy more crypto.

Let’s Get Into the Tech
“Our platform will be a unique combination of multi-block-chain nodes, auto trading on multiple
exchanges and a high-end user experience. All this is orchestrated by smart predictive algorithms
designed to reduce rates, maximize profits to our members, mitigate risks, and maintain the safety
and growth of the ecosystem.”
Nuke Goldstein — Co-Founder and CTO

Building Every Day
We’re not thinking about a product, we’re building one. Our team
of 10 plus developers has already produced a working prototype of
both our mobile wallet for lenders and our shorting platform for
borrowers. Both products are now being beta tested and we plan
for our initial public release in Fall of 2018.

Technical Specifications
Security and Risk
Celsius is building the platform with security at its core. We will use bank-grade
security to keep our members’ assets and data safe. From multi-factor authentication,
to encryption, to private-key double vaults, and more. Our software is designed with
security in mind.
Crypto assets will be distributed among several wallets and top exchanges. In addition,
we will store a cold wallet treasury to provide last-resort insurance in case of a
catastrophic event. We will also employ white-hat hackers and third party cyber security
solutions to provide a continuous cover layer of audit and protection.

Community Support
We’re here for the cryptocurrency community, our goal is to support the community by
providing them with access to loans using their crypto holdings as collateral and to also
provide the community with a way to earn interest on their crypto assets.

Lending Protection
Members who lend coins on the Celsius Network will be protected by the Celsius lending
protection pool (funded by our fees). Any defaulted lending or coins lost will be insured
through our protection pool and coin values will be restored immediately. The Celsius
wallet will show our cash deposits every day which will also be audited by an outside
accounting firm several times a year.

Compliant & Legal
We adhere to all applicable rules and legal guidelines. We will be working with top-of-theline financial institutions, and will require all members of the Celsius community to go
through KYC (Know Your Customer) in order to comply with anti-terrorism and anti-money
laundering (AML) laws.

Our Fees
Celsius’ model aims to protect its token holders and always do what is in their best
interest by providing the most competitive rates for dollar borrowers, and in the future,
token holders. We will take a variable fee based on the amount of interest charged in each
borrowing transaction. Our members will always receive a minimum of at least 5% annual
interest on any lent crypto currencies. We will not charge account or transaction fees.

Celsius Network: Borrow cash. Earn interest.

Celsius’ Token Economics
We’re building the Celsius Platform to allow our members to deposit, lend and borrow a
variety of different crypto assets. The Celsius Token (CEL) will be key for users who wish to
lend or borrow.
CEL are a platform utility token that is rewarded to crypto holders in the Celsius Wallet as
interest on their coins. That interest is generated from fees, in CEL tokens, collected from
institutional traders who use the assets pool. Celsius has a non-for-profit model where
proceeds are used to cover all costs and membership growth, while most are distributed
back to the members community.
When the token is issued, members who own CEL tokens will be able to apply for and
receive dollar loans against their current holdings. In addition, users who accept the loan
may pay the interest in CEL tokens for a discount.

Celsius’ Token Economics
Our dual-sided system will create a supply and demand cycle between institutional
traders, such as hedge funds, who seek to borrow coins and require the CEL
token to pay the fees and commissions; and the crypto holders around the world
who receive these tokens as interest on their lent coins. This is a much-needed
fundamental service which we believe will help to grow and nourish the cryptoeconomy.

Ok Great, But Do You Really Need a Token?
Yes, we do. Our lending and borrowing model requires a blockchain and an open ledger
technology, it also requires consensus and a global footprint of coin holders in order to really
gain traction and complete our mission.
Any loan we issue may be collected from thousands of individual coin holders which
may be switched at any time. Only a smart contract capable of tracking and paying in
micropayments can handle such complexity. So while we will be starting with allowing
our members to borrow dollars against their crypto, our long term vision is a 2-sided
marketplace for lending and borrowing that will utilize:

Open Ledger :

With the Celsius Platform millions of transactions will be transacted
between borrowers and lenders and an open ledger is the key to transparency on our
platform.

Consensus : Whenever we issue credit or enable members to borrow coins we will
employ the consensus given to us by our members.

Global Footprint : We are building Celsius to be a global decentralized marketplace
that allows lenders from anywhere in the world to earn interest regardless of their base
currency or the local laws they operate under.

*Any excess tokens will be burned after the token sale.

**At launch, there will be 650 million tokens (or slightly less as any tokens not sold will be burned). We are selling 50% of the
tokens (325 million) between the presale and public sale, and will distribute tokens shortly after the close of the public sale.
The additional 50 million tokens will be placed into a smart contract, with 25m tokens being released to the Celsius Treasury
only if the CEL Token price in the secondary market remains above an average of $1.50 for ten (10) days (meaning the price of
CEL has increased 5x from the time of the Crowdsale). And an additional 25,000,000 CEL Tokens will be released only if the
CEL Token price in the secondary market remains above an average of $3.00 for thirty (30) days (meaning the price of CEL has
increased 10x from the time of the Crowdsale).
A couple of things to note about these additional tokens: a) they are released directly to the treasury and not to any
individual or exchange and b) they will be used predominantly to fund new loans (81%) with the remaining 19% used to
incentivize new team members as we grow.
Tokens placed into the Treasury will be used for new loans, and not sold off immediately upon delivery. Rather, Celsius would
only sell off small portions from Treasury to meet the demand for dollar loans on an as-needed basis (i.e. as our USD supply
needs topping up to meet loan demand).

About Celsius
We’ve built companies from the ground up, served hundreds of millions of users and
completed multiple exits for billions of dollars (including an IPO).
This isn’t our first rodeo. Our team of experienced entrepreneurs knows how to take a
concept from ideation to full execution on a global scale.
Our founder, Alex Mashinsky, has filed over 30 patents including the original patent on
VoIP technology. He previously founded several multi-billion dollar businesses including
Arbinet (IPO 2004), Transit-wireless and GroundLink. A cryptoholder since 2013, Alex
serves as an advisor and investor to several Blockchain companies including Sirin Labs,
MicroMoney and Ties Network.

Our Mission
We are building a community of borrowers
and lenders, with the aim of legally
replacing Wall Street with blockchain,
and allow all of our members to benefit
from our ecosystem. Traditional Financial
Institutions should no longer control the
flow of credit to people across the world.
We want to use a consensus-based, Proofof-Stake approach to allow the Celsius
community to borrow, lend and vouch for
each other, creating a truly win-win-win
self-governed solution for people involved
in every step of the credit ecosystem.

Our Mission
Main Street Takes Wall Street
With cash, banks make rich people richer. With crypto, let’s not make the same
mistake.
We are building a community of borrowers and lenders, with the aim of legally replacing
Wall Street with blockchain, and sharing the profits amongst our members. Through
our community pool, members will be able borrow cash using their crypto assets as
collateral after the crowdsale and, in the future, earn interest on their deposited coins
(when lent).

Serious & Sustainable
The Celsius Network is on a long-term mission. We are conducting a crowdsale in
order to achieve our goals: a decentralized network of good actors who will be supported
with loans and credit. We want people to contribute to our crowdsale who not only want
to get loans in dollars using their crypto as collateral but who also believe in our mission
to expand the crypto community and the future of credit on the blockchain.

Over the past 25 years,
we invented and built
trusted marketplaces
for advertising, VoIP,
electricity distribution,
music, information
exchanges and other
markets.

Cash and Crypto Money Flow Overview
This document describes the flow of funds and cryptographic assets within the Celsius Network platform. There
are three key actors in the platform: lenders who commit crypto assets to a lending pool and may request for a
crypto-backed fiat margin loan, borrowers who get leveraged margin trading tools, and the Celsius service which
orchestrates the system using sophisticated algorithms that move crypto and fiat funds as needed and executes
trade orders on several coin exchanges. The Celsius service maintains both fiat custodian accounts and crypto
asset accounts, in addition funds are managed on the coin exchanges in order to provide a quick response time
for trade orders.
The system also creates a supply and demand cycle of the Celsius Token (CEL). The CEL token is used as a fee for
borrowers of crypto assets and rewarded as interest to lenders contributing their assets.

The following diagram provides an overview on the flow of funds and assets between the
key system components and their corresponding internal accounts:
