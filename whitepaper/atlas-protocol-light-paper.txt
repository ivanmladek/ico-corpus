Atlas Protocol Light Paper
Defining blockchain interactive adver tising & marketing

version: 0.9
2018-10-18

Motivation
With the rapid growth of the Blockchain industry we are seeing continuous rollouts of blockchain
projects. However, as of today, there is very little interaction can be done on blockchain other than
balance transfers. Even though we have Smart Contracts that enables Dapps, a good mechanism for
information transferring and discovery is still to be deﬁned.

There are prior attempts trying to solve digital advertising’s problem with Blockchain technology,
however, Blockchain economy has its own advertising problem to be solved. It is impractical to
promote Blockchain projects in Internet since digital advertising industry can not proﬁle Blockchain
addresses and current Blockchain could not support complicated interactions required by advanced
advertising practices.

Hence a better infrastructure is needed to help deﬁne ways of identifying, activating users and
conveying information along with value. Nebulas Labs (Nebulabs) and xGoogler Blockchain Alliance
(xGBA) has jointly incubated Atlas Protocol (ATP) to close this gap in the blockchain ecosystem.
ATP is tasked to build a Blockchain native interactive marketing infrastructure so to enable
information ﬂow freely on chain and also to explore new ways of on-chain interactions.

Protocol
Overview

Atlas Protocol proposed a new Blockchain native media for value ranking and circulation via
advertising. ATP aims to connect advertiser, publishers(e.g, DApps), Blockchain users with on-chain
interactions via Atlas Ads.

TIE

ATR

UDP

Atlas Protocol components includes:
■ Transaction Interactive Element (TIE): Interactive elements build on top of Blockchain transactions
■ Atlas Targeting Rank (ATR): Value ranking mechanism based on on-chain activities
■ User Data Protection & Incentive (UDP): Mechanism to protect user privacy from abuse as well as
include users into the value circulation by rewarding user for engaging in on-chain interactions.

Protocol:
Transaction Interactive Element
In Atlas Protocol, Transaction
Interactive Element (TIE)
deﬁnes a generic structure for
users on Blockchain to
interact with each others
besides transfer transactions.
It is worth noting that TIE also
deﬁnes how one can
proactively reach other
Blockchain users on-chain
with information and
interaction intent.

The protocol itself deﬁnes:
● Generic interaction structures that could be specialized for different scenarios
● TIE data structure and related storage & transportation guidance
● How to Interpret TIE data in end user facing channels
● Smart Contract interfaces for record TIE interaction data on Blockchain

Protocol:
Atlas Targeting Rank

Atlas Targeting Rank (ATR) aims to navigate advertising information in the ever growing Blockchain
network and make sure it reaches the most wanted audience.

Smart Contract

Addr

ATR deﬁnes a value ranking mechanism for addresses that is:

Address A

Address B

● Based on on-chain activities of addresses
● Specialized for advertising
● Used to increase the overall ROI of on-chain promotions

Addr

Every address’ ATR value is updated periodically, and relatedness among user and multiple ad
candidates are calculated dynamically during ad match.

Protocol:
User Data Protection

Atlas Protocol ascertains that
user data belongs to user
themselves, and value user
contributed data through
interaction as their
contribution to the ecosystem
to be rewarded.

AD

Hence in User Data Protection (UDP), the protocol speciﬁes the follow details:
● Ways of using Blockchain technology and other security measures to ensure user data. privacy, including that ATP user proﬁling will not use risky traditional technologies such as
Cookies.
● Mechanism to make sure ATP applications complaint with data protection regulations such as GDPR.
● Guidelines for distributing incentives to user to acknowledge their data contribution.

Use Cases:
Atlas Smartdrop
In the era of Blockchain
advertising, Airdrop is a new
way of promotion that native
to Blockchain, however,
current solutions all rely on
Internet for spreading the
word and does not have good
targeting hence are costly and
ineﬃcient.
With Atlas Smartdrop, one can
rely on ATR for selecting
targeted audience on-chain
base on their need and
proactively reach out to onchain addresses with
information, engagement
intent as well as token
rewards, hence making the
whole process highly eﬃcient,
yields great ROI.

Use Cases:
Atlas SmartVoting

As a third-party technology
platform, Atlas Protocol
product establishes mutual
trust among exchanges,
projects and users. Users
participate in on-chain voting
and get rewards.
Every vote is recorded on
blockchain. On-chain data
analysis makes it possible to
analyze user behaviors and
obtain accurate marketing
information while straying
away from user oﬄine data in
order to protect privacy.
