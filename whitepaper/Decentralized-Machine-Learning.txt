1. Executive Summary
In the era of rapid development in artificial
intelligence and machine learning, data quality
and relevancy are essential to generate usable
applications of high quality and accuracy for
machine learning.
As compared to publicly-accessible data,
privately-held data are more relevant and
timely for machine learning. These private
data are usually untapped and inaccessible as
they are stored in individual electronic devices
such as smartphones, tablets and computers.
Leading technology firms try to access these
private data when individuals are unaware of
or by providing free service to them in return.
Nevertheless, these leading technology firms
can only obtain a portion of the private data,
which are subset of the massive untapped
private data owned by all individuals.

Decentralized Machine Learning (DML)
protocol is designed to expand the reach
to untapped private data and unleash their
potential to facilitate machine learning
development while providing economic
incentives and protecting data privacy.
Machine learning algorithm will be run on
the devices without extracting the data from
the devices, which will be kept within the
devices. Only the machine learning result
will be aggregated with outcomes generated
from other devices to form an unbiased,
comprehensive and accurate crowdsourced
analytics and predictions. Through DML
protocol, both the private data and processing
power for machine learning are decentralized
as algorithms are run directly on individual
devices by utilizing their idle processing power.

Section 1: Executive Summary | www.decentralizedml.com

The quality of the algorithms is as critical
as data quality to generate good usable
applications and conduct accurate predictions
through machine learning. With the belief
in collective intelligence, a machine learning
developer community will be built by means
of establishing a marketplace for talented
developers to list their algorithms for sale. Any
parties, who want to apply usable applications
and conduct predictions through machine
learning, can locate or request suitable
algorithms from the marketplace. Innovation
from the periphery are encouraged and
enormous potential in machine learning
are unleashed through decentralizing the
algorithm development.
To facilitate participations in DML protocol,
economic incentives and a reliable environment
are needed. With the aid of blockchain smart
contract, a distributed trustless system is
created that connects participants of the DML
protocol directly without the need to trust a
centralized third party. It ensures participants,
who successfully contribute their effort such
as allowing algorithms to be run on individual
data, building machine learning algorithms by
developers etc., to be rewarded in DML tokens.

DML protocol is a scalable decentralized
infrastructure that aims to connect potentially
billions of devices and tens of thousands of
developers to facilitate machine learning
development while providing decentralized
ownership of data and artificial intelligence.
Many possibilities will be unlocked through
crowdsourced untapped data and collective
intelligence. We expect and support
innovation from the periphery to promote
unconventional, ground-breaking and diverse
innovations from all over the globe. Such
decentralized machine learning protocol
is too powerful to be controlled by a few
persons, monopoly or oligopoly, hence it
should be owned collectively and allow mass
participation through decentralization. The
whole decentralized DML ecosystem will
keep evolving. The ecosystem allows every
participant to equally and fairly contribute
equally and fairly to the machine learning
development for a better humanity.

3.1.2 Unlock Massive Market
Potential of Untapped Private Data

The internet and availability of big data set are
key elements that lead to the recent tremendous
development in machine learning. In the past
decades, leading technology firms such as
Google, IBM, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft
etc. have already invested heavily in machine
learning research and development. With the
increased interest and investment in machine
learning, established technology firms, startups and research companies continue to
develop and enhance the applications. This
creates the need to acquire more data and
algorithms for machine learning.
According to the research conducted by
International Data Corporation (IDC), it is
expected that the revenue for big data analytics
will grow from US$130 billion in 2016 to over
$210 billion in 20201. IBM also sees the huge
potential in machine learning markets and
predicts a market worth of US$2 trillion over
the next decade.2

Given the existing available data that each
company has collected separately, the market
potential in machine learning and big data
analytics are already predicted to be enormous.
However, these existing available datasets are
just tip of the iceberg. If the untapped private
data, like the bottom of the iceberg, is being
tapped and applied to machine learning, its
market potential and revenue generated can be
even greater than the current market forecasts.
Therefore, we see massive market potential and
significant advancement in machine learning
for our decentralized machine learning
protocol.

Utilize Decentralized and Idle
Processing Power
Nowadays, machine learning is often
conducted through a centralized computer
cluster with limited processing power . If
additional processing power can be utilized
to run more machine learning algorithms, the
market potential is tremendous.
Currently, there are approximately 2.3 billion
smartphones and 2 billion personal computers
that are not fully utilized. This implies that
there is a total of 4.3 billion of electronic
devices with underutilized processing capacity
for machine learning. If DML protocol can
connect the idle processing power of these
devices and build a decentralized magnificent
processor for machine learning, the extra
market revenue predicted to be generated can
be tremendous.

3.3/
Unleash Creativity to Build ML
Algorithms and Models with
Practical Utility
Large corporations are increasingly applying
machine learning in their business According
to Harvard Business Review, global companies
are applying machine learning in anticipating
customer preference, improving media
purchase etc..3 Furthermore, the review also
states that there can be immediate benefits
on revenue generation and cost saving. Giant
corporations like Amazon and Microsoft see
fraud, bad debts and costs are reduced while
enjoying significant increase in revenue and
operational efficiency.4

We see huge potential growth if more
companies can apply machine learning
algorithms and models in their businesses
provided that the initial cost required to acquire
machine learning algorithms and models or
engage outsourced programmers to build
tailor-made algorithms and models becomes
more affordable. We foresee mass adoption
in machine learning in the commercial world
when the associated cost is lower and when the
prediction made by machine learning is more
accurate.

Often only the large corporations can afford
investing huge initial capital and resources to
build in-house machine learning algorithms
or acquire tailor-made ones from consultancy
firms and apply in their own businesses.
Therefore, machine learning applications are
often only found in some large international
corporations rather than local or medium
sizes companies.

Our DML protocol is the solution.

We aim to create a decentralized machine learning protocol and ecosystem, where customers, such
corporate customers, research institutions, government and non-government organizations or
even individuals, who wish to run analytical predictions can acquire appropriate algorithms from
crowdsourced developers through the DML marketplace. With the aid of DML protocol, the machine
learning algorithms can be run on the untapped private data and leverage the idle processing power
of individual devices resulting in more precise predictions. Furthermore, the developers can improve
their algorithm and its predictability by the crowdsourced model trainers in the DML protocol.

4.1.1.1 Customers Acquire
Algorithms from Marketplace5
Customers, who wish to conduct analytical
predictions through machine learning, can
either choose to develop their in-house
machine learning algorithms or acquire readily
available ones, which will be built by freelance
developers and listed in the DML marketplace.
Algorithms are categorized according to
different types of businesses or themes within
the marketplace where customers can acquire
the appropriate ones that fit their purpose best.
Afterwards, the customers need to specify
their needs and criteria such as target segments
in terms of geographic and demographic
information. By narrowing the scope, this
enables the machine learning algorithms
to be run on appropriate dataset resulting a
more accurate prediction that matches the
customers’ requirement.

4.1.1.2 Use of Smart Contracts to
ensure Governance among Users6
The criteria input, scope of services provided
by each participant and rewards in terms of
an utility token i.e. DML token will be written
in the blockchain-based smart contracts. The
smart contracts will be digitally signed to
eliminate default risk and connected among the
customers, developers, and the decentralized
nodes that are connected to DML protocol.

4.1.1.3 Decentralized
Architecture via Decentralized
Node Deployment
Instead of connecting the customers and
developers directly to all potential data
owners’ devices, DML protocol adopts
a decentralized approach to connect the
developers to various decentralized nodes with
different functionalities. Subsequently, each
decentralized node will connect to multiple
individual data owners’ devices. Therefore, a
massive number of potential data owners can
be connected at a faster speed with more stable
connection by utlizing the processing power
and network bandwidth of the decentralized
nodes.

4.1.2.1 Distributing Node to Identify
Devices for Algorithm Distributions7
Based on the machine learning requirements
stated in the smart contracts, distributing
nodes will identify appropriate data owners,
who have granted access to their data on
their electronic devices. The data will match
the criteria and defined scope of running
the selected machine learning algorithms.
These distributing nodes will distribute the
algorithms, which will be homomorphically
encrypted, to appropriate data owners’ devices
as identified.
For instance, if the machine learning algorithm
is required to be run on photos stored in the
photo albums, the distributing nodes will
identify the devices with data owners’ consents
obtained to allow algorithms to be run on their
photo album before distributing the encrypted
algorithm to these appropriate devices.

4.1.3 /
Run Algorithms on Eligible Data
Owners’ Devices8

The amount of token required to engage the
protocol is purely driven by the market. It
may depend on the scope and how busy the
protocol is. DML protocol will analyze the
current protocol capacity and suggest to
customers the amount of DML tokens required
for processing at that particular moment.
The algorithm distribution and deployment
sequence will be prioritized according to the
amount of incentives as paid in DML tokens.

With the aid of homomorphic encryption,
the encrypted algorithms received from the
distributing nodes can be directly run on
the data within the devices. Therefore, the
intellectual property right of the algorithms is
being well-protected through encryption.

4.1.3.1 Run Algorithms directly on
Devices without Data Extraction
Unlike traditional data analytics, which private
data are transferred from the data owners to the
developers or a centralized hub for processing,
DML protocol will facilitate machine learning
algorithms to be run directly on data owners’
devices such as smartphones without the
need to extract any personal data or to store
the information elsewhere for processing. As
a result, individual private data will be well
protected without any raw data leakage from
individual devices.

4.1.3.2 Deploy Algorithms on
Individuals’ Authorized Dataset

4.1.4 Share Encrypted Prediction
Results without Data Extraction

With the DML Application, data owners can
authorize specific types of datasets, such as
photos in the album or text messages etc.,
for machine learning algorithms to be run.
Only with the consent of the data owners, the
algorithms can be run on certain authorized
types of data in the devices. Since the algorithms
are run directly in the device, the data will be
kept within the devices without transferring to
any third parties or being stored in the cloud
server.

After the machine learning algorithms are
run directly on the authorized dataset within
the devices, only the analytical conclusion in
the form of local prediction results will be
encrypted and transmitted to a federated node
via a secured network. All individual raw data
will be retained in the data owners’ devices
without sharing to the nodes. Therefore,
concerns over data privacy are resolved as data
owners can stay anonymous and their private
data will not be obtained by any third parties
including developers or customers.

Furthermore, non-public data located in
other applications such as social media
and messenger can be used to run machine
learning algorithm too with the aid of API and
users’ authorization. Therefore, DML protocol
is not only a gateway to connect private data
stored inside the device for machine learning,
but also a mean to access massive amount of
non-public data stored within the existing
networks.

4.1.5 /
Federated Nodes to Aggregate
Prediction Results9
4.1.5.1 Average Prediction Results
by Federated Learning
Each individual device will transfer its local
encrypted prediction results to the connected
federated node. The federated node will
aggregate the prediction result with results
generated from other connected devices to
formulate a comprehensive prediction via
averaging by Federated Learning.

Section 4: Solutions | www.decentralizedml.com

4.1.5.2 Validate Prediction Result
Quality against Requirement

4.1.7 Prediction Report Retrieval
and Smart Contract Execution

The federated nodes do not only act as a hub
to collect and average the prediction results,
but they also help to validate the quality of the
results against the original requirements. If
the results do not match the defined scope and
criteria as set earlier, the node will instruct the
connected devices to re-run the algorithms.

Once the report node shares and stores the
final report in IPFS, the customers can retrieve
by decrypting the report. At the same time,
the report node will automatically update the
smart contract once it stores the final report
in IPFS.

4.1.6 Report Node to Produce
Final Report & Store in IPFS10
After various federated nodes aggregate and
average the local encrypted prediction results
of respective connected individual devices,
they will send the encrypted aggregated
results to the Report Node. The report node
will further average the encrypted results as
processed by individual federated nodes, of
which an encrypted final report will then
be generated and stored in a distributed file
system such as IPFS.

The smart contract will be automatically
executed by rewarding DML tokens to
different participants in performing their
roles according to the criteria and terms
as established in the smart contract. The
contributing participants include developers,
data owners and decentralized nodes such as
distributing nodes, federated nodes and report
node.

If the total number of devices that contribute to
the final results are less than a certain amount,
the result will not be shared to avoid inaccurate
predictions due to small sample sizes and
data privacy protection by eliminating the
possibility of reverse-engineering.

4.2 /
Improve Existing ML Algorithm via
Crowd Informed Fine-tuning
To improve the machine learning algorithms, it
usually requires intensive manual resources to
fine-tune the algorithms and provide accurate
responses to train the algorithms. Apart from
unleashing the untapped private data for
machine learning and building a community
of talents to develop algorithms, DML protocol
also facilitates to identify idle resources to
fine-tune and improve the machine learning
algorithms with the aid of a vast community of
participating model trainers.
Through crowd knowledge and dataset, the
algorithms can be fine-tuned, trained and
improved by correcting the labels of the dataset
in the algorithms.

20

4.2.1 Distribute to Model Trainers
for Algorithms Improvement
When customers want to improve the
selected algorithms before running them
on appropriate data, the distributing nodes
will identify participating model trainers,
who previously indicated their willingness to
support fine-tuning and correcting machine
learning models, and send the models to
these model trainers for improvement before
running the algorithms on those appropriate
data. Besides, DML protocol also facilitates
developers, who simply want to enhance their
algorithms, to distribute the algorithms to the
participating trainers for fine-tuning without
the need to compulsory list their algorithms
for customers to use.
As device owners, they can opt to allow
algorithms to be run on their authorized data
to generate predictions, volunteer to improve
the algorithms through fine-tuning and
training, or both in return of DML tokens.

Section 4: Solutions | www.decentralizedml.com

4.2.2 Adaptive Test Approach:
Common data as Control Group

4.2.3 Federated Node to Aggregate
Weighted Fine-tuning Update

Once the algorithms are distributed to the
devices of participating model trainers for
fine-tuning and correction, an adaptive dataset
with a mixture of common and private data
will be used to test the participating trainers’
response through questioning and testing in
randomly generated sequence.

High-quality updates and correction to the
algorithm as derived from the participating
model trainer result will be encrypted and
transmitted to the federated node, which will
further aggregate and average the updates
from other participating trainers by applying
similar approach as Federating Learning.

The results derived from common dataset will
act as a control results, which will be used to
cross examine with other individuals’ responses
and evaluate the accuracy of participating
trainer’s response. Weighting will be applied to
individual training responses based on result
accuracy generated from the questions based
on common dataset.

To ensure the fine-tuning updates are accurate,
which will enhance rather than worsen the
machine learning models, cross examination
across fine-tuning results generated from the
common dataset of different devices will be
conducted. Results from poorly performed
model trainers that do not meet a minimum
standard will be excluded statistically. While
weighting based on the result accuracy
generated from common dataset will be applied
to the overall updates from each participating
trainer before fine-tuning the algorithms.

21

Section 4: Solutions | www.decentralizedml.com

4.2.4 Algorithm Refining Node to
form Fine-Tuned Algorithm
After the federated node has averaged the
fine-tuned updates and has aggregated
the encrypted updated algorithm based
on the weighted updates received from
their respective connected model trainers,
the updated algorithm will be sent to the
algorithm refining node. Upon receiving the
updated algorithms from all federated nodes,
the algorithm refining node will average
and aggregate the updates to generate a final
improved algorithm.
The final algorithm will be encrypted and
sent to the distributing nodes for full scale
distribution and run on the devices of
appropriate data owners or to the developers if
no machine learning job is deployed but only
refinement is required.

6.1.2 Open Market to Sell Machine
Learning Algorithms

The current ecosystem of machine learning
and artificial intelligence development is
mainly dominated by large corporations. They
may either employ in-house developers or seek
external professional consultants to develop
the machine learning algorithms. Developers
working at large corporations may be subject
to hierarchical influence. They can only follow
the bureaucratic corporation guidelines and
hence may hinder their creativity to build
algorithms with better use.

Currently, it may not be easy for many
developers to sell or market their algorithms
to buyers such as commercial clients. Even the
developers can find a mean to market their
algorithms, they may need to pay high agency
costs to sell their algorithms.

DML Algorithm Marketplace creates a
developer’s community where developers
have the capacity to work as a freelancer to
build and market their machine learning
algorithms in return for incentives. Innovation
and creativity to build machine learning
algorithms are unleashed as no approval by
tech giants or any other parties with vested
interest is needed. Besides, better algorithms
may also be developed and evolved due to
open competition in a free market ecosystem.

28

DML algorithm Marketplace provides
developers an alternative mean to market their
algorithms to potential algorithm buyers in an
open market that are free from middleman
control and costs. The transaction will be
executed in smart contract with clear written
terms and free from default risk.
The algorithm usage will be subject to different
type of license conditions. We expect the most
common type of licenses is on subscription
basis for single use which requires minimal
cost. On the other hand, the algorithm will be
encrypted to prevent unauthorized access to
the IP of the developers.

Section 6: Benefits for Different Participants | www.decentralizedml.com

6.1.3 External Source to Fine-tune
Machine Learning Algorithms

6.2 /
Data Owners’ Perspective

One of the major challenges of building a
useful machine learning model is the lack of
sufficient training dataset and the manual
effort to correct the labelling of the machine
learning algorithm in order to increase the
accuracy and the intelligence of the algorithm.
This is because supervised learning algorithms
often require analyzing labelled training data to
produce an inferred function that can generate
predictions and generalize classification based
on other unseen information. However, the
processes to test the algorithms and training
the dataset for supervised learning can be time
consuming and can require a lot of manual
effort to conduct.

6.2.1 Unlock Economic Value of
Private Data with Privacy Protection

Through DML Marketplace, developers have
additional mean to connect with numerous
individual devices owners whom can
support the manual exercises to fine-tune the
algorithms and trained the dataset without the
need to hire in-house limited resources. This
is another breakthrough and improvement in
machine learning by connecting and engaging
model trainers in the crowd.

Through DML Protocol, the economic value
of the private data is unlocked. Data owners
are incentivized to allow machine learning
algorithms to run on their private data in
return of DML tokens without leakage of their
private data to any third parties. Data privacy
is protected as only the prediction results
will be collected and aggregated through
the decentralized nodes while the original
source of private data will be kept within their
individual devices. Therefore, data owners
can participate in the machine learning
development with economic incentives while
data privacy concerns is addressed.

29

Currently, some data owners are already
unknowingly sharing their individual data
in their smart devices. They shared the data
through various means such as social medial
applications installed on on their devices,
without any economic incentive and much
attention to data privacy protection. Many
data owners are reluctant to share their private
data due to data privacy concerns, lack of trust
and lack of incentives even if they are willing to
contribute to machine learning development.

6.3 /
Customers’ Perspective

The processing power of our devices such
as mobile phone, tablets and computers are
growing rapidly. In the past decades, the
processing power increases approximately
according to Moore’s law. However, we recently
see exponential improvement in processing
power in smart devices with dedicated chips
for
on-device artificial intelligence and
machine learning. While we usually do not
actively use our devices 24/7, the underutilized
processing power can now be used to run
machine learning algorithms and be rewarded
along with the private dataset usage.

6.3.1 Reducing the Bar for Applying
Machine Learning Algorithm

6.2.3 Certain Data and Device
Owner also Acting as Model Trainer
While DML protocol design aims to run and
make prediction in a hassle-free and automatic
way to encourage mass participation, some
data and device owners may be interested
to walk an extra mile by acting as model
trainers through correcting the labels of the
machine algorithm in their spare time., The
effort contributes to the machine learning
development and earn extra DML token.

30

Currently, it is costly to hire an in-house
developers or seek external professional
consultancy services to build machine learning
algorithms. Therefore, only large corporations
with sufficient budgets may be able to afford
the research and development costs in
building machine learning algorithms. It is not
surprising that large corporation dominated
the machine learning field.
DML Algorithm Marketplace creates an open
market that is available for anyone to acquire
machine learning algorithms at a marketdriven cost that are free from middleman
control and costs. As a result, even small and
medium enterprises, research institutions or
even individuals may also be able to afford
accessing talented resources from all over
the world and acquiring the algorithms for
business predictions or other usages at a
market-driven cost. Furthermore, customers
can request tailor-made machine learning
algorithms for specific predictions without
going through a middleman if the algorithm
required is not in the current list or does not
match the exact required criteria. As such,
the marketplace could always meet the latest
demand in the market.

6.3.2 Better Prediction Results
with the Use of Untapped Data
The DML Protocol and Algorithm
Marketplace can help the customers to
acquire machine learning algorithms for
their business predictions. They can also
generate more accurate predictions by
applying the algorithms to untapped data
stored in individual electronic devices, which
is inaccessible before, at a market-driven cost
and free from middleman by adopting smart
contract.
Comparing to traditional market research
such as conducting survey and focus group,
prediction from the DML protocol could
be much faster and timely, unbiased, costeffective, more accurate and relevant. DML
protocol provides a powerful tool to identify
market trends and sentiments are learnt.
With more accurate prediction on trends and
sentiments etc, customers could deploy and
plan their resources more wisely by producing
and providing the goods and services that
better fit the consumers’ preferences and
needs. Other customers such as political
parties in election campaign, after learning the
latest trend of the election, could quickly adapt
and change their strategy in marketing and
promoting themselves geographically and/ or
demographically.

7.1 /
Major Uses of DML Token
7.1.1 Utilize Untapped Data and
idle processing power for Machine
Learning
DML token is paid to the data owner
to contribute their private data and idle
processing power for running machine
learning algorithm in the DML protocol.

7.1.2 Acquire Machine Learning
Algorithms in Marketplace
Apart from building in-house machine
learning algorithm, customers could acquire
machine learning algorithm from the
developers in our DML marketplace using
DML tokens. Therefore, talented developers
are incentivized to join the DML developers’
community to develop machine learning
algorithms for real life applications.

33

7.1.3 Reward to Decentralized
Nodes in the protocol
DML tokens are used to motivate the
decentralized nodes with different functions
such as distributing algorithms, aggregating
and averaging local machine learning result
by federated learning or producing aggregated
machine learning report. Those functions are
essential and serve as part of the decentralized
processing power network in machine
learning.

7.1.4 Reward to Algorithm Trainer
for Fine-tuning Algorithms
Developers who wish to seek resources to
train and fine-tune their models can pay DML
tokens to the model trainers. DML tokens are
used to motivate model trainers to contribute
their effort and time to fine-tune the algorithms
by correcting the label of the algorithm.

Section 7: DML Token Usage and Mechanism | www.decentralizedml.com

7.2/
User Growth Pool to Incentivize
Users
A user growth pool of 9% of DML tokens
will be created to incentivize DML users to
early participate in the DML protocol and
ecosystem.
1. Data owners to allow machine learning
algorithms to be run on their untapped
private data;

7.3/
The DML Token Utility System
Data owners will be rewarded from up to two
sources, which is driven by the market demand
of using untapped private data for machine
learning and from the user growth pool.
To encourage simplicity and mass adoption of
token and cryptocurrency, a ERC20-supported
wallet will be built in DML App to keep the
DML token or other supported tokens.

2. Decentralized nodes which provide various
essential functions in supporting different
parts of decentralized machine learning;

7.2.1 Extra Reward to Contributors
In addition to DML tokens directly paid by
customers, data owners may earn extra DML
tokens randomly from the user growth pool
as long as they are connected to the DML
protocol. The data owners, therefore, will
earn DML tokens from up to two sources i.e.
customers and user growth pool.

7.2.2 User Growth Pool Generation
Mechanism
A limited amount of the DML token will
be generated according to the pre-defined
decreasing-supply algorithm based on the
preset mechanism across time. The mechanism
is designed to encourage early participation to
contribute to machine learning development.
Therefore, the reward block is designed with a
pre-defined algorithm that will decrease with
time.

8.3 /
Encourage Public Contribution to
System Debug

DML Protocol adopts a “collective governance”
structure that allows and motivates any
parties to participate in system and protocol
monitoring, auditing and debugging. It is an
open source protocol, of which the source
codes of the protocol are open to public.
Therefore, participants of the DML community
can access, read, debug and audit the source
codes.

Furthermore, open source codes allow any
participants to access, amend and debug
the existing codes. To encourage talents
to continuously debug the codes, they are
incentivized with DML tokens. A pool of
DML tokens are set aside to distribute to these
participants who successfully debug the code.
With the debug incentive mechanism, security
of the DML protocol will be strengthened as
any bugs or security leakage will be fixed by
talents all over the global network.

8.2 /
Self-Governance through System
Audit by DML Participants
With the source codes open to DML
participants, it creates transparency over
the DML protocol as any participants can
audit the source codes to check against our
philosophy and mechanism such as only local
prediction results are aggregated without
leakage of original private data. Rather than
being governed by a small group of people
at periodic interval, DML protocol will be
monitored and audited continuously 24/7 by
talents from all over the community, which
creates confidence and provides transparency
to users.

9. Future Upgrade & Interoperability

9.1 /
Flexibility to Upgrade and MultiBlockchain Compatibility
We treasure the knowledge, expertise and
innovation of every individual as we believe
in collective wisdom and intelligence, which
is our core value that motivates us to unleash
untapped data and link them together to create
a co-intelligence system. Therefore, DML
protocol is designed to encourage developers
to participate in system upgrade or future
technology compatibility advancement too.
Compatibility with existing and forthcoming
blockchain and cryptographic technology
together with the flexibility for protocol
upgrades are the key for on-going development
and sustainability. Therefore, DML protocol is
designed with flexibility to be upgraded and
compatible with new blockchain technology,
of which it will not be confined to any single
or existing ones.

38

9.1.1 Promote DML Protocol
Upgrade
We encourage any developers, who have
ideas to improve the protocol by proposing
enhancement to the existing one, through
our protocol. We will reserve financial
resources to motivate any developers to
improve our protocol. This does not only
incentivize developers across the globe to
continuously contribute to the maintenance
of the decentralized network, but also the
forthcoming enhancement of the protocol.

9.1.2 Scalability and Off-chain
Transactions
DML protocol is designed with scalability
feature to cope with increasingly mass usage
and heavy transactions load. For instance,
we may adopt off-chain method, such as
state channels, by offloading non-core and
generalized processes off-chain to increase its
efficiency and reduce transaction costs.

Section 9: Future Upgrade & Interoperability | www.decentralizedml.com

9.1.3 Cross-chain Compatibility and Interoperability

Our decentralized and open-source blockchain technology allows individual data and
intelligence to be joined together to create a collective beneficial ecosystem. We believe such
decentralization approach should not be confined to one single blockchain platform. Therefore,
our technology welcomes and encourages all sorts of blockchain technology to be adopted in
our protocol and various system languages to be used to run their machine learning algorithms
on our network.
We encourage both adoption of existing blockchain technology such as Ethereum and any
other future blockchain platform. Our protocol aims to allow integration of new blockchain
technology to the currently adopted ones without replacing or overriding them. A co-exist
ecosystem that links and aggregates different blockchain-based technologies will be created.
Likewise, for the protocol upgrade mechanism, developers are also encouraged to integrate
any new blockchain technology on top of the existing blockchain platform as used in DML
protocol. The same incentive mechanism will be deployed to encourage a variety of blockchain
technologies to be adopted.

10.1.2 Launch of Regular DML Algorithms Competition
10.1.3 Connect Mobile Sensors and IOT devices
10.2

Future Phase 1: Extend Applications to other Programs

10.3

Future Phase 2: Global Self-Initiate Decentralized ML Network

10. Protocol Evolvements
10.1 /
Initial Phase:
10.1.1 Utilize Untapped Data &
Create DML Marketplace

10.1.2 Launch of Regular DML
Algorithms Competition

The first and most important features for DML
protocol is to explore and utilize the blue ocean
of untapped and privately-owned data for
machine learning. In our initial development
stage, we connect electronic devices from all
over the globe to reach the untapped private
data through DML protocol.

Subsequent to the release of DML
Marketplace, a DML Algorithm Competition
will be introduced, which creates a distributed
platform for crowdsourcing machine learning
solutions. It aims to attract and motivate more
diversify talents to create machine learning
algorithms with practical utility to solve real
life problems. A level-playing field is created for
any developers disregard of their background
to participate in the competition., They can
employ their talents, polish their skills and
be rewarded solely based on their capability
without any hierarchical interference.

We focus running machine learning algorithms
on the untapped data to generate more
accurate predictions through DML protocol.
We protect data privacy of data owners, which
is one of our top priorities and niches, by
sending local prediction results for further
aggregating and averaging with no raw data
being extracted from the electronic devices. All
the prediction results will be further processed
and consolidated on collective basis, which
will yield a final prediction result.
The DML Marketplace is also created with the
view to collective wisdom or “co-intelligent”.
Therefore, the data, algorithms development
and fine-tuning of algorithms are decentralized
through our DML platform rather than being
centralized or controlled by oligopolies.

41

Real life challenging use cases will be provided
for participants to solve by creating tailormade algorithms. Winners will not only
be rewarded by DML tokens, but also gain
reputation in winning the award and can
market their solutions in DML Marketplace.

Section 10: Protocol Evolvements | www.decentralizedml.com

10.1.3 Connect Mobile Sensors
and IOT devices
While we initially focus on exploring data,
which has already be generated and stored
in the device, machine learning development
can be further advanced through the real time
and relevant data generated from the multiple
sensors within the smart devices and other
IOT devices as controlled by the same devices.
The distributed IOT and mobile sensor network
will bring machine learning development
to another level by providing data that does
not exist before or very difficult to collect
for on-device machine learning. The use of
sensors or IOT connection will require data
owner authorization and those data will not
be extracted from the smart device to protect
data privacy.

42

10.2 /
Future Phase 1: Extend
Applications to other Programs
Machine learning applications is only one of
the major use cases for DML protocol. With
a network that connects to potentially billions
of electronic devices to unleash the use of
previously untapped private data and their idle
processing power, it can extend its applications
from machine learning algorithms to any other
types of programs to be run on untapped data
by using the idle processing power of these
devices to generate any suitable programs and
applications.
We aim to truly unlock the untapped data
within the electronic devices especially
smartphones and fully utilize their processing
power for the advancement of artificial
intelligence development. Not only does the
machine learning algorithms that generate
predictions can be run on these untapped
data, but other kinds of applications and
programs can also leverage the same DML
platform in applying the untapped data and
idle processing power of those connected
devices. Similarly, these programs can also be
marketed to potential users through the same
DML marketplace.

Section 10: Protocol Evolvements | www.decentralizedml.com

10.3 /
Future Phase 2: Global Self-Initiate
Decentralized ML Network
We do not only believe in “more good quality
data, better result”, but also “the whole is greater
than sum of its parts”. Therefore, applying
existing distributed data in a decentralized
network for machine learning is the initial step
to build the DML Protocol ecosystem.
Smartphone is an extension of our body, which
performs as extra pair of eyes, pair of ears as
well as other sensors. It is also a gateway for
us to reach the outside world digitally through
the mobile network and internet.
The potential of DML protocol is far more than
facilitating algorithms or programs to be run
directly on these connected electronic devices
through its decentralized network. Ultimately,
we aim to leverage the decentralized network
that connects potentially billions of devices all
over the globe to be able to communicate with
each other.

43

Once a self-communicating network is built
across all electronic devices, decentralized
data collected can be cross-checked and
complementing with each other. Therefore,
the data set in the DML protocol are more
reliable, complete and with highest integrity
for algorithms and programs to be run to
generate more accurate predictions or produce
better software applications.
Ultimately, the self-communicated network
can self-detect and self-initiate to acquire
useful information scattered across the
globe to formulate valuable predictions with
global impact that may be beyond human
imaginations. As such, it will be the suitable
time to research and develop Strong-AI as
powered by the matured version of DML
protocol.
