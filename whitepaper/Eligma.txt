purpose of this whitepaper is to present a summary of Eligma’s business model, value proposition
and an introduction to the Eligma crowdsale for potential token purchasers in connection with the
proposed token sale. The information set forth below may be changed for any reason, may not be
exhaustive and does not imply any elements of a contractual relationship. The sale and purchase of
ELI tokens is governed by the Terms of Sale available on the Eligma website.
If you are in any doubt as to the action you should take, you should consult your legal, financial, tax
or other professional advisor(s) and immediately navigate away from the Eligma website and do not
contribute to the development of Eligma.
This whitepaper does not purport to be all-inclusive or contain all information that you may desire
in examining the project. This whitepaper’s sole purpose is to provide relevant and reasonable
information to you in order for you to determine whether to undertake a thorough analysis of the
project and the company with the intent of acquiring ELI tokens. PURCHASE OF ELI TOKENS INVOLVES

A word from our founder

“It’s nothing personal, it’s just business.” I strongly disagree. To me,
entrepreneurship is a passionate belief and a personal mindset that
can make all the difference between success and failure. It is the
reason behind my actions, the source of my ambition, my dedication
and my pride. And when you put so much of yourself, your time and
your belongings in it, business becomes very personal.
Eligma is a dream I started dreaming a decade ago. Technological
changes and rapid advancements made me think how everything around us is connected
and how thoroughly the internet is changing the way we live. I recognized the advantages,
but also the traps. One thing was obvious—in this era of data, consumers have too much
to choose from and not enough time.
That is why Eligma is on a mission to connect all online commerce into a one-stop point
and use the latest technology to help us all navigate in a consumption-oriented world. By
harnessing AI and blockchain Eligma will act as our personal shopping assistant, giving us the
overview of our belongings, but most of all helping us take back control and empowering
our decision-making, which we as consumers have lost. The best thing: it will save us time
that we all desperately lack.
Now, the dream of Eligma is becoming a reality with the help of three co-founders. We
are all dreamers with one important distinction: we do not just imagine, but actually live
our dreams!
Jože Mermal dreamt of an area that would connect business, entertainment, shopping,
well-being and innovations in one place. Today, he manages BTC City—a 400,000 m2 area
in Ljubljana with more than 10,000 brands, 3,000 companies, 450 stores, 70 bars, restaurants
and over 20 million yearly visitors. It is one of the largest shopping areas in Europe. In a
country with only 2 million inhabitants, his dream became a definition of innovation, open
mindset and commerce evolution.
Matej Gregorčič’s vision made him a living legend in the blockchain community. For him,
entrepreneurship is like a competition at the Olympic Games—years of training and dedication
leading up to one big race to win! He is the heart and mind of Viberate, a start-up that
became the new standard and a synonym for top-notch crowdsale projects.
My whole life is also connected to start-ups and innovations. I have lived around the world,
doing business and improving myself in the process practically everywhere I could. The dream
of Eligma started in Shanghai and was at the time called Crowdering. Its main goal was to

connect people directly with factories, removing middlemen from the process. My path then
led me to Amsterdam, where I got familiar with 3-D printing, and then to Slovenia, where I
immediately founded the ABC accelerator. Three years after that, ABC was named the best
start-up accelerator in Central Europe with new offices popping-up in Silicon Valley, Germany,
Slovenia, Bosnia and Ukraine. It invested in more than 80 start-ups and raised more than 40
million dollars to help turn the world into a better place in its own special way.
Many things need to come together for something as big as Eligma to happen. For our
team, last summer was crucial. Talk over a coffee challenged me to stop wishing and start
making my biggest dream a reality. It meant a big change for me, as I was the CEO of an
amazing company and I enjoyed my job tremendously. But I knew that I was willing to let
everything else go for Eligma. Both Matej and Jože supported me 100 % and more. Jože
brings his invaluable knowledge, experience and the BTC City infrastructure to test Eligma
in the real world. On the other hand, Matej lives and breathes statistics, metrics, blockchain,
crypto, but most of all, supports me to expand my limits.
When you put us three dreamers together, you get a guarantee that something extraordinary
is about to happen.

Project overview
Eligma was born as a response to several key trends and problems identified in traditional
retail as well as online shopping, where the use of the latter has exploded in the recent
decade. The goal of our project is to offer a set of previously impossible or unanticipated
solutions to discover, purchase, track and resell items. This is now viable thanks to the
development of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology.
These three main pillars, discovery, inventory and loyalty, will enable Eligma to become an
AI-driven and blockchain-based platform that acts as a personal commerce agent.

1.1

DISCOVERY
Discovery will use a deep neural network-based product recommendation engine to find the
best deals for products users are looking for. Through a unique algorithm that will compare
products based on their specifications and characteristics, Eligma will also offer alternative
solutions that match the users’ requirements. Through Eligma’s chatbot, finding the right
product will only take seconds. There will be no need to search for products in thousands
of online sources anymore.
Users will be able to manage any online store account through Eligma’s unified shopping
account. A single shopping cart and checkout process will suffice to complete purchases
in multiple online stores at once. Users will be able to use a simple interface to authorize
Eligma to register with selected online stores on their behalf.
Eligma’s cryptocurrency payment gateway will enable users paying with cryptocurrencies,
even if the online store they are buying from does not support them yet.
And to round up the discovery process, Eligma will create a blockchain-tracked Digital Item
Profile (DIP) for every item purchased through the platform, where users can store several
records, including Proofs of Purchase.

1.2

INVENTORY
Every DIP will be automatically written into the user’s inventory. In order for the user to
have an overview of all the items in his household, he will also be able to manually add
elsewhere purchased items.
Within the inventory, users will be able to see the AI-predicted current and future item value.
Eligma’s household trading agent will notify users when the best time to sell the product
is. It will automatically generate and publish listings on selected second-hand online stores

9

with a single click. If a user chooses to replace that product, Eligma will even propose a
suitable replacement.
To make C2C transactions safer for the user, Eligma will offer two solutions to both trading
parties. With its Escrow service, Eligma will act as a trusted intermediary and ensure fairness
of contractual terms. The second option is a completely decentralized sale on the blockchain,
where both parties will make a deposit into a smart contract as a guarantee. These deposits
and the buyer’s payment will remain locked until the contract terms are fulfilled.

1.3

UNIVERSAL LOYALTY
With both discovery and inventory pillars established, Eligma will consolidate retailers in
an integrated open-loop universal loyalty system and provide a simple and convenient
user interface with a customer-centric approach. There will be no need to register with a
standalone loyalty program of each merchant and users will be able to redeem acquired
ELI tokens with any other network member.
Unlike the existing loyalty systems that give points, Eligma will transfer value into ELI tokens
and credit them directly to the user’s wallet. Users will be able to earn loyalty tokens not
only by performing certain actions on the platform, but also by making purchases at any
other online or offline merchant, included in the program, or by simply buying them on
an online exchange.
Although the majority of platform features will be free, some of them will only be unlocked
with ELI tokens. With the adoption of cryptocurrencies, ELI tokens will be used for purchases
at all merchants involved in our loyalty program.
Eligma is anticipated to become a generally recognized and accepted platform for online
shopping. It will be entering a market, where the amount of sales reached 2.3 trillion U.S.
dollars in 2017 and is anticipated to double in the next four years (Statista, 2018).

1.4

VISION
Eligma will serve as a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to e-business. By connecting blockchain
and business, we will create a modular platform for commerce and save time that users
spend on searching and purchasing products by utilizing artificial intelligence. It will advise
users, which item to buy by taking into account item components, quality, price, shipping
time and costs as well as other factors. It will enable users to securely and transparently sell
their used items on multiple second-hand markets at the most appropriate time through

10

their personal item inventories - Eligma will transform every household into a business. All of
this will be possible thanks to the innovative use of existing AI and blockchain technologies.

1.5

MISSION
Eligma’s mission is to optimize the online shopping experience and through it help people
save the one thing that can not be bought - time. Eligma will strive to offer transparent
and secure C2C trades, decentralized loyalty program and help bring cryptocurrencies into
mainstream.

E-COMMERCE TRENDS
The habit of buying products online has exploded in the recent years. There are two main
reasons for that happening: the expansion of internet access across the world (in December
2017, 54.4 % of the world population was using internet2) and people becoming more
accepting of online shopping as technological changes have made it more convenient and
easier. Online shopping does not know geographical and time boundaries. Customers can
now place orders internationally and 24/7. The possibility to shop at any time and the ability
to compare prices and find better deals are the main reasons consumers rather shop online
than in physical stores3.

More and more people value their time and that is why online shopping is growing at such a
high rate. Retailers are transforming their stores into showrooms and sending their customers
to finish the purchase process online. Preferences to buy in-store vs. online are different
amongst different categories, but with every year the percentage of online sales is growing.

SECOND-HAND MARKET
The second-hand market has its own specifics, but is growing rapidly. With companies like
LetGo raising incredible amounts of money (Letgo raised $175 million U.S. dollars5) in the
used goods segment, it is apparent that this market has a lot of potential.
However, both sellers and buyers are facing risks when performing such transactions. Even
eBay admitted that there is something wrong, as their system was built on the assumption
that most people are honest6. A large number of frauds are making consumers hesitant to
sell or buy on second-hand markets as those markets are doing a poor job protecting them.

Annual net revenue of eBay, currently the largest used goods marketplace,
has grown by 7 % in 2017 and has reached almost 10 billion U.S. dollars7.

2.4

DISPERSED ONLINE STORE ECOSYSTEM
According to a research done by Omer Rachamim in 2014, there were 12-24 million online
stores in the world, but only 650,000 out of them were generating annual sales of more
than a thousand U.S. dollars8.
With all the online stores available, one of the main drawbacks is the necessity to register
to complete a purchase. Nowadays people are losing track of stores where they are already
registered and statistics show that 23 % of shoppers would not complete the purchase if
they had to register again9.
To solve these problems, online retailers are trying to provide a more personalized experience,
as it is very likely that such an experience can increase the number of purchases.

that deliver personalized and connected cross-channel experiences. People would rather
buy from a retailer that recognizes them and recommends options based on their previous
purchases and their habits. Personalization is expected to undoubtedly increase sales in
the future11.

2.5

LOYALTY PROGRAMS
While almost half of all loyalty programs are established in the retail industry, one of their
main drawbacks is that they are not connected and not monetary by nature. All suffer from
being too similar to others and not innovative enough. According to research, the number
of loyalty program memberships in United States tripled in the last decade. An average
American was a member of at least 10 different loyalty programs back in 2016, but more
than half of those memberships remained inactive, confirming that the loyalty program
industry is facing issues12.

CRYPTOCURRENCY PAYMENTS
Cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more recognized amongst the wider population and
are slowly stepping into the mainstream. According to research, credit cards remained the
online shoppers’ preferred payment method worldwide in March 2017 and cryptocurrencies
reached 3 %14.

This percentage is anticipated to increase, since the last research conducted in July and

cryptocurrencies for conducting payments in the future15.
One of the main reasons, why the adoption of cryptocurrency payments is slow, is the fact
that big online merchants are not implementing this payment solution yet. As of July 2017,
Bitcoin was accepted at just three of the top 500 online merchants16.

2.7

CONCLUSION
Research shows that the online shopping market is growing yearly and that people are
already losing a lot of time searching for the right product. The offer is vast and the online
shopping ecosystem is very dispersed. The second-hand online market is blooming and will
probably grow even faster if certain seller and buyer security measures are implemented.

2.8

MAIN PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED IN THE RESEARCH
Online product research and shopping are time consuming
People spend a lot of time researching online to find the product and the deal that suits
their needs, but even the most persistent ones cannot check all the online store offers. Users
are never certain, whether they found the best possible deal.
User privacy issues
Users disclose personal data with every store, where they want to place an order. Their every
move on the store’s website is also being monitored. This means that stores are collecting
extensive behavioural data about each user and can connect that data directly to the person.
Registration with every online store is required
Users have to separately register with each online store they want to shop in. Due to this
inconvenience, they can be discouraged from placing an order in a new online store. Keeping
track of different accounts can be a hassle and therefore consumers are returning only to
stores, where they are already registered.
Keeping track of household belongings
Users do not have an overview of what they own and how much their belongings are worth.
Every household has many products that still have value, but are never used and people
forget about even having them.
Creating second-hand listings for faster sale conversions
When trying to sell used items, users are having problems setting the appropriate price and
selecting a second-hand market with the highest probability of finding potential buyers.
Usually they list products on some of those markets and forget about the listing, as it rarely
converts into a successful sale.

Payments with cryptocurrencies are not possible
With growing wealth held in cryptocurrencies, the demand for conducting payments in those
currencies is growing. Very few online stores stepped into this direction, even though all the
indicators are showing that in the future cryptocurrencies are going to become mainstream.
Vast number of individual loyalty programs
Big retailers have introduced loyalty programs a long time ago, but those programs are not
connected. This means that in order for users to really benefit from a program, they have
to keep track of every one of them, which is next to impossible.
Incomplete or inaccurate product descriptions
Most online stores provide their own descriptions. The quality of those descriptions varies
from store to store and it is very hard for users to know which one of them is relevant. In
most cases, when users are searching for products with a higher price, they have to first visit
the manufacturer’s website to find the description they can trust.
Lack of a personalized approach
Despite the adoption of new technologies, most online stores are still not embracing the
personalized shopping experience approach. In many cases, online stores are displaying
inappropriate products to the wrong customers and it is up to the users to browse the store
and find the product that best suits their needs.

20

Eligma will offer the best quality / price
ratio in a market consisting of billions
of products.

3

Eligma
Eligma will be an AI-driven and blockchain-based cognitive commerce platform that will
change the way people discover, purchase, track and resell items online. With its unique
features it will offer users a “one-place”, where they can shop in all the online stores
anywhere in the world, check the value of items in their household and learn the best time
to sell them. Eligma will offer users a completely decentralized universal loyalty program
and help transform every household into a business.
Eligma contains three main pillars: discovery, inventory and loyalty, described in the following
subsections.

DISCOVERY

INVENTORY
• AI-calculated item value
• Household trading agent
• Automated second hand listing
• Decentralized sale on blockchain

LOYALTY
• Universal loyalty program
• Users are rewarded for contributions
• Every merchant can join
• ELI tokens as a payment option

3.1

DISCOVERY
The first pillar of the Eligma platform is Discovery. It is the core of the platform and its
unique AI algorithms will enable us to develop future smart solutions.

22

3.1.1

Databases / Data Warehouse
In order to start with AI development and the machine learning process, we are initially
building a complete architecture of the platform, which uses a high-performance database
as a precondition.
This whole architecture is designed in a way that is able to serve an unlimited amount of
data entries and user requests. To ensure a better presence in different markets, the platform
will have multilingual support.
Eligma’s first building block will be a data warehouse that consists of the following elements:
•

Product database;

•

Online store database;

•

User profile, inventory and behaviour data database;

•

Purchases and Proof of Purchase database.

Eligma will use a product data collection service to automatically collect and update data
from suppliers, manufacturers, online stores and other content providers. We will introduce
the users’ contributions feature for growing our database later.

23

3.1.1.1 Product database
Every product in our continuously growing product database has more than 300 data fields
and the database itself is carefully categorized in accordance with the global categorization
standard. Eligma’s database already includes more than 20 million unique products that are
currently available on the global market.
We have partnered with the world’s leading product data provider IceCat NV from the
Netherlands, who started the product data collection and processing in 2001. As manufacturers
provide most of the data, Eligma will reduce the risk of false data to the minimum.

3.1.1.2 Online store database
The next step in gathering data is to connect our product database with online stores. Eligma
has established a team of senior developers who are focused on setting up, upgrading and
maintaining this database. Two different approaches will be used for gathering data:
•

Connecting to open APIs of online stores;

•

Developing parsing services to scrape the data from online stores.

Eligma will not be collecting entire datasets from online stores because some of that data
might be incomplete or inaccurate and because we already possess the correct product data
in our product database (such as title, description, specification, etc.). Eligma will be focused
on collecting data, specific for each individual online store:
•

Price

•

Shipping countries

•

Shipping options

•

Shipping price

•

Shipping duration

•

User reviews

•

Timestamp

•

Warranty details

3.1.1.3 Matching algorithm
Our matching algorithm will compare the data gathered from online stores with the data
written in the product database. When a match is found, the algorithm will create a new
entry in the existing database. We will analyse most unmatched products using a deep
neural network, which will help us match them based on their similarity metrics score. If the

24

product is not found in our database, we will still collect the data and try to find a match
manually (we will have a dedicated team for product matching). By using this method, our
system will gain additional knowledge through the process of machine learning and thus
improve the matching algorithm. If the manual matching is unsuccessful, we will create a
new product in the product database and validate the input fields. Only when the validation
is successful, will we put the product in our product database.

AI-driven global product discovery
At the core of the Eligma platform is an AI-driven module that will help users discover the
best deals for desired products at any online store considering their preferences. It will
use several sources of user data to achieve the optimum results. Eligma will also connects
the offline and online worlds together in order to upgrade the shopping experience and
ensure that each user really finds the best deal. We are developing the following features:

25

•

Global product discovery
Our platform will display global discovery results based on the search input and
knowledge about the user (preferences set in the profile, user behaviour data
analytics, current inventory, location, etc.). Eligma will also suggest alternative
products, for which the AI predicts a better-fit probability by comparing the price
vs quality ratio and other preferences;

Eligma’s “on-demand” multi language chatbot will tailor simple questions to better
refine discovery results;

•

Product hunter
Users will be able to select the product they want and define criteria under reach
they are willing to purchase it. Eligma will perform regular lookups in all the online
stores and when it finds the product that fits the criteria, it will notify the user and
guide him through the purchase process;

Code scanner
To connect online and offline shoppers, Eligma will develop a code scanning open
source code to be used use within the Eligma mobile app or through the APIs
implemented in any third party application. With it, users will be able to scan the
barcode (EAN, UPC) or QR code of a product displayed in a physical store. The app

26

will recognize the product using the existing Eligma`s database and provide users
the exact description of the product and best ways to purchase the product.

•

Wishlists
Wishlists are lists of items usually bought together at the same time. Eligma will
generate these lists using smart product matching algorithms. Wishlists can also be
generated by the community.

3.1.3

Unified online shopping account
Eligma will enable users to simply and securely connect to all the online stores and manage
all their purchases from one unified account.
It is common for organizations today to implement a so-called unified access management,
through which they can access many different applications to fulfil their needs. Eligma will
implement a similar concept to enable users to manage their online store accounts. Through
Eligma, users will be able to perform the following actions in any online store:
•

Add products to their shopping cart;

•

Place an order;

•

Register with a new online store;

•

Login to online stores;

•

Make a payment;

•

Update user profile information;

•

Remove an account.

With this feature, Eligma will eliminate the need to memorize all the online store login
credentials and having to jump from one online store to another to find and purchase
everything you need. Eligma’s “one-cart” interface will enable users to add products from
different online stores in one unified shopping cart and to only go through the checkout
process once.

3.1.4

User privacy and security
User privacy and security are extremely important to us and for this reason multi-layered
security, preventing internet-related fraud and identity theft, will be implemented inside
the platform. All transactions will be monitored and compliant with PCI Security Standards
enhanced with an additional cryptographic security layer.
For an even better protection of user privacy, users will be able to simply erase all the
connections between their private information (name, last name, address) and their behavior
with a click of a button. This means that if a user uses Eligma for all his shopping needs, all
the available data on that user’s shopping habits will be deleted from the web, if the user
so decides.
Eligma will be in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from its
inception and user data privacy will be respected according to the required standards.

3.1.5

Cryptocurrency payments
In order to make the discovery process complete, Eligma will offer users a wide array of
payment options. Apart from the common ones (Paypal, credit cards) we will also enable
cryptocurrency purchases through Eligma’s internal cryptocurrency payment gateway. This
means that users will not need to wait and hope for those online stores to implement it.

According to research, the percentage of consumers that are willing to
pay in cryptocurrencies is increasing. Last year more than 11 % of people
confirmed that they are expecting to use cryptocurrencies for payments in
the future.
SECURITY: All funds will be separated to hot and cold wallets and supported by highly secure
offsite backups.

3.1.6

Blockchain-tracked Digital Item Profile (DIP)
Items purchased on Eligma will gain a unique designated Digital Item Profile (DIP) that
will be stored in a blockchain protected database - our implementation of a decentralised
database that utilizes the InterPlanetary File System and is protected by the Ethereum
network and its blockchain (sidechain). After that, hashes from the DIP will be written into
the Ethereum blockchain. DIPs will be organized as digital containers that can store several

28

records and references to digital documents with the information on purchase (Proof of
Purchase), original item profile and description, repairs, warranties, resells and other events
that can be collected and tracked.
Records inside DIPs will be stored in a time sequence and include timestamps and hash
of the previous record, forming a small blockchain ledger of transactions inside each DIP.
Records will also be signed with the creator’s private key, adding verifiability of the issuer
to each record.

3.1.6.1 Proof of Purchase / Claim of Ownership
The initial document in a DIP can be either a Proof of Purchase, created automatically when
a product is purchased through Eligma and serves as a certificate, or a Claim of Ownership
that is created when an item is purchased elsewhere (offline or in other online stores)
and manually added to an Item Inventory of an Eligma user. A claim of Ownership can be
upgraded into a Proof of Purchase only if the user initiates this request and uploads the
required documentation that will be manually verified before approval. In addition to
information on buyer/claimer, DIPs will be able to store technical information about the
product, alleged condition, price and other applicable information.
DIPs will be publicly accessible and browsable, enabling all Eligma users to research a history
of each item, although some information will be encrypted and accessible only to the record’s
creator (example: buyer ID and Proof of Purchase or Claim of Ownership). Although Eligma
does not guarantee that all events in DIPs that follow the Proof of Purchase and are recorded

29

or scraped from data & service providers will include truthful and accurate information, they
can be used to create a valuable record of a digital footprint for each product.
If a user adds an item with an already existing DIP to the inventory, previous records about
the item’s history are automatically connected. Users can also add modifications of the
product that change expected features or condition of that item.

3.2

INVENTORY
Our inventory module will provide an interface for recording details about the users’ personal
belongings. In order to have an overview of all the items in a household and their value, users
can add items to their inventory, which will be saved into a sidechain in the following ways:

•

Automated inventory
After a user purchases a product through the platform, a DIP will be assigned to
the item together with Proof of Purchase and Eligma will automatically list the item
in the user’s inventory.

•

Manual input
User can add a product that was purchased elsewhere manually through a simple
interface. If the product is recognized and it already exists in the product database,
Eligma will automatically fill the product data (title, description, specifications).

•

Reverse inventory lookup
An online store that partners with Eligma can notify all it’s previous customers
about creating DIP on the platform. Users will receive a mail with a link, leading to
a simple interface for claiming Proof of Purchase.

Inventory is private to the user, unless a user chooses to share it with the
community.
3.2.1

AI-predicted item value
Eligma’s unique machine learning software will predict the estimated current value of the
item based on several different factors:
•

Local market value;

•

Local market demand;

•

Age of the item;

30

•

Condition of the item;

•

etc.

Eligma will additionally also predict how the product value will behave in the future.

Household value
When users will have their inventory properly setup and filled with items
they own, Eligma will be able to tell them the value of their household
belongings in time.

3.2.2

Second-hand market
Every household will be transformed into a business
In order to fully transform households into businesses, our crucial next step will be to
implement second-hand online stores to the platform. These stores will also be managed
from the unified shopping account.

3.2.2.1 Household trading agent
Eligma will manage your personal belongings
By combining knowledge of the future value of the product in the household inventory and
the replacement product`s price on the market, we will be able to predict the best time to
sell that product and buy the replacement. This process on Eligma is fully automated via a
trading agent that notifies the user about upcoming sell suggestions upon request.

31

3.2.2.2 Automated listings
One click to list your products everywhere
When a user decides to sell an item from his inventory, he will be able to create a universal
listing, stating its condition, asking price, shipping preferences (local vs. international), payment
options (fiat vs. crypto) and additional security options. Eligma will offer a one-click solution
that will automatically generate and publish this listing on all selected second-hand markets.

Eligma’s unique second hand market solution will make certain steps
much simpler, faster and more transparent. While the sale can be
completed in a traditional manner, Eligma will offer two exclusive
features to make the whole process safer for its users.

3.2.2.3 Eligma as an Escrow service
When a user will be creating listings on the platform, he will be able to select the Escrow
service as a possible feature to conclude the deal. This service is provided by Eligma and is an
additional precaution for both the seller and the buyer. Listings, created with this option on
the Eligma platform, will still be pushed to other second-hand online stores and published
there. For the time of delivery, Eligma will withhold the buyer’s payment and the seller will
have to deposit ELI tokens as a guarantee.
All offers, insured by this feature, will be highlighted on the Eligma discovery engine, thus
giving them an enhanced level of visibility.
In the case of a dispute, Eligma will mediate between the seller and the buyer and demand
additional explanations and proofs that each of the parties fulfilled their part of the contract.
Through Eligma, the order can be canceled and both the funds and the product returned
to their original owners if the dispute cannot be solved or the purchase can be executed
under newly agreed terms (i.e. lower price).
The Escrow service will ensure that in the event of a dispute Eligma will act as a trusted
intermediary and ensure fairness and observance of all contractual terms.
If the deal concludes successfully, the event is written in a DIP, a new Proof of Purchase is
generated on the Eligma sidechain and a new hash is added to the blockchain. In the case
of a returned item, DIP is upgraded with a flag, stating that there was a dispute regarding
the product condition. By doing so, we prevent the seller from selling the product several
times without changing the description of its condition.

3.2.2.4 Decentralized sale on blockchain
Eligma will additionally develop and offer a mechanism to execute a purchase or any trade
process in a completely decentralized way using smart contracts on a blockchain.
This option will provide a tool for exchanging a payment in cryptocurrencies between a seller
and a buyer, who previously created a trade agreement either through the Eligma platform
or by using other means of communication, like online chat, forums or online boards.
Complete process of a product sale between a buyer and a seller will be conducted directly
through a smart contract, meaning there is no central authority to intervene - even Eligma
has no control over the process.
Both the buyer and the seller have to establish a motivation to successfully fulfil contract
obligations by placing a deposit in ELI tokens. This deposit is released after the smart contract
is concluded, forcing both parties to reach an agreement regarding the trade.

Steps for creating a smart contract:
1.

Seller and buyer negotiate the deal (product, price in cryptocurrency, shipment,
delivery etc.) through the Eligma platform or through other communication
channels.

2.

Seller will be able to use the Eligma Decentralized Application (DAPP) to
construct a smart contract on an Ethereum blockchain. In order to create
such a decentralized offer, this information will have to be entered into the

		

DAPP:

3.

•
seller’s Ethereum public address,
•
buyer’s Ethereum public address,
•
payment in a cryptocurrency for the item.
DAPP will calculate an amount of ELI tokens, needed to be deposited by the
seller and the buyer, proportional to the payment amount. How does the
seller create a smart contract:
•
•

4.

He signs and broadcasts a transaction through a DAPP, spending a
small amount of Ethereum (gas) and
deposits a corresponding amount of ELI tokens to a Smart Contract

as a guarantee.
Buyer can accept the offer with depositing the below stated to the smart
contract:
•
•

Payment for the product in a determined cryptocurrency and
a matching amount of ELI tokens.

34

The result of this process is a smart contract that is fully under the control of both the seller
and the buyer. They both are motivated to resolve the contract, as their deposits remain
locked until they reach an agreement about closing the contract. As both parties have put
down the deposit, it is in the best interest of both to conclude the deal, otherwise both of
them will lose their deposit.

Ways of resolving a smart contract:
Positive closing
Once the buyer receives the product, he will be able to confirm that the product was received
in the expected condition by “closing” the smart contract with a confirmation transaction.
In this case, both deposits are released and returned to the buyer’s and seller’s addresses,
while the payment in cryptocurrency is sent to the seller’s Ethereum address.

Closing with an alternative proposal
Seller and buyer can also negotiate to close the smart contract in an alternative way by
splitting the payment. This way, a negotiated percentage of the payment is returned to
the buyer and the remaining percentage is transferred to the seller. Both deposits are then
returned to their originating Ethereum addresses. Alternative closing is a convenient way
for closing an agreement when a buyer receives the product, but it is not in an expected
condition or has minor errors.
A proposal for an alternative closing can be set by sending a transaction to a smart contract
from either the seller or the buyer and the counterparty must accept the proposal with a
confirmation transaction.

Annulation
Seller and buyer can also agree to “annulate” the smart contract. In this case, the payment
and the deposits are returned. In order to cancel the contract, a proposal must be broadcasted
with a transaction to the network from either the seller or the buyer and the counterparty
must accept a proposal with a confirmation transaction.

LOYALTY
We will provide a universal loyalty program by introducing the ELI token. With both discovery
and inventory pillars established, Eligma will consolidate merchants in an integrated openloop universal loyalty system and provide a simple and convenient user interface with a
customer-centric approach. There will be no need to register with a standalone loyalty
program of each merchant and the users will be able to redeem the acquired ELI tokens
with any other network member.
Unlike the existing loyalty systems that give points, Eligma will transfer value into ELI tokens
and credit them directly to the user’s wallet. The growing number of customers using ELI
tokens and the increase of the market share of blockchain-based services and infrastructure
will make users want to use their ELI tokens for additional purchases. Users will also be
receiving regular reports and offers from the stores where they made their purchases, which
will also serve to incentivize their further actions.
The main purpose of the loyalty system is to reward loyal users for actions that benefit
the party handing out loyalty points or in our case, loyalty tokens. Eligma’s infrastructure
will enable several parties to benefit from this program and offer users incentives for their
involvement in the program.

ELI

37

3.3.1

Merchant to User
Merchants will have a merchant account on the platform and with it the opportunity to
reward their loyal customers. With our tokens, merchants will be able to use common ways
of rewarding or even be more creative when rewarding their customers. Some of those
possibilities are:

•

Every purchase is rewarded
When a customer purchases something, the merchant can give away ELI tokens as
a “cashback” reward. This option is possible for either online or offline purchases.
Merchant’s benefit: Growing sales

•

Backtrack rewarding
As the Eligma system is already gathering information about customers’ purchases,
merchant will be able to decide he wants to reward everyone, who bought a certain
product from him in the past.
Merchant’s benefit: Better recognition and positioning, which result in better future
sales.

•

Product rewards
Merchant can announce that every purchase of a product during a time period will
result in an ELI token reward for the customers.
Merchant’s benefit: Better sales of a specific product he wants to promote or sell out.

These are just few examples, but in the future decentralized loyalty will enable merchants
to come up with a new innovative ways to reward their loyal customers.

3.3.2

Eligma to User
The Eligma platform has different objectives when it comes to loyalty and therefore offers
rewards on different layers to benefit the growth of the platform:

•

Purchases on the Eligma platform
Eligma will reward ELI tokens for purchases through the platform.
Eligma’s benefit: More sales through the platform result in more revenue and Eligma
will be sharing part of that revenue with the users.

•

Registering on the Eligma platform
Users will receive a welcome reward in ELI tokens when registering on the platform.
Eligma’s benefit: New users.

38

•

Detailed profile information
When users add additional information, Eligma will reward them with
additional ELI tokens. A simple interface will guide users through the
profile expansion process.
Eligma’s benefit: More information results in better platform AI predictions.

•

Adding items to the inventory
Users will be awarded ELI tokens for manually adding items to their
inventory.
Eligma’s benefit: Growing potential for second-hand trades.

•

Uploading receipts
Users will be rewarded with ELI tokens when they upload receipts through
the Eligma’s mobile app or the platform itself.
Eligma’s benefit: A growing database which results in better machine
learning results.

•

Referrals
Referral rewards will be awarded for referring new users to the platform.
For each rewarded action that a friend carries out, the user who referred
him will get an additional reward.
Eligma’s benefit: New users.

•

User online store referral
When a user referral results in a connection of an online store with the
platform and this online store makes its first sale through Eligma, the
user is rewarded with ELI tokens.
Eligma’s benefit: Expanding the online store database and growing
revenue.

3.3.3

User actions rewarding other users
•

Wishlists resulting in sales
When a created wishlist results in a direct sale, the user who published
the wishlist will be rewarded with ELI tokens.

•

Social media actions
When a social media share or a post results in a direct sale, the user who
created the post will be rewarded with ELI tokens.
Using smart contracts, we will setup a function that will release a fixed
amount of ELI tokens daily, which will be distributed through the Eligma’s

39

reward plans. Rewards will be adjusted to correspond to the distributed percentage.
Users will be able to withdraw ELI tokens to their private Ethereum wallets or online
exchanges and trade with them.

3.3.4

Token usage
Although the majority of the platform features will be free, some will consume ELI tokens
from the user’s or merchant’s balance. Users will be able to add them to their platform
balance, either with performing rewarded actions or with a deposit of ELI tokens, bought
on an online exchange. ELI tokens, spent for performing these actions, will be transacted
to a fund, dedicated to reward plans.
Users will be able to utilize tokens on the Eligma platform for several purposes:

•

Product hunt
When ordering a product hunt, a certain user’s balance of ELI tokens will be locked.
If Eligma discovers a product that fulfills the user’s requirements, tokens will be
released to Eligma and returned to the user otherwise.

•

Second-hand listings
Users will have the option to push an item in their inventory to all the second-hand
online stores, connected to our platform. Eligma will require users to utilize ELI
tokens to perform this service.

•

Escrow fees
When a seller creates a listing and selects Escrow service as a possible feature to
complete the sale, he will be required to deposit ELI tokens for the service.

•

Decentralized Item Sale
When a seller and a buyer decide to complete an item sale in a decentralized way,
they will have to deposit the amount of ELI tokens, equivalent to the item price, as
a motivation to successfully fulfil contract obligations.

•

Advertising
ELI tokens can be utilized for advertisement space on the platform.

•

Other Eligma solutions
ELI tokens will be used for other Eligma’s solutions in both the offline and online
worlds. The first such solutions will be the POS systems and the marketplace for
our partner company BTC.

•

Purchasing selected items
Eligma will offer a limited amount of pre-selected items, which users will be able
to buy with ELI tokens only.

40

Eligma will use blockchain
technology and AI to create the
ideal customer experience.

Pilot project - Blockchain City
Every great project needs to start small – on the appropriate testing grounds. We wanted
a physical area with a lot of different stores, restaurants, business premises and a lot of
people movement. It was very fortunate that we did not need to look far. BTC City lies in
our office vicinity in Ljubljana, Slovenia and encompasses more than 10,000 brands, 3,000
companies, 450 stores and 70 bars and restaurants. It annually hosts over 20 million visitors,
who can also enjoy a food court, a recreation centre, a waterpark, a theatre, a cineplex,
hotels and a casino.
We have successfully cooperated with BTC in the past and when we approached them with
the idea, we discovered that we can write our story together–offline and online. The stars
aligned perfectly with the name as well, so we are calling it Blockchain city and using it as
our laboratory.
BTC is currently operating strictly offline and our first goal is to bring cryptocurrencies and
blockchain technologies into the mainstream by creating a unified marketplace, where
paying both with fiat and cryptocurrencies will be possible. This will simplify payment and
business processes and enable the creation of a central warehouse, from which any item
can be shipped.
Additionally we are enabling offline retailers to implement our POS solution that will
combine with the mobile wallet and operate as a cryptocurrency payment processor. BTC
City is already home to multiple blockchain companies and Eligma will expand its capabilities
to host future blockchain companies and projects with great potential.
After successful testing, we will have enough data to transfer all the technologies and
concepts from our testing ground to larger cities, where potential is limitless.

4.1

ONLINE PLATFORM
The first phase of the online platform is already developed and is currently operating in
test mode. It already supports payments in some cryptocurrencies (BTC, BCH) and more will
follow shortly.
The platform is curated by the enterprise start-up BTC and is enabling users to purchase
products, offered by the offline retailers in the BTC area. Items offered by the retailers are
currently limited to so called »Special deals«. Users can also browse through a complete
catalogue of products that can be bought in the BTC City area.
We will gradually transform the online store platform into a true marketplace of all the
retailers that are a part of the BTC City ecosystem. At that point, the retailers will be able
to manage their own profiles and item portfolios.

42

4.2

MOBILE WALLET
With a tailor-made mobile wallet and POS systems, we will also enable offline users to
use cryptocurrencies as a payment option in retail stores. As the adoption of POS systems
amongst retailers within the BTC City area is growing, it is slowly but surely becoming the
first fully covered cryptocurrency shopping centre.
Our mobile wallet possesses all the basic functionalities of mobile wallets:
•

Storage of different cryptocurrencies and tokens;

•

The ability for users to transfer funds to other wallets;

•

The ability for users to use it as a payment option on crypto payment-supported
points of sale;

•

The ability for users to view the transaction archive.

Beside these functionalities, it also offers users some additional features that will help us
gain more traction and collect more detailed and more accurate user data:
•

List of stores in the BTC City area;

•

Store details (opening hours, exact location, type of store, contact information, etc.);

•

Simple navigation to the stores;

•

Special discounts for mobile app users;

•

Notifications of special deals in the BTC City area.

To create a full service solution for the retailers, our POS systems will help introduce
cryptocurrencies to a wider public. These POS systems also accept payments with third party
mobile wallet solutions, but their main benefit will be visible when users will pay using
our mobile wallet, as those payments are free of transaction fees. Every purchase is also
rewarded within our loyalty program.
Our POS system is a web-based application and can be run on all modern operating systems
on desktop and tablet devices.

4.3

USER PROFILING
User profiling is a key ingredient in developing a strong AI algorithm for relevant search
results. This process is growing daily and exponentially. As we will need a lot of user data
even before Eligma’s launch, we used our partnership with BTC d.d. to develop the abovementioned solutions.

43

We will use both solutions to gather data on user/customer behaviour and purchasing
habits. The platform itself will be gathering online behavioural data and the mobile wallet
will serve for collecting offline data. This data will then be used for the machine learning
process to produce more precise user profiling in Eligma.

4.4

PILOT PROJECT TIMELINE
Our pilot project is already in motion and we have finished the development of beta versions
of the mobile wallet and the POS system. Our first integrations for real-life testing in retail
stores in the BTC City area will begin in March 2018. During this testing phase, we will be
carefully monitoring the product and making improvements where necessary. This testing
phase will end in Q3 2018 and by then we are planning to have at least a 10 % coverage
in the area.
In April 2018, we will launch the beta version of the online platform-BTC marketplace.
We will be testing the platform through the summer of 2018 and then launch a national
marketing campaign in September 2018.
We are striving to have the whole pilot product up and running in the beginning of 2019,
with retail stores coverage of at least 30 % in the area.

Business model and
execution plan

5.1

BUSINESS MODEL
At Eligma, we will implement several business models in the B2C and C2C segments.

5.1.1

Affiliate Program
Eligma’s main revenue stream will at first come from an affiliate program that is performancebased. While Eligma will serve as a window to all the different online stores and marketplaces
by merging them under one roof, the affiliation program will track the sales in stores, to
which users will be redirected and Eligma will receive a commission on those purchases. This
module is very popular amongst sellers, since they benefit in terms of marketing, visibility,
site visits and consequently higher sales. It enables additional marketing that is free, until
the purchase is actually made.

5.1.2

Commission-based
When Eligma implements a unified online shopping account, revenues will be made
through a commission-based model. Digital contracts will be signed with online stores and
marketplaces. For every order, placed through the Eligma platform, a commission will be
charged to the seller.

5.1.3

Advertising
Eligma is entering the online retail market that is anticipated to reach 4.48 trillion in 2021.
With a constantly growing user database, Eligma’s advertising space will lead to excellent
ad revenue opportunities.
Eligma will offer different advertising modules according to different posting places, sizes,
frequencies and durations. This feature will be payable with fiat currencies as well as more
popular cryptocurrencies. When advertising will be compensated with ELI tokens, users will
receive additional advertising rewards.

5.1.4

Third party Integration
Eligma’s product and online store database will grow exponentially by incorporating additional
APIs, adding manual product entries and using machine learning. Database will thus soon
become appealing for other companies. They will be able to access Eligma’s database via
APIs in accordance with monthly agreements set.

5.2

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
Our team is well aware of the complexity of the project, and therefore a clear project
development plan has been set in place. Its execution will have to be very methodical,
as we need to prepare a product that will support the scaling of server capacity and the
product itself.

5.2.1

Wishlists / Categories
In order to focus on parsing algorithms that will provide us with updated data on products
and online stores, we decided to test them in narrower groups called ‘wishlists’.

47

PLAN:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

5.2.2

Set first wishlists for focused data collection
Develop AI / machine learning algorithms for those wishlists
Test those algorithms on the market
Adapt the algorithms based on real use-case tests
Add new wishlist / category
Rollout tested wishlists / categories on new markets with new online stores

Data growth and blockchain
Our next step in scaling the item will be including wider sets of categories and moving wishlists
into one of the platform features. By doing so, we will expand Eligma from a narrow product
discovery provider to a provider that will enable discovery of entire product categories.
In this phase, Eligma will already operate as a channel, where you will be able to discover
the best deals according to your needs and will include an option to discover alternative
products using AI algorithms. Product purchase will be completed on the seller’s website.
In the same phase, we will also start introducing the user inventory functionality and start
putting DIPs on the blockchain.

5.2.3

Unified online shopping account
Further in the future, Eligma will start developing an interface, where users can manage
other online store accounts without visiting them.

5.2.4

Decentralized Loyalty program
To create a complete circle, Eligma will add a completely decentralized loyalty program,
where users will be able to create loyalty programs with their favourite sellers, brands,
offline stores, service providers, etc.

5.3

SCALING OF THE PRODUCT
Eligma will launch the testing phase for the product in Slovenia, where we will connect
to about 25 online stores. During this test phase, we will gather valuable data that will be
key for further development of the platform. We will be able to estimate the precision of
the discovery results and the possibility of finding a better deal on some of the unlisted
online stores.

48

Based on that data we will have the opportunity to scale in one of two ways - geographical
scaling or precision scaling.

5.3.1

Discovery results and precision scaling
Scaling for better discovery results is very straightforward-the more sources (online stores) we
have, the better the precision is. This kind of scaling will always be improving, as we will be
constantly adding new sources. In addition to that, Eligma’s machine learning and artificial
intelligence will improve with experience gained and thus provide better discovery results.

5.3.2

Geographical scaling
Slovenia will only be a testing ground to optimise Eligma for our intended market entry
strategy. Our first target for the product launch is the United Kingdom. With taking the
results of beta launch testing in Slovenia into account we will improve the product and use
the following strategy for penetrating the UK market:
1. Scrape global online stores that deliver to the UK;
2. Scrape additional local online stores;
3. Adapt the product using gathered data;
4. Launch the product;
5. We will continuously keep adding additional online stores.
The same process will be used for further geographic expansion, until Eligma is present
worldwide.

Token Crowdsale

8.1

GENERAL INFORMATION
•

Eligma token (code: ELI) is a fully ERC-20 compliant Ethereum utility token and
will be available in exchange for Ethereum (ETH) contributions.

•

Total number of ELI Tokens that will be generated during the Token Generation
Event (TGE): 500,000,00018 ELI

•

Number of ELI Tokens that will be distributed during the whole Token
Crowdsale process: 300,000,000 ELI (60 %)

•

Target sum of contributions in the Token Crowdsale process (hard cap): ETH in
equivalent of 24,000,000 U.S. dollars

•

Minimum sum of contributions (soft cap): ETH in equivalent of 3,000,000 U.S.
dollars

•

Offered Token exchange ratio: 1 ELI = 0.1 U.S. dollars

Details:
The Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure, where contributors disclose their personal
information, is mandatory in both phases before the contribution.
Our goal is to collect 16,000,000 U.S. dollars in the presale and an additional 8,000,000 U.S.
dollars in the public crowdsale in equivalent Ethereum contributions. The ETH/USD exchange
ratio can fluctuate, therefore these hard caps are just approximate values. Additionally,
unsold tokens in presale period will be transferred to the public crowdsale phase with a
different bonus, meaning that the total sum of collected contributions in ETH (in U.S. dollar
equivalent) can deviate from the target sum.
Tokens, not distributed in the presale phase, will be transferred to the next phase. Unsold
tokens in the crowdsale phase will be transferred to a fund, dedicated to reward plans for
Eligma platform users.
If the equivalent value of all contributions will not reach the soft cap, all contributions will
be returned to the contributors’ Ethereum addresses.
Excess contributions in ETH, received after the individual phase hard cap is reached, will be
bounced or returned to the contributing Ethereum addresses, reduced by the transactional
costs (gas).
Contributors should NOT contribute ETH directly from online exchanges, as ELI tokens will
be returned directly to those contributing address, which might not be able to accommodate
our tokens. All contributors MUST contribute ETH from their private Ethereum wallets.

18

This is a total number of all ELI tokens in existence. There will be no later issuance of ELI tokens.

66

All tokens will be distributed after the completion of the last phase and will be locked
(non-transferable) for a short validation period. After successful validation of the process,
all tokens will be unlocked and become transferable.
All dates are in the format: DD.MM.YYYY
For more information, please refer to the Terms of Sale available at [www.eligma.io/tos].

8.2

PHASE I: PUBLIC PRESALE
This phase is dedicated to our close Community members and early contributors that will
be able to obtain ELI tokens. We want to ensure that our ELI tokens will be well distributed
among long-term supporters and users of our platform. ELI tokens, not distributed in this
phase, will be offered in the next phase.
Phase duration: 20.3.2018 12:00:00 UTC - 10.4.2018 11:00:00 UTC or until the hard cap is reached
Phase target sum of contributions: ETH in equivalent of 16,000,000 U.S. dollars
Phase bonus: 15 % of additional ELI Tokens for all accepted contributions
Eligma however reserves the right to introduce an invite-only Private Presale contribution
period, where the bonus for the duration of the Private Presale contribution period may
be higher (at Eligma’s discretion). The ELI Tokens distributed during the Private Presale
contribution period will not exceed 50% of all the available ELI Tokens assigned to the
contributors. All the contributors in the Private Presale will be whitelisted.
Target amount of distributed ELI Tokens: 216,000,000 ELI
Minimum contribution: 0.1 ETH
Contributions validation time: 17.4.2018 8:00:00 UTC
An equivalent value of contributions in USD will be calculated at this time according to the average exchange
ratio on coinmarketcap.com.

PHASE II: PUBLIC CROWDSALE
This phase is dedicated to the general public, HNWIs and small contributors.
Phase duration: 17.4.2018 11:00:00 UTC - 8.5.2018 11:00:00 UTC or until the hard cap is reached
Phase target sum of contributions: ETH in equivalent of 8,000,000 U.S. dollars
This target sum is only an approximation that can vary due to fluctuations in the ETH/USD
exchange ratio. It will also be influenced by the fact that a total number of distributed tokens
might increase by the amount of unsold tokens from previous phases.

Phase bonuses:
•

8 % of additional tokens for the first 20 mio. ELI tokens

•

6 % of additional tokens for the second 20 mio. ELI tokens

•

4 % of additional tokens for the third 20 mio. ELI tokens

community requests a minimum of two days prior to the public crowdsale
Contributions validation time: 17.4.2018 8:00:00 UTC
