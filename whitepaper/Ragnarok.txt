Ragnarok Project Overview

By creating Ragnarok Coin (RAGNA) we made a cryptocurrency with a focus on
decentralization and a secure storage of RAGNA in digital wallets. It
utilizes an energy efficient Proof of Stake protocol, second-tier Masternode
network along with a blockchain and a financial model that would generate
income for RAGNA owners while utilizing itself for the security of the RAGNA
blockchain. We have also inherited, through a selected fork of PIVX, the
ability to provide for near-instant payments through SwiftTX. Ragnarok is a
form of online digital money that can be easily transferred
all around the world in a blink of an eye with nearly non-existent
transaction fees. You can buy RAGNA and just hold to earn rewards similar to
interest, trade on an exchange or buy crypto mining items online. To address
the issue of previous first-generation cryptocurrencies, the
network provides the owner the option to ensure fungibility of RAGNA through
the inherited functionality of PIVX’s Zerocoin Protocol.

Our main goals are to be an advanced digital currency that is fast and secure
which can be used to earn money online or buy crypto mining items from an
online store we will partner with, this is something that has not been done
before. This enables you to buy crypto mining items like GPU, Motherboards,
riser and so on without having to give anyone your credit card or payment
information

Proof of stake

Proof-of-stake algorithm is the storage of all the operations in Ragnarok
wallet and it requires a user
to have a certain number of RAGNA for them to have a chance of getting a
reward. Synchronization of the wallet nodes is running on proof-of-stake
which is carried out through the peer-to-peer network, P2P. This is more
efficient and environmentally friendlier than proof of work algorithm, in
which the user validates transactions and creates new blocks by performing a
certain amount of computational work. The longer you keep RAGNA in a wallet,
the more credibility that wallet will be given on the network. The wallet
will likely receive a block reward because of the relative weight that wallet
contributes to the protection of the network. The amount of time a wallet
participates in protecting the network is also a factor.

The node serves in the first layer of the hybrid cryptocurrency network by
confirming transactions on the blockchain, selecting a network masternodes
for instant transactions, and creating the next block for storing future
transactions.

Masternode

Masternode plays an important part in the RAGNA network. Masternode is the
second layer of the network that donates processing power to confirm
transactions instantly utilizing the SwiftTx technology inherited from PIVX.
In this 2 tier system reward is split between MNs and traditional POS
(staking) wallets. MNs require 10,000 RAGNA as collateral. Masternode receive
85% from the block reward and the remaining 15% is for traditional staking
wallets, these rewards are paid directly to the Ragnarok wallet that is
linked to the masternode. Using masternodes also ensures the stability and
security of the entire network and serve a special purpose within the network
to mix various transaction amounts to increase fungibility and anonymity of
transactions.

Prospective Partnership
Ragnarok has partnered with an online crypto mining equipment store which will
enable Ragnarok holder to buy crypto mining equipment very fast and safe. The
online store will be launching soon and when it ready you can easily spend your
RAGNA buying crypto mining equipment at a cheaper rate. You can check them out
by visiting the link on the flyer below
