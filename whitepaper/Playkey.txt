Executive Summary
Playkey, a leading cloud gaming provider, is contemplating an ICO with the intent of exponentially
accelerating the pace of cloud gaming development through decentralization. The aim is to provide
gamers with a reasonably-priced opportunity to play top rated games anytime and anywhere, using
any device connected to Internet, without having to purchase a high-end PC or console.
The revolution of cloud gaming has picked-up steam, but is still struggling through
some obstacles, namely:
• the complicated process of game streaming software development;
• getting approval from game developers and publishers to use their game titles on cloud platforms;
• the high cost of hardware (professional GPUs, server equipment, data storage equipment, etc.).
Playkey is based on proven working technology. The team of 45 experienced R&D specialists,
collaborate with leading game publishers including Ubisoft, Bethesda and Wargaming. Playkey
has a network of 120 Nvidia Grid powered servers based in London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam
and Moscow, and is backed by a large European VC fund.
Playkey aims to create an ecosystem for cloud gaming and other use cases
(“The Playkey Ecosystem”) featuring:
• Dozens of independent owners of powerful computers worldwide (“miners”) united within
a community, and acting as cloud gaming service providers;
• A single universal ecosystem cryptocurrency —the PKT token— which will be issued via the ICO;
• Unified high standards of cloud gaming service (SLA) set in the form of a miner-gamer smart
contract;
• A governing and community regulating body — Playkey Foundation, the issuer of the PKT token,
responsible for service and ecosystem development.
All parties benefit from participating in the Playkey Ecosystem:
• Miners get an efficient option to utilize their computational capacities that is more efficient, more
stable, and less risky than cryptocurrency mining;
• Gamers will be able to choose the best and closest server for playing;
• Game developers and publishers will expand their client base.
Funds collected through the ICO are will be used for development of the Playkey Ecosystem
and cloud gaming popularization. The main terms and conditions of the ICO and PKT token
are as follows:
• Total number of PKT to be issued is 100 000 000 units long-term non-inflationary;
• 60% of issued tokens are intended to be sold, 12.5% are reserved for the Playkey Foundation,
and the rest will be distributed among team, escrow agent, bounty and ICO advisors;
• PKT tokens are to be implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain in accordance with
the ERC20 (Ethereum Token Standard Tokens);
• Cap is set at PKT 100 000 000 (one hundred million) level;
• ICO proceeds are going to be used for the Playkey Ecosystem and cloud gaming
service development;
• The funds will be stored in ETH, bitcoins and US dollars after the end of the ICO to minimize
the risks.
Subject to the amount collected, the planned structure for fund use is as follows:
• Service marketing, promotion and PR – 25-45% of total fund;
• R&D expenses (mainly salaries and wages) – 20-50%;
• Infrastructural costs – 20-30%;
• Operational costs – 4-5%.

The Future of Gaming and the Playkey Mission
Gaming revolution – moving into the cloud
• Gaming is moving into the cloud, following video, music and other services. For gamers,
cloud gaming is 10x cheaper than owning personal gaming hardware (PC/console), leveraging
share economy principles.
• The development of GPUs, the Internet, and low-latency streaming, have diminished
the demand for personal gaming hardware. In fact, the next generation of consoles could
be the last one that is based on hardware.
• Moving gaming into cloud technology has now become inevitable – 70% of Steam players
are unable to play AAA titles like GTA V in high resolution, and 30% of players cannot even run
such titles on their obsolete PCs.
• The demand for cloud gaming will continue to grow. The demand for latest-generation hardware,
and the increased requirements from gaming caused by resource-intensive VR technologies,
will be making home hardware more and more expensive and non-viable for casual gamers.

Industry leaders predict – the future of gaming is streaming
PETER MOORE
CEO of Electronic Arts
”I’m not sure there will be consoles as we know them anymore.
Games will be accessed by streaming technology, so we don’t need
hardware intermediaries in between the two. If you and I want
to play Battlefield 12 against each other, we’ll just jump into a game
via whatever monitor we happen to have in our homes. It’ll
be on a chip, rather than in a box”

YVES GUILLEMOT
CEO of Ubisoft
“…For the new consoles, there’s nothing official on that so my
expectation is we will have another cycle of consoles before we go
to streaming…”

KATSUHIRO HARADA
Tekken/Bandai Namco director and producer
“When there’s the PS5, it will probably be just a controller
and a monitor. Then, the thing that will be left is the name
of the service”

AZAD MUKHUROV
Cloud Services Leader Russia&CIs of IBM
Home hardware quickly becomes obsolete. This is a constant
“arms race” for gamers . Do you want to play new games with high
quality? You should regularly pay for equipment upgrades. I think
cloud services are an excellent solution to this problem. It gives
way out of the vicious cycle and allows you to play new games
forgetting about regular upgrades.

The Playkey mission – to leverage the cloud gaming revolution during
the early stage by decentralization
• Allow all gamers to play any game they wish, on any device connected to the Internet, using
a decentralized cloud model, by leveraging the existing proprietary technology, product
and business of Playkey.
• Create the world’s largest platform and marketplace for all hardware providers, gamers and other
participants in the emerging industry of cloud gaming.
• Provide a decentralized ecosystem with a core platorm for miners and gamers, based
on blockchain technology, which provides private/professional GPU owners with a new way
to earn money. The way that is more efficient, more stable, and less risky than crypto-mining,
while providing gamers with an aﬀordable way to play AAA games, without using latest
generaton hardware.

Experts believe that the future of gaming is in the cloud, and Playkey
believes that it should be decentralized!

Gaming market size and the urgent need for streaming services
YVES GUILLEMOT
CEO of Ubisoft
Streaming will totally change the way we create and play games,
and will again positively disrupt how we think about gaming

The global entertainment market (games, music, video) has been actively moving into the cloud
for the past 5 years. Nowadays, users don’t need to download digital content to their devices
(computer, phone, laptop or tablet). Instead, they can consume it online from the cloud.
Up until recently, there were no working technologies that would allow the transmission of a highquality real-time image with minimal response time (ping < 100 ms), and without corrupted visuals,
hangs, or frame losses, while at the same time supporting the minimal-ping input from the user that
is crucial for cloud-streamed gaming — a condition that distinctively separates it from less demanding
media such as one-way video or audio streaming. Only a low-ping output and input solution can
provide the user with a seamless cloud-gaming experience on AAA titles, without having to purchase
expensive gaming hardware that can amount to over $1 500 on the current market. Now, Playkey
is one of the pioneering developers and providers of this technology.

GAMING MARKET SIZE
According to the Newzoo’s Global Games Market Report for 2017 there are 2.2 billion active gamers
in the world, of which 47% (1.0 billion gamers) spend money while playing. These gamers are expected
to generate $108.9B in game revenues in 2017 (for comparison, in 2015, the global PC games market
was estimated at $ 91.9B).

Also according to the report, consumers are spending more time than ever playing games,
and this is especially true for millennials. The reason for this, is that games now cater to a much wider
variety of interests. This includes “lean-forward” (gaming intensely or casually), “lean-back” (viewing
content created by peers or provided by the professional gaming scene), and “creating unique content
and sharing” (on-demand and live streaming).

The Playkey Cryptocurrency – The PKT Token
Purpose and technical description of the token
Playkey introduces an open source cryptographic token – PKT. PKT is a cryptocurrency that
will be used to buy and sell cloud gaming subscriptions as well as other Playkey services and future
products. It will be the unit of account for all economic transactions within the Playkey Ecosystem,
and will be used as a basis for interaction with other digital services.
PKT is a fixed-supply cryptocurrency. It is long-term non-inflationary. Units of PKT are fungible
and transferable, and they are expected to trade on cryptocurrency exchanges.
PKT will be implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain in accordance with the ERC20
(Ethereum Token Standard). Any token implemented according to the ERC-20 standard is compatible
with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem, which allows for quick and easy
implementation. Advanced functions and high activity within the Ethereum ecosystem make
it the most suitable for issuing PKT.

PKT Token usage opportunities
SHORT TERM
In the short term, PKT will be used for transactions between miners and gamers, and for purchasing
gaming software. During the first stage, Playkey will integrate the PKT wallet into all Playkey accounts
and will transfer all current transactions to PKT.

Initially, Playkey will be offering packages that can be used in smart contracts between miners
and gamers fixing gaming time (hour, monthly, weekly, others) and quality preferences (HD, Full HD,
Ultra). A smart contract monitors the specified conditions of achievement or violation of the contract’s
clauses, and makes independent decisions based on the conditions that have been programmed.
The smart contract ensures full automation and reliability of contractual relations between people.
The Playkey Foundation will be working closely with the miner community to recommend the most
mutually-beneficial pricing. However, the final pricing decision will be left to the miners themselves.
The Foundation’s goal is to build a sustainable business model so that gamers who are unfamiliar with
blockchain technologies can experience good quality gaming easily.
Special SLA (service level agreements) requirements will be developed for miners to ensure that
they provide an outstanding level of gaming quality to the user. The SLA will include the minimum
requirements for hardware, broadband channel bandwidth, and uptime.

MEDIUM TERM
In the medium term, Playkey will decentralize the infrastructure. Servers purchased by the Development
Fund after the ICO will be put on open auction, and every PKT holder will have the chance to purchase
computing capacity that will generate revenue for its owner.
Additionally, every miner will be able to create their own smart contracts to attract money from PKT
holders and provide gamers/communities with the opportunity to fund their local regional professional
miners so as to minimize latency and maximize the quality of the streaming service.

LONG TERM
In the long term, the Playkey Foundation will expand the ecosystem to cover R&D, marketing, game
development and publishing, in-game currencies, e-sport and live streams, apps and content creation.
The primary goal of the Playkey Ecosystem is to provide advantages and benefits to all participants,
which will fuel growth in the number of service providers and platform users. The key initial driver
of the ecosystem growth will be the cloud gaming services, which will provide high value both for miners
and gamers.

Miners’ benefits
Providing hardware to gamers will be:
• 2-3 times more efficient than any altcoin mining add opportunities;
• More stable in the short, medium and long term than cryptocurrency mining;
• Less risky than cryptocurrency mining due to its intrinsic value — the mining return is much more
predictable and mostly based on being an alternative to buying one’s own gaming hardware
(PC/console);
• A good alternative/hedging option for those private or professional miners who have already bought
GPUs and can’t use them effectively due to the increasing competition on the crypto mining market.

GAMERS’ BENEFITS
Gamers will get the following benefits:
• The ability to play AAA titles on obsolete/old/non-gaming (Mac) hardware (min. requirements:
CPU >= 1.5 GHz (for Video Adapter with H.264 hardware decoding support));
• The ability to receive high level SLA with low latency and great picture quality;
• The ability to play anywhere;
• The ability to play on any device – Mac, tablets, Smart TV, etc.;
• A plug’n’play solution to purchase playing time with just 1 click, without having to spend hours
downloading a game;
• The opportunity to pay 4x as few as they would pay for the gaming hardware, while receiving
the same benefits. The price of a gaming PC is $1 500. When purchased using a pay-monthly
scheme over a period of 3 years, the price for per month for that same PC is $41. A monthly cloud
subscription fee can be one-fourth of that price.

We expect that an open, decentralized cloud gaming market
will provide both private and professional miners with the opportunity
to generate 2-3 times more cash with a lower risk level than
crypto mining, and will decrease prices for gamers by 50%, which
will allow more gamers to play games, thus expanding Playkey’s user
base and number of hardware providers.

10

The Playkey Ecosystem
Playkey will be a blockchain-based decentralized ecosystem for gaming services
that will cover the following market segments and participants:
• The core participants in the Playkey Ecosystem are gamers and miners
(cloud gaming hardware providers). Playkey is expected to build a large,
private and professional community of miners, and become
the largest streaming service provider and marketplace in the world.
• At a later stage, Playkey plans on expanding the ecosystem,
decentralizing other functions (R&D, game publisher relations,
marketing), and connecting to the platform other gaming market
elements and segments such as developers and publishers, in-game
currencies, e-sport and live streams, apps and content creation.
During the initial stage, the Playkey Ecosystem will be supported
by the Playkey Company. In the future, Playkey is expected to transfer
its ecosystem to a fully decentralized independent model.

The core of the Playkey Ecosystem – cloud gaming
CLOUD GAMING ARCHITECTURE
The basic architecture of the service consists of the user choosing the server on the website,
connecting the client with the server, and fixing the contract at the beginning and the end
of the game.
A special trade service will be established to connect miners with gamers using smart
contracts. Miners will be able to develop their own smart contract terms (such as pricing), or join
the recommended terms based on the gaming market demand.

MINERS OVERVIEW
Miners are intended to be approved personalities or organizations with GPU-powered
hardware resources with powerfull CPU and RAM that are capable of virtualizing video games in high
resolution, with a high FPS rate and a wide broadband Internet connection.
Miners will get the most of the revenue in PKT and will share part of the revenue with the Playkey
Foundation for the purposes of further marketing, R&D and the integration of new games. These
percentages will be figured out by the Playkey Foundation on the basis of the customers’ needs
and the miners’ community feedback.
There are two types of miner profiles planned – basic (home/private) miners and professional miners
who place their hardware in Data centers with a Tier 2 or higher service level. We expect that anyone
should be able to become a miner. However, we want to develop an ecosystem with a 100% guarantee
that customers will get an outstanding level of game experience.
To start as a miner, the requirements are as follows:
1) Install the Playkey server side software on your virtual machine;
2) Setup and run the software;
3) Download games available in the Playkey service;
4) Test your miner node and pass the SLA (service level agreement);
5) Activate production mode and start mining!

SPECIAL SMART CONTRACTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
AND DECENTRALIZ ATION OF THE MINERS’ COMMUNITY
The Playkey Foundation will spend ICO funds to develop the miners’ ecosystem, provide support
for early miners, help miners to pass SLA tests, and be equipped to offer a high level of service.
The Playkey Foundation plans to spend 25% of the funds to support the Development Fund.
This organization will work to create the stability of the ecosystem and support the decentralized
network of miners. The Development Fund will buy servers, install them in the most efficient
locations, maintain them, and attract users.
A significant number of the servers will be regularly auctioned off, so that every PKT holder will have
the opportunity to buy a profitable server and generate revenue. The minimum price will be set
by the Development Fund using revenue multipliers, but will not be less than the price of purchase.
This scheme will be based on the Playkey Foundation smart-contract to guarantee transparency
and efficiency.
Additionally, every miner will be able to create their own smart contracts to attract money from
PKT holders and provide gamers/communities with the opportunity to fund their local regional
professional miners, minimizing latency and maximizing the quality of the streaming service.
12

This approach will be implemented as a process to create a stable and efficient decentralized
infrastructure.

Playkey Ecosystem further development –
other use cases
GAME DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLISHING
The Playkey Ecosystem will support a wide range of initiatives for game developers and publishers
to incentivize the creation of new games with the direct support of the gaming community.
• Direct connection between all the publishers and game developers, and the platform;
• Publishing and crowdselling of games inside the Playkey Ecosystem;
• Support for indie developers through donations and stimulation by Playkey Foundation initiatives.

MARKETING DECENTRALIZ ATION
The Playkey team believes that the next stage of decentralization will be marketing. It will provide
a wide range of tools for miners to attract users to their GPU-powered machines (for example, a web
service, a mobile application). Overall, these initiatives will provide transparent and fair terms for all
market stakeholders.
• Large professional miners or regional miner communities can execute local marketing campaigns
independently, including using their own mobile applications;
• CPA networks and YouTube bloggers can issue their smart contracts in which they would be paid
for each client that they send to a miner’s server;
• Game selling promotions for publishers via smart contracts.

gamers and teams with a wide range of fair and engaging competitions. Additionally, the team
will develop services to support and enhance the game streaming experience for both gamers
and streamers.
• Global and local gaming competitions via sponsorship, and additional services inside the Playkey
ecosystems;
• Services for E-sport teams, and sponsorship smart contracts;
• “Play now” button for stream viewers to directly start playing with the streamer;
• Cross-subscription prices – customers buying a stream channel subscription receive a bonus
for a cloud gaming subscription, and vice versa;
• “Stream now” function for gamers to motivate them to stream directly from the cloud.

GAMING CONTENT CREATION
Playkey will support the creation of content-related services, which will provide fair game reviews
and interesting content.
• Game magazines and blogs with different monetization schemes via smart contracts inside
the Playkey Ecosystem;
• YouTube streaming support via smart contracts with publishers and gamers;
• Game reviews or other content (video/text).

13

The Playkey Foundation
The Playkey Foundation is a management company within the Playkey Ecosystem.
It will be responsible for increasing the platform’s popularity, managing the key rules of the ecosystem,
and developing a core strategy.
The primary goal of the Foundation is to develop an open gaming ecosystem that users can find
value in, and simultaneously supply miners (and other service carriers) with an open and sustainable
platform to broaden, deliver, and enhance those services, as well as attract users.
The Foundation’s responsibilities will include managing the Playkey Company and financing
it for software development needs. The Playkey Company will also do all the negotiations with gaming
publishers, and will clear all the legal issues to make games available in the system.
The Playkey Foundation will direct and fund the development of tools that give ecosystem partners
the ability to build, grow, and create value for one another. The Playkey Foundation will further
this work by engaging development teams to continue improving the technology suite that supports
the Playkey Ecosystem.

Foundation management philosophy
The Playkey Ecosystem is viewed as a community of ecosystem partners (products and service
providers) – miners, R&D developers, game publishers and game enthusiasts – that are interconnected
via the use of PKT and their customers. The Playkey Foundation is meant to be an unbiased, nonprofit, and democratic governance frame for the members of the ecosystem.
The essential functions of the Playkey Foundation will consist of the open governance of its resources
collectively with different ecosystem partners, the advancement of the PKT implementation, and all
matters related to the ecosystem community.
The Playkey Foundation will administer a centralized ledger and execute on its defined policies
and protocols in an automated but trustful way, while working towards a fully decentralized method.
In order to fulfill its mission, the Playkey Foundation will dedicate resources to establish a fair
and transparent governance process that will take into account the voices and needs of all participants
within the ecosystem. This open governance model will oversee decisions related to legal matters,
content, and compliance guidelines.
Resources will be dedicated to foster the ecosystem by working with partners to drive value
creation and network effects.
To aid the Playkey Foundation in carrying out its mission, the Playkey Foundation will carry
PKT reserve. The Playkey Foundation is responsible for guaranteeing the security of the PKT
reserve, as well as transparency in the use of its funds. As part of its mandate, the Playkey
Foundation will create incentives for digital services and applications that create vibrant services
within the PKT Ecosystem.

Identity service
User identity becomes an important issue in a decentralized ecosystem of digital services,
as users should be able to transact without friction across multiple digital services. The Playkey
Foundation will maintain a consistent and easy to use identity service, that will allow to establish
and communicate a consistent identity across services, to maintain a single, robust wallet, and to own
an ongoing reputation within the digital environment. The reliability of storing such accounts
will be ensured by encryption protocols and algorithms of two-factor authentication. The Playkey
Foundation will also provide participants with the code and the required API to integrate identity
service.

15

Technical descriptions of the token and platform,
and their limitations
Playkey will initially implement a semi-centralized hybrid on-chain and off-chain transaction service
for scalable interactions with the PKT cryptocurrency. Playkey will develop and host a centralized
off-chain ledger with an API available to all digital service partners. However, the transactions in PKT
will be settled on the Ethereum blockchain.
This will help avoid network fees in transactions between users, and avoid stress on the public
network due to the large volume of transactions. It will also improve the user experience in terms
of latency.
The choice of such an implementation is based on Playkey’s experience. The expected daily
transaction rate could potentially surpass Ethereum’s throughput capability, posing the risk of network
congestion.
A purely on-chain architecture may not be optimal at the outset for two reasons:
• Ethereum transaction confirmation times result in a significantly delayed responsiveness that
is higher than what users typically expect from consumer applications;
• The Ethereum blockchain requires fees to be paid for every transaction. Fees are paid in Ether
cryptocurrency, creating an adoption barrier for the average user.
This is why the hybrid solution has been chosen. It creates a semi-centralized system in which end
users will enjoy a standard user experience, insulated from some of the complexity of blockchain
systems. However, this approach also has the drawbacks typical of a centralized system, such
as having to rely on trust between participants. In the long term, the Playkey Foundation will move
towards the migration of the transactional infrastructure into a fully decentralized system, while
retaining a low friction user experience.
In a decentralized ecosystem, users should be able to make transactions, without any friction, across
multiple digital services. Therefore, it is important that users establish and communicate a consistent
identity across services to maintain a single, robust wallet, and to own an ongoing reputation within
the digital environment. Playkey will support a consistent and easy-to-use identity service,
and will provide participants with the code, and the required API to integrate it.
It is necessary to achieve significant success in blockchain technology to provide highly-scalable, lowcost and cost-effective decentralized systems, and eliminate the need for semi-centralized approaches.
Progress is already being made in the areas of throughput scalability, sharding, efficient payment
channels, and decentralized governance protocols.
To accelerate the required advancements, Playkey would welcome the opportunity to work with
the blockchain technological community, and test these technologies in production by integrating
them into the PKT transaction services.parameters set by the gamer, will be implemented in
the future.

16

Gamer’s workflow
A typical gamer’s workflow will be as follows:

The public Ethereum network will serve as the currency’s decentralized settlement layer, providing
interaction with users who want to transfer PKT from the Playkey application and into it.
It will provide better experience for users interactng with PKT inside Playkey ecosystem.
This will solve problems in the early release of the system, such as blockchain scalability bottlenecks,
feeless transactions, faster transaction times and encapsulation of complex features. With
the development of blockchain technology, PKT will grow and will allow the provision of these
features in a completely decentralized environment.

Episode 1 development steps
DECENTRALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE
We will integrate Blockchain and PKT in our business processes, providing miners with opportunity
to lease their PCs and servers to gamers. To develop new features we will hire additional people
to rally marketing and R&D for Playkey Ecosystem.

MARKETING ACTIVITIES
Our primary objective is to make cloud gaming popular and available to every gamer in the world.
Marketing helps us achieve this objective. The more funding we get, the faster we will be able to scale
and launch Playkey in different regions. In Episode 1 we will concentrate on current markets – the US
and Europe.

INFRASTRUCTURE FUND
Our primary objective for this round is to decentralize infrastructure. To develop decentralized
infrastructure and support mining community we will setup Infrastructure fund. We will start with
$2m, and the more we receive the more we invest in the fund.

Episode 2 development steps (further to Episode 1 steps)
PRO MINERS PLATFORM
Pro miners are crowds, organizations, or private miners with large resources, which can organize
professional mining with a high level SLA (service level agreement) in professional data centers or
farms. We will develop a specific platform for miners, which will allow them to crowdfund their
growth and become professional miner organizations, so that they can supply their gamers with
cheaper and higher-quality SLAs. Pro miners will be able to receive PKT and share dividends with their
investors. The Playkey Foundaton will guarantee deals between investors and pro miners.

ANDROID CLIENT APPLICATION
We will develop a client for all Android 4.2 and higher versions that will allow you to launch Playkey
on any Android-based device (tablet, console, Smart TV, dongle).

MESSENGER
To further development of Playkey Ecosystem we will develop our launcher with built-in messenger
for text and voice chats.

MARKETING ACTIVITIES
In Episode 2 we will expand to the fast growing gaming market in Asia. In addition to marketing we
will setup Foundation’s servers there to provide first users with high quality service.

21

Episode 3 development steps (further to Episode 1 and 2)
SMART TV SERVICES
We will develop a client application for TOP smart TV models including LG, Samsung and Android
powered TVs, that will allow gamers to play on the big screen.

P2P CLOUD STORAGE NETWORK
A peer-to-peer cloud storage network implementing client-side encryption would allow users
to transfer and share data without relying on a third-party storage provider. This network will store
games builds and user profiles.

DECENTRALIZED WORK WITH PUBLISHERS
We will develop API for game developers to sell games inside Playkey ecosystem. In future,
it will provide an opportunity to make subscription based games with transparent billing system. That
system and Cloud Gaming principles will provide publisher with a piracy-free environment.

MARKETING ACTIVITIES
If we will reach Episode 3: US (United States), EMEA (Europe Middle East and Africa), APAC
(Asia and Pacifc) and LATAM (Latin America), we will have covered all the main regions.

Episode 4 development steps (further to Episodes 1, 2 and 3)
VR DEVICES AND GAME SUPPORT
VR games require double GPU and CPU power to render game objects, making the cost of VR-ready
hardware high. We will solve this problem by developing a low-latency, high resolution protocol that all
gamers with VR helmets will be able to utilize to play VR games without having to purchase hardware.

BIGDATA FOR GAME PUBLISHERS
Game publishers will be able to enrich gamers experience, using our tools for exploration gamers
habits, issues in games. All these will bring new quality standards for games in Playkey Ecosystem.

DECENTRALIZED MARKETING AND R&D
To further decentralization we will initiate creation of independent teams for R&D of core product
and new services inside Playkey ecosystem. Additionally, we expect that for better matching of miners
needs in marketing and opportunities for PR agencies, CPA networks we will open API to create smart
contracts for marketing inside Playkey Ecosystem.

THE PLAYKEY GAMING CONSOLE
We will develop a proprietary gaming console that will give gamers the possibility to play on a big
screen. The client application will be based on Linux, and the code will be open source, so that any
hardware manufacturer is able to develop its customized Playkey console version

OPEN PLATFORM FOR NON-GAME APPS
We understand that the Playkey solution is viable not only for games, but also for other applications
i.e. any software that can consume high CPU and GPU resources. Our plan is to develop
the ability to launch, virtualize and stream not only games, but also other software that can be in
demand for owners of obsolete PCs.

MARKETING ACTIVITIES
As we will succeed in our main regions, we will intensify our marketing for these and new regions with
lower population.

Marketing model
Goals of the marketing campaign
• Drive 10,000,000 gamer users into the decentralized Playkey gaming platform for 36 months.;
• Ensure a sufficient number of miners to meet the demand of gamers’ audience.

The target audience
• Gamers. Users of laptops, MacBooks, medium and weak PCs, for which games are one of many
hobbies. They are willing to spend 5-6 hours a week playing games, but this is not the main kind of
leisure, so they are not ready to invest in expensive gaming equipment.
• Miners. Individuals: owners of powerful gaming PCs, farms for mining.
Legal entities: data centers with a fleet of own servers.

Resources for the marketing campaign
We proceed from fees for ICO in dollar equivalent of 50,000,000 USD. Marketing accounts for
25% of fees. Thus, the marketing resource for achieving the above goals is USD 12,500,000. With
every transaction from a gamer to a miner, the Playkey Foundation receives a revenue share on
the development of the service, currently it is considered on the level of 25%. The deductions for
marketing will be 20% of this share. For example, the miner received $100. The Playkey fund will
receive $25 from the miner. Playkey Fund reinvests $5 in marketing.

Phases of the marketing campaign
1. Acquisition phase
The first 12 months since the public launch of the decentralized Playkey platform.
The goal of the phase is 1 million gamers on the platform.
2. Scalability phase
Next 24 months.

PKT token price mechanics and economics
Key considerations
• PKT is a utility token, it means any PKT holder may use the token to pay for Playkey cloud gaming
service (short time rent of Playkey GPU powered servers to play video games);
• PKT is the only mean to pay for Playkey service, i.e. to have an access to Playkey service user
needs to have PKT which he/she transfers to the miner who provides the service (the analogue is
internal currency in computer games like gold in World of Tanks, which you need to have, to buy
more powerful shells and consumables);
• Demand for the Playkey service creates demand for PKT tokens;
• Number of tokens is limited, but service demand has a potential for growth => increase of
demand for service leads to increase of PKT price on the market and vice versa;
• Miners are not obliged to sell PKT tokens immediately after receiving them;
• Playkey as a miner and as a licensor of software solution (miner ought to pay some share of their
PKT revenue to Playkey) may absorb supplies of PKT token on the market to decrease its price
volatility.

Basic mechanics for PKT pricing
Any point of time there is a demand for Playkey service from gamers, who are ready to pay some
amount of money (expressed in fiat or any other cryptocurrency, not PKT) for service subscriptions
(hereinafter, instant demand).
Gamers buy PKT tokens directly on exchange or through an agent (including Playkey website) and set
up a smart contract with miner to get required service paying miners with their PKT tokens.
Generally, gamers are not interested in PKT and its price, they worried about the price for the cloud
gaming service they get for their money.
Thus, assuming some number of PKT tokens available for sale, the price is defined as:
PKT price = Instant demand / number of PKT available tokens for sale
For example, there is an Instant Demand for a service for the total amount of $200,000 (20,000
gamers are buying monthly subscriptions at a price of $10) and there are 100,000 tokens available on
the market. Than the PKT price is $2 = $200,000 / PKT 100,000.
The supply of PKT tokens is formed:
• By miners earned tokens providing the service;
• Other PKT token holders (ICO participants, bounty, employees, Playkey Foundation, etc.).
To avoid the situations, when the gamer acquired some number of PKT tokens to get an exact volume
of service, but no miner ready to provide the service for this number of tokens, it is planned to provide
quotation for the service from miners simultaneous with the purchase of token.
Later Playkey Foundation plans to acquire and install servers with subsequent sale of these servers
to miners for PKT tokens as well as to launch new convergent services. This will create additional
demand for PKT tokens in future.
Key factors influencing PKT price
Demand for Playkey service and a number of PKT tokens for sale are basic and fundamental factors,
but there are many other factors influencing the PKT price.

25

Positive correlation
• Number of users;
• Users’ life time (how long users use the service);
• Total servers capacity (no servers -> no service -> no users);
• Positive news on service development and overall transparency of Playkey project;
• New goods and services available for PKT tokens.
Negative correlation
• Supply of tokens (bigger the number of tokens for sale, the lesser the PKT price);
• Negative news;
• Competition and substitutes.
Playkey ICO’s main objective is to integrate blockchain and P2P model and to raise funds for service
further development and promotion worldwide to become the market leader and to have dozens
millions of users. Moving towards this objective demand for the service is expected to grow followed
by PKT price increase.
The basic economic model of Playkey is described below.

Economics of Playkey
Demand for Playkey service is a key fundamental factor for PKT price change.
Basic economic model for Playkey service promotion and generating revenue stream/demand (key
assumptions):
• Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is $10 / user;
• User uses the service in average for 4 months;
• Revenue per user is $10 per month;
• Variable costs are $4 / user (servers lease payment, collocation, electricity);
• Playkey reserves server capacity for new users for 1 month;
• All profits are reinvested.
Playkey spends $14 (CAC + cost of one month reserve of server’s capacity), and from the next month
Playkey receives revenue from the user in amount of $10 / months during next 4 months:

First 4 month: investing $14 Playkey receives $10 of monthly revenue and $6 positive cash flow every
month during next 4 months ($24 in total), i.e. $1 (one) dollar invested gives a monthly revenue of $0.7
and a positive cash flow stream of $0.4 per month during the next 4 months ($1.6 in total).
5-8 months: reinvesting $24 in the next month gives the revenue of $17 monthly and $9.6 positive
cash flow ($38.4 in total).
9-12 months: reinvesting $38.4 it gives monthly revenue of $26.9 and $15.4 positive cash flow ($61.4
in total).
And so on.

26

Summarizing, spending $14 for service promotion and further reinvesting all cash streams, by the end
of 12 months period Playkey may have monthly revenue of $38.4 (i.e. demand for the service backed
by servers capacity).
Every $1 spend on service promotion results in $2.7 of monthly revenue (demand) in 12 months
period of time.

Change of customer acquisition costs, user’s lifetime, user’s average spending on service, time lag
while allocating financing among marketing partners and hardware distributors may significantly
influence Playkey economics in both ways.
P2P model will speed up the expansion of the service dramatically saving time and money for
equipment purchase and installment.

How the gamer will pay for the service after the ICO
1.

After the ICO the process of paying for Playkey service subscription will be not changed for casual
gamers:
1.1. The user goes to Playkey web site, chooses the subscription he/she wants, and pays in fiat
currency according to recommended fiat currency prices, as he/she usually does and did
before.
1.2. Then Playkey converts collected fiat into PKT token on the exchange for behalf of the
gamer.
1.3. Then Playkey transfers acquired on the exchange PKT tokens to miner and simultaneously
set up a smart contract in accordance with the terms chosen by the gamer (total number of
hours of service, 30 or 60 FPS, HD ready / Full HD resolution, etc.).

The gamer will have an option to acquire PKT tokens on the exchange by himself and use these
tokens to pay for Playkey service:
2.1. Gamer acquires any number of PKT tokens he/she wants on the exchange by the price set by
the market.
2.2. Gamer transfers PKT tokens to the miner and concludes the smart contract with the miner to
set up the volume and parameters of the service he wants to have (total number of hours of
service, 30 or 60 FPS, HD ready / Full HD resolution, etc.).
