VISION

Escrow Services powered by Blockchain Technology

We have developed a secure and trustworthy platform
where buyers and sellers can transact, knowing their
money is safe.

3

THE PROBLEM

Escrow Services powered by Blockchain Technology

A conventional transaction
can take days to complete
as disputes are handled by
the Escrow company.

Online Fraud is growing
exponentially without
any real solution.

With conventional Escrow
there is always the
possibility of corruption
and the bribing of officials.

THE SOLUTION

Escrow Services powered by Blockchain Technology
The major difference between Conventional and
Decentralized Escrow is that with Decentralized Escrow, the
blockchain and Smart Contracts are the Escrow company.
This ensures that transactions are:

exponentially quicker

more secure

a fraction of the price

individuals who can
cast votes on a
dispute transaction.

Nodes will be
awarded points for
casting valid votes,
inspiring
confidence in the
platform.
