Goals and Objectives
#MetaHash is a decentralized network for digital asset exchange and a platform for building decentralized applications that work in real time

The popularity of cryptocurrencies in 2017 caused thousands of blockchain projects of different scales and focus to appear. However, the
growth of most of these projects was limited by the technical capabilities of the existing blockchain / operators / networks.
The low speed, closed nature of blockchain networks, and their inability to interact with each other, are the real problems slowing down the
development of this technology in general. #MetaHash is designed to
create a single solution that allows blockchain systems of the future to
unite into a single decentralized network, capable of recording each and
every transaction.
The self-regulating #MetaHash network, in fact, creates a basis for the
emergence of a fully-fledged branch of the decentralized internet. It
doesn’t depend on individual creators once launched and is managed by
open voting1 of users or #MetaHashCoins2 holders.
A fully decentralized internet would bring freedom from the control of
large corporations. Project management would be in the hands of end
users.

The #MetaHash platform allows
any project to become fully
decentralized. Thousands of
projects require decentralization
right now, but the speed and
capabilities of existing blockchain
operators aren’t sufficient to meet
those needs

The key distinction of decentralized projects running on open source3
code is the fact that they are built the way users need them. Projects are
created for users rather than for maximizing benefits to a limited group
of stakeholders, which harms both the market and the users.

#MetaHash enables the creation of:
Decentralized applications that work in real time like ordinary web
services and applications and can respond to events both in any of
the blockchain networks and on the regular internet;
Independent sub-chains protected by the main #MetaHash network that also operate on the basis of the #TraceChain protocol.
These sub-chains are created so thousands of #MetaApps can
cost-effectively operate without overloading the main network and
slow other applications. Lots of applications are waiting for a solution to build isolated, cost-effective and secure chains that would let
them transfer the required data;
Digital assets in the form of tokens in the #MetaHash network
for sharing within the network and converting to the tokens (digital assets) of other networks. Any asset in another blockchain
system (ETH, ERC20, Bitcoin) can be converted to #MetaHashCoins.
#MetaHash supports the concept of blockchain interoperability assuming that the future of the internet lies in the ability of independent networks to interact and integrate with each other.

Open voting means that any voter can get
access to the results of voting and see
the IDs of participating wallets and their
decisions.
#MetaHashCoins (#MHC) is the internal
currency of the #MetaHash network.
An open-source project allows any user
to access its code and use it to create
their own version of the application, or to
improve the current version.

White Paper 5

Problems and Solutions
We believe in the future of cryptocurrencies. But today it is far from perfect.
#MetaHash represents all the blockchain-powered opportunities of the future
embodied in a single project
What needs to be changed

Why it is important

Existing cryptocurrencies

#MetaHash

Significantly increase the
number of transactions per
day

Will allow cryptocurrencies to
come into the real world

Up to 2 million transactions
per day

More than 5 billion transactions per day

Ability to send a transaction
free of charge

The ability to use #MetaHashCoins for micro-transactions

Often up to $80, or even
$400 per transaction including the reward to miners

Free for the user for most
transactions.
Fees appear as network
load grows to protect the
network against spam
transactions

Transition from PoW (mining)
to multi-PoS (forging)

Mining limits possible transaction speeds of the network
and requires expensive resources to protect the network

Dependant on hardware
that costs billions of dollars,
wastes electricity and pays
billions to miners

Forging #MetaHashCoins
with nodes and wallets provides the most
important resources and
eliminates pointless ones

Protect the network from a
"money attack" that could
interfere with the network

The growth of cryptocurrency
capitalization will inevitably
lead to a growing number of
hackers trying to block the
network's operations

Less than 1% of the current
capital of ALL leading cryptocurrencies is enough to
block their work

An additional verification
step provided by wallets
will not allow hackers to
block or corrupt the network, even if they possess
67% of nodes or coins

Increase the speed of transaction approval

Increasing the speed of the
transaction affects the ability
to implement the technology
in everyday operations

Minimum 30 seconds for first
approval and minimum 1.5
minutes for final approval

1 second for first approval
and under 3 seconds for
final approval for most
transactions

Implement the built-in mechanism of "tokenization" of any
assets

The ability to exchange digital
assets used by blockchain
networks makes the technology available to people who
do not have special programming skills. This contributes
to quicker introduction of the
technology in the social sphere

Currently, the best solution
only allows the creation of
tokens if you have advanced
programming skills, and can
result in loss of money. The
smart contract technology
is not transparent to people
who do not know programming

Any asset, even other
networks' cryptocurrencies, can be instantly
"tokenized" in #MetaHash
without knowledge of programming. Token information is simple and easy to
understand

White Paper 6

#MetaHash Structure
The #MetaHash network
consists of four parts
#TraceChain
The solution to the speed problem is based on an automatic self-learning algorithm for routing signals over the network. Starting at a rate of
50,000 transactions per second (the capability of a 100-megabit channel), it grows as more nodes with higher bandwidth are added to the
network forming the core of the network and improving the reliability of
additional #DataChains which are needed for running applications.

#MetaApps
Nodes added to the #MetaHash network are used by decentralized applications. The core code of #MetaApps optimizes the location of application copies based on required resources and financial motivation of
the owners of nodes connected to the network. Any developer can create
and publish an application in #MetaApps, and #MetaHashCoin holders
will decide by open vote whether or not to approve it, reflecting the universal values of all the network members.

Four components of the system
form a single, synergistic
solution that allows complex
decentralized applications to
work in a real-time mode,
even with high system loads.
The technical complexity of
the system is hidden behind a
user-friendly interface, making it
accessible to ordinary users

#MetaGate
This is an open source interface using the #TraceChain protocol making it
possible to work with #MetaApps and networks. Third-party developers
can use the #MetaGate code to embed #MetaApps and #TraceChain/
blockchain features into various applications and browsers.

#MetaHashCoin
The network's digital payment currency. It is used to ensure consensus,
to pay for all network services and to control self-financing. Recognised
by FINMA on July 3, 2018 as Utility token with payment function. #MHC
tokens are qualified as payment means in accordance with the AntiMoney Laundering Act.

White Paper 7

#TraceChain

#TraceChain
Technology
#TraceChain is the new internet protocol that the #MetaHash network is based on.
#TraceChain uses a mathematical model of optimal signal propagation
across the network. The synchronization of thousands of computers
overloads a network and slows it down. To solve this issue, #TraceChain
relies on mathematical algorithms powered by #TraceChain AI - all signals go from the outer radius to the cores. The signals are synchronized
in multiple powerful cores and go back across the network.

All existing blockchain systems
(those already available
and those that are under
development), are too slow
and expensive or are not fully
decentralized

The more computers that need to be simultaneously synchronized, the
higher the load on the network. The cores are not static and are constantly altered by voting. Adding high-performance computers to the
network does not automatically make them cores, which protects the
network against attacks. The core's segments are fully decentralized
and protected by Trust algorithms and additional verifications. The performance of the network core's segments is checked and protected by
external radiuses.

Main Advantages
Comparison with current and prospective decentralized blockchain
systems:
Modern blockchain projects imply that cryptocurrency can only be
used by technical specialists, traders and blockchain enthusiasts.
Cryptocurrencies are complex and incomprehensible to a mass
audience;
Today, none of the existing or prospective systems provide sufficient speed and convenience to make blockchain solutions usable
on an industrial scale;
Speed, high transaction fees and huge complexity are the issues
that the #TraceChain1 protocol is designed to address.

White Paper 9

Bitcoin
PoW (Proof of Work) is a reliable, but very expensive, network integrity
protection mechanism. The four Bitcoin mining pools fully control the
network and comprise 60% of Bitcoin hash power. These four pools
form the longest chain, which is considered valid in case of conflicts.
The synchronization process in blockchain is renowned for the problem
of slow nodes. The network is slow as long as its nodes are slow. A
significant portion of the Bitcoin network is physically located in places
with cheap electricity and slow internet (most often 3G).
A lot of Bitcoin nodes have such low bandwidth that increasing a block
size limit from 1 to 4 MB would cut off a significant part of the network.
Bitcoin's most pressing issue is that its core resources are concentrated in the hands of people who are, most often, not stakeholders.
Miners are interested in maximizing their income and exchanging coins
to regular currency to cover electricity and equipment costs. Thus, PoW
miners always act against the interests of the blockchain network. At
any time, any blockchain miner can redirect the mining power to
another blockchain platform.

Bitcoin forks and systems built on a similar code
Typically, they are characterized by higher bandwidth and a bigger block
size. Bitcoin has enough power to store transactions, but it is still not
enough to run applications.

EOS
EOS is a reliable and fast banking system. However, it is centralized. 20
supercomputers control the network and provide a maximum number of
votes. These top 20 computers synchronize transaction data and receive
all commissions. Sometimes the commission is paid to one more computer which is chosen on the basis of the weight of votes cast in its favor.
As the top 20 servers are static, they attract high amounts of delegated
coins and the system gets highly centralized as it is almost impossible
to get a new server to the top 20.

Lightning Network
Lightning Network features an excellent concept of transferring data
between several participants. The system works well if a group of participants needs to make a lot of transactions amongst themselves in
the course of a day. The group's money is stored in the multi-signature
wallets of the participants. However, this platform has a limited use, because the same group of participants are unlikely to need to exchange
data multiple times. When a transaction has to move outside the organized group, there is no gain in speed and it is limited by the bandwidth
of the network within which it operates.

MetaHash.org

hello@metahash.org

White Paper 10

Ethereum
Ethereum features a good implementation of PoW, but at a very slow
speed caused by direct synchronization between a multitude of participants and low throughput of many PoW nodes.
Its smart contracts are of particular value because they enable response
to events in the Ethereum network, but unfortunately they cannot react
to anything else and are unsuitable for real-time applications.

Ethereum Plasma
This is a very good solution for increasing the bandwidth of the Ethereum network. Transfers of tokens and application data take place in
separate blockchains and are based on the principle of PoS consensus,
with anchors stored in the main Ethereum blockchain which operates on
the PoW algorithm. This will significantly improve the performance of
smart contracts that only respond to events in the Ethereum network.
But the speed of the main network will remain low and average users
will still be unable to use wallets due to a very low block download speed
(up to several days), even after a weekly break in use and the huge size of
the current chain which has to be fully downloaded onto your computer.
Light wallets could be an alternative solution, but using them could be
risky because projects associated with them are under-funded.

Other projects we are aware
of do not have the sufficient
documentation or coding to be
considered serious alternatives

What Makes #TraceChain Stand
Out From Existing Projects?
We couldn't find any project focused on creating a fully decentralized and synchronized network capable of
quickly processing data on a large-scale, global basis, so
we created #MetaHash
#MetaHash offers a solution that ticks all the boxes
as a next-generation blockchain platform:
Full decentralization
You should never trust a network that is not decentralized enough.
Full synchronization
If high speed and sufficient bandwidth are achieved through
reduced network synchronization, transferring data between network parts will eventually become problematic, outweighing the
benefit.

Many of the current projects
feature clear and useful ways of
application yet fail to fully meet
the needs of the market

Transaction speed under three seconds
The longer a transaction takes, the less convenient it is to use the
system, and the more difficult it is for decentralized applications to
run in full capacity.
High bandwidth
The amount of transactions per second is not just another number.
High bandwidth allows the network to keep transaction prices low
because it has sufficient resources to process more transactions
per unit of time.
Low prices
The lower the transaction price, the more potential customers are
interested in using the platform to store their financial transaction
info and technical data.

Testing function

Node trust evaluation

It would be required to know the performance of each
node and the data transfer rate between nodes to
create an optimal TraceChain AI network map. Therefore, #TraceChain AI randomly puts some nodes into
testing mode to collate information. The tests are
specifically designed so that even if a node is corrupt, it will not be able to report the performance or
speed above the claimed figures and will not be able
to identify it is being tested, because this information
is only revealed at the end of the interaction.

The best protection against a brute-force attack is
blocking the node after an unsuccessful attempt. This
is the method we use to evaluate node trust. If a
node processes a transaction incorrectly, it resets its
trust level. A node can achieve 99% trust value after
approximately 6 months of continuous activity. If a
node is used to disrupt or slow down the network,
it loses the accumulated trust value and will not be
used to its full potential for a long time. In addition,
Trust Nodes also affect the votes required for other
types of consensus.

We also use the data on the actual node performance in the decentralized network under normal
operating conditions of the system to calculate node
performance, thus eliminating the inaccuracies of
the testing methodology.

White Paper 16

#TraceChain AI
Each node features a code that votes for the roles to be assigned to other nodes in the moment. As a result of the
voting, every available node receives the roles for several subsequent cycles of the network's life.

#TraceChain: Node roles

#TraceChain AI

1. Peer Nodes
These nodes deal with wallets and external services.
They protect the internal parts of the network from
external overloading caused by signal reception and
distribution, including dDos attacks. At the same
time, they protect the network's core parts against
the threat of corruption.
2. Master CoreNodes & Slave CoreNodes
The fastest and most reliable nodes become the core
of the network; they receive the maximum reward
and form commits. Any Slave Node can at any time
become Master Node and start performing corresponding functions. In the Slave mode, they check
the accuracy of Masters' work and reduce their workload in terms of signal distribution among verification nodes.

Testing Function

3. Blockchain Backup Nodes

6. #MetaApps Nodes

These nodes verify network integrity and check for
correct functioning of the core. In addition, blockchain Backup Nodes run a voting procedure if the
core of the network is successfully attacked

Many services, such as smart contracts and decentralized apps, require extensive resources in order to
execute work. In #TraceChain, there is a separate fee
for execution of work not related to transactions;

4. Verification Nodes
Approved transactions are sent to these nodes which
verify the functioning of Master and Slave Nodes and
transmit the information to Peer Nodes for distribution to wallets.
5. Proxy Nodes
Most wallets by default are light wallets that trust
the network consensus, but any wallet can become a
full wallet, decide not to trust the network and store
all the transactions itself. This is a high load that requires a good internet connection and enough space
on the disc to store large amounts of data. A wallet
doesn't need to store all transactions; it can store
the transactions following the last trim or work with
trusted full nodes only.

MetaHash.org

hello@metahash.org

7. Test Nodes
All nodes go to test mode from time to time, collecting technical data concerning node speed capabilities
and the speed of data transactions between nodes,
which is used by #TraceChain AI to create an optimal
network map and assign roles. Of course, the testing function is not the only one that determines node
performance.

White Paper 17

#TraceChain Multi-consensus
To finalize the voting procedure, 67% of nodes in each of their possible
roles must validate the transaction. The use of multi-consensus rules
out the possibility of gaining control over the network even with a concentration of more than 67% #MHC on one hand or gaining full control
over a network's part. In addition, the PoS multi-consensus regards every network member as important, not only the owners of the largest
share of resources. 67% is a mathematically backed value that proves
the need and sufficiency of exactly 67% of nodes.

#TraceChain uses multiconsensus voting on node roles,
supported by the multiPOS
(Multivote Proof of Stake)
principle

Technology Development
This document describes the principle of operation of the distributed
network, which is launched together with the ICO Round A. While developing the current protocol, we are testing an alternative network synchronization option featuring unlimited transactions (up to millions of
transactions per second), reduced latency and increased protocol security. In this regard, the version described below may be different from the
final public release.

#MetaApps

#MetaApps
Decentralized cloud for real-time applications
High speed, decentralization and the ability to handle
high loads shape the new, decentralized internet
With #MetaHash, any program written in any programming language
under any operating system can become a decentralized app and work
with both data from the internet and data from any blockchain system.

#MetaApps

#MetaApps run in real time as regular websites and services, but
they are decentralized and even their creator cannot change their behavior unless their users or owners of their digital assets (tokens) cast
their votes.

Run in real-time mode

#MetaApps is an evolution of smart contracts and can be used to decentralize any service. These are independent programs that can exist
forever and do not belong to anyone. They work exactly as programmed
and cannot be tampered with by third parties.

GUI

Any developer can create a #MetaApp from code
in any language
Program and operation systems image uploads onto the network
and starts automatically on numerous computers.

As fast as regular web services and
applications

Can look like ordinary applications
or webpages

Work exactly as
programmed
No one can change the
application's behavior by bypassing
the update rules

Are created in any programming language including C++, PHP,
Solidity and others. Compatible with any OS.
Full support of smart contract functionality. #MetaApps can work
with any blockchain or just with data from the internet.

Ready-made modules for applications
The #MetaHash network will include an array of decentralized modules to accelerate the development of new projects.
For example, creators of each project will be able to use the existing
#MetaChains service instead of creating their own Bitcoin or Ethereum
parsing scripts. Projects requiring a decentralized database will be able
to use #MetaDataBase. The basic functions of the protocol support the
creation of #MetaTokens and data networks protected by the basic consensus of the #MetaHash network.

MetaHash.org

hello@metahash.org

White Paper 20

Self-financing Applications
The number of computers running a copy of a #MetaApp depends on the
amount of #MetaHashCoins generated per day as well as its resource
consumption. Anyone can top up the account from which #MHC will be
debited. Alternatively, a certain percentage of an app's income may be
transferred to its account.

This model gives rise to
fundamentally new type of
projects and the way in which
they exist and are launched

Any app developer can program an application to use a certain share of
its revenue to support its work in the network and keep the rest of the
revenue to finance further app development. In this model, the team
that develops an application can be selected by the users of the project
by general voting. The issues of marketing and the need for other services can be addressed collectively, too.
Following the logic described above, we can create a social network
that:
Is controlled by general voting of #MHC holders and the project's
active users;
Encrypts data and user messages, so no one has access to them;
Is self-financed.

Here is an example of a decentralized self-financed
social network based on the #MetaHash platform:

The Project Team launches a ICO Round A to finance the development of the project;
The finished code of various project nodes is uploaded into the
#MetaHash network and these nodes' wallets receive funds. The
nodes' code is automatically deployed in #MetaHash;
Users' publications are encrypted and stored in the #MetaHash data
network. They can only be decrypted by users who are "added as
friends" and therefore allowed to see updates. Thus, only those who
are on the user's list will be able to get the key to decrypt and read
current and past updates published by this user. Private messages
are encrypted with end-to-end encryption and are only available to
their recipients, despite the fact that they are stored publicly;

Please note that the described
example is just a concept.
The implication of such a project
would require detailed planning,
which cannot be done within the
framework of this White Paper

After the ICO, the project is financed through ad sales carried out
in #MetaHashCoins or through the "Disable ads" user function. The
team supporting the project as well as the project's Marketing Team
get paid in #MHC while a certain amount of #MHC is exchanged
through the automatic decentralized exchange service and credited
to the wallets of the project's nodes.

Applications developed by the
#MetaHash Team
#MetaChains
Decentralized parsers of all popular blockchain platforms.
In order for #MetaApps to immediately respond to events in any blockchain system, we will release decentralized parsers allowing the use of
API to get balance info and transaction history from wallets across various blockchain platforms.
This will allow applications to respond to different blockchain events and
verify data accuracy by sending queries to network nodes.

#MetaToken
The app's features include:
Automatic tokenization of #MHC into ERC20 digital assets and
others;
Conversion of any digital assets into #MHC;
Transferring digital assets between #MetaHash, blockchain and
Ethereum wallets.

Tokenization of digital assets:
Using the data provided by the #MetaChains app and taking advantage
of the protected and automated decentralized data storage service, the
user can convert any blockchain network's token into #MHC and use it
in the #MetaHash network. If required, the asset can be automatically
converted back and transferred to its original blockchain network. This
way, any digital asset (token) can be turned into a #MetaToken and used
in the #MetaHash network.
The protected and automated decentralized data storage service will
be created under the supervision of #MetaHash Company, but financed
from data storage fees. They will not belong to the #MetaHash Company.

A digital asset, equal in value to
the original token, is created within
the #MetaHash network. At the
same time, the original asset is
frozen on the blockchain platform
it belongs to. Tokenization has the
retroactive effect of converting a
#MetaHash asset into an original
token

#MetaStorage
Decentralized data storage service allows you to work with public encrypted data stored in the #MetaHash network, as well as with individual data nodes that are funded by an application using this data.

#MetaICO
The application allows the release of #MetaHashCoins through the
#MetaToken interface without knowledge of any programming language, using a combination of settings.

MetaHash.org

hello@metahash.org

White Paper 22

In addition to simplifying the process of creating #MHC, it is very important to support the protocol and create a comprehensive protection environment against hackers by code verification on multiple applications.
At the moment, all ICOs are held using smart contracts. Creating, executing and understanding their results would require extensive knowledge
of programming. #MetaICO offers a new ICO model. Absolutely anyone
will have an opportunity to hold an ICO using tools similar to smart contracts. The tools offered by #MetaICO will be simple enough to be used
by people who don't have any significant programming skills.
#MetaICO will accept any cryptocurrency using the data received from
the #MetaChains app and convert the #MetaHashCoins into Ethereum
tokens and other ERC20 tokens of other networks.

#MetaICO application will allow
any ICO porticipant to use their
digital assets (tokens) in any
network, not just the #MetaHash
network, facilitating the storage
of various projects' digital
assets (tokens) and providing
connection to various token
exchanges

Censorship in #MetaApps
Although the idea of applications that cannot be blocked or deleted
sounds wonderful, we must not forget that some people would want to
use the system to harm others.
We believe that we have to apply censorship, but it is not for individual
people to decide how this will be manifest, but rather for the whole
#MetaHash community. This will be done through open voting.

placement rules, the #MetaHash
community will always take into
account all applicable laws

Blocking an application
The open voting procedure is initiated if 10,000,000 voting coins
have been accumulated in favor of blocking an application. The
voting takes a month.
If an application gets 100,000,000 voting coins, the voting period is
reduced to one week.
If an application gets 500,000,000 voting coins, the voting period is
reduced to 24 hours.
As a protective measure against numerous malicious applications, a deposit sufficient for three months of hosting the application (not less than
10,000 #MHC) will be required in order to upload an application. This
figure may be changed by a general vote. If an application is blocked, the
remaining deposit is frozen.
If 67% of votes in favor of blocking the application are gathered by the
end of the voting period, it is blocked.
The application owner can file an appeal, unblock the application and
return the deposit. The appeal is subject to the same rules as blocking
and is successful if 67% of votes are cast in favor of unblocking the
application by the end of the voting period. A second appeal can be filed
one month after the first one. The appellant may offer a modified version
of the application, eliminating the reasons that made the community
members decide against it.

#MetaGate

#MetaGate
Gateway to Decentralized
Internet
#MetaGate is not just another cryptocurrency wallet and
browser for decentralized applications. It is a gateway
to the decentralized internet which exists in parallel with
the usual internet but follows its own rules. It cannot be
modified or blocked. It is everywhere and nowhere at the
same time. It belongs to no one and everyone.

#MetaGate is an open-source
program, so all developers can
embed parts of its code into
their applications and browsers

With all the technical complexity, #MetaGate is much easier for the user
than the usual cryptocurrencies. All the necessary elements that provide
network security function in the background, leaving the end user with a
concise and clear interface.

#MetaGate consists of:
A multi-asset wallet that supports "light mode" without downloading the entire blockchain. Data comes from different sources
of the decentralized network and is checked by the user. Of course,
the wallet can work in "full node" mode or by selecting trusted nodes
that have a copy of the #MetaChains application. (Private keys from
all blockchains used will be stored only by the user.) The wallet which
can be built from the source code in order to ensure the source code
is validated by the community and that the wallet does in fact belong
to the user.
A catalogue of decentralized applications and a browser to work
with them. Any decentralized application built on #MetaHash can be
accessed, not only through the standard internet domain, but also
via #MetaGate or it can be allocated to a separate program.

#MetaHashCoin (#MHC)
#MetaHash is a self-financing system with selfdevelopment process embedded in its genetic code

#MetaHashCoin is used
for payment:

Transactions

Operation of applications

Instant and reliable
transactions of any assets at
an adequate, fixed price.

Any decentralized application

White Paper 28

10% of #MHC are distributed during ICO Round B.
Launched only after Forging.
We warn all participants that if Round A closes early, we may cancel
Round B unilaterally. In this case, all participants of the Founders
& Private rounds as well as participants of ICO Round A will have
21 days to sell their #MCH before #MetaHash launches on crypto
exchanges. The only exception is the founders of the project who are
obliged not to sell their #MHC until January 1, 2020.
#Metahash reserves the right to buy back #MHC from the Founders
& Private Round participants at the price of 0.0000625 ETH per 1
#MHC as an anti-dumping measure. This is a right of the #MetaHash
project rather than an obligation. The only exception is the founders
of the project who are obliged not to sell their #MHC until January
1, 2020.
The White Paper regulates the relations between #MetaHash and
ICO participants. Additional terms and conditions can be found in the
documentation posted on the #MetaHash website.
During ICO Round B, the project's team reserves the right to
regularly and repeatedly raise the token value, according to the
market situation and current demand. The starting value of #MHC
in this round shall not be lower than the price offered at Round A,
multiplied by two.

In case of an early listing on crypto exchanges, 10% of #MHC
initially planned for the distribution during ICO Round B
will be sold at crypto exchanges at twice the Round A price.
The project will then begin the process of its
transformation into a DAO.
5% of #MHC are reserved for building a fork of Ethereum
and Bitcoin. This is 460,000,000 #MHC.
In order to implement additional system protection,
#MetaHash will leave anchors in the Ethereum and Bitcoin
blockchains. 5% of #MHC will be used as a motivation for
ETH and BTC digital asset holders because we wish to recognize the merits of these blockchain systems.
Owners of the most popular cryptocurrencies will be able to
get a share of #MHC. Thus, we want to attract the most active
members of the crypto community regardless of the size of
their contribution to the ICO and motivate them to use the
#MetaHash network. In order to participate, you will need to
buy one or more #MHC using an Ethereum or Bitcoin wallet. A
bonus is awarded at the time of transaction signature verification procedure. Bonuses will be distributed until the sum of
460,000,000 #MHC runs out.
A bonus is awarded to the wallet used for the transaction at the
time of the start of ICO Round B or the launch on crypto exchanges.
The bonuses are given to the owners of Ethereum and Bitcoin, in
proportion to their wallet balances.

#MHC emission: 1% per year for 10 years to encourage the project's development.
10% of #MHC will be issued in the course of 10 years to stimulate

10% of #MHC will be issued in the course of 10 years to drive the

50% #MHC will be issued in the next 10 years to stimulate forging.
Starting from 15.5% in the first year and ending in
5.9% in the 10th year.
The project has a high potential to successfully exist as a
self-financing entity once the funds raised during the ICO
period are exhausted. However, if the team that develops
the project offers to increase the share of commission paid
to #MetaHash, and #MHC holders find it necessary, they
can vote in favor of this plan.

#MHC Forging
Forging rewards come from the forging pool and transaction commissions. Rewards are calculated every 6 hours when a new block (trim) is
formed. The frequency of calculations and payments may vary depending on technical requirements, at the discretion of the #MetaHash Team.
Unlike the PoW system, #MetaHashCoins forging servers don't go out of
date and don’t lose their effectiveness, as their number is limited and
depends on #MHC stakes. The only thing that will need improvement is
the system's core, (if scaling becomes necessary,) but transaction commissions at this stage will fully cover the upgrade.

50% of all rewards for forging are distributed among
#MetaHashCoins owners
Coin holders can entrust their voting rights to any of the network nodes
including their own nodes. This can be easily done via the wallet interface. Delegation initiates a technical transaction in the network. Instead
of establishing their own node, an #MHC holder may give their voting
right to the operator of the node they trust and get a share of the commission. In this way, large numbers of votes are concentrated at nodes
that the community trusts, making attacks on the system more difficult.

Commission paid to #MHC holders amounts to 50% of the total pool
regardless of the stake limits that are taken into account when the
voting power for each commit (block) is calculated. The amount of
#MetaHashCoins received for the forging process (also known as mining) of #MetaHash commit (block) is calculated by the following formula:

h * (fp + с)
t
h - Holder's Stake

t - Total at stake

fp - Forging pool

c - Comissions

40% are distributed among the owners of the network's
nodes
Nodes with the highest technical performance and a large number of
delegated coins can become the core of the network. The system is designed to encourage users to add nodes with maximum capacity. Rather
than requiring a multitude of computers, the system needs a limited
number of computers with high processing capacity, as well as weaker
computers that could perform the role of Peer Nodes and protect the
network's core. As the network fills with high-performance nodes, the
amount of transactions that the network can carry out per unit time
increases.

MetaHash.org

hello@metahash.org

White Paper 31

Minimum stakes:
To become an active node, a minimum of delegated coins is required.
1,000,000 #MHC to act as a Master/Slave/Verification/Blockchain
Node with a maximum voting strength of 10,000,000 delegated
#MHC per node.
100,000 #MHC to act as a Peer Node with a maximum voting
strength of 999,900 delegated #MHC per node.
100 #MHC to act as a MetaApps/Proxy/Wallet Node.

10% is paid to the owners of active wallets
Winning wallets for a new round are chosen with a mathematical formula providing a random distribution of active wallets based on the
previous trim's hash value (that is, from all transactions that occurred
before the end of the last round). Thus, winners become known immediately at the start of a new round and their wallets receive corresponding
notifications. Since the hash of the past trim is known throughout the
network, all users can easily check the correctness of the calculation
using the same mathematical formula. During multiple hash upon hash
calculation, a wallet that is closer to the current hash number in this
round gets its place and the next hash is calculated to determine a new
winner. Let's calculate the awards for wallets assuming that the forging
reward pool on this day is 1,904,000 #MHC (the daily pool during the
first year) ignoring commissions that increase the reward pool.

Wallets protect the integrity of
the system. Thanks to wallets,
the system can't be controlled
by anyone even if they own
more than 67% of all #MHC. In
contrast to nodes, wallets can't
generate significant rewards but
may still bring a nice bonus to
any network user

All active wallets with more than 1 #MHC are eligible
5%: first place (95,200 #MHC)
1%: second place (19,040 #MHC)
0.5%: third place (9,520 #MHC)
0.34%: fourth place (6,473 #MHC)
0.235%: fifth place (4,474 #MHC)
0.95%: from 6th to 100th, 0.01% 190 #MHC each
1.8%: from 101st to 1,000th, 0.002% 38 #MHC each

As an example, let's calculate the awards assuming that

50% of reward is given to voting coins and is 10,000 #MHC;
Alice took part in the voting with 1,000,000 #MHC, and a total of
10,000,000 #MHC participated in the voting procedure;
Alice will receive 10% of 5,000 #MHC = 500 #MHC;
If Alice bought a node and voted for it with her coins, she will receive
another 400 #MHC for the node;
If Bob, who doesn't have a node, uses his 1,000,000 #MHC to vote for
Alice's server, she'll get 400 more #MHC;
So Alice will earn 1,300 #MHC in this commit (block);

development
Every 2 years, elections of the Project Team are held.
In the first 10 years, 1% of #MHC is allocated to finance the Team's work.
Once 10 years have passed, the income of #MetaHash Company should
be sufficient to self-finance its activities.
Once the first 2 years have passed, those wishing to continue supporting
the project should publish their budget plan and the list of proposed project development measures for the next 2 years, as well as the names of
suggested team members.

Methods of updating #MetaHash software
When a decision regarding software updates has to be made, the "Standard Voting" procedure is initiated, accompanied by a public notification.
If a real need exists, "Emergency" or "Fast" voting may be initiated, but
if 25% of votes are cast against the proposed change, the voting period
is extended to "Fast" or "Standard". It is #MHC owners, rather than node
owners, that are eligible to take part in the voting process. Only nodes
running the latest version of the software are allowed to operate on the
network.

Change to commission fees, budgets and tools of selffinancing
The project's financial plan should reflect a balance between short-term
and long-term interests of #MHC holders.
Any changes to financial instruments are decided by means of "Standard" voting, accompanied by a public notification.

App blocking and appeals
It requires 10,000,000 votes to initiate the "Standard" voting on app
blocking and appeals. The status of the procedure changes to "Fast"
if 100,000,000 votes have been accumulated, and to "Emergency" if
500,000,000 votes have been cast. 67% of votes are required to block
an app or win an appeal.

Roadmap

Roadmap
2012-2016
The technical part of the project was based on the achievements of
AdSniper, created in 2012 through 2016 in the field of advertising
technologies:
A network library for receiving signals, working on C++ and capable
of simultaneously receiving and sending more than 1,000,000
requests per second to one inexpensive standard server;
A network library for synchronizing signals within a cluster that
manages gigantic data flows between cluster machines;
A machine learning system that decides in 10 milliseconds
to respond to a signal taking into account multifactorial
interrelationships;
Own analogue of Hadoop’s for similar systems in C++ for distributed
processing of large data.

We received a lot of requests
from different companies for
the application of blockchain
technology and came to
understand that current
technologies cannot satisfy
requests for such types of
systems. So in 2016 we started
developing our own protocol
#TraceChain

Now, each of the geographically dispersed nodes belonging to AdSniper
accepts requests from the entire internet at the rate of more than a
million requests per second and can be scaled without limits by adding
more servers.

international marketing and business development. By the beginning of
2018, we started to build a network of experts in blockchain, security,
trading on exchanges, legal services, marketing, and financial technologies who will contribute their expertise and support the release of the
project in 2018.

#MetaHash Smartapp is created by the platform itself and features all
necessary settings, making it possible for a person who doesn't know
programming to get contract details. Since this is a SmartApp, not a
smart contract, it is not tied to any specific blockchain platform and can
work with any blockchain and accept payments in any cryptocurrency
