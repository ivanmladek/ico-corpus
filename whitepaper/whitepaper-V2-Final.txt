1. Legal Disclaimer
MenaChain Solutions DWC – LLC is an organization which aims to help the digital
transformation starting from Middle East and Africa region. It is committed to
invest in areas which encourage the use of digital currency in daily life. The phrases
of “Foundation” and “MenaPay Foundation” in this whitepaper, including Index
pages, represent MenaChain Solutions DWC – LLC. The information contained in
these documents is confidential, privileged and only for the information of the
intended recipient and may not be used, published or redistributed without the prior
written consent of MenaPay.
Investing in cryptocurrencies involves a high degree of risk and the potential for
significant losses. Do not invest money you can not afford to lose.

2. Abstract
This whitepaper is written in order to inform the reader about how and why
MenaPay project started and will continue.
MenaPay is the first fully blockchain based payment platform which focuses on the
Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) preliminary. Main reason for the
initial market decision is the high amount of unbanked population in the region as
84%. Traditional financial institutions cannot transform that population due to
Islamic Finance requirements while MenaPay is the first non-bank mobile payment
platform entering the region by the power of blockchain technology. MenaPay is a
platform that allows transactions on a blockchain with very low transaction fees, is
not affected by fluctuation of cryptocurrencies, faster and more secure than any
traditional payment gateway.
In addition to all these benefits, MenaPay also assures instant transaction on
blockchain which enables the daily life use of cryptocurrencies.
MenaPay aims to reach maximum user base hence it has been designed to
comply with Islamic finance requirements which have big importance for
MENA. The MenaPay Platform does not use or give interest and each
transaction is performed under at least 2 witnesses thanks to the blockchain
technology.

T

MenaPay token holders get benefits as long as the platform gets more
popular which is also encouraged by the Islamic Finance approach.

MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

MenaPay has its own stable coin “MenaCash” which is designed to be used in any
online and offline transactions for the intention of daily usage. M e n a C a s h h a s a
stable 1 US Dollar value which is warranted by the same amount of USD kept in
multiple banks as fiat currency equal to the amount of MenaCash in circulation.
MenaCash solves one of the huge problems to use cryptocurrencies in daily life for
users; fluctuation. The main objective of the project is to make it possible, easy and
secure to transfer money for each user by using the advantages of today’s high–end
technology.
As you can see in the following parts; it is obvious that there is a need in MENA
region for a revolutionary payment system which can solve many problems that
current old-fashioned banking system brings; such as security, difficult transaction
process, highly expensive transaction fees.
MenaPay’s products are also designed with excellent user interfaces with the local
languages, advanced data tools for both users and merchants to disrupt not only cash
dependent payment system but also old-fashioned banking tools.

3. Introduction
3.1. Vision and Mission of MenaPay
MenaPay aims to become the most commonly used cryptocurrency in the world,
[1]
[2]
starting from MENA region. Focusing on 18 country and 441 Million people as
a starting point, MenaPay carries the mission of becoming the largest non-bank
payment solution by using blockchain technology while generating significant returns
for the investors. The business model that you can review in detail in this paper will
create a whole new standard in crypto industry by creating an infinite “Green Mining
Reserve” by using the the majority (75%) of the revenue to buy-back the MenaPay
tokens from the market and fill the reserve.
MenaPay Token Holders will be the nucleus of a huge community to disrupt
traditional banking system in MENA and will create the most advanced financial
system which will cover the entire region with its Islamic compliant, transparent and
decentralized structure.
Today, traditional financial system instruments such as banks, credit cards, debit cards
and cash suffer from the lack of security, slow and inconvenient ways of transaction.
These traditional financial institutions spend huge amounts of money and resource to
prevent fraud but none of them fully succeed. Blockchain is the only way to solve all
these problems that current banking and payment systems have, till a better
technology comes out.

5
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

MENA does not have a similar non – bank payment system while other
leading players such as China already has. Just like any other revolutionary
dynamic; technology grows with the power of people who believes in it.

T

Developing the MenaPay Platform with community support is the futuristic
way of finding the opinion leaders and securing necessary funds.
This futuristic way is now possible thanks to one of the last milestones of
technology called “blockchain”. Since the Internet came out in 1989, blockchain is
the first tech wave, which shook the whole world with a similar impact. It will
disrupt every single business and destroy them if they do not keep pace with it. Now
it is time to create new structures that really belong to public, not to a certain central
authority.

3.2. Definition of MenaPay
In order to understand what MenaPay is, first, it is important and a priority to
understand MENA.
3.2.1. What is MENA?
The Middle East and North Africa region includes 18 countries and approximately
441M population. The region officially speaks two languages. 359M (81% of the
region) people speak Arabic and 81M people speak Turkish. [3] 93% of the region
practice Islam religion. [4]

Figure 1: MENA Region

6
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Even though the region looks harmonized in terms of language and religion, it has
an extremely fragmented structure in terms of geography, politics, economic power
and currency. Turkey plays a bridge role between the Middle East and Europe. The
Republic of Turkey is governed by full democracy and 99% of people practice Islam.
.[4]
It’s the 17th largest economy globally It has a developed and broadminded banking
[11]
[19]
and financial system while having 40 Million unbanked population.
The State of Fintech report says startups in MENA raised $50 million in funding in
[13]
2017, a 270% percent increase on the $18 million in disclosed investments 2016.
GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) region is the shining star of the Middle East.
GCC is formed from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
[6]
Bahrain, and Oman. Average GDP per capita in these countries is 26,000 USD.
All of the Middle East is considered an oasis for digital industries. Especially GCC
region is the target of many global companies, while they all face difficulties while
entering the region. Payment collection is one of the biggest challenges especially for
online businesses. More than 50% of the GCC region is unbanked while 84% of t h e
total MENA region is unbanked.
GCC is a region where Islam religion is practiced in the most conservative way. The
fact is, traditional financial institutions do not comply with Islamic practices so huge
amount people prefer to use cash in everyday transaction since it is more safe way
than using banking tools in terms of their beliefs. That is the core reason of the high
unbanked population ratio as 84% in such a rich region. Poor banking systems also
do not make people's lives easier.
Most of the population in the MENA region prefers cash-on-delivery as a
primary payment method for e-commerce. Interest is forbidden by Islam and
any payment method developed by banks are not welcomed as their major
revenue stream is from interest gains. Any P2P transaction should be
witnessed by 2 parties in order to comply with Islamic jurisprudence to prove
that there is no interest gain. The nature of blockchain and the MenaPay
revenue structure perfectly meets Islamic tenets.

T

When we analyze the rest of the region, we see many crowded but unstable
economies. Traditional financial institutions cannot provide trust to the public as
they are fully controlled by the governments. In some countries such as Egypt, it is
not possible to withdraw or make cross border transactions of foreign currency.
Meanwhile, keeping the money in the local currency became very risky in terms of
consistent devaluation. There are 18 different currencies in the region which
MenaPay wants to interconnect creating one common currency instead;

Along with the challenging environment, the region has 49% of the total oil
reserves in the world.[7] Countries like Turkey and Egypt are top tourism
destinations with their deep history and natural beauties. UAE also became
one of the top tourist destinations and one of the financial capitals in the
world with their visionary government. Dubai is the first city using
blockchain in their government operations.

T

Countries like UAE, Turkey, Qatar and Kuwait are leading the technology and
innovations in the region. UAE is the number one country in terms of
smartphone penetration in the world. [20]
Digital adoption of the rich Arabic public is impressive. Both Bahrain and
UAE are competing to be the capital of blockchain projects by solid legal
framework preparation and open-minded authorities. The average GDP per
capita of the GCC region is 236% bigger than world average. [6] [8]
Other countries sometimes counted as part of MENA. Including the populations of
Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Chad, Comoros, Cyprus, Djibouti, Eritrea,
Georgia, Mali, Niger, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Palestine and Sahrawi Arab
Democratic Republic; wide MENA region has 827M population in total.
3.2.2. What is MenaPay?
MenaPay is the first blockchain based non-bank digital payment gateway for building
the biggest cashless society in the world. It focuses on the MENA region primarily.
MenaPay allows users to transfer money within daily life in a secure, fast and
decentralized way.
MenaPay focuses on MENA as its primary market so it is fully compliant with
Islamic finance rules which are very important specifically in GCC region to provide
a convenient and trustable digital payment solution. Users who most probably care
about Islamic finance will see that blockchain technology meets the requirements of
Islamic finance rules about money transactions between parties and earnings from
the investments.

9
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Three major statements in Islam are highly important in the region;

•

Interest is prohibited. People cannot generate profit via interest.

•

There should be at least 2 witnesses to approve any debt transaction between
2 parties.

•

Earning money via money is allowed if and only if people invest in a real
working business and/or asset.

T

On blockchain structure, at least 3 parties are needed to confirm the transaction. It
cannot be deleted or rearranged by any individual or a central authority after a
transaction has been confirmed.
MenaPay focuses on building a large community of consumers and merchants who
prefer MenaPay as their primary method of payment for any digital business such as ecommerce, and any online/offline or traditional P2P transaction for each aspect of
daily life, including P2P cross border transactions. MenaPay can be used in various
places, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping malls, gas stations, vending machines;
shortly in every possible money transaction activity. Basically, MenaPay aims to be
integrated in every possible industry.

3.3. What is the Difference Between MenaPay Token and
MenaCash?
The MenaPay Platform creates a token and a coin which you will see clearly and in
detail through this whitepaper. In the blockchain ecosystem, a token represents a
fungible or tradable asset or a utility on a blockchain.
MenaPay Token is a utility token which will be issued with a limited number of 400
million. 64% (256 million) of the total tokens will be owned by the public. MenaPay
Token is used for mining purposes from the reserve by 2 ways, getting via peer to
merchant (P2M) MenaCash transaction and MenaPay token staking. We apply this
process via “Green Mining”.
MenaPay token holders have the option of staking their tokens and earn tokens
according to the amount of staked MenaPay tokens and the time they keep in their
wallet. MenaPay will be able to be purchased (buy-back) from exchanges after the IEO
to fill the Green Mining reserve. During the IEO period, only the confirmed users in
the whitelist who completed the KYC process can purchase MenaPay tokens from
www.menapay.io using various payment methods.

10
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

MenaCash; is a stable cryptocurrency of the MenaPay platform which will be used for
daily transactions between 3 dynamics in the system; users, merchants and foundation.
Transactions between users P2P (peer to peer), transactions between users and
merchants P2M (peer to merchant) and transactions between approved merchants and
MenaPay Foundation for conversion of their MenaCash to fiat currency purposes
M2F (merchant to foundation) will be possible by using MenaCash. MenaCash will be
generated on the MenaChain permissioned blockchain to assure secure and fast
transactions between the users.
Circulating supply of MenaCash will always be equal to the US dollars in the
bank accounts of the MenaPay Foundation.

3.4. Governance Structure
Defining the governance structure is the key point to assure the trust in the
community and integrity of the team as a whole. We’ve defined governance structure
of MenaPay Foundation and management of MenaCash in order to have 100% trust
by our entire ecosystem.
3.4.1 MenaChain Solutions DWC - LLC
MenaChain Solutions is a company which act as a foundation by its philosophical
approach to its business, preliminarily MenaPay. MenaChain Solutions does not carry a
profit motivation for the company itself so in this whitepaper “MenaPay Foundation”
or “Foundation” describes MenaChain Solutions DWC - LLC. The main goal of the
company is to create a total new payment and money transfer solution with its
blockchain based technology which will belong to the community and bring a
significant solution to the everyday problems that payment systems currently have.

11
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

That is why, MenaChain allocates its 75% of total income to buy-back MenaPay
Token in order to fill its green mining reserve for the users. Shareholders of the
company assign the Executive Board members. Executive Board members lead the
company with full integrity. They consider benefits of the MenaPay community and
all stakeholders of MenaPay ecosystem; including users, merchants and resellers.
Executive Board acts according to the vision of MenaPay. Since the priority is
sustainable growth, Executive Board has right to make strategic decisions to change
transaction fees, cash out fees, allocated revenue to buy-back the MenaPay tokens to
fill the green mining reserve and the distribution ratio of the reserve.
Obviously, those token purchase activities would positively affect the token prices in
the market. Executive Board is responsible to implement effective security measures
and ethical standards to avoid fraud, insider trading and misuse of information.
The entire company team works full time, dedicated to MenaPay operations. The
management team prepares the annual budget for marketing and operations. The
Managing Director of MenaPay has the right to spend within the budget and has
limited authority on the Power of Attorney. For the payments over the limit, 2
signature authorities are required; one from the Managing Director, and the other;
from an Executive Board Member.
CFO directly reports to the Executive Board with respect to reporting, audit and
internal control purposes.
Every quarter, at least one board meeting should be performed. Executive Board is
responsible with controlling the management team. All strategic decisions such as
investment, acquisitions, budget revision, etc. requires board approval.
3.4.2 Trust structure for MenaCash
Trust structure of MenaCash is good use case of blockchain. Instead of using
traditional audit methods by providing periodical financial documents, blockchain
gives the freedom for an instant audit. Our 3rd party audit and escrow partners are
announced on the www.menapay.io to assure the 100% safe and trustworthy
structure for MenaCash.
As the total circulating supply of MenaCash should be equal to the US dollars in the
bank, there will not be a moment where the US dollar amount is less than MenaCash
in the circulation. In order to assure that structure, bank accounts of MenaCash will
be separated from the MenaPay Foundation. Any cash that will be able to release
only with the approval of MenaPay Foundation CFO and the reputable 3rd party
audit company.
12
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Minimum MenaCash reserves to be hold is calculated based on the USD equivalent
of total assets and cash amount in the banks. Total provision should be equal to the
MenaCash in the circulation after deducting the commission and cash-out fees that
MenaPay deserves.
In order to explain the instant audit process clearly, it’s better to explain by a chart
below with the assumption that we have 100 million MenaCash in the circulation.
Status at a moment N
100M MenaCash in circulation
100M USD in the bank accounts

M2F
Merchant sends 1M MenaCash to convert it to fiat currency

Status at N+1

3rd Party Audit makes instant audit from the NODE established in their facility

Fund Release
1M USD Fund is released to the merchant in 24 hours after double confirmation from MenaPay
Foundation and 3rd party audit

Our policy is to keep maximum 100M US Dollar in a single bank account. Bank
accounts and the locations of the banks will be distributed worldwide. No interest
profit will be generated based on reserved money. Instead of keeping all the money
as a cash reserve in the bank, it will be kept in different assets such as other Islamic
Finance compliant tools such as real estate, low risk venture capital funds, etc.
Executive Board holds the right to change the type of the reserved currency to any
currency which is acceptable by the regional merchants. The US Dollar has been
chosen for the convenience of merchants as of 2018. GCC countries use local
currencies fixed to the US dollar and the oil price is determined with US dollars. In
the future, we foresee that Euro or Yuan may become more popular. If the fiat
currency expectation of the majority changes, Executive Board can decide to shift to
another currency which is globally reputable and acceptable.

4. Need for MenaPay
The new digitized world requires using technology in each single area. The
countries which inspired the others with their game changing steps such as
China had readily been aware about the importance of the need in the fintech
market. Today, the total amount of people who use Alipay and WeChat Pay in a
month is around 900 million. [10] We can clearly say that they already started to
live in a digitalized, cashless future.
Even though banks worked well enough till now, the system is designed
according to the antiquated economy and just like any other industry; it will be
disrupted by the new technology. The issue with banks had and has been a
problem in regions like MENA. Despite the high penetration rate of
smartphones and internet connectivity, more than 84% of the adult population
in the region is unbanked, [11] while three in four GCC bank customers are
ready to switch banks for a better digital experience. [12] With the population of
MENA getting younger, better educated and more demanding, a need for a
massive overhaul in financial services occurred.
MenaPay has been designed to solve the lack of problems that traditional
payment/ banking system has, besides creating a chance to get rid of the
obligation of carrying cash and recognition of fake cash. MenaPay is also the
way to have an easy, fast and secure payment opportunity for those who does
not prefer banks and bank products—debit or credit cards—due to their
religious beliefs whom contain 378 Million people.
With this chance to digitize payment in all areas of daily usage; life will be
easier for MenaPay holders while merchants who do not use credit and debit
cards will be available for shopping.
4.1. Payment Problems in MENA and Solutions by MenaPay

• Single Payment Method for Online Shopping

As a result of the poor banking system and lack of proper applications of
Islamic finance, the only way to shop online is using the most common
method; cash on delivery (CoD). But it also brings some other risks and
problems such as high costs and uncharged deliveries. Also, CoD method can
only be used for physical goods. Proper monetization of digital goods and
services is still a big challenge. MenaPay introduces fully Islamic finance
compliant digital payment system to users along with its stable currency
MenaCash.
14
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

• Obligation of Carrying Cash

Apart from security problems, this brings despair to users since this payment
method is the only way. People are not happy to carry large amounts of cash
but they love shopping. There is no solution if the user loses that high
amount of money on the way to buy a valuable good. One of the goals of
MenaPay is to get rid of cash with the ease of digital payments and security
of blockchain technology. MenaPay brings a digital, single and stable
currency to the region which people can carry within their smartphones.

• Cross - Border Money Transaction

Due to the extreme conversion rates of banks, it is very costly to make cross
border transactions or online payments in various currencies. MenaPay aims
to make this process as easy as sending a message on any online platform.
After completing the KYC process that MenaPay requires from the users,
money transfer between countries will take seconds, as it is a necessity of the
digital age we live in.

• Dependent Central Authorities

Because there are trust issues and high inflation risks, people mostly do not
prefer to hold their money in the national banks of their countries.
Blockchain technology, solves any trust or dependency problems that might
occur by its nature. All savings are recorded on the blockchain and can’t be
changed by anyone. The MenaPay platform also belongs to the community,
it’s designed to sustain forever.

• Counterfeit Money Problem

Counterfeit money is a serious problem especially in North Africa and the
north part of the Middle East, where people have plenty concerns about
fraud. Digitalized and stable currency MenaCash of the MenaPay Platform
will also be a solution for this common concern.

4.2. Stable Cryptocurrency for Transaction: MenaCash
Digital or blockchain based payments are typically much faster than today’s
classical financial tools, since there are no intermediaries.
The major obstacle for the crypto-payments could be the unexpected
fluctuations in the currencies. As a solution to this problem, MenaPay offers
its own 100% USD backed stable coin, MenaCash.

15
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Another problem could be the wrong addressing the wallet ID while sending money.
MenaPay offers a useful way to preclude this problem with solutions such as QR
Code and UI/UX design which shows Merchant’s name on the screen during the
payment.
MenaCash, will be easily reachable through MenaPay app via all current payment
systems such as credit or debit cards and our offline reseller network in the region.
1 MenaCash will always be equal to 1 USD, so user will not worry about the value of
the money. The exact amount of, circulating MenaCash will be held in several banks
so the users can always be sure that their wealth is under protection and available in
fiat currency form.
This will be reputable and trustworthy specifically by and for the approved merchants
on the system since they will easily be able to cash out MenaCash from the
foundation. Only approved merchants will be able to convert their MenaCash to fiat
currency with a minimum amount restriction. We will not let the users cash out
through the foundation, due to money laundering concerns. Users can cash out their
MenaPay tokens from exchanges.

4.3. Easy Cash-Out for Merchants
MenaPay Foundation will give the right to cash out only to the approved merchants
of the system. They will be able to convert MenaCash in their wallets to fiat
currencies at any time.
Merchants will be entitled to convert their MenaCash easily from the company with
the minimum limit of 1.000 MenaCash. The Foundation will take 5% commission on
the average. The ratio could change sector and the amount dependently. When
merchants cash out, they will receive the exact amount excluding cash out
commission as 1 MenaCash = 1 USD. Detailed information on the cash out system is
given in section 6.6.

5. Products of MenaPay
With its ease of use and blockchain infrastructure, MenaPay aims to be the ultimate
platform for users to carry out their all and every payment operation, while enabling
merchants a simpler reach out to their customers and a faster mean of payment.
The MenaPay Platform offers a comprehensive payment solution to be used in every
aspect of the daily lives of the cash using MENA region community with its
blockchain-based payment infrastructure, mobile and desktop applications, its
specially-designed Dashboards for merchants and Reseller applications.

16
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

After a quick registration process, MenaPay enables its users to store MenaCash by
using global and/or regional payment methods or using cash through its wide
Reseller Network across MENA region. Once MenaCash is stored, the user can
transfer MenaCash to his/her peer, or he/she can shop from thousands of
merchants within the MenaPay system effortlessly using QR codes, e-mails and
phone numbers.

5.1. KYC for Profile Verification
To ensure no illegal activities are performed on the MenaPay Platform and serve our
customers a secure network, the platform conducts a KYC (Know Your Customer)
procedure. All users, merchants and resellers who reach an accumulated process
volume of 100 MenaCash are subject to a detailed KYC process.

Figure 2: KYC Steps
The process is pursued with 4 steps;

•
•
•
•
•

The user completes the mandatory and optional profile information and confirms
his/her email address.
Any officially recognized identity document (National ID, Drivers Licence or
Passport) is uploaded to the platform.
A 5-second video record which clearly shows the document and the face of the
person is uploaded to the platform.
Approval of the information by MenaPay Foundation.

KYC process is held to include firm information including legal documents, firm’s
financial history and business licenses for institutional users.
User data collected by the KYC process is kept on an off chain secure database and
all General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) are met. Information on GDPR is
found in section 11.

5.2. Business Dashboard for Merchants and Resellers
Data oriented decision making is crucial for merchants. The most important
advantage in a highly competitive sector as the e-commerce business is to know your
customers closely, observe their purchasing tendencies and to take actions to
improve sales according to these data. On the other hand, offline commerce
businesses cannot aggregate this type of data due to the shortcomings of
their existing payment tools.
Businesses which add MenaPay as a payment method and sell MenaCash for
additional revenue can use its detailed Dashboard to get important insights about
their business and make decisions comfortably or take the necessary actions.

Figure 3: MenaPay Dashboard

5.3. Business Application for Merchants and Resellers
Businesses that would like to receive payment by MenaPay as an alternative to cash
or other payment methods can start receiving payment just in seconds by
downloading the MenaPay Business app right after signing up via the Business
Dashboard and completing the profile verification steps.
With the MenaPay Business, member businesses can settle their own exchange rates
when determining the amount of MenaCash that corresponds to the local currency
they use. They will be able to calculate the value of the amount in MenaCash in their
local currencies and receive payment in seconds. Detailed information can be found
in the section 6.1.
In order to provide an easy MenaCash purchasing experience to its users, MenaPay
Foundation authorizes some enterprises other than itself, which can sell MenaCash.
These enterprises are called “Resellers” in the system.
The Reseller Application is designed especially for the MenaCash sales. Enterprises
who are entitled to be Resellers and who are listed on the Reseller App can easily
conduct MenaCash sales. More information can be found under the section 6.3.

5.4. Mobile & Desktop Payment App (Wallet)
The MenaPay application also has the digital wallet features. Every individual register
with their phone number thereby creates a unique wallet. They can add wallets
afterwards as they like.

19

handled social media accounts.

5.5. MenaPay Card
For the users which do not prefer banking tools such as credit or debit cards,
MenaPay offers a prepaid card besides Reseller points. Users will be able to use
MenaCash even if there is no Reseller point around.

20
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

MenaPay Cards will be purchasable around 50.000 different points after the launch
date as March 2019 so that taking place in MenaPay ecosystem will be easier than
ever.

6. MenaPay EcoSystem
6.1. Merchants
Merchants are the building blocks of the MenaPay ecosystem along with individual
users. Enterprises which accept MenaCash payments in return of their service or
products are called merchants in the MenaPay system. MenaPay Foundation has
readily signed contracts with 50 large establishments. Merchants who register with
the platform and start MenaCash acceptances can use advantageous features of
MenaPay. MenaPay presents an easy-to-register platform where they can execute
their sales operations and keep track of the relevant sales data.
To develop the largest cashless society in the world, MenaPay presents an easy-tointegrate Software Development Kit (SDK). Any seller can accept MenaCash
payments after they download and setup the SDK.

21
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Figure 6: Pay with MenaPay
All merchants can take advantage of the MenaPay payment system. They can accept
payments and spend the MenaCash they received as they wish. Merchants who use
MenaPay solely as a payment intermediary and whom will not cash out their
MenaCash are named “Standard Merchants”. Otherwise, it is needed to get an
approval for the cash out privilege in terms of Anti Money Laundering processes.
When the approval process successfully finalizes, merchants who fulfill the necessary
requirements are badged as “Approved Merchants”.
6.1.1. Merchant Approval
Every merchant integrated with the MenaPay Platform should submit below
documents and get the “Approved Merchant” badge to be able to cash out the
MenaCash in their accounts.

After the application is received, MenaPay team assesses the applications. If the
requirements are met, the merchants are accepted into the MenaPay “Approved
Merchant Network”.

22
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

6.1.2. Merchant and Wallet ID Matching
All merchants and users can add more than one wallet into their applications. Every
wallet has a unique ID and they are matched with users. Wallets that are held by
merchants are matched with their identities as a company also and are shown to the
customer during the payment transaction. This assures the customer of the address
he/she is transferring MenaCash to.
MenaPay ID matching process is designed to transfer MenaCash with top security
measures. Every user’s information is matched with the ones that are kept on the off
chain. During every transaction request which comes over the MenaGateway, validity
of these informations are confirmed by the user.
During MenaCash transfer, receiving side’s app produces a QR code encoding its
public key. When the sending side’s app scans this QR code, it gets this public key
which is enough for performing the transaction.
But to ensure receiver’s real identity, sender additionally requests supplementary
identity information using receiver’s public key. The public key is matched with the
identity of the receiver on MenaPay servers and masked identity information is
returned to the sender side as identity hints.

6.2. Individual Users
Since MenaPay preliminarily focuses on the MENA market, each product of
MenaPay is designed to fully meet user habits and expectations of the region.
MenaPay users will be able to login the platform with a well-designed fast
onboarding process. When the transaction volume is to become more than 100
MenaCash cumulatively with the previous transactions, the user will need to
complete the KYC process.

24

The MenaPay Platform has an age limit of 16 for the use of MenaCash; to become a
MenaPay token holder and related MenaPay token attributes the user must be 18 or
older. In October 2019, “Parental Control” feature will be added to the MenaPay
Platform to enable users under 16 to use the platform safely. Detailed roadmap is
given under 8.4.
Above the cumulative 100 MenaCash transaction limit, KYC process is initiated to
prevent fraud and fake account possibilities. This process, mentioned in 5.1 in detail,
prevents security breaches without compromising transaction speed.

6.4. P2P (Peer to Peer) Transaction
Transactions performed in between the users.
Details of the receiving party (phone number, email, nickname, public key or QR
code) are requested from the sending party. Following MenaGateway and the
MenaPay Platform approvals the transaction is realized by the user approval.
MenaPay Foundation presents this innovative and fast payment system with lower
costs of transaction compared to existing payment methods. MenaPay takes 1%
commission for each transaction.

6.5. P2M (Peer To Merchant) Transaction
Transactions made by the customers to the merchants.
During this process, a unique transaction code is produced for every purchase from
the merchant. Within this code, there exists information on the purchased product or
service and the cost. This code is reflected as a QR code on the merchants’ screen.
The QR code is scanned by the customer’s app and the payment is realized after
system approval.

6.6. M2F (Merchant to Foundation) Transaction
MenaCash is easily converted to fiat currency for approved merchants.
As merchants can use the collected MenaCash for their own purchase purposes, they
can also join the Approved Merchant Network and cash out from MenaPay
Foundation. Cash out requests opened by approved merchants are closed by the
foundation on returning the fund, keeping 1 MenaCash = 1 USD equality. The
minimum limit for cash out is 1,000 MenaCash. MenaPay Foundation claims 5%
commission on average over the amount cashed out. The rights to change the
commission rates are reserved by the MenaPay Foundation.

7. Introduction to Technical Design
The problem with public blockchains such as Bitcoin as day-to-day payment systems
is that they are not as easy to use as credit cards or cash. You cannot be expected to
wait in your favorite coffee shop for half an hour or a few minutes for Bitcoin for
your payment transaction to go through. Most blockchain based currencies are slow
compared to traditional payment methods.
Both consumer or institutional wise privacy is a problem when a blockchain is
considered as a day-to-day payment system. Users, or companies may not want their
transactions to occur on a public platform, that is all transactions and payments can
be traced publicly. Privacy is a problem (for now) as a payment system on daily basis.
Today payments systems such as Visa have the capacity to handle thousands of
transactions per second (TPS). When TPS is considered, most blockchain platforms
fall short. Bitcoin can handle 7 TPS, whereas Ethereum can handle 15 TPS.
These limits are probably going to increase in the future with 2nd layer technologies
like lightning network, sharding, etc. MenaChain is designed to support over 100s of
TPS initially but will be scaling up to support thousands in the following years.
It is important to remember that TPS does not mean a clear explanation of the
transaction in terms of speed. Today, while Visa finalizes an entire transaction in 15
seconds in CEMEA (Central Europe, Middle East and Africa) region.[25] MenaPay
Platform requires less than 10 seconds to finalize a transaction. The technologhy
behind platform makes MenaPay at least %33 faster than current common payment
system such credit cards.

7.1. Why MenaPay Chose Ethereum?
MenaPay is utilized on the Ethereum platform using ERC-20 technology which is
public, easy-to-use, and one of the biggest and widespread blockchain platforms in
the world. Ethereum has the most widespread-use utility tokens. Whether it is stock
exchanges or transactions between two dynamics, all operations are held much faster
than the existing banking system by the blockchain technology.
Ethereum is a decentralized network of computers with two basic functions. These
functions are a blockchain that can record transactions, and a virtual machine that
can produce smart contracts.

30
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Thanks to these two functions, Ethereum can support decentralized applications
(DApps). These DApps are built on the existing Ethereum blockchain, piggybacking
off its underlying technology. In return, Ethereum charges developers for the
computing power in their network, which can only be paid in Ether, the only interplatform currency.
Depending on its purpose, DAPPs might create ERC-20 tokens to function as a
currency, a share in the company, for points in a loyalty program, or even proof of
ownership, say, of an amount of gold or the deed to a house.
A smart contract is a computer protocol on the blockchain which technically orders
projects. In our use, smart contracts are the unchangeable agreements on how
transactions are approved according to the rules written within them. They are
responsible for the autonomous ruling of the system. Smart contracts basically act as
objective escrow mechanisms.
Since smart contracts can be written to define rules for token uses and for decision
making processes, a central authority is disintermediated.
The tokens follow a list of standards so that they can be shared, exchanged for other
tokens, or transferred to a crypto-wallet.
Ethereum community has created these standards with three optional rules, and six
[15]
mandatory ones:

7.2. MenaCash Technical Details
7.2.1. Permissioned Blockchain: MenaChain
MenaChain is the blockchain platform designed to build MenaPay’s scalable payment
system. MenaCash is the default and only cryptocurrency of MenaChain. MenaCash
is a stable coin backed by USD. All created MenaCash will be backed where
1 MenaCash = 1 USD.
31
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

MenaChain is designed to support over 100s of TPS initially but it will be scaled up
to support thousands in the following years via parallel blockchain. Parallel
blockchain structure creates basically as an alternative way to overlocked blockchain.
The important part for speed of transactions is transaction finality which measures
how long one user must wait for the confirmation of transaction from the starting
moment. After at least 2 confirmation the transaction is recorded on the blockchain
and. This is a significant property for a business, because waiting an hour on a
[24]
blockchain network can have significant repercussions for businesses. In MenaPay,
time for transaction finality is measured in seconds; not minutes, hours, or days. That
means user will not spend longer time than current payment process with any
common credit/debit card or cash usage.

MenaChain is decentralized and borderless. There are no leaders, miners or
coordinators with special influence towards consensus. Every node is equal.
MenaChain is designed as a permissioned blockchain platform, therefore an
identity authentication service is required. Rather than providing unknown
entities like in open networks participants are known, but all the participants
can hide sender, receiver addresses as well as the amount that is being
transferred from other merchants on the chain. MenaChain also supports
multi signature wallets for its corporate users. The transactions on the chain
can be configured to require the signatures of multiple users when the use
case calls for it.

T

MenaChain built on standalone installation of Stellar nodes. Since approval of
MenaPay Foundation is needed in order to join the MenaChain network as a node,
all nodes assumed safe participating the MenaChain Network. MenaChain platform
will start with a small number of nodes during the testing phase. Then it will expand
to have nodes run by approved organizations which meet certain requirements. The
real-life identities of all the participants are known. These participants have a
common goal—they want to do business together—but they do not necessarily trust
or like each other. Nevertheless, knowing the identities of the participants allows a
permissioned blockchain to use the SCP (Stellar Consensus Protocol), a federated
Byzantine Algorithm.

32
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

7.2.1.1. Federated Byzantine Agreement / Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)

Figure 13: Federate Byzantine Agreement
Consensus means achieving agreement across validators in a network. The validators
must each agree on a transaction in a network and the network must also tolerate
faulty or incorrect messages from misbehaving validators.
There are several protocols in achieving consensus in a network, such as Bitcoin’s
Proof of Work, where the consensus mechanism relies on the computing power of
the nodes competing with each other to solve cryptographic puzzles, and thereby
reach consensus. Another widely known practical consensus mechanism is Proof of
Stake, where nodes are not associated with computing powers and electricity
consumption, but instead the creator of the next block is chosen via various
combinations of random selections. Odds of block discoveries are in parallel with
the amount held in individuals’ wallets. Simple selection by account balance would
result in undesirable centralization, as the single richest member would have a
permanent advantage.
Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) was pioneered by Ripple and refined by
Stellar. In FBA, each participant knows of others it considers important. It waits for
the vast majority of those others to agree on any transaction before considering the
transaction settled. In turn, those important participants do not agree to the
transaction until the participants that they consider important agree as well, and so
on. Eventually, enough of the network accepts a transaction that it becomes
infeasible for an attacker to roll it back.
33
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Stellar Consensus Protocol is derived from the concept of Byzantine Agreement that
functions as a provably safe construction of Federated Byzantine Agreement. It
achieves robustness through quorum slices, since all the nodes in the network are
assumed safe and trusted. Individual trust decisions made by each node that together
determine system level quorums.
7.2.1.2. Quorum and Quorum Slices
A quorum is the minimum number of votes that a distributed transaction has to
obtain in order to be allowed to perform an operation in a distributed system. In a
distributed system, a transaction could be executing its operations on multiple nodes.
Since distributed transactions are required to be atomic, the transaction must have
the same fate at every node, even when nodes are partitioned and the partitions may
not be able to communicate with each other. This is where a quorum-based
technique comes in. The fundamental idea is that a transaction is executed if the
majority of nodes vote to execute it.
Traditional non-federated Byzantine agreements require every node to be involved
with every transaction to reach a quorum. This is a waste of time and resources. In
federated Byzantine Agreement, a quorum slice is the subset of a quorum
convincing one particular node of agreement. A node can rely on multiple set of
nodes asserting statements. Each node chooses one or more quorum slices, which
are sets of nodes including the node itself, resulting in a more federated and
decentralized environment. A quorum slice represents a sufficient set of peers that
the node selecting the quorum slice believes the slice collectively speak for the whole
network.
Compared to decentralized proof of-work and proof-of-stake schemes, SCP has
modest computing and financial requirements. SCP works through the use of
quorums, which are set of nodes used to reach an agreement. This gives the ability
to process larger number of transactions quickly and cheaply since there is no
expansive mining operation involved.
The reason that MenaPay choose SCP is Compared to decentralized proof of-work
and proof-of-stake schemes, SCP has modest computing and financial requirements.
SCP works through the use of quorums, which are set of nodes used to reach an
agreement. This gives the ability to process larger number of transactions quickly
and cheaply since there is no expensive mining operation involved.

34
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

SCP provides advantages such as decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust and
asymptotic security. Nodes can reach consensus in a couple of seconds which is
within typical human expectation for a web or payment transaction. Safety rests on
digital signatures and hash families whose parameters can realistically be tuned to
protect against adversaries with vast computing power. Users also have freedom to
trust any parties that they see fit. [23][24]
There is 1% fee for each MenaCash transaction between individual users. The fees
will be gathered in a special decentralized address.
MenaPay secures its MenaCash transfers and intakes with the MenaGateway
technology. MenaGateway technology again offers a transparent substructure for
both MenaPay users and the merchants.

7.3. What is Green Mining?
In order to understand the mining system of MenaPay let's take a look at the
blockchain technology first.
Theory: A cryptocurrency system such as Bitcoin possesses state information
enabling users to derive their balances. For Bitcoin, the system state is a collection of
unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), with each output cryptographically locked,
requiring the user to provide a proof of ownership to spend a UTXO. Instead of
explicitly storing the balance, Bitcoin and other digital currencies maintain a
complete history of users’ transactions, which can be used to infer the current state
and all past states of the system. Transactions represent atomic changes to the
system state. Transactions are grouped in blocks; blocks form an ordered collection
called the blockchain. To organize the blockchain, each block contains a reference to
the previous one. The first block in the chain is the genesis block; it does not have a
previous block and is usually hardcoded into the protocol. New blocks are
discovered according the specified set of rules set by the cryptocurrency protocol.
An important function of these rules is to protect against attacks on the blockchain
and to reach consensus in case multiple instances of the blockchain appear. Proof
of work and proof of stake refer to two kinds of restrictions on valid blocks and
imply two different consensus mechanisms.
Definition 1: We say that a user works on top of block B if he attempts to discover
a block that references B as the previous block. Note that B uniquely determines the
entire blockchain so we can denote a blockchain with its latest block and say that
blocks are discovered on top of blockchain B. A cryptocurrency system can be
viewed as a distributed database, with copies of the database belonging to
infrastructure providers for the currency communicating via a peer-to-peer Internet
protocol. In terms of the CAP (consistency, availability and partition-tolerance)
theorem, cryptocurrency systems are available (every request receives a response) and
partition- tolerant (the service still performs even if some nodes fail) but are not
consistent.
From time to time, different users of the system will see different states of the
system as current. In some cases, the inconsistency corresponds to the situation
when a new block has been discovered but has not yet been relayed to all users of
the system. To obtain eventual consistency, a sound consensus protocol should
impose the following requirement:

36
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Condition 1: A user who discovered a block should be encouraged to broadcast it
over the network immediately and not hold it for himself. In other cases, system
inconsistency is caused by the blockchain splitting into several branches. There are
various causes of blockchain branching (forking):

•
•

Two users discover new blocks at about the same time
An attacker attempts to reverse completed transactions by forking the blockchain

In order to discourage deliberate branching, a sound consensus protocol should add
the following requirement:
Condition 2: A user should be discouraged from discovering blocks on top of
intermediate chains. More precisely, if there is a known block B′ referencing the block
B, the user should have no reason to build on B. With the situation depicted in Figure
1, only three blocks can be used as a base for extending the blockchain according to
Conditions 1–2: Bi+2, B′′ i+1, and B′ i+2. There are further restrictions imposed on
valid blockchains; in most cases, these conditions amount to selecting a chain with the
maximum number of blocks (which excludes B′′ i+1 from blocks a rational user could
build on his own chain). The goal of consensus rules is to assure selection of a single
chain; however, it is usually the case that some rules depend on the user. E.g., if there
are multiple Bitcoin blockchains with the same length, users should select the one they
received first. Thus, there is no way to enforce the selection of the same blockchain
for all users (as it is very difficult or impossible to ensure that user-specific rules are
followed). In order for the system to be eventually consistent, its consensus protocol
should satisfy the following third requirement:

37
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Condition 3: Consensus rules should be constructed in a way that results in
resolving blockchain forks, i.e. one of the competing branches should take over all
other branches in a reasonable amount of time. We will use separate terms for
discovering blocks using proof of work and proof of stake algorithms:
Definition 2: The process of solving a computational challenge imposed by a proof
of work protocol is called (block) mining.
Proof of Work (PoW): PoW systems need computing power and electric
consumption to approve the operations on the network. (Ex: Bitcoin)
Consider Bitcoin as an example of a cryptocurrency systems secured with a proof
of work algorithm. Each block in Bitcoin consists of two parts:

•
•

Block header of key parameters, including block creation time, reference to the
previous block and the Merkle tree root of the block of transactions
Block list of transactions.

To reference a specific block, its header is hashed twice with the SHA-256 function;
the resulting integer value belongs to the interval [0, 2256 − 1].
To account for different possible implementations, we will use a generic
.
hashing function hash ( ) with a variable number of arguments and range [0,
M]. For example, arguments of the function can be treated as binary strings
and merged together to form a single argument that can be passed to the
SHA-256 hashing function.

T

The block reference is used in the proof of work protocol; in order for a block to be
considered valid, its reference must not exceed a certain threshold;
hash(B) ⩽ M/D, (1)
where D ∈ [1, M] is the target difficulty. There is no known way to find B satisfying
(1) other than iterating through all possible variables in the block header repeatedly.
The higher the value of D, the more iterations are needed to find a valid block; the
expected number of operations is exactly D.

38
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

The time period T(r) for a miner with hardware capable of performing r operations
per second to find a valid block is distributed exponentially with the rate r/D:
P{T(r) ⩽ t} = 1 − exp(−rt/D)
Consider n Bitcoin miners with hash rates r1, r2, …, rn. The period of time to find
a block T is equal to the minimum value of random variables T(ri) assuming that
the miner publishes a found block and it reaches other miners immediately.
According to the properties of the exponential distribution, T is also distributed
exponentially:

P {T = min(T1 , . . . , Tn ) ! t} = 1 − exp −

i=1

.

The last equation shows that the mining is fair: a miner with a share of mining
power p has the same probability p to solve a block before other miners. It can be
shown that proof of work as used in Bitcoin satisfies Conditions 1–3.
Proof of Stake (PoS): On the contrary to Proof of. Work (PoW), Proof of Stake
networks are not associated with computing powers and electricity consumption.
Odds of block discoveries are in parallel with the amount held in individuals’ wallets.
In proof of stake algorithms, inequality (1) is modified to depend on the user’s
ownership of the particular PoS protocol cryptocurrency and not on block
properties. Consider a user with address A and balance bal(A). A commonly used
proof of stake algorithm uses a condition as
hash(hash(Bprev), A, t) ⩽ bal(A)M/D, (2)
where

•
•

Bprev denotes the block the user is building on.
t is the current UTC timestamp.
For various reasons, some cryptocurrencies use modified versions of (2) which we
discuss in the corresponding sections.

39
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Unlike (1), the only variable that the user can change is the timestamp t in the left
part of equation (2). The address balance is locked by the protocol; e.g., the
protocol may calculate the balance based on funds that did not move for a day.
Alternatively, a PoS cryptocurrency may use unspent transaction outputs as Bitcoin
does; in this case, the balance is naturally locked. A proof of stake protocol puts
restrictions on possible values of t. For example, if t must not differ from the UTC
time on network nodes by more than an hour, then a user can attempt no more than
7200 values of t. Thus, there are no expensive computations involved in proof of
stake.
Together with an address A and a timestamp t satisfying (2), a user must provide a
proof of ownership of the address. To achieve this, the user can sign the newly
minted block with his signature; in order to produce a valid signature, one must have
a Private Key corresponding to the address A.
The time to find a block for address A is exponentially distributed with rate
bal(A)/D, the (2) implementation of proof of stake is fair: the probability to
generate a valid block is equal to the ratio of user’s balance of funds to the
total amount of currency in circulation. The time to find a block for the entire
network is distributed exponentially with rate ∑ a bal(a)/D.

T
the currency ∑ a bal(a) is fixed or grows at a

Thus, if the monetary supply of
predictable rate, the difficulty D should be known in advance: D = 1 Tex ∑ a
bal(a), with Tex denoting the expected time between blocks. In practice, D
needs to be adjusted based on recent blocks because not all currency owners
[16]
participate in block minting.

7.4. Innovative Reward System by MenaPay Green Mining
MenaPay introduces 2 approach via Green Mining as explained below:
7.4.1. MenaPay Token Chance for Each P2M Transaction
First one comes with the chance of earning MenaPay Token. Each individual who
uses the MenaCash for the transactions to the merchants (Peer to Merchant
transaction - P2M) has a chance of getting MenaPay Token as a reward via the
system calls Proof of MenaCash Transaction (PoMT). When a transaction happens
between a user and a merchant; users qualify for a chance to earn MenaPay Token
regarding the following formula:

40
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Vm = Total value to be divided between participants for month m.
km = Number of participants in month m.
sim = Total amount of share that participant I receives in month m.
xim = Share coefficient of participant I in month m.
yinm = Value of nth transaction by participant I in month m.
zinm = Random number, zinm ∈ [0,1] and zinm can have a different probability
distribution function every month.
F = Cumulative distribution function for transactions. Returns a constant number
for each transaction depending on its value.

As a major revolution, the reward is independent from the volume of each
transaction and reward make the user a MenaPay community members even
if they had never purchased a MenaPay Token before.

T

7.4.2. Staking Model for MenaPay Token Holders
Second and the most reformist way to generate additional revenue apart from the
price increasing is staking the MenaPay Tokens.

41
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Since Menapay Platform is a nonprofit organization it must use majority of its
revenue to fill Green Mining reserve. This amount calculated as 75% of
Menapay Platform’s revenue and will be used to buy MenaPay Tokens from the
exchanges in order to feed Green Mining pool.
It is creating a new standard in the crypto industry for the level of participatory
returns, beyond the regular incentives for users and investors.
Each staked MenaPay Token is considered as a mining token and has chance to
win an additional token based on the smart contract designed by the criteria
mentioned below;
- Total # of tokens staked on daily basis
- Total # of tokens in the green mining reserve
The users who stake their MenaPay Tokens will have right to earn tokens from
Green Mining pool according to the number of staked tokens. In order to take
advantage of this model, user must stake minimum 5.000 MenaPay Token with
the minimum time limit as 30 days. Users who decided to get back their tokens
before the minimum period may not take any share from the Green Mining
reserve.
Only staked tokens holded in the native MenaPay wallet or MenaPay payment
application will be considered.
As a summary; staking income by MenaPay tokens will be distributed on the
(N+30). day where N is the first day of staking for the individual.
It is important to highlight that MenaPay Token is a utility token since
MenaChain Solutions DWC - LLC does not issue dividends and/or voting
rights to the token holders. MenaPay Foundation will distributeMenaPay
Tokens from Green Mining reserve with holders according to the amount of
their staked MenaPay Token in their wallets as mentioned above. MenaPay
Foundation keeps the right to adjust the model according to the needs of the
market and community.

42
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

7.5. Security
Today, existing payment systems and solutions are open to data breaches, hacks,
malignant uses. According to IBM, in 2016 data breaches have increased by 937%
and have reached 200M financial service records with respect to the previous year.[17]
Financial services spend multibillion US dollars to prevent this kind of
malicious cases. Another control mechanism is added to the system for each
added control mechanism to inhibit the added control mechanism.This
process is an endless chain reaction which is reflected as inefficient time and
money on both internal processes of financial institutions and user
experience. In the technology environment we live in, this system is still used
while it has continuously given deficits which has ended with great amounts
of labor and money thefts. The seven-year fraud which has reached a $81M
volume in India is an example from hundreds.[18]

T

For credit card purchases, mostly the information on the card is sufficient. A card
left on the table is open to be used outside of the owner’s knowledge. MenaPay is
developed with 2FA, payment passwords or approval processes considering this kind
of possibilities.
Every transaction step is written in a block on the blockchain and MenaPay, which is
on a permissioned blockchain, keeps records of these transactions. Records cannot
be tampered with, since the blockchain is fully closed to outside interventions.

Figure 15: Transaction Steps on Blockchain
43
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

MenaPay uses technology to create an innovative and maximum-safety-platform against below
possible safety problem scenarios;

•

Someone else obtaining the private key:
The private key belonging to the user and the password the user enters to login
MenaPay is encrypted together. Algorithms which encrypt these are tested so that third
parties cannot possibly decrypt the key and password combination.

•

Attacks on MenaGateway:
We will request a MenaGateway over HTTPS, which will prevent DNS Attacks,
DDoS Attacks, SSL certificate attacks, etc. on the server side.

•

3rd Party integrations:
All libraries and SDKs used within the application are controlled by MenaPay
developers. Only the versions which have safety approvals exist on the platform.

•

2FA login:
2 Factor Authentication is a security process where two methods of identification are
needed. The password and the special code produced by the identification readily
embedded in your application forms the two steps of the process.

•

Mnemonic phrases are used:
We use 16-word phrases for retrieval of accounts in case of forgotten passwords. Users
will keep their 16-word auxiliary passwords elsewhere which are given during the sign-up
period.
What is Mnemonic Phrase?
Mnemonic phrase is the name given to the 16-word password which enables users to
retrieve their wallets in case of password loses. This 16-word password is unique for every
user and shared during the signup process.

Figure 16: Mnemonic Phrase Screen
44
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

•

Detection of Private Keys:
Private keys are encrypted within the application and are only decrypted during
transactions.

•

Payment/transfer approval:
Users will be able to see transaction summaries including the counter party and
amount information at the last step of the payment/transfer so that they can pay
safely and transparently.

•

Except private keys, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard will be used for the
data within the application.

•

In cases of MenaGateway use, different data centers will be assigned regarding
any possible technical problems that might occur in the existing datacenter. If
such problems occur, CDN service will be used to direct traffic to the other data
centers. This will ensure an uninterrupted user experience.

•

All users, merchants and resellers who reach an accumulated process volume of 100
MenaCash are subject to a detailed KYC process in order to prevent fraud and fake
accounts. This process is told in detail under 5.1 and doesn’t compromise speed
while preventing security breaches.
MenaPay, presents a permissioned blockchain cleared from attack possibilities rather
than a public blockchain which are usually under attack at 51%.
MenaPay is not responsible for the theft of information from individual users from
their own devices. This situation is under user’s own risk.

8. Business
We’re building the MenaPay Platform in an untapped region within the fintech
industry with the power of blockchain technology.
One of the other reasons why MenaPay focuses on MENA is the power of well
networked founders and investors who are highly reputable and well known in the
region. MENA will be a very strong “hometown” to grow fast, dominate as a first
mover and then move to the global scenery.

45
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

8.1. How to Develop the Most Commonly Used Cryptocurrency
MenaPay brings a first-time solution for crypto currencies to be ease and practical in
daily life. Such a practical and robust solution will naturally attain Top 10 ranking by
market cap.
Today, current steps of 2 commonly used payment systems in the MENA region is
mostly like below:
MenaPay aims to become the most commonly used payment platform by
replacing the banks with Resellers and/or MenaPay Foundation itself in a
transaction process.

T

So instead of this flow which requires bulk of bureaucracy to get in;

Figure 17: Current Payment Steps
MenaPay offers below process by replacing the banks with resellers:

Figure 18: Payment Steps with MenaPay
46
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

If you look at the leaders of technology which disrupted conventional ways,
one of the most common specialty of them is being distributed. Airbnb
distributed the accommodations, Uber distributed the vehicles and any online
market place website distributed one store to hundreds of them.

T

Our major strategy is to distribute one single money source (bank) to
hundreds of them (Resellers) for the MenaPay users. This way comes with
the chance of defaecating from whole bulky requirements of traditional
payment system which includes banks. Distribution method will work easier
than ever with the power of decentralization on blockchain technology.
Besides this method, integrating merchants starting from the ones which has
biggest customer databases will bring millions of users in a short period of
time to the MenaPay Platform.

T

MenaPay follows a certain plan for the exponential growth in the region with being
data driven, adaptive and solution-oriented. MenaPay will follow the channels below
for marketing and business development purposes;

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Discount on premium merchants for MenaPay users (Discount amount will be covered
by MenaPay Foundation)
Very low commission offers to merchants compared to current payment gateways
Significant online and offline marketing actions
Data oriented performance marketing
Influencer marketing
Social media channels
Offline events and organizations
Regional partnerships with brands
Bounty & referral program
Media Relations, PR
Business development team located in UAE, KSA, Turkey and Bahrain
Business network of the founders and investors

MenaPay’s most important customer segments are merchants and the individual
users. Therefore, its marketing strategy comes in two steps; reaching merchants and
acquiring users.

47
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

When it comes to merchants, we have already started to make deals with merchants
from the region, using our previous experience and network. Currently, we managed
to make deals with 50 merchants from the region. With the aim of reaching 1.000
merchants within a year, we will build a two-way communication with our potential
and existing merchants using a well-designed, data-driven, problem solving B2B sales
strategy to create a sustainable and satisfied ecosystem.
We have designed a simple and fast user interface in our product, so users could
easily get used to the system. User will have 10 different language options including
Arabic, English, Turkish and so on. We have built a strong digital marketing strategy
for our social media channels which we will be fully and constantly active to connect
and communicate with our community.
To fully understand the culture and the needs of the region, we will build an
experienced, strong sales team to get in touch with the merchants and resellers in the
field. As we set our purpose to become the most commonly used cryptocurrency of
MENA, MenaPay will spread effectively in the region.
MenaPay will gladly share tokens to make sure that they have privileges in the
community as discounts, priorities, private events etc. 10% of tokens separated for
bounties and airdrops which is equal ratio for team members and founders.

8.2. Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) Details and Timeline
While creating MENA region’s first blockchain based common payment system,
MenaPay Foundation will collect the necessary funds with an IEO, Public Token
Sale will be done with Initial Exchange Offering, which is a safe and innovative way
of fundraising.

•

The tokens reserved for Founders, Team, Bounty, Airdrops, Advisors and
Partnerships will have 12, 24 or 36 months of lock up periods and will only be
released in 10% brackets (10% of the assigned token amount) in each month after
lock-up period.

•

Green Mining Reserve, is the portion to provide MenaPay tokens earned by
MenaCash transactions and staking model.

8.4. Timeline and Growth Plan
When the IEO finalizes, the MenaPay Platform will start to operate with the 50
existing merchants in the system. MenaPay users will be able to pay these merchants
with MenaCash over the platform. As of July 2019, there will be at least 500
merchants on the platform. Relevant information could be found under the headline
8.1.

Figure 19: Timeline
Face Recognition: In order to increase security measures and provide user
convenience, face recognition feature will be added on September 2019. Our R&D
team is also working on the integration of mnemonic passwords and face
recognition which will create a unique solution in the industry.
5 Offices in MENA Countries: We’ve already opened offices in Dubai (UAE), in
Istanbul & Ankara in Turkey and in Manama (Bahrain). Our plan is to open KSA
(Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) and Egypt offices in the short term to speed up
penetration in the region.

50
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

50 Merchant Integration: We’ve already signed “LOI - Letter of Intent” with more
than 50 merchants who are willing to integrate MenaPay as a payment gateway and
become the grand launch partners of MenaPay platform. Our business development
team has already started participating in the international exhibitions to present the
MenaPay solution and acquire new merchants. All events can be followed on
https://www.menapay.io/#events
5 Million MenaPay Users: When the critical milestone of 5 million accumulated
users is reached by mid-2019, we will have more than 2 million monthly active users
which will make MenaPay one of the most commonly used cryptocurrencies in the
world and distinctly the #1 crypto currency in MENA region. Accordingly, we
expect to enter into the Top 30 Cryptocurrencies by Market Capitalization.
Smart Contract to MenaChain: In the third quarter of 2019, MenaChain will also
have a smart contract so it will have the securest way to transact money between two
parties. Specifically companies which have security concerns will be able to define a
3rd party to control the transaction of money and/or goods.
Whitelabel MenaCash Wallet: Since it requires a long, detailed process to develop
a wallet for merchants; MenaPay will offer a whitelabel wallet to the merchants in the
platform. Merchants will be able to name and use their own digital currencies in
MenaPay ecosystem.
Cash Register Integration: In order to propose another useful experience to
MenaPay user, in the second half of 2019, MenaPay will apply cash register
integration.
500 Merchant Integration: MenaPay business development team is focused in the
integration of premium online merchants at phase 1. Together with the increasing
trend of active users, many merchants will be willing to integrate MenaPay as their
primary payment method.
Parental Control for Family Accounts: Family account feature will be activated.
Parents will monitor and control their children’s accounts.
Supporting 10 languages: Since our priority is MENA region, all products will be
launched with Arabic, Turkish and English languages firstly. After reaching over 5
million users, MenaPay community will be willing to use MenaPay at overseas as well.
We expect a significant request from the merchants located in the countries such as
UK and USA where MENA-region-people frequently visit. Also, merchants and
users in the other Islamic countries (extended MENA region) will be willing to use
MenaPay and we’ll support the community by adding more languages.
51
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

Expansion to Asian countries: MenaPay expansion plan especially covers the
Islamic Asian countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia. We’ll take Islamic Asian
countries as our base point to penetrate the large and promising Asia market. At the
same time, Asian digital companies are aware of the monetization problems in the
Islamic regions and they are willing to integrate solutions to help them better
monetize their businesses. We plan to open offices in Asia to reach the potential
merchants with local teams.
Advanced AI features, P2P Lending and payment installment: MenaPay is the
future of finance. MenaPay platform collects user data and analyses them with
advanced machine learning and AI features. By the end of 2019, MenaPay data
platform will reach a sophisticated level to calculate proper credit score for the users.
Credit scores can be shared with the merchants upon approval from the users. Then,
merchants can decide whether to allow users to pay in installments or start payment
after a certain period of time according to their credit score.
Dubai, İstanbul, Bahrain, Riyad and Kahira will be the places welcoming MenaPay’s
first offices in the region.
During the IEO, MenaPay plans to be listed on the Top exchanges. After the IEO,
since the key part for a cryptocurrency to take place in any exchange is the number
of users and the volume. MenaPay aims to reach 1M users in a very short period of
time and 5M users in 6 months which would make MenaPay globally #1
cryptocurrency in terms of number of users. The main reason for MenaPay’s
development is to serve any person who wants to use a digital payment system in
their daily life.
AliPay and WeChat Pay examples which dominate the payment system industry in
the Asia region are guarantees for the success of MenaPay within the MENA region
by easily gaining users where the internet and mobile penetration rates are extremely
high.

8.5. Business and Revenue Model
MenaPay eliminates major cost channels of POS machines, monthly fixed fees,
expensive credit and debit card fees by integrating barcode and QR code
technologies, which are usable on every smartphone, into the system. This
opportunity is highly intriguing for the merchants. Built with these advantages and
the blockchain technology, which eliminates intermediaries, MenaPay aims to create
its own ecosystem without depending on other dynamics.

52
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

MenaPay Foundation, generates the revenue to be distributed to MenaPay Token
Holders through 3 channels;

•
•
•

P2P transaction fee
P2M transaction fee (from merchant)
M2F cash-out fee

Transaction fees for P2P will be 1% on average and cash-out fee will be 5% on
average.

Figure 20: MenaPay Platform Revenue Models
All transactions are 100% transparent and secure whether guaranteed by the technical
structure of the blockchain technology or by the nodes that will be given to the 3rd
party audit companies.
Revenue generating methods of MenaPay do not include any interest methods.
MenaCash equivalent USD is kept in accounts of MenaPay. This money is never to be
subjected to interest. The accounts are interest-free. In case of large sums of money,
money will be held in baskets of gold, different fiat currencies and liquid real estate
assets. Any P2P transaction witnessed by 2 parties is considered as compliant with
Islamic jurisprudence, so long as there is no financial interest within that system.

53
MenaPay WhitePaper V 2.0

MenaPay Foundation also assures not to generate any interest gain from the cash
reserve of MenaCash.
MenaPay Foundation uses %75 of its total revenue to fill the Green Mining pool
which will use for staking and rewarding models. Detailed information can be found
under section 7.4.

8.6. Financial Projections
From the 1.000 merchants we will be reaching at the end of year 2019, there will be
10.000 users acquired on the average for each. This will bring our user number to
10M. Today, the mobile payment penetration of WeChat Pay is around 87% in
China. WeChat Pay first arose in September 2014. If this high percentage achieved
by WeChat Pay and MENA region’s digital transformation rates are taken into
account, the number of users solely within the MENA region would become 225
million in year 2022.
The average money transfer per person made within the year 2017 through digital
POS machines is 243 USD. [21] Even if the exponential increase of the transfer
amount is disregarded, with 225M users, MenaCash transaction volume would be
60B USD.
Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there
were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of
them using Bitcoin. [22] Considering Bitcoin is the most used cryptocurrency even
with the fast-paced volatility it is accustomed with, we can predict that MenaCash
would become the most used cryptocurrency with its stable USD backed value in the
region and the world.
