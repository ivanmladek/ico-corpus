Abstract

Mainstream adoption of blockchain systems has been limited due to unsolved questions
of scalability, privacy, and interoperability. In this paper, we will outline a proposed design
for the Aion Network; a 3rd generation multi-tier blockchain system designed to address
these challenges. Core to our hypothesis is the idea that many blockchains will be created
to solve unique business challenges, within unique industries. As such, the Aion Network
is designed to support custom blockchain architectures, while providing a trustless mechanism for cross-chain interoperability. At the root of this system is the world’s ﬁrst dedicated public enterprise blockchain, Aion-1; a state of the art blockchain that introduces a
new paradigm of security, and fair, representative crypto-economic incentives.
Roadmap

This paper is intended as a technical introduction, and will be followed by additional research and design considerations. As such, over the coming months, the Aion team will
publish a series of research papers that more thoroughly explain the concepts of the proposed consensus algorithm, the virtual machine and scripting language, the bridge and
inter-chain transaction functionality, and the economic system underpinning the network.
In addition, following this introductory paper, Aion will release its fundraising strategy and
timeline for your consideration. We look forward to your feedback as we share our ideas
with you.

HISTORY

INTRODUCTION

Mainstream adoption of blockchains has been limited because of scalability, privacy, and interoperability challenges. Aion is the ﬁrst
multi-tier blockchain network designed to address these challenges.
Core to our hypothesis is the idea that many blockchains will be created to solve unique business challenges within unique industries.
As such, the Aion network is designed to support custom blockchain architectures while providing a trustless mechanism for cross-chain
interoperability. At the root of the Aion network is the ﬁrst dedicated, public, enterprise blockchain: Aion-1.
Aion-1 is a state-of-the-art, third-generation blockchain that introduces a new paradigm of security and fair, representative, cryptoeconomic incentives.
This paper:
• Introduces and explains the Aion network—the next generation of blockchain technology and ﬁrst multi-tier blockchain network—
and its necessary infrastructures and protocols.
• Details the vision and technical concepts of Aion-1, a purpose-built, public, third-generation blockchain and a component within
the Aion network.
• Provides a roadmap for future implementations of Aion-1 and the Aion network.
These concepts are a work in progress and this paper is intended to establish intent and be exploratory in nature, not declarative. Join
the Aion network mailing list to get alerts about more detailed white papers related to speciﬁc aspects of Aion as they become available.

HISTORY

The landscape of digital currencies and related blockchain technologies has changed signiﬁcantly since Bitcoin was ﬁrst introduced in
2008.

2.1 First-generation blockchain
Bitcoin [1] led the way in the creation of numerous alternative currency platforms as the ﬁrst generation of blockchain technology. These
ﬁrst-generation blockchains provided a solution to conventional transaction limitations by implementing cryptographically-secure, peerto-peer, digital transactions that are veriﬁed by a decentralized global network and recorded into an immutable public ledger. Resulting
in a platform that leverages the advantages of being digital, while preserving the economics of scarcity.

2.2 Second-generation blockchain
With the second generation of blockchain, Ethereum introduced the ability to build application-speciﬁc logic upon a blockchain network
[2]. This enabled new capabilities beyond transactions to incorporate state, business logic, and multi-party contracts to be stored and
executed on a blockchain and written to an immutable ledger. These concepts have been incorporated into other distributed ledger
technologies and have led to the distinction of building a blockchain and building upon a blockchain.
The emersion of blockchain-based applications is positive for the industry. Applications with novel use cases further demonstrate, and
validate, the technology’s ability to evolve beyond just a means of transferring value. However, these separate networks are becoming
disparate as they are isolated and able only to transfer data oﬀ chain or transfer value through centralized exchanges. In a sense, tiny
kingdoms with borders between economies and industries are being cemented. As the number of networks grow, the more disconnected
and sparse the industry becomes.
Just as in the early days of the internet, disparate blockchains networks have yet to truly realize the beneﬁts of being connected. While
specialized blockchain networks will and should be developed, being able to communicate on chain to other networks oﬀers signiﬁcant
beneﬁts, particularly if privacy and scalability can be maintained. A mechanism for joining disparate networks will unlock enormous value
for every participating network.

AION MULTI-TIER BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK

2.3 Aion: the third-generation blockchain

2.3 Aion: the third-generation blockchain
In the future, blockchains will federate data and value in a hub and spoke model similar to the internet. The future of mainstream
blockchain adoption will be achieved by the development of a networked, federated blockchain to integrate these separate spokes. That
integrated blockchain network is Aion.
Aion is a third-generation blockchain network that will enable any private or public sector organization to:
• Federate: Send data and value between any Aion-compliant blockchain and Ethereum.
• Scale: Provide fast transaction processing and increased data capacity to all Aion blockchains.
• Spoke: Allow the creation of customized public or private blockchains that maintain interoperability with other blockchains, but
allow publishers to choose governance, consensus mechanisms, issuance, and participation.
At the root of the Aion network is a purpose-built, public, third-generation blockchain called Aion-1. Designed to connect other blockchains
and manage its own robust applications, Aion-1 also provides the economic system that incentivizes interoperability in the ecosystem.
AION tokens are the fuel used to create new blockchains, monetize inter-chain bridges, and secure the overall network.

AION MULTI-TIER BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK

The Aion multi-tier blockchain network is like a computer network, providing a protocol and standard for dissimilar systems to communicate. However, in addition to information, the Aion network will pass logic and value among participating blockchains to create a
contiguous value chain where every transaction occurs on-chain, with logic and value passing among chains as freely as liquid assets.

These infrastructures, protocols, and concepts will work together to guarantee transmission from an origin to its destination through
interchain communication. The value of these technologies is that they enable one blockchain to transact with another blockchain, as
well as one blockchain to transact with every connected blockchain.

3.1 Connecting Networks
Connecting networks are networks that facilitate interchain communication and interchain transactions between multiple private or
public blockchain networks. Connecting networks are deﬁned by requirements that specify their role within the context of the Aion

Interchain transaction

network. Connecting networks and interchain transactions provide a universal interface that enables blockchain developers and users
to route messages from one network to another. Speciﬁcally, a connecting network should provide the following core functionalities:
• Route messages between diﬀerent blockchain networks through a common bridging protocol that involves translation and propagation of the message, which must be considered ﬁnal.
• Provide decentralized accountability.
• Provide a bridging protocol.
Aion network protocols specify standards for the external components. While the actual functionality and internal components of each
connecting network might vary by vendor and intended purpose, these core functionalities should be implemented.
Point-to-point connections such as inter-blockchain relays or purpose-speciﬁc networks such as BTC Relay exist as central hubs. Such
protocols, while simple and eﬃcient, often result in complicated state channels that can give rise to contentious situations and are often
at the mercy of one or a select group of individuals that run the relaying networks.
A connecting network instead uses bridges and a trust-free blockchain network to validate and ensure the correctness of ﬂowing transactions. By introducing a third party that routes messages from point A to point B, the networks themselves do not have to manage diﬃcult
or unclear situations.

3.2 Interchain transaction
An interchain transaction is a trust-free message between blockchain networks, a critical infrastructure component powering interchain
communication. Interchain transactions allow any connected blockchain networks to exchange information, like computers on the internet.
Interchain transactions are initially created on a source blockchain and then processed and forwarded by bridges and connecting networks before ﬁnally reaching the target blockchain. As stated previously, the creator of an interchain transaction must pay a transaction
fee for the communication cost using AION tokens, thereby incentivizing all the participants in each junction of the route.
Interchain transactions are designed to be somewhat analogous to packets by specifying the hops they should perform from the source
to target network, which potentially means passing through numerous connecting networks.

3.2.1 Format

Ideally, the interchain transaction format would include three parts:
• Payload data that is speciﬁc to the creator and is typically regular transaction data, but potentially could be extended to arbitrary
data, at the discretion of the creator and the source network.
• Metadata about the interchain transaction that contains routing information and fees.
• Merkle proof that is only used when the sender wants to bypass the bridge.
The bridge and connecting network validators shall not interpret the data, but do check the integrity of the transaction as a whole. Privacysensitive information applications could choose to encrypt the data if necessary.

3.2.2 Routing

The routing of interchain transactions is a multi-phase process. In each phase, the validators verify the transaction and reach consensus
on whether the transaction should be forwarded or rejected. If a transaction gets rejected at any point, any state change as a result of
the interchain transaction will be reverted, at least in the connecting network.
The routing path can be divided into two subpaths: the forward path and backward path. In the forward path, an interchain transaction
ﬂows from the source chain all the way to the target chain. In the backward path, a conﬁrmation of the interchain transaction is passed
back.

If a bridge refuses to broadcast an interchain transaction for any reason, the sender may choose to pass the interchain transaction,
including proof, directly to the connecting network. The connecting network will validate the interchain transaction based on its knowledge
of a merkle hash chain of the participating network and broadcast it if valid.
The design of the interchain transaction is still under consideration and a detailed paper on the workings of interchain transactions will
be published as the project progresses.

until the transaction is processed.

3.3 Bridges

• The on-hold transaction will be forwarded by bridge validators that connect the connecting network and the next blockchain on
the route.
• Once a conﬁrmation is received from the target blockchain, the state changes to conﬁrmed.
• If no conﬁrmation is received, the state changes to timed out.
• For conﬁrmed interchain transactions, the state changes to ﬁnalized and all locked fees are distributed to the connecting network
and bridge validators.

3.3 Bridges
A bridge is a communication protocol that facilitates communication between the participating network and the connecting network. A
bridge is composed of its own distinct network of validators that assures translation of protocols and accountability between networks.
Bridges are directional; the source blockchain is the chain where transactions are emitted and the target blockchain is the chain where
the transactions are forwarded.
A bridge has two main responsibilities:
• Signing and broadcasting an interchain transaction only if they have been sealed in the source blockchain and an interchain transaction forwarding fee has been paid.
• Informing the connecting network of the merkle hash updates of the participating network.
Bridge validators will use a lightweight BFT-based algorithm to reach consensus. Transactions get approved only after receiving over two
thirds of the total votes (weighted).

3.3.1 Registration

Connecting networks are responsible for registering their directly-connected bridges. For each bridge, a dedicated table of validators will
be maintained on the blockchain, sorted by stake. Anyone can join a publicly-available bridge by pledging stake towards it. Speciﬁcally,
there is a contract or protocol whose purpose is to maintain a global bridge registration, which is updated dynamically as nodes join or
leave bridging networks.
For a bridge to be considered valid, a minimum total stake is required. Only the topvalidators will be allowed to participate in bridge
consensus.

3.3 Bridges

3.3.2 Competition

Multiple bridges may be generated when multiple groups of validators register for the same blockchain network using diﬀerent identiﬁers.
From the perspective of the connecting network, these bridges are distinct, although they propagate and receive messages towards the
same network.
It is then the user’s responsibility to determine which bridge to use by specifying the target network identiﬁcation. Here, the intent is to
drive an open market by incentivizing diﬀerent bridging networks to compete in terms of stability, reputation, and pricing, with the goal
of an optimal fee value driven by market demands.

3.3.3 Bridge consensus

Bridge validators reach consensus by following a lightweight, BFT-based protocol where transactions are processed by one round instead
of multiple rounds. Each validator evaluates a transaction based on their view of the previous blockchain. An interchain transaction is
deemed valid if two thirds or more of validators voted yes, at which point the next blockchain considers the transaction valid.
Beginning at the start state, a bridge validator is required to wait until an interchain transaction is received and then veriﬁes the validity
of signature and transaction fees. Based on the validity of the transaction, it is either dropped (not signed) by the validator, or signed and
propagated to the connecting or target network.

3.3.4 Fee distribution

Bridge validators are rewarded from interchain transaction fees and potentially a portion of block rewards. The fee distribution aim is a
fair distribution policy.
Internally, all fees that go to a bridge are distributed to the bridge validators. This could be done either proportionally to the stake each
validator has put on the bridge or equally regardless of staking.
Externally, bridges share interchain transaction fees with other bridges on the routing path and with the connecting network validators.
There are two possible distribution models for external fees:
• The sender of an interchain transaction speciﬁes how the fees are distributed between bridges and the connecting network. The
advantage of this approach is that users have the option to optimize the fees based on the bridge load and minimum rates. The
drawback is that users need a basic understanding of the routing path and fee requirements of each bridge before sending the
transaction.
• The sender only speciﬁes the total fee and the bridge and connecting network shares this fee based on agreements or hard-coded
protocol. This approach has the advantage of being simpler for the user. The drawback of this approach is that changing the ratio
between bridge and connecting network is slow, if not hard.

3.4 Participating Networks
One of the core concepts in the Aion network design is that it is dedicated to the federation of compatible blockchains or blockchainrelated networks. These can be purpose-speciﬁc blockchains, private networks, or consortium blockchains representing collections of
entities. Regardless of the context, the interconnectedness and the ability to interoperate in an eﬃcient, secure, and transparent manner
increases the value of each network individually and also provides stability to the blockchain ecosystem in general.
A participating network is any network that has successfully implemented requirements to integrate with the connecting network. Participating networks should be blockchains, but are not necessarily limited to such. Some useful participants could be oracles, cryptlets
[3], or database clusters in need of veriﬁable information. The only limitation is the ﬂexibility of the participating network to integrate
with the connecting network. Once integrated with the Aion network, participating networks gain access to the communication protocol
(interchain transaction) speciﬁed earlier, enabling numerous possible use cases.
Participating networks have the full ﬂexibility to customize diﬀerent modules of their blockchain infrastructure including the consensus
algorithm, hashing algorithm, virtual machine (VM), and scripting languages.

3.4.1 AION Compliant Blockchains

Aion-compliant blockchains refer to the participating blockchains that comply with the Aion protocol and on which bridges can be established easily to forward interchain transactions through Aion-1.
To be Aion-compliant, a blockchain must meet certain requirements including:
• Be decentralized in some fashion and support procedures commonly found in blockchains such as atomic broadcast and transactions. The exact implementation is left to the discretion of the bridging protocol and the network itself.
• Be able to recognize interchain transactions as distinct from regular transactions.
• Be aware of the consensus protocol used by the bridge and store a transaction deemed valid.
• Implement locktime or a similar feature that allows tokens to be held by the network for a period of time.
Blockchain vendors will be able to adapt their oﬀerings to be Aion-compliant. The Nuco blockchain infrastructure will be among the ﬁrst
Aion-compliant networks.
More speciﬁc details on the requirements will be published as the project progresses.

3.4.2 Existing network compatibility

Unlike Aion-compliant blockchains, existing blockchains are not designed to be interoperable. To enable interchain transaction routing
between the Aion network and existing blockchains, additional assumptions and/or compromises are required. In this section, we discuss
the possibility of connecting the Ethereum blockchain to the Aion network.

3.4.2.1

AION to Ethereum

As part of the bridge protocol, a lightweight BFT-based consensus algorithm is used by the bridge validators. In Aion connecting networks,
these BFT votes are natively aggregated and processed by the blockchain validators. The Ethereum blockchain does not have this built-in
functionality, so it needs an interchain transaction contract.
In this model, the interchain transaction contract will synchronize the public keys of bridge validators periodically, depending on the Aion
network speciﬁcation. When an interchain transaction is requested, the bridge validators sign for it with their private key and send the
signature to the interchain transaction contract. The interchain transaction contract will collect all the votes (signatures) and provide a
provable record of the event that contains the interchain transaction data and voting information. If at least two thirds of votes have
been received, the bridge validators will use the record as evidence when conﬁrming the interchain transaction.
Because the computation cost of multi-signature veriﬁcation is high in the Ethereum blockchain (3,000 gas for a single ECDSA), a higher
bridge fee is expected. To reduce this cost, a blockchain with full BFT functionality may be used in the bridge and only the outcome of
voting will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

AION-1 BLOCKCHAIN

3.4.2.2

Ethereum to AION

Sending interchain transactions from the Ethereum blockchain to the Aion network is easier because of Ethereum’s programmable transaction size. Transactions intended for other blockchains will need to incorporate routing information in the data ﬁeld.
There are two possible scenarios that can occur from an Ethereum interchain transaction (interchain transaction from the Ethereum
blockchain to the Aion network), depending on the receiving address. If the transaction is sent to an externally-owned account, the data
ﬁeld can be used without modiﬁcation. If the transaction is sent to a contract account, a workaround will be needed as the data is also
interpreted by the Ethereum VM. One approach for this would be appending the interchain transaction magic tag and routing information
to original call data, as long as the contract logic does not rely on the CALLDATASIZE op code.
To ensure transaction ﬁnality, the bridge may require additional block conﬁrmations; typically major exchanges use 120 (half an hour) for
transaction conﬁdence.

AION-1 BLOCKCHAIN

The Aion-1 blockchain is the genesis implementation of the connecting network. It is designed to be a fair, distributed, open blockchain architecture that is capable of fulﬁlling the requirements speciﬁed in the multi-tier blockchain network architecture. As an open blockchain,
Aion-1 was designed with the following goals:
• Connecting blockchains and external services (e.g., oracles and databases) together through the contiguous network and providing
accountable communication maintained through a decentralized network.
• Providing the necessary infrastructure to develop high-performance, decentralized, inter-blockchain applications.
• Creating a maintainable network through a robust and sustainable economic model.
Users will be able to deploy adjacent participating networks suitable for their own use cases and communicate with other networks
through an accountable routing architecture. Users ranging from large enterprises hosting consortium networks to community-oriented
open networks are all welcome to participate. In the future, decentralized applications could sit on top of the connecting network with
logic driven by integrating data from a multitude of blockchain networks.
In addition, the Aion-1 blockchain is equipped with a full-functioning economic system intended to drive the continued maintenance and
integrity of the network.

4.1 High-level overview
In this proposal, Aion-1 refers to the genesis, or ﬁrst, implementation of a connecting network. The Aion-1 implementation also serves as a
fully-functioning blockchain architecture, comparable to state-of-the-art implementations found in today’s market. We envision Aion-1 to
be a standardized template that provides building blocks for future network implementations. Key components of the Aion-1 blockchain
include:
• Consensus will be used to implement the proposed architecture of connecting two or more blockchains. Two variations of the BFT
protocol will be designed to reach consensus on the bridge and the connecting network:
– Bridge consensus is a lightweight variation to reach consensus quickly on the bridge.
– Connecting Network Consensus is a consensus protocol focused on providing stability at scale.
• Aion virtual machine (AVM) is a custom-built, lightweight, performant, and stable VM that leverages key characteristics of the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM), providing concurrency and robustness within a blockchain-speciﬁc context. The AVM is responsible for
running applications on top of Aion-1. The AVM will include its own scripting language (further described below)

4.2 Consensus
We ﬁrst explore the consensus algorithm featured in Aion-1 to solve the requirements introduced by the connecting network concept. The
consensus algorithm selected needs to maintain consensus of the blockchain for both on-chain transactions, and interchain transactions.
To fulﬁll these requirements in an eﬃcient and immutable manner, Aion-1 uses a consensus algorithm based on a Byzantine Fault Tolerant

(BFT) algorithm combined with a hybrid protocol that aims for a fair representation of both parties in backing—partly through a token
system and partly through a novel veriﬁcation algorithm based on concepts used in modern neural networks called proof-of-intelligence.
To meet operational scale and enable wide participation in the network validation process, Aion-1 will employ a representative validation
model similar to the delegated model explored by the BitShares team [4] and Lisk [5]. This validation model will allow Aion network
participants to back validators who actively participate in the consensus process, enabling a drastic increase of participation beyond what
conventional BFT algorithms would technically allow for. The speciﬁcs of the BFT-based protocol have not been ﬁnalized, but guarantee
the standard properties of liveness and safety. These assumptions are complemented by the representative selection approach in that the
network should be incentivized to select optimal and correct validators. Some implementations that we are investigating are HoneyBadger
[6], Tangaroa [7], and Stellar [8], with special interest in the proposal behaviour within HoneyBadger and the election protocols within
Stellar and Tangaroa protocols.
The conceptual design behind a representative network validation scheme is similar to that of a representative democracy in which candidates register themselves and are elected based on the votes they receive from their constituents. However, in this system, validators
must be supported by backers and each backer receives a share of the reward. The rationale behind such a design is a belief in the
self-governance of the network where collective action of the network directly impacts the security of the network through proper voting.
To summarize, the consensus protocol being proposed is that every node in the network can submit themselves as a candidate and
pledge backing towards a candidate. At the start of every term, the highest-backed set of candidates are selected to be the validators for
this term. These validators contribute to the block generation process through a BFT-based protocol and are granted a distribution of
the block rewards for doing so. This is continued until the term ends and the next term begins, which restarts the process.

4.2.1 Deﬁnitions

To provide context for the various aspects of representative consensus, refer to the following set of deﬁnitions that are used consistently
throughout the rest of the paper:
• Nomination is the process by which a node can register to become a validator to participate in representative consensus on Aion-1.
Nomination must be completed before any other users in the network are able to pledge backing towards them.
• Ranking is used to determine the nominated validators with the highest backing. This ranked list becomes the active set, which
means that the valiator node can contribute a vote towards the consensus process.
• Active set is the tiered list of active validators. The number of validators in the active set.

• Backup sets compose the candidate validators that are active, but are not on the active set. The backup set are the next highest
backed validators. In the event of malicious behaviour or inactivity, the network looks towards this set for replacement validators.
• Backers refer to nodes that support validators. There will be more backers than validators on the network and their participation
directly impacts the ranking of validators on the active set. Additionally, backers are proportionally rewarded based on the rewards
of their validators. Backers consists of two distinct groups: stakers and solvers.
• Stakers are users who pledge tokens towards validators as their backing and are a subset of backers.
• Stakes are locked amounts of tokens held by the network until a predeﬁned time when they are released back to the staker.
• Solvers are users who employ proof of intelligence to solve a cryptographic puzzle given by the network. The proof of intelligence
is then converted to backing. Solvers are a subset of backers.
• Terms are a deﬁned duration of time that a static set is used by the network for purposes of BFT-based consensus. In each term,
a static set of validators validates new blocks. At the end of every term, the active set is frozen to generate a new static set based
on changes in stake.

4.2.2 Validator Nomination Process

Any node can self-nominate and register to become a validator, but they require suﬃcient backing to actively validate on Aion-1. The
network maintains and refreshes between terms a network-wide repository of candidate validators, the nomination contract.
Validators become active through a continuous backing process by the network. The members of the active set are always the highestbacked candidates. To facilitate this continuous backing process, there are two copies of the nomination contract at any point in time.
The live set is updated as network users back or withdraw their backing from the candidates and the static set exists only for the duration
of the term. The consensus protocol derives its active set from the static set. At the end of every term, the static set is overwritten with
the live set for the duration of the next term.
The validators will be able to set how their backers are compensated. So, the validator proposes the terms of its backing and, if those
terms are agreeable, backers will commit resources to that validator. This creates a balance of inﬂuence as the ranking (and subsequent

reward) for an active validator is based on the amount of backing it has compared to other validators.
There is also a reputation mechanism for validator nodes. Candidate validators can oﬀer their reputation as a way to attract initial backing.
The exact features of reputation are being considered, but they will be quantitative, measurable, and well-deﬁned. The intention is to
encourage all participants to consider becoming candidate validators, in addition to using the Aion-1 network for its inherent utility.

4.2.3 Validator-backer rewards distribution

All users are required to present a certain amount of stake towards the network to be considered a candidate validator. However, the
rewards of a validator are not necessarily proportional to their stake. Instead, the ratio of rewards going to validator and backers are
proposed by the validator at the time of proposal to the nomination contract. The idea is for backers and candidate validators to arrive
at some market value that both parties agree on.

4.2.4 Tiered active set

Within the active set, the validators will be organized in a tiered structure. The tiered structure is ranked based on backing, in descending
order, from the highest-backed validator to the lowest. Each tier further incentivizes virtuous behaviour by providing a higher reward as
compensation. The idea is to encourage decentralization by introducing a cost-beneﬁt equilibrium point for centralized backing, thereby
incentivizing backers to diversify.
The belief is this design will incentivize optimization and virtuous actions through interaction between participants. Validators will compete to receive higher backing, and backers will beneﬁt from backing validators, but only up until they are better compensated through
diversifying their backing, including backing inactive validators. One potential reward distribution scheme is as follows.

Referring to the reward scheme depicted in the Table 1, rewards are divided equally among the tiers (25%), then distributed to all validators
in those tiers. Validators in higher tiers have higher proportional rewards because of restricted tier sizes. A predeﬁned reward introduces
an economic model for backers to evaluate the opportunity cost of backing validators, thereby incentivizing backers to distribute their
stakes amongst multiple validators (decentralization), or even nominate themselves as validators. The exact incentive model and structure
will undergo rigorous simulation testing.

4.2.5 Backing

Backing refers to either staking tokens or proof-of-intelligence towards a particular validator. The network is designed to be a hybrid
network that emphasizes a duality of parties to properly distribute power and monetary value evenly across the network. The belief
is that a purely staking-based network (proof of stake) creates a centralization of monetary value within a select group of individuals.
Therefore, an opportunity for another class of users, a class who do not possess the monetary value to participate in staking to contribute
to the network, are emphasized.
The backing algorithm is broken into two distinct categories:
• Backing by staking
• Backing by solving
These two factors combine to generate backing, a conceptual intermediate value used to determine the rank of a validator, as well as the
proportion of rewards given to a backer. In the following sections, each algorithm is discussed and the correlation between these three
variables is investigated.

4.2.5.1

By Staking

Backing through tokens is done through staking the tokens towards a particular validator. During the term 𝑇𝑛 , a user is able to stake
towards a certain validator 𝐾 within 𝑇𝑛+1 . The implication of this is that the tokens are escrowed by the network until the end of 𝑇𝑛+1 ,
at which point the tokens are returned to the user (provided no malicious actions have occurred). Before that, a user can send another
message indicating that they would like the tokens to remain staked towards the same validator 𝐾 .
Renewing the stake refers to the backer keeping the stakes with the validator. The concept of coinage could be a useful mechanism here
where the stakes have a half life. This would encourage liquidity and maintain competition between validators. In return for staking, the
backer receives a portion of the validators reward. The reward is proportional to the amount staked, as well as the current tier of the
staked validator.

4.2.5.2

By Solving

Another form of backing is done through solving a cryptographic puzzle, the exact details of which are explained in the proof of intelligence
section. A unique puzzle is generated per request and the puzzle must be solved through the proof-of-intelligence algorithm to generate
a proof of intelligence. The proof is then submitted to the network as proof of an amount of backing for a particular validator. Solvers
are also rewarded proportionally to the amount backed.

4.2.5.3

4.2

Consensus

As a function of stakes and solutions

To incentivize a hybrid network, a certain distribution of stakes and proof-of-intelligence is needed. This ratio is currently arbitrarily
designed to be 60/40 for stakes and proof-of-computes. The total amount of stake and solutions is accumulated per term and the
backing ratio for the network is adjusted until it is consistent with the expected ratio. Therefore, having a greater proportion than the
expected ratio results in lower backing per stakes/proof of intelligence, and having a lesser proportion than expected results in a greater
amount of backing.

4.2.6 Incentives

The proposed system is designed to discourage bad actors or actions. However, some events may occur. In such events, the validator
will be demoted tiers or removed from the active set, preventing participation in consensus and any rewards for themselves and their
backers.
To discourage malicious backers, repercussions are dealt with by their method of backing. The consequences imposed by the network are
designed to eliminate opportunities for reward, rather than punishment by removal or redistribution of stakes among other validators. In
summary, this mechanism removes the zero-sum gain where one’s loss is another’s gain. Instead, it aligns motivations, and encourages
positive collective actions. The belief is that, with this system in place, the individual understands the consequences of their actions and
is incentivized to act in a virtuous manner and align with other virtuous actors. Bad actors will be identiﬁed by the network, and through
the validator’s decrease in reputation and backing, they receive feedback immediately and make corrective actions or are removed from
the active set.

• Duplicitous Actions are punished by locking all stakes submitted by the validator for a period of time and immediately removing
the validator from consensus. The backers of the validator are punished depending on the method in which they supported the
validator. Stakers are punished by locking their stakes for an extended duration. Solvers are punished by the removal of the
validator from consensus, thereby rendering their proof-of-intelligence solutions invalidated.
• Inactivity by a validator over a period of time is punished by demoting validators in the tier system. If the inactive validator is at
the lowest tier level, they are immediately dropped from consensus.
Replacement validators (the next highest ranked) are available and would immediately be shifted into the consensus process until the
end of the term.

4.2.7 Reputation

Representative consensus leaves the responsibility of selecting the optimal validator nodes to the network. This process is diﬃcult to
achieve unless there is a mechanism for the network to observe past behaviour of candidates and active validators. One option would
be to rely on external statistics to select the optimal candidate. However, there would be incentive to manipulate this data. Therefore,
a reputation system needs to be built within the network where past actions and statistics of a node are a part of the network protocol,

Consensus

• Uptime is the amount of time a node has been active on the network and is important when determining the age (and therefore
reliability) of a node.
• Total backing is the total or aggregate amount of backing received up until that point in time and is summed up per end of term
(as stakes are locked in for that duration of time) and can indicate past performance for the node.
• Centrality is used within the same context as it would be within a social network, would indicate which nodes are the most well
connected within the network, and could be a good indicator of reliability and performance.
• Transaction origin refers to the ﬁrst instance of a transaction appearing on the network (that was accepted into the blockchain)
and can easily be calculated with a requirement that nodes sign transactions they emit.
• Network trust is a global network value for a particular peer that indicates the satisfactory behaviour of the peer from the perspective of the network. This was originally designed for P2P ﬁle-sharing systems [9], and has an algorithm that can be adapted to
consider parameters relevant to our use case.
These statistics are freely available to the user and an eﬀort will be made for these statistics to be easily accessible through the internet.
This creates a knowledgeable user base that is necessary to form the basis of a democratic network.
Lastly, the reputation system is a mechanism that illustrates a node’s investment into the network. This investment is subject to consequences of a node’s virtuous or malicious actions and is eﬀective in assessing backing risk.

4.2.8 Proof of Intelligence

Proof of intelligence is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks by requiring participants, solvers in Aion-1, to perform
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) computation. The intent is to motivate the creation of AI-speciﬁc or specialized hardware that could be used for
machine learning and neural network training in the future.

4.2.8.1

Mechanism

The proof of intelligence works by requiring participants to train a predeﬁned neural network so that it will output similar results to the
proposed ground truth (e.g., the hash of current block given the hashes of previous 𝑁 blocks as input). The parameters of the trained
neural network will serve as a proof that computation took place and is easy to verify by inputting the parameter and conﬁrming the
results.

4.2.8.2

Validation

The validation of a proof is fast compared to the training process and is done in the following steps:
1. Load the neural network as deﬁned by the provided parameter vector.
2. Feed the neural network with the hashes of previous 𝑁 blocks.
3. Run and collect the outputs.
The validation process is being researched and developed.

4.3 Aion virtual machine (AVM)

Pooling

The pooling of proof of intelligence is achieved by separating the parameter space into subspaces. Similar to the pooling concept in
proof of work where each miner works on a range of the nonce space, proof-of-intelligence solvers work independently on a parameter
subspace. They share the proof and block reward.

4.3 Aion virtual machine (AVM)
The AVM architecture is designed to be a blockchain-speciﬁc solution with an emphasis on performance, determinism, and robustness.
The AVM is a customized lightweight JVM implementation tailored towards executing chain logic (application logic) within distributed
networks and hardened against scenarios that arise in such an environment.
The AVM provides the infrastructure for one of the primary functionalities of the connecting network, allowing the abstraction between
the blockchain and application-speciﬁc logic and paving the way to powerful interchain applications. The rationales of this design choice
and other considerations are expanded on in the upcoming sections.

4.3.1 Implementation

At the core of the AVM architecture is a lightweight, machine-friendly, blockchain-speciﬁc bytecode interpreter, after careful consideration
of practical and technical objectives. Implementation requires:
• Performance that is close to native by using a set of machine-friendly instructions.
• Stability of the AVM, achieved by using an isolated VM sandbox environment and carefully measuring the computation and resource usage. New VM features will go through a formalized feature request and speciﬁcation procedure, meaning that new
features are well-documented and tested before moving to the production environment.
• Determinism for the AVM, guaranteed through a full-featured blockchain development kit as a replacement to any conventional
SDK. The proposed blockchain runtime environment would be built from the ground up with determinism as the major goal.
This is introduced in conjunction with the Aion VM, which only supports functionality built on top of the Aion blockchain runtime
environment within the native and bytecode context.
• Compatibility will aim to be backwards, meaning that chain logic will always be valid and executable as the VM infrastructure
evolves.
• Tooling from existing bytecode analysis can also be adapted to AVM bytecode. Leveraging this interoperability allows tooling that
would be suitable for mission-critical code such as chain logic.
The AVM leverages of signiﬁcant existing research and development eﬀorts. Additionally, using machine-friendly bytecode makes chainlogic execution very eﬃcient.
Customized means that the lightweight VM is conﬁgured for purposes of consumption metering (explained in the subsequent section)
and isolation from the host machine (network, ﬁle I/O, unﬁltered system data). The isolated environment would ensure that no meaningful information about the host machine and no unﬁltered (non-oracle) communication takes place within chain logic. This is critical to
ensuring the safety of the host machine and the determinism of chain logic.
Users wishing to implement the program must submit a transaction with the necessary data (deﬁned by some binary interface). Upon
receiving a message, the chain actor calls start() to initiate a boot-up sequence and accepts the data through accept(data). The logic then
processes the data, modiﬁes its state, returns a response to the network, and calls stop() to initiate the shutdown sequence.

4.3.2 Limited Consumption

One of the key issues in a VM running on top of a publicly-accessible environment is the potential for misbehaviour through malicious
logic execution. In the presence of a turing-complete language, an expendable budget must be set so that the executing logic cannot
run indeﬁnitely or behave in a fashion that may damage the host machine or disrupt the consensus mechanism through faulty timing
behaviours. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the budget mechanism as the limited consumption, which is a mechanism where an allotted value is
speciﬁed by usage, space, and bandwidth consumption of the executing logic.

Scripting Language

Eﬀectively, the logic execution would take place in an isolated or sandboxed environment. Within our context, usage refers to the CPU
usage allotted for this particular chain logic. Space refers to the memory allocation initiated by the executing logic. This prevents the
execution of code that uses a large quantity of memory. Bandwidth refers to the input and output consumption of the VM. With these
mechanisms in place, users executing logic would eﬀectively rent the VM.
The protocols specify that using this mechanism requires the user to specify exactly the amount of resources given to the VM. From here,
one of two things may occur (both of which produce a response):
• Successful logic execution and subsequent response
• An exception in logic execution, either through exceeding the proposed resource bounds or through the logic itself
In the event of an exception in logic execution, the AVM will inform the network of the event through an ERROR response.

4.3.3 Chain-oriented concurrency model

Blockchain networks are classically considered very serial in usage; state changes and transactions occur in serial to provide the determinism necessary for consensus. However, this creates a bottleneck in the amount of transactions that can be processed at any time
period. The solution to this lies in the idea of transaction parallelism. In particular, transactions must be implemented such that context
is given to the information about the state that they require. If this deﬁnition is formalized, a transaction scheduler can be implemented
that allows for deterministic parallel transaction execution.
From the perspective of the AVM, support for program-level concurrency, the parallel processing of multiple chain-logic programs, is
required. Towards this goal, the AVM is envisioned to be scalable, automatically clustering multiple VMs and scheduling contracts to be
processed by each in a deterministic manner.

4.4 Scripting Language
The Aion scripting language is used for writing chain logic that runs on Aion-1 and potentially any connecting/participating network. The
Aion language is compiled into AVM bytecode and executed by the AVM.
The Aion language provides the following features:
•
•
•
•

Defensive programming
Blockchain runtime environment
Blockchain context injection
Security

4.4.1 Speciﬁcations

The Aion language complies with a subset of the Java language speciﬁcations and is targeted for blockchain logic. To accomplish this,
existing bytecode will be reviewed and possibly refactored to ﬁt within the given context.
Additionally, the Aion language speciﬁcations include a blockchain runtime/development kit (BRE/BDK). The intent is to provide the developer with highly-optimized development libraries that implement blockchain-speciﬁc functionalities. These include but are not limited
to sending transactions, emitting events, retrieving blockchain related data, and communication between chain-logic applications. This
runtime environment is used to replace conventional development kits found in general compute purpose environments. In general,
users of this language should expect the same syntactic structure, but a completely unique development kit.

4.4.2 Defensive programming

Defensive programming will be supported by the Aion language. According to past research [10], mistakes made by chain-logic developers
result from unexpected input data, runtime exceptions, and unexpected state change after reentrance. The Aion language will provide
mechanisms to decrease the possibility of these common errors. The mechanisms include:
• Aion veriﬁes the input data before passing it to a chain logic and validates the output data after the execution.

ROADMAP

• The scripting language introduces precondition, postcondition, and assertion to help programmers clearly organize their thoughts
into a defensive pattern.
• Try/catch exceptions are fully supported by chain logic, emphasizing the handling of application state post exception rather than
state rollbacks
• Bounds of array access are checked at runtime.
The addition of tooling provides the means of guiding the developer towards these mindsets, perhaps adding warnings and best practices
in areas where unprotected code is found. Other features will also be considered in the future.

4.4.3 Blockchain runtime environment

The blockchain runtime environment facilitates chain-logic execution by providing a deterministic library. This library is carefully tailored
to meet the determinism requirements of chain logic. Time access will be limited, using block time instead of current system time. Object
allocation will be implemented in a deterministic way so that memory address-based functions will continue to work (e.g., the default
hashCode() function). In addition, common utilities and algorithms will be carefully examined and included in the blockchain runtime
environment.

4.4.4 Blockchain context injection

Dependency injection is a technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object. It allows a client, such as chain
logic in blockchain context, the ﬂexibility to be conﬁgurable and hides the details of how the dependencies are provided.
Within the Aion scripting language, blockchain context and runtime information are considered dependencies. Any chain logic that requires this information can declare the requirements through the use of annotations. As Aion develops, more resources will be added
to the injectable objects.

4.4.5 Security

The security of the Aion language is derived from the defensive nature of the language and the AVM where time, space, and resource
usage are strictly gauged and constrained. Additionally, security should be emphasized through the tooling provided for the scripting
language. For example, the logical correctness of Aion chain code can be provided by existing bytecode analysis, veriﬁcation, and model
checking tools. Other examples include Java Pathﬁnder [12], FindBugs [13], and PMD [14].

ROADMAP

The objectives laid out in this white paper are both ambitious and experimental. To approach this issue in a pragmatic manner, Aion-1
will be rolled out in an iterative manner, starting from existing technologies and gradually moving towards the intended objectives.
Aion-1 will be executed in three separate phases, with each phase focusing on diﬀerent aspects of the technology and assembling the
building blocks while progressing towards the ﬁnalization of the network (phase 3). The exact deadlines for each phase and plans are
subject to change as options for each phase are investigated more thoroughly.

5.0.1 Phase 1

The focus of the ﬁrst phase in the Aion release schedule is the interchain communication and bridging infrastructure. With this in mind,
phase 1 functionality will include:
• Modiﬁed, high-performance EVM
• Functioning bridging and interchain communication
• Modiﬁed proof-of-work consensus algorithm

5.0.2 Phase 2

The second phase of the Aion release plan is targeted towards the migration from our modiﬁed EVM architecture towards the proposed
AVM architecture. Development priorities of this phase include:
• Aion Virtual Machine
• The Aion scripting language
• EVM legacy codebase continued support

5.0.3 Phase 3

The third phase ﬁnalizes the envisioned network infrastructure, providing infrastructure for fast, eﬃcient interchain communication and
interchain applications. In addition to the interchain functionalities from Phase 1, and the VM implementation from Phase 2, this phase
will introduce our representative consensus including the representative consensus algorithm.

CONCLUSION

The proposed solutions articulated in this paper are the result of several years of implementation and experimentation in the blockchain
industry. The team behind Aion has been particularly close to several large-scale enterprise projects, where the challenges outlined
previously are signiﬁcantly pronounced. The Aion network is designed to overcome these challenges, and to propose a solution that
will enable blockchain applications to achieve their full intended potential. In our research and development of Aion to date, we were
fortunate to come across incredible ﬁndings and experiments from leading thinkers and researchers working on complementary concepts.
We’ve done our best to capture this and give credit in the references below.
As we continue on our journey to make Aion a reality, and to connect an ever-growing fragmented ecosystem of blockchains, we look
forward to engaging with you, and getting you involved.
