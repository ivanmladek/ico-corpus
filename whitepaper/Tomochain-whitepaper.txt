1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION
“...Blockchains are a new invention that allows meritorious participants in an open network
to govern without a ruler and without money. They are merit-based, tamper-proof, open,
voting systems. The meritorious are those who work to advance the network. As society
gives you money for giving society what it wants, blockchains give you coins for giving the
network what it wants…”
Naval Ravikant - CEO of AngelList - on 6/21/2017.

T

he blockchain industry and the infrastructure of the Internet of Value are being

built rapidly around the globe, and to many the atmosphere is eerily similar to the
building of the Internet in the late ‘90s, with pioneers and dreamers coming together
to build a new future. TomoChain and TomoCoin can be a leading part of this
phenomenon through seamlessly merging an ecosystem of social and consumer
applications integrated with cryptographic tokens used by millions of mainstream
users with a unique blockchain infrastructure architecture, allowing for fast,
frictionless payment and a secure, decentralized, and trusted store of value.

The Internet of Value is understood as a phase when values and digital assets exist as
a packet of information on Internet via blockchain technology. These packets of
information are transparent, secure, programmable, and globally accessible to anyone
with Internet. Our mission is to be a leading force in building this era, designing its
infrastructures and working toward a reality that will make knowledge,

decentralization, ﬁnancial independence, and opportunities accessible to everyone,
everywhere. Our goal is to make TomoChain infrastructure powering a host of
multiple successful decentralized applications and supporting thousands of
cryptographic tokens from established small and big companies and to make
TomoCoin one of the most valuable and important digital assets for millions of people.

TomoChain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem with the Ethereum
blockchain in particular and with all current blockchain network in general.
TomoChain plans to support horizontal scaling via adding more second layer
blockchains with good performance integrated with Ethereum network for backup
and atomic cross-chain transfer. TomoChain is envisioned to be a network of chains
that supports instant conﬁrmation, near zero transaction fee, and smart contracts
which will be an ideal solution for decentralized apps, token issuances and token
integrations for small and big businesses alike. TomoCoin will be the protocol token
that govern and regulate this infrastructure. TomoChain will be a critical part of the
alternative ﬁnancial system based on Internet and blockchain technology which is
more secure, transparent, efﬁcient, inclusive and equitable than the traditional
regime.

The ReplyBlock will be the ﬁrst consumer application utilizing TomoChain blockchain
infrastructure. ReplyBlock aims to build a new decentralized social network with a
built-in cryptocurrency. In this social network, each contributor role is highlighted and
rewarded; user privacy is respected and micropayments are easy,

cheap and fast. ReplyBlock approaches this goal by focusing on building a Q&A social
site in which a network of contributors are answering questions and creating valuable
content. All Q&A contents are publicly available to create a public library of
instructional videos and answers. It is planned that ReplyBlock will have a native token
running on Tomochain infrastructure.

2. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
A | TomoChain Development

We are working on the TomoChain, a blockchain infrastructure framework, which is
an open-source, high performance, nearly zero (economically) fee and instant
conﬁrmation blockchain that can process billions of ﬁnancial transactions per day. In
the current plan, TomoChain is designed to be a public permissioned chain pegged to
the Ethereum network. TomoChain is a technically innovative and signiﬁcant
component that makes TomoCoin and other cryptographic tokens issued on it secure,
transparent and trustworthy enough to be a store of value as a digital asset. The
current feature plan of TomoChain includes:

-

Proof of Authority consensus based on Ethereum codebase

-

Masternode and servicenode system

-

2 second conﬁrmation and nearly zero transaction fee for transactions

-

Support all Ethereum smart contracts

-

API supports for token issuances and integrations

-

Zero-fee atomic cross-chain transactions (between Ethereum and TomoChain

back and forth)
-

Sending transaction within TomoChain with nearly zero fee and fast

B | Tomo Wallet

In our opinion, a secure and user-friendly coin wallet that gives ﬁnancial control back
to the end-users is one of the most important parts of the infrastructure of the
“Internet of Value”. It will bridge the gap between a cryptocurrency enthusiast and a
mainstream user – and possibly increase the adoption rate of cryptocurrency by
10-fold if done right. Tomo wallet shares the same backend infrastructure of Tomo
application such as TomoChain, third party APIs, decentralized identity system, coin
exchange smart contract and APIs etc. The planned feature set of Tomo wallet will be
as follows:

C | Tomo decentralized knowledge sharing application

This ReplyBlock will be the ﬁrst social consumer application utilizing TomoChain
infrastructure. The beta version is now available at ReplyBlock.com with thousands
of weekly active users and is available for download on the Apple App Store and
Google Play Store. The app is characterized by decentralized governance by multiple
stakeholders in the Tomo application. The app was able to solve the problem of building a contributor’s network by designing an incentive system that empowers and
entices users to contribute and work together to build a new knowledge sharing
network. The rationale is written in more detail by Long Vuong in “The missing roles
in social network”.

3. TECHNICAL DISCUSSION

This section discusses some current technical issues behind TomoChain, TomoWallet,
Applications running on Tomochain and how they connect with the Ethereum
blockchain.

Ethereum platform limitations and the off-chain solution
Currently, the average conﬁrmation time on the Ethereum blockchain is 17 seconds.
The number of transactions in the Ethereum blockchain is increasing day by day, from
38,730 to 102,103 in the ﬁrst quarter of 2017 – a rise of 163% – and it will continue its
steady increase, with new applications and users joining the Ethereum ecosystem by
the minute. The Ethereum blockchain can process around 8.5 transactions per second,
equivalent to 740,000 transactions per day. There are some signiﬁcant changes to the
Ethereum protocol planned in its roadmap, such as a transition from proof-of-work
distributed consensus to proof-of-stake consensus, which will potentially raise the
bandwidth further.

With a conservative estimate of 50 million active users after the ﬁrst three years of
operation, the Tomo application’s goal is to become a ﬁrst-class, mainstream
application using cryptocurrency. This requires, ﬁrstly, instantaneous ﬁnancial
transactions within the app; secondly, minimal or no-cost ﬁnancial transactions within
the app. With that goal in mind, Ethereum mainnet would not be the ideal choice for

directly hosting all of ReplyBlock ﬁnancial transactions given that a single app such as
the Crypto Kitty app can quickly slow down the whole network after achieving
popularity. We are designing our TomoChain solution to better satisfy the given
objectives but also maintain the cryptocurrency characteristics of TomoCoin.

TomoChain is a blockchain infrastructure solution to the scalability problems with
building ReplyBlock or other mainstream applications on Ethereum or other
blockchain technologies in general. TomoChain is a public permissioned blockchain
with integrated
the

smart contract

functionalities

(currently based

on

Ethereum code-base) which allows for nearly zero fee & instant transaction

speed with public auditability of ﬁnancial transaction records. TomoChain opts to use
Proof of Authority and build nodes in multiple locations to make sure the database in
a highly secure, immutable state. APIs for third parties will also be standardized and
published in the next phase of development.

Architecture overview
Below is the integrated architecture of ReplyBlock and TomoWallet utilizing
TomoChain infrastructure and connect with Ethereum blockchain.

WHITEPAPER

ReplyBlock

ReplyBlock
ReplyBlock is a social network with a native cryptocurrency. ReplyBlock uses
Microservice architecture to be ﬂexible and extendable. At the storage layer,
ReplyBlock uses several type of databases to satisfy requirements from speciﬁc
functionalities.

Microservice
There are three main sub-trees in ReplyBlock: i) User Services: This tree serves
functionalities related to users and this tree will work for both ReplyBlock and

WHITEPAPER

TOMOCHAIN

16

TomoWallet; ii) Social Services: This tree serves social functionalities such as
Comment, Like, Feed, Notiﬁcation; iii) Question Services: This tree serves
functionalities such as Question, Answer, Post and Post Ranking. Depending on future
upgrades of the application, there will be additional new sub-trees.

Databases, Cache, and Message Queue
ReplyBlock uses noSQL database which operates Master-Slave model to maintain
high-performance. Sharding techniques are used in both database and application
layer to ensure a read and write at high speed level. ReplyBlock uses Cache in multiple layers of the system such as Client-side (Mobile Application, Web Browser), Webserver, Server-side, Database. Besides reading and writing databases, ReplyBlock
deals with natural language processing, ranking algorithm and use Message Queues
such as Kafka, RabbitMQ to deal with non-concurrent processing.

Search and Recommendation
Search is a very important part of ReplyBlock. We pre-process the data and serve data
to search databases such as Elasticsearch and Apache Solr. Recommendation services
connect users and experts to questions and answers they are interested in.
ReplyBlock uses natural language processing techniques and Graph databases such as
Neo4J to deliver suggested content and related topics.

WHITEPAPER

TOMOCHAIN

17

Artificial Intelligence
We will be using AI for a number of functions within the ReplyBlock such as: i)
optimization of personal feed based on public proﬁles and activities; ii) optimization of
suggestions of people to follow and content; iii) spam and fraud detection and iv)
image and video recognition. We commit to only using publicly available information
in the ReplyBlock to improve the user experience, while maintaining the privacy of any
personal and private communications within the network. We take advantage of
available and powerful tools for AI such as Tensor Flow, Scikit-learn, Inception V3 etc.

Blockchain and Smart Contract
ReplyBlock Reward Engine will emit coins to users based on the contribution of users
to the network. Financial transaction will be hashed and stored in blockchain to ensure
the security and transparency of the data and to maintain a high level of trust.
ReplyBlock works with two chains: the ﬁrst one is the Ethereum blockchain which will
be used to issue ERC-20 token and allow users to sell and buy tokens via third party
exchanges. The second is a side chain (TomoChain) that will host all ﬁnancial
transaction within ReplyBlock. Both the sidechain and the Reward engine will interact
via our Smart Contracts.

WHITEPAPER

TOMOCHAIN

18

Reward Engine and Contributor Score
ReplyBlock will reserve a part of the token supply for the Reward Engine’s emission
over the year. The process mimics Bitcoin block rewards in that at a ﬁxed interval, the
Reward Engine will emit a predetermined amount of token to ReplyBlock users
based on their relative contributions to the application, hence the process is called
Proof of Contribution. A published algorithm will calculate the relative contributions
based on the quality of contents in the given period based on factors such as number
of Likes, number of Comments weighted by the Contributor Score (C-score) of users
performing such actions. New users in ReplyBlock will have an equal starting C-score
and their C-score will increase and accumulate over time based on the relative amount
of contributions he/ she gives to the network.

Example: The ReplyBlock has three users A,B,C and the corresponding C-scores are
X,Y,Z. At the current interval, A contributes 1 answer, B contributes 1 answer and C
contributes 1 answer to the network. Assuming C’s answer is liked by A and B; B’s
answer is liked by A; A’s answer is liked by C. The relative calculated contributions of
A,B and C in the current interval are Z, X and X+Y respectively and the payout in coin
to A,B and C will be given accordingly. C-scores of A,B,C will also increase by the same
amount after the current interval.

We will publish a separate paper on Reward Engine and C-score implementation for
public viewing and commenting before deploying the solution to the mainnet at a later
date. AI will later be used to aid in the process to make the Proof of Contribution fair

WHITEPAPER

and cheat-resistant. The updated C-score for contributors in each interval will be
input to the payout smart contract to automate the coin reward payout. The process is
illustrated via a diagram below.

Step 1: ReplyBlock Backend calls Reward Engine function in Reward Engine Smart
Contract in TomoChain.
Step 2: Based on the calculated results, RewardEngine Smart Contract sends the
payouts to users.
Step 3: ReplyBlock Backend catch Reward Event and send notiﬁcations to users and
resulting payout will appear in TomoWallet.

Step 4: ReplyBlock Backend call transfer function RewardEngine Smart Contract in
Ethereum.
Step 5: ReplyBlock token will be transferred to TomoWallet address and users can
cash this out.

Users and Authentication
TomoWallet and ReplyBlock will share an identity database so that users can use the
same account to login to applications. There will be published APIs for third parties to
use the same service. TomoChain development will create a secure and decentralized
identity service for Tomo network.

Public/ Private key and Passphrase
The TomoWallet allows users to control and use multiple addresses. The addresses
could be from different blockchains such as TomoChain, Bitcoin, Ethereum. Private
key will be encrypted with a passphrase and saved in both client and server. The
process of encrypting and de-encrypting will stay only at the client side. Therefore, no
one has an access to the private key without the passphrase. If users change devices,
users will need to use the passphrase to synchronize the data and access to their

WHITEPAPER

TOMOCHAIN

21

accounts. The security of digital assets from users is very important to us. We are using
BIP32 and BIP39 to generate random passphrase and ask users to save the passphrase
securely.

TomoWallet Backend
TomoWallet has a separate backend following microservice architecture. This
backend collects data from blockchain for analysis and serves features such as
Notiﬁcation, Message, Feed etc. Financial transactions will not go through this
backend but will go through TomoChain to maintain security and transparency at the
highest level.

SDK and APIs
The TomoWallet allows third parties to use its infrastructure and user’s graph. Third
parties can use the open source SDK provided by Tomo or to use the standard APIs
using Restful and Swagger documents. TomoWallet also provides WebHooks at
multiple levels to the third parties.

WHITEPAPER

Instant Messaging and QR code
Messaging is an important communication function in TomoWallet. We use client
encryption and peer to peer communication protocol allowing messages to pass
between users not through TomoWallet’s servers. QR codes is the chosen interface
for TomoWallet transactions and micropayments.

Cash in and Cash out
Users can use ReplyBlock Token for many services within ReplyBlock and
TomoWallet. Users can use ReplyBlock Token in Ethereum and transfer it to
ReplyBlock. The process is done via smart contract as described below:

Users can use ReplyBlock token in
Ethereum and Tomochain

Step 4: TomoWallet Backend call Cash-out function in Cash-Out Smart Contract in
Ethereum
Step 5: Cash-Out Smart Contract transfers ReplyBlock token to user’s wallet in Ethereum
Step 6: ReplyBlock token appears in user’s Ethereum wallet

TomoChain
TomoWallet and ReplyBlock utilize Tomochain infrastructure and aim to reach the
highest level of performance for Internet consumer applications which requires very
low transaction fee and very fast transaction speeds. At the same time, transparency,
security and value of TomoCoin and other tokens on Tomochain are of paramount
importance to us. TomoChain allows for nearly zero fee transaction and and very high
transaction speed, at the same time supports public auditability of all ﬁnancial
transaction records. TomoChain will also interact with Ethereum public blockchain via
smart contracts allowing for token interoperability between Tomochain and
Ethereum public blockchain. It is planned that TomoChain will also use TomoCoin as a
protocol token to govern and regulate the infrastructure which will create demand for

TomoCoin from other third party utilizing TomoChain. A technical paper on

WHITEPAPER

TOMOCHAIN

25

TomoChain, the governance system and its the economics will be published when the
chain design is completed. The ofﬁcial launch of TomoChain is planned for the third
quarter of 2018.

Proof of Authority
In Proof of Authority (PoA), all node validators are chosen based on collaboration
between parties. PoA consensus is suitable for an organization who want to build a
transparent blockchain supporting external auditability but control who can join the
node network (permissioned public blockchain). TomoChain opts to use PoA and build
nodes in multiple locations to make sure the database in a highly secure, immutable
state. In the future, other organizations wants to utilize this architecture can join to be
a partner and and operator of TomoChain.

Kovan is an open-source based on Ethereum codebase and developed by Parity. Kovan
is using PoA, however Parity only allows selective partners to join the network.
Consequently, Ethereum foundation created Rinkerby Testnet, also using PoA and
allowing a wider range of partners to join. Tomo plans to use Ethereum-based, POA
consensus to build a customized TomoChain. This is a good choice given the level of
maturity in documents, code bases, smart contracts within the Ethereum ecosystem.

4. MARKET ANALYSIS

I

n the paper “A vision of the Internet of Value”, Long Vuong points out there are seven

dimensions of a new money technology: transparency / anonymity; efﬁciency; security
/ counterfeiting risk; accessibility; decentralization / trust independence;
programmability; and acceptability. TomoCoin can become the cryptocurrency of
choice for a certain class of end-user if TomoCoin can be the best in its class in a certain
dimension, or if TomoCoin can accrue a unique combination of characteristics that
appeals to a subset of end-users. Being the native cryptocurrency to Tomochain,
TomoCoin will be the reserve cryptocurrency with all the third-party apps running on
Tomochain. Being the protocol token for the TomoChain infrastructure, TomoCoin will
be needed by all the parties utilising TomoChain to build applications or issue and
integrate cryptographic tokens into their applications. Research and development is
at work on the security and UX of the Tomo wallet; and the efﬁciency,
programmability, and security of TomoChain will further improve the value of
TomoCoin in the future. Tomochain is a public blockchain protocol comparable to
other public blockchain such as: ICON, POA network, EOS etc…

5. TOMOCOIN CRYPTOCURRENCY

“...Tokens are a breakthrough in open network design that enable: 1) the creation of open,
decentralized networks that combine the best architectural properties of open and
proprietary networks, and 2) new ways to incentivize open network participants, including
users, developers, investors, and service providers. By enabling the development of new
open networks, tokens could help reverse the centralization of the internet, thereby keeping
it accessible, vibrant and fair, and resulting in greater innovation...”
Chris Dixon - investor and researcher at A16Z venture - 6/1/2017.

A | General characteristic

TomoCoin is a cryptocurrency of ﬁxed supply, consequently it is long-term and
non-inﬂationary. Like other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, units of
TomoCoin are fractionally divisible, fungible and transferable to other TomoCoin
holder. TomoCoin will be implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain as an
ERC20 token. The ERC20 token interface allows for the deployment of a standard
token that is compatible with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem,
such as development tools, multi-signature wallets, ICO contract scripts and
exchanges. The Ethereum blockchain is currently the industry standard for issuing
custom digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts because of its
Turing-complete language allowing for the writing and deployment of complex

WHITEPAPER

TOMOCHAIN

27

WHITEPAPER

TOMOCHAIN

28

trustless smart contracts such as the issuance contracts of Golem or TenX digital
tokens etc. These features and active ecosystem make Ethereum the chosen
settlement layer for TomoCoin.

B | Coin economics and emission rate

TomoCoin’s price will be determined by the force of market supply and demand. On
the fundamental level, demand for TomoCoin will be closely related with the
popularity and usage of TomoChain infrastructure and D-apps ecosystem on top of it.
Later on, this demand will also increase with the capability of using TomoCoin for
transactions in physical locations. On the supply side, TomoCoin has a ﬁxed supply
pre-determined on the issuance day, but only a percentage of the total coin will be
released initially to the crowdsale participants. The company and advisor’s allocation
will only be released gradually based on a vesting schedule over several years. The rest
of the coins will be released over a 8 years period to the network contributors via the
Reward Engine to masternode/ Ecosystem Building program and other developer’s
partnership program.

The planned allocation of coin is as follows: 50% of coins going to the crowdsale
participants; 15% of coins going to the company and advisors, 35% of coins going to
the Reward Engine to masternode/ Ecosystem Building program and the emission will
last 8

WHITEPAPER

TOMOCHAIN

29

years at around 4,5% per year. After 8 years, the initial coin reserve will run out but the
Reward Engine/ Ecosystem Building program could continue from the network’s
revenues such as fees from other services and applications. The collective of coin
holders could give guidance on the options for the network to move forward at this
point. The following chart illustrates the TomoCoin yearly inﬂation rate toward a ﬁxed
supply after 10 years.

T

omoCoin supply is ﬁxed at 100 million tokens. The allocation is as follows: 50

million is going to the token sale event; 35 million is going to Reward Engine/
Ecosystem Building program and will be distributed to users and developers based on
relative contributions to the network over an 8 year period; 15 million is going to the
software company which allocates the coin to team members and advisors over a
vesting schedule in a 4 years-period. TomoCoin is important in several dimensions to
the Tomochain infrastructure, ﬁrstly, TomoCoin will be used as a source of funding to
complete the development of TomoChain, ReplyBlock and TomoWallet; secondly,
TomoCoin being used in the Reward Engine to masternode/ Ecosystem Building
program as an incentive mechanism to build Tomo ecosystem and community; thirdly,
TomoCoin being used as a long term decentralized governance instrument of Tomo
infrastructure , that means we will build tools to gather opinions from coin holders to
decide the future direction including TomoChain infrastructure, TomoWallet and
other critical services and applications; fourthly, TomoCoin can be used as the native
payment method within other third-party services and applications.

We have a long-term commitment to complete the product, engineering and
marketing roadmap for the Tomo ecosystem including Tomo TomoChain, D-apps
running on top of Tomochain and TomoWallet. Consequently, ﬁguring out the
resources needed to get the works done effectively, we estimate to spend at least one

and half million $ per year over 4 year period before the network can start to have
other stream of revenues. To be on the safe side, the company ideally needs eight
million $ to plan for 4 years ahead. The maximum hard cap is 8.5 million $. The token
sale structure is following:

-

A maximum of 7.5 million USD worth of token will be sold to qualiﬁed private -

presale contributors
-

A minimum of 1 million USD worth of token will be sold to public contributors in

a later date
The actual conversion price to TomoCoin from other cryptocurrency contributions
will be calculated based on the market prices of other cryptocurrency at the end of the
whitelisting period. The coins not sold out after the public sale will be kept by the
company and locked for a one-year period. The coins reserved for the team members
will go through a 4-year vesting schedule.
