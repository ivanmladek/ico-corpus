Caution Concerning Forward
Looking Statements
Our public communications, including this White Paper, may contain
“forward-looking statements” – that is, statements related to future, not past, events.
In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future
business and financial performance, and often contain words such as “expect,”
“anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” “estimate,”
or “forecast.”
These forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning
the timing and success of strategies, plans or intentions. We have based these
forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about
future events. While we consider these expectations and assumptions to be
reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic,
competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of
which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control and could
cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Readers should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. We
undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to conform to
actual results or changes in our expectations, unless required by applicable law.

Abstract
BoatPilot is the first, free integrated marine navigation service with augmented
reality capabilities for private and commercial yachting markets.
PRECISE NAVIGATION INFORMATION
BoatPilot allows yachtsmen to easily track marine routes and access the most
relevant information on coastal objects; including charts, navigation signs, reference
data, maritime laws and regulations in a specific region. The cloud-based
infrastructure allows BoatPilot users to add and update the existing database and
generate relevant content, which is checked and supported by other members in the
yachting community. This structure leads to creating the most complete and precise
navigation information database in the world. In addition to general information
about coastal objects and services, BoatPilot also includes professional comments,
photos, and sketches.
AUGMENTED REALITY FUNCTION
BoatPilot supports an augmented reality (AR) function, which allows the skipper to
use AR glasses to see all necessary data incorporated into actual surroundings, and
avoid distractions by the traditional dash. This feature is especially useful during poor
visibility conditions, or at night.
FREE TO USERS
BoatPilot is completely free to all end users. Unlike most existing marine navigation
systems on the market, our product is uniquely developed for private yachtsmen and
small yachting businesses. It is not an updated, or reworked, version of military or
large commercial navigation systems.

ADVERTISING
BoatPilot is more than just a marine navigation tool, although navigation is definitely
its main feature. BoatPilot is a marketplace that provides businesses of any size –
from large brands to small seaside restaurants – effective and convenient access to
the international yachting market, which is estimated to reach $74.7 billion
by 20221. Best of all, BoatPilot advertising works even when the user has no internet
access.
BoatPilot is essentially Google Maps and TripAdvisor in one
program, with no other product like it in the world.
BoatPilot is not an abstract concept. It is an existing and functioning product. By
late 2017, the service was released on Android.

BoatPilot in the marine
navigation market
SHORTCOMINGS OF CURRENT MARINE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS
Private yachting has grown steadily over the last 20-25 years. Yet there has been no
concerted effort to develop a navigation product aimed specifically at private
yachtsmen.
There are a handful of marine navigation systems that are popular among users —
Navionics and MaxSea for example — but they lack a mobile device component.
The original systems, created largely for use by military and commercial fleets, were
quickly modified to fit the needs of the civilian yachting industry. Such “adapted”
versions contain unnecessary information, lack a user-friendly interface, and often
do not relay practical information on nearby marinas, fueling stations, services, and
restaurants.
The systems available today have two fundamental shortcomings.
First, current marine navigation systems do not fully address the unique needs of
the largest fleet in the world — private yachtsmen, and small yachting charter
companies.

6

BoatPilot ™ / White Paper

Second, and closely related to the first, the current systems do not feature regular
updates of seaports and other known large objects. As a result, outdated
information is slow to reach users. Below is an outline of typical marine chart
updates:
1. National hydrographic agency

2. Chart aggregator (only 3-4 in the world)

3. Software developer

4. Navigation system manufacturer

5. Annual or semi-annual updates on a physical data
carrier (for built-in systems), or rare and sporadic
updates for mobile devices
This process results in untimely delivery, or complete loss, of crucial information. It
sometimes takes years for objects to be added, changed or moved. For example, in
the Mediterranean region alone there are dozens of known marinas and lighthouses
that are not included in any of the navigation systems currently available.

7

BoatPilot ™ / White Paper

The biggest issue is there are countless built-in onboard systems that are not
compatible with each other. Many require users to install branded navigation
software that are simply a modification of a similar program. Manufacturers also
introduce small changes to their products, making them incompatible with
competitor systems. This divides the yachting community into various system users,
and inhibits communication and exchange of important navigation information. As a
result, skippers find themselves tied to a specific onboard navigation brand, despite
the fact that most of the available software actually operates on the universal
navigation standard for all marine electronics communication – NMEA.
Summarizing the above-mentioned, skippers and yachtsmen encounter issues
due to a lack of currently available systems designed specifically for the needs
of the largest fleet in the world – the private and charter yachting sectors.
Existing navigation solutions migrated from professional platforms of the
military and commercial fleets, and do not support many functions important
for the private and charter users, nor do they offer options to deliver relevant
updates quickly. Additionally, each user is tied to a specific navigation brand
and limited by that brand’s functionality, with no efficient way to exchange
information with other users. In turn, hardware manufacturers do not have an
opportunity to choose between different software options because the market
is controlled by two or three companies, with no universal solutions currently
available. To this day, the most precise sources of information are considered
to be paper maps catalogues, which are manually updated every season. We
believe this situation is biased, and intend to change it in the near future.

BoatPilot ™ / White Paper

BOATPILOT SOLUTION
BoatPilot was developed specifically for the private yachting sector. Unlike other
marine navigation solutions, which receive chart information from an existing
database, BoatPilot allows users to send updated information to the server.
Each BoatPilot user can update existing charts and create new ones. The more users
participate and sail, the more exact BoatPilot’s database becomes. In fact, BoatPilot
testing revealed that our program provides more precise information than other
marine navigation systems that have been on the market for years. For example,
BoatPilot’s program includes recently updated information on more than 100
geo-locations in the Mediterranean, that are not included with competitor systems.
Detailed information about the technical aspects of BoatPilot can be found here.

How does BoatPilot work?
BoatPilot consists of three components — hardware and software:
1. BoatPilot navigation
2. Pocket Skipper service app
3. BoatGod hardware module developed to collect data from onboard systems
BoatPilot combines navigation functions, while Pocket Skipper supports all
additional services, such as brokerage (listing vessels for sale or rent, based on
specific parameters), marina rental, sailing companion search and tour proposals,
and other capabilities discussed in greater detail later in this report.
While BoatPilot and Pocket Skipper are the software components, BoatGod is the
hardware side of the project. This module connects directly to the onboard system of
any vessel, collects marine data, and transfers it via Wi-Fi. BoatGod enables precise
collection of data, which is then used to update marine navigation charts.
BoatPilot is based on unique software components described in detail below. Each
component will function as part of our system, and can be used as a ready-made
solution by other marine navigation manufacturers and marine chart aggregators.

Release and distribution
of NAVY tokens
In July of 2017 the fully functional of BoatPilot was released on Google Play to assess
demand for this product among yachtsmen and skippers. Our goal was to gain
insight and determine BoatPilot’s potential to occupy a large portion of the marine
navigation marketplace.
Over 50,000 users have downloaded Android version of BoatPilot since its release,
with no substantial marketing efforts.
BoatPilot maintains a stable user base that includes thousands of yachtsmen around
the Mediterranean. During the record-breaking 2017 season, BoatPilot navigated
over 4,700 yachts. Considering that an average yacht costs approximately
$250,000, we can assume that we’ve been trusted with over $1.2 billion in
property by our current users.
Our research insights, and Android application test results, clearly establish market
demand for BoatPilot. In addition to constructive comments, our team secured
BoatPilot's first contracts with charter and service agencies.
To raise funds for BoatPilot’s future development, we are launching a Token
Generation Event (TGE), to offer NAVY tokens to the general public. The financial
model, which you can review here, assumes two possible courses of development
and functionalities of BoatPilot. Both are based on the amount of funds raised through
the TGE:
Soft Cap – $3,920,000
Hard Cap – $9,850,000

The TGE will be launched in two stages — closed pre-sale and open main sale.
During the pre-sale stage, BoatPilot will engage with private investors (friends &
family), funds and large market players. The minimum amount of NAVY tokens
purchased during the pre-sale stage is $25,000 (equivalent in ETH, BTC, BCH,
LTC). There are provisions for bonuses reaching up to 50% or 100% of tokens
purchased, and will be discussed on an individual basis.
The second stage of the TGE will be open to the public (with restrictions in certain
jurisdictions2) – anyone from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, to yachting professionals is
welcome to participate.
The pre-sale will begin on January 9, 2018 and last until March 31, 2018.
The main sale will begin on April 1, 2018 and last until April 30, 2018. You can
read all the details about the pre-sale and the main sale in our Token Sale Policy.

During NAVY token emission, we will use fairly standard distribution conditions
which are currently engaged in many TGEs.

If the Soft Cap is not reached during the TGE, all investments made will be returned.
The TGE will end automatically when the Hard Cap is reached. It is likely that the
funds raised during the entire TGE will be in the range between the Soft and Hard
Caps, in which case our team will do everything possible to develop the
functionalities outlined under the Hard Cap goal. As soon as the final amount of
funds raised is available, a detailed action plan will be issued via a press release.
BoatPilot aims to ensure complete transparency and accuracy in its approach to
all investments made during the TGE, and at later development stages.

Using NAVY tokens and
Token Economics
USING TOKENS
Marine charts need to be updated most frequently and are the basis of our project.
BoatPilot updates all current charts utilizing the geo-data that is sent by those users
who have the BoatGod module installed on their vessels.
All of the updated geo-data is stored in a special intermediary storage called the
Geo-Pool. We will use NAVY tokens to reward all people who send us their
geo-data – the more data users send us, the more tokens they will receive. To
understand clearly, you can think about it as NAVY token mining – you sail around
the world collecting geo-data, and get rewarded with NAVY. This is a win-win
situation – the project constantly receives updated navigation data,
yachtsmen-miners get our tokens, while all other users get access to most up to date
navigation information. The size of the NAVY rewards will be determined
dynamically and published on our sites: www.boatpilot.me and www.boatpilot.io.
Our team has allocated a special NAVY fund to start the geo-data mining program
(Project Ecosystem – 1.5% of the entire emission). This will be enough to start with, but
we anticipate that the reserve will be spent quite fast. After the fund is depleted, we
will start the second stage of the program – buying out NAVY tokens from
exchanges3.
The project architecture is set up in such a way that we will not be able to use the
geo-data received from users until we send them the tokens they deserve. Since data
is the key and most valuable part of the project, we are highly interested in being
able to use the geo-data collected by our users. This is why we will continue to buy
out the tokens – only this way can we reward BoatPilot community for its data.
3

We plan to list NAVY tokens on multiple exchanges. No promises can be made as to when exactly or if it will happen. As soon as we
have an agreement with an exchange, we will post the news on our website and issue a press-release.

Using NAVi tokens within the project

When users register, they include their Ethereum wallet address where the mined
tokens will be send 1-2 days after the user clicks “Redeem NAVY”.

18

BoatPilot ™ / White Paper

TOKEN ECONOMICS
The more actively the tokens are used within the project, the greater is the potential for
NAVY rate growth. BoatPilot has a very simple growth model:
We commit to invest 10% to 15% of all BoatPilot marketing profits to buy out NAVY
tokens from cryptocurrency exchanges. A part of the bought out tokens (25%) will be
burned, while the other part will be used within the project ecosystem and to reward
NAVI miners for their geo-data.
This means that a) we will buy out tokens from exchanges in proportion to the
company’s growth; b) we will sign more contracts with charter companies that install
BoatGod on their vessels, and cover more regions in order to get more mined
geo-data, in return raising the number of NAVY bought out from exchanges. This will
ensure the constant demand for our token and raise its price.
Additionally, we will burn between a quarter and a third of bought out tokens in order
to lower the circulating volume of NAVY tokens, raising the demand and NAVY market
price.

19

BoatPilot ™ / White Paper

WAYS TO RECEIVE THE TOKENS
You can get NAVY tokens by doing one of the following:
•Purchase NAVY during the Token Generation Event. During the early stages of the
TGE you can receive the most bonus tokens (50% to 100%). The main sale will
be held April 1 to April 30, 2018 and will offer a bonus of up to 20%.
•Geo-mine NAVY. In order to do this you will need to install BoatGod on your
vessel or rent a vessel with installed BoatGod modile and share your geo-data.
The more geo-data we receive, the more NAVY tokens you will get.
•Purchase NAVY on cryptocurrency exchanges that agree to list NAVY (as soon as
we have an agreement with an exchange, we will post the news on our website
and issue a press-release). As the project moves forwards, you will be able to see
a regularly updated list of exchanges at www.boatpilot.io and
www.boatpilot.me.

International yachting market
EUROPE

BoatPilot was first released in Europe. According to MarketsandMarkets4, the
current European yachting charter business is valued at $13 billion, and is estimated
to increase to $13.6 billion by 2020. BoatPilot received rights to book over 13,000
yachts from more than 1,000 operators in Europe since May 2016, making our
project one of the leading players in this segment.

Currently, the European yachting market exceeds $20 billion, with the share of
commercial marine cartography in Europe being approximately $154 million in
2015. It is projected that by 2020 the marine cartography segment will reach $166
million. On the other hand, the total volume of the European yachting advertising
market is estimated at $100 million as of the year 2014. Don't forget that BoatPilot is
also a powerful advertising platform with a very targeted and affluent audience.
By 2019 we plan to:
•Secure 2.5% of the electronic cartography marine market due to chart licensing
•Secure 1.5% of the advertising market due to geo-targeted advertisement sales
INTERNATIONAL MARKET

26

BoatPilot ™ / White Paper

Valued at $200 billion with an active target audience of 1.4 million yachtsmen, the
Americas and Asia Pacific are two largest yachting regions outside Europe.
While the entire international electronic cartography market grows at a rate of
1.46% annually, the fastest growing sub-regions are Asia (CAGR 3.36%) and Latin
America (CAGR 3.30%). Between 2013 and 2016 the international electronic
cartography market has enjoyed a steady growth rate, and according to
MarketsandMarkets™ will amount to $717 million by the year 2020 (1.84% CAGR
for 2014-2020 years).
The main growth drivers of the international commercial marine electronic
cartography market are:
•increased demand for transport vessels

REGIONAL COMPOSITION OF THE ELECTRONIC MARINE
CARTOGRAPHY MARKET

According to MarketsandMarkets™ forecasts, by the year 2020 Asia Pacific will
take up the largest share (43%) of the cartography marine market and will grow at
the highest rate of 2.91% between 2014 and 2020. In monetary terms, this is an
increase from $265 million in 2016 to $308 million in 2020. Such steady growth
can be explained by the overall high rate of economic development in the region.

28

BoatPilot ™ / White Paper

The North American market will show a more modest growth rate of 0.76%, and will
amount to $167 million by the year 2020. Tthe main growth driver in this region will
be the increase in the use of the Panama Canal and overall marine traffic.
The European market will grow from $150 million in 2014 to $166 million in 2020
(CAGR 1.64%). Europe has the most favorable conditions for the development of
navigation and cartography technologies, due to the fact that almost 90% of its

MAJOR PLAYERS AND COMPETITORS

Being that 63% of the marine cartography market is controlled by only eight
companies, it can be easily considered an oligopoly. The three key players are
Jeppesen (18%), Transas Marine (12%), and Navionics (8%).

into a long-term partnership with the aircraft manufacturer Eclipse Aerospace and
The Flynas of Saudi Arabia airline. Additionally, it is a member of an alliance that
includes the non-profit organization The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
