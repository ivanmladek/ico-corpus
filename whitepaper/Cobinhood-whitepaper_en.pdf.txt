1. Abstract
COBINHOOD is a cryptocurrency service platform for the blockchain era. The ﬁrst
service launched by COBINHOOD is the world’s ﬁrst zero fee high-frequency
cryptocurrency trading exchange that solves existing problems of cryptocurrency
exchanges. It provides spot trading and margin trading with ZERO trading fees to
maximize traders’ proﬁt and market liquidity.
COBINHOOD also provides ICO underwriting services to solve the problem of ICO
token liquidity issues.

COBINHOOD will launch its ICO (Initial Coin Oﬀering) on September 13th, 2017.

2. Background
With the advance of blockchain technology, more and more people are migrating from
ﬁat-based ﬁnancial system towards blockchain-based ﬁnancial system. Since January
2017, the cryptocurrency market cap has increased from 7B USD to 110B USD in July[1].
Moreover, cryptocurrency trading volume exceeded stock trading volume by August
2017. However, existing cryptocurrency exchanges are not able to handle modern
trading demands.

2.1 Problems of Current Cryptocurrency Exchanges
2.1.1 High Trading Fees
According to Exchange War[2], the top 30 cryptocurrency exchanges, on average,
charge 0.2% trading fees for both makers and takers, which impact traders’ proﬁt
margins signiﬁcantly. Some exchanges claim that they charge low trading fees, but
these reduced rates often only apply once a trader’s volume has reached a very high
threshold.
2.1.2 Diﬃculties of Real-time Trading
Due to rate-limited trading APIs, non-real-time transaction conﬁrmation, and delayed
order book updates, traders are unable to trade in real-time.
2.1.3 Asset Security Issues
Cryptocurrency trading platforms hold a large amount of cryptocurrency deposits,
making them unavoidably the target of hackers. On February 24th, 2014, Mt.Gox, a
Bitcoin exchange, was breached and lost 650Ｋ Bitcoin, which is currently worth2.6B
USD; in August 2016, Bitﬁnex, one of the world’s top 10 cryptocurrency exchange, was
hacked and lost 120K Bitcoin, currently valued at more than 480M USD. If investors
continue to be concerned about security issues, then the growth of the cryptocurrency
trading market will be aﬀected.
Moreover, most cryptocurrency exchanges are not able to guarantee the adoption of
the 100% reserve banking system. Deposits can be embezzled, the security concerns
make cryptocurrency deposits into exchanges unsecured.

2.1.4 Shutdown without Warning
Shutdown without warning is common amongst trading platforms. In 2014, Mt.Gox
encountered serious technical failures, resulting in trading halts. The value of Bitcoin
plummeted from 260 USD to 110 USD. On May 25th, 2017, Kraken, another
cryptocurrency exchange platform, shut down three times in one day. On May 27th,
2017, Coinbase, a leading exchange platform, claimed that the system halt was caused
by unprecedentedly high trading volume. The incident also led to a signiﬁcant plummet
of Bitcoin value. Platform shutdowns bring user trading to a halt and people have lost
vast amounts in investments. To this day, many of these incidents remain unresolved.
2.1.5 Only Limited FIAT Currencies Are Supported
Most exchange platforms only support one kind of ﬁat currency. While some don’t even
provide FIAT withdrawal/deposit.
2.1.6 Lack of Multilingual Support
Most exchange platforms only support one language; only a handful are multilingual.
2.1.7 Slow Customer Services and KYC Process
Currently, the delivery of customer services is slow, while some exchanges don’t even
respond to inquiries at all. Furthermore, the process of KYC (Know Your Customer) is
slow and complicated. Take Kraken as an example, when the demand for identity
veriﬁcation is high, it takes around 30 days to complete Tier 4 veriﬁcation.

2.2 Existing ICO Issues
In 2017, funds raised through ICOs increased from 5.6M USD in January to 987M USD
in July[3]. This activity is expected to exceed 200B USD in 2020. Although ICOs are
increasingly popular as a means of fundraising, some problems with ICOs remain
unsolved.
2.2.1 Low Liquidity of ICO Tokens
The most serious problem for ICOs is that ICO tokens cannot be immediately traded in
exchanges after their ICO. Low liquidity of ICO tokens means ICO tokens’ bid-ask
spread is large, which further reduces their value.
In addition, it required an intimidatingly high listing fee to list a token on one of the
world’s top 10 exchanges. The listing fee is often as high as 500 to 1000 Bitcoin.
As a result, traders have no choice but to resort to the secondary market, which has low
liquidity and large spread for trading ICO tokens. This has imposed signiﬁcant obstacles
to the overall development of the cryptocurrency market.

3.2 Features of COBINHOOD Cryptocurrecny Exchange
3.2.1 ZERO Trading Fees
COBINHOOD features ZERO trading fees for spot trading and margin trading with up to
10x leverage to maximize the proﬁts for traders all over the globe.
3.2.2 100% Reserve Guarantee
COBINHOOD guarantees 100% reserve. It will also disclose all online and oﬄine wallet
addresses for public audit, ensuring no embezzlement of traders’ funds.
3.2.3 Oﬄine Multisig Wallet Security System
Every kind of crypto assets deposited at COBINHOOD will be stored in an oﬄine
multisig wallet. It is estimated that 98% of assets will be stored oﬄine, while 2% of
assets will remain in an online wallet allowing for faster user deposit/withdrawal
experience.
Each oﬄine multisig wallet consists of 8 HSMs (Hardware Security Modules). This
means that transactions which use the multisig wallet will require 5 out of the 8 HSMs
to proceed. If one of the HSM administrators is compromised, the multisig wallet will
remain secure. Furthermore, the administrators of the HSMs are located in diﬀerent
countries (geo distributed) adding to COBINHOOD’s security system.
3.2.4 Crypto Assets Backed by Insurance
All crypto asset deposits in COBINHOOD’s online wallet will be backed by insurance.
Since oﬄine multisig wallet is virtually impossible to be compromised, all users’ crypto
assets will be fully covered.
3.2.5 Two-Factor Authentication Enforcement
COBINHOOD enforces two-factor authentication (2FA) to log in. Withdrawal of crypto
assets requires an extra email conﬁrmation to protect the user’s crypto assets.

6

3.2.6 Distributed Order Matching Engine
The COBINHOOD platform is built on Google Cloud Platform and is programmed with
Golang for high concurrency.
By design, each trading pair is transmitted through a dedicated order matching engine
to ensure high order matching speed.
COBINHOOD’s order matching engine is composed of microservices, including
frontend, API backend, order matching system, and job/message queue services
deployed with Docker and Kubernetes to achieve high availability and high scalability.
All of the transaction records are stored in Spanner DB, a Google Cloud Platform
database that features strong consistency and the ability to do horizontal auto scaling.
The information of the order book is stored in Redis cluster, an in-memory database
technology featuring horizontal auto scaling and distributed in-memory replication.
Transactions and order book updates are sent through Web Application Messaging
Protocol (WAMP) to achieve real-time information update at every tick. In stress tests,
COBINHOOD is able to process 1,154,284 orders per second and achieve 10,142 order
book updates per second for each trading pair on average—making it the world’s ﬁrst
cryptocurrency exchange capable of high-frequency trading.
At COBINHOOD, software development follows test-driven development (TDD). By
using Docker and Kubernetes together with CircleCI, continuous delivery (CD) and
continuous integration (CI) we can ensure system stability and strength.
3.2.7 Wide Range of FIAT Currencies Supported
COBINHOOD will support a wide range of ﬁat currencies. Users are able to choose their
preferred ﬁat currencies to make funds deposit or withdrawals.
Fiat currencies supported by COBINHOOD: USD/EUR/JPY/KRW/CNY/HKD/CAD/GBP/
AUD/NTD

7

3.2.8 The Most International Cryptocurrency Exchange
The website and app of COBINHOOD support 10 main languages, covering 98 % of the
world’s population’s native language, making it the most internationalized
cryptocurrency exchange.
Languages supported by COBINHOOD: Chinese/Japanese/Korean/English/Russian/
French/German/Spanish/Portuguese/Arabic
3.2.9 Responsive 24/7 Online Customer Services
COBINHOOD provides 24/7 online customer service. Should users encounter issues or
need assistance, customer success specialists can be reached via the COBINHOOD
website and mobile app. When a user submits an inquiry, the customer success team
will respond within one day. COBINHOOD’s goal is to provide consistently excellent
customer assistance.
3.2.10 User-friendly KYC Process
COBINHOOD will enforce bank-level KYC (Know Your Customer) processes to comply
with AML (Anti Money Laundering) laws. COBINHOOD provides user-friendly identity
authentication services. The process usually be completed within 24 hours of customer
submission.
3.2.11 Decentralized Exchange
In the future, COBINHOOD plans to build a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. As
the consensus algorithm of blockchain technology advances, decentralized highfrequency trading and real-time order book matching will become feasible.
3.2.12 Design of COBINHOOD Website and App

3.3 Features of COBINHOOD ICO Underwriting Service
COBINHOOD only underwrites high-quality, promising ICOs that have passed stringent
due diligence, smart contract code review, and legal compliance review by
COBINHOOD’s dedicated ICO review team. In addition, COBINHOOD’s ICO Spark
ProgramTM will help well-known enterprises, successful startup companies, and
celebrities launch their ICOs.
Also, ICO tokens underwritten by COBINHOOD can be traded on COBINHOOD exchange
immediately after ICO, which solves ICO tokens’ low liquidity issue as explained in 2.2.1.
3.3.1 ICO Due Diligence
It is very diﬃcult for ICO investors to tell if an ICO project is promising or not.
COBINHOOD ICO review team makes a huge diﬀerence. The team will review ICO
projects on diﬀerent aspects, including project feasibility, idea novelty, ﬁnancial
justiﬁcation, and legal compliance.
3.3.2 ICO Smart Contract Code Review
In June 2016, The DAO was able to raise 150M USD within a short timeframe; however,
due to the ﬂaws in its smart contract code, a hacker was able to steal 50M USD from
it. COBINHOOD’s experienced technology team will review ICO smart contracts to
eliminate errors, bugs, or backdoors.
3.3.3 ICO Legal Compliance Review
COBINHOOD is committed to achieving the highest possible standards for legal
compliance. COBINHOOD’s legal team are highly experienced in securities law and
banking law. All ICO project’s white paper documents and ICO terms will be examined
for compliance with legal regulations.
3.3.4 ICO Spark Program
COBINHOOD ICO Spark ProgramTM is launched with vision to help companies integrate
their products and services through the use of blockchain technology.
A well-known example of traditional and blockchain technology integration is “FunFair.”
FunFair creates a fair gambling environment for players with Ethereum smart contract
technology. FunFair FUN token’s market cap is now 98M USD as of August, 2017[4].
Another example is Lampix, a computer-vision AI startup whose machine-learning
algorithm can transform any surface into a smart surface[5]. In August 2017, it launched
an ICO for its PIX token, an image-mining blockchain. Its ICO was a success with 14.2M
USD raised[6] in 8 hours.

Other than enterprises, the ICO Spark Program TM also aims to help individuals launch
their own ICO. With guidance from the ICO Spark Program TM team, a person of notable
accomplishments can easily launch ICOs for fundraising or charitable foundations.
Through the “ICO Spark ProgramTM”, COBINHOOD will launch ICOs for well-known
enterprises, successful startup companies, and distinguished individuals, not only to
help fundraising but to also build a trustworthy ICO ecosystem.

3.4 Conclusion
COBINHOOD is the world’s ﬁrst ZERO trading fee cryptocurrency exchange that is
capable of high-frequency trading. In the near future, large investment banks, hedge
funds and institutional investors will be more than willing to enter the cryptocurrency
trading market due to COBINHOOD’s high quality of service.
Together with COBINHOOD’s ICO underwriter service, COBINHOOD will become
NASDAQ and Goldman Sachs in the cryptocurrency market.

7. COBINHOOD ICO
7.1 ICO Plan
Participate in COBINHOOD’s ICO to sponsor COBINHOOD exchange development.
COBINHOOD’s token symbol will be COB. COB tokens are based on Ethereum ERC20
token standard. A total of 1 billion COB tokens will be issued. 500 million COB tokens
will be available for ICO.
ICO Amount: 50% (500M COB tokens)
COBINHOOD Inc. Amount: 40% (400M COB tokens)
Private Placement Amount: 10% (100M COB Tokens)
The COBINHOOD ICO starts on September 13th, 2017 and continues until October 22th,
2017. Only Ethereum is accepted. The rate of COB will be as follows:
9/13 - 9/19:
1 ETH for 5600 COBs (40% bonus)
9/20 - 9/26:
1 ETH for 5200 COBs (30% bonus)
9/27 - 10/3:
1 ETH for 4800 COBs (20% bonus)
10/4 - 10/10:

The COBINHOOD exchange is scheduled to go online on November 1st, 2017. COB
token can be traded on the COBINHOOD exchange once it is online.

*Participation in the COBINHOOD ICO means you are sponsoring the development of the COBINHOOD exchange
platform. COBINHOOD, Inc. does not and cannot promise any guaranteed returns for ICO participants.
*COB token is not security since it does not reﬂect the ownership of COBINHOOD, Inc. legal entity.

7.2 COB Token Privileges
COBINHOOD ICO participants will be eligible for several privileges. For example,
50% oﬀ margin trading loan interest can be availed when paid with COB tokens.
Another privilege is, when COBINHOOD underwrites an ICO, COB token holders will
be able to get future ICO tokens at signiﬁcantly lower rates. The amount of ICO
tokens that a COB token holder can get at a lower rate is as follows:
(ICO Tokens Received by COBINHOOD from ICO Underwriting Service) * (The
Amount of COBs Owned) / (Total Amount of COBs)
COB token holders can bind their Ethereum wallet address, which is holding COB
tokens to their COBINHOOD trading platform account, by calling the binding
function in COB token smart contract. After the binding is complete, COB holders
can get the ICO tokens at a lower rate on the COBINHOOD exchange.
As an example, COBINHOOD underwrites an ICO for a token called XYZ. The total
issuance of XYZ tokens through ICO is 100M and COBINHOOD takes 5% as
underwriter service fee. 10M COB tokens holder will have a lower rate, i.e. :
5M * 10M / 1B = 50k XYZ tokens.
COBINHOOD will make eﬀorts to maximize a COB token holder’s beneﬁts. There
may be more privileges for COB token holders in the future.

*Privileges for COB token holders may be subject to change in the future.
*A detailed ICO underwriting service report will be published on the 15th of every month on COBINHOOD’s
oﬃcial website.
