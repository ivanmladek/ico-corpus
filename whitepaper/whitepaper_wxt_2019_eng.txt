Executive Summary
Wirex is a ground-breaking UK-based, FCA-licenced global leader in digital
money solutions for individuals and businesses. Our payment platform
pioneered the seamless integration of crypto and traditional currencies to
support multi-currency accounts, currency transfers and exchange services.
Wirex has a global footprint with 6 offices across the globe, nearly 2 million
registered users and availability in 200 countries and territories.
Wirex is built on state-of-the-art technology to make the future of digital
payments a reality, today. To realise this goal and facilitate the everyday
management of both digital and traditional currencies, Wirex integrates traditional
banking infrastructure with cryptocurrency blockchains. This provides a trusted
and cost-effective service for digital money transactions which is relevant for both
today’s payment environment and the token economy of the future. Wirex is a
regulated financial institution and is licensed as an Electronic Money Institution
(EMI) by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), licence number 902025.
By building a solid foundation for scalable and secure services in a regulated
environment, Wirex will be the key platform for digital payments in the near
future, including merchant payments, cross-border currency exchanges/
transfers and machine-to-machine (M2M) micro transactions. Most
importantly, Wirex is available to everyone – from everyday consumers to
businesses of all sizes.
The platform currently supports nine cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin, XRP,
Ethereum, Lumens, Waves, Wollo, DAI and NANO) and eleven traditional
currency accounts (including GBP, EUR, USD, HKD, AUD, CAD, CHF and CZK),
with a number of major crypto and traditional currencies in the pipeline.
Wirex was the first company in the world to issue a contactless Wirex Visa
card, allowing users to convert and spend cryptocurrencies instantly in dayto-day life. The platform provides unrestricted access to OTC and interbank
rates for crypto and traditional currency exchanges. Unlike some other
financial institutions and payment platforms, Wirex doesn’t limit access to

Executive Summary

the best market rates to those who can afford excessive minimum order
amounts. Furthermore, we are excited about the successful launch of our
unique B2B platform in February 2019 that has already attracted more
than 3,000 registrations from corporate customers and has successfully
onboarded top tier exchanges and OTC brokers including Huobi, ZBX and
Enigma Securities.
True to the goal of bridging the gap between traditional and digital money,
Wirex created Cryptoback™, the world’s first crypto reward programme.
It earns cardholders 0.5% back in digital currency on all in-store purchases
made with the Wirex Visa card.
WXT, the Wirex platform native token, is a universal Stellar-based token
extensively used within and outside the Wirex platform, representing a
universal fee and reward unit. It is designed to benefit our growing B2C and
B2B user communities, help our customers save on fees and let them access
unique financial rewards if they maintain the required balances of WXT.
Backed by SBI Group, a globally-renowned financial institution, Wirex has spent
the past four years revolutionising payments. It’s no surprise that nearly 2m
users across 130 countries already say: “I pay my way. I pay by Wirex.”

Background

2.1

Vision
As great believers in blockchain technology and a cashless society, we
have built a platform that can address the limitations of conventional
financial institutions by exploiting technological breakthroughs. Our focus
is on facilitating the adoption of the token economy by creating solutions
for the most relevant use cases. Having analysed the current status of the
blockchain-based financial services segment, we have ascertained that only

5

Wirex Token [ WXT ] Whitepaper
Version 1.0 [ June 2019 ]

Background

one fully-formed industry cohort exists, represented by several established
crypto exchanges/trading platforms.
Out of dozens of exchanges operating on the market, a few command
significantly higher transaction volume. Their success, in our view, can be
attributed to robust technical infrastructure, clean user interfaces and a wide
selection of currency pairs for trading. Some of these exchanges, such as Huobi
and Binance, prefer transacting solely within crypto ecosystem, whilst others
like Coinbase and Bitstamp strive to combine crypto and fiat functionality. In
short, the crypto trading/exchange market is well-developed and competitive.
Crypto-based financial services that lie outside the trading and exchange
vertical are less developed. When it comes to payments, insurance, lending,
asset management and so on, there are no recognisable winners.
Although currency exchange is a very important part of our business model
at Wirex, our main focus targets blockchain-based, payment-related use
cases. The over-saturated trading vertical is not a priority for us.
Having started our journey enabling individual customers to utilise digital
assets in everyday life, we are now the first FCA-licensed company in the
world to have built a corporate solution – Wirex Business – for all types of
businesses that enables the management of both digital and fiat funds on
one borderless platform, with multi-currency IBANs and blockchain wallets.
Our vision for the future of the token economy correlates with a real trend
towards technological mass adoption. Given our focus on payments, we
strive to offer the best-in-class platform for individual customers and
businesses alike. We have been market leaders in combining major payment
rails with blockchains for more than four years.
There are blockchain payment use cases, including M2M payments,
micropayments and the global digitalisation of assets, that cannot be fully
realised today. Our aim is to continue developing practical solutions for our
customers, both businesses and consumers, with a view to becoming the goto platform in the payment environment of the future.

pace, technological achievements and milestones reached so far.

2.2

Wirex history

2014

Wirex was founded in 2014 with the aim of bringing cryptocurrency
into everyday life, using the extensive Visa network (40m merchants in 200
countries and territories).

2015

The first Wirex Visa card was issued in January 2015, fueling tremendous
client growth. Wirex achieved its goal of creating a truly innovative hybrid
crypto/traditional currency card that captured the imagination of both crypto
enthusiasts and the wider market. Thanks to the support of early adopters
and a ‘first mover’ advantage, Wirex quickly became the default card for
cryptocurrency payments globally.

2016

Wirex opened its R&D centre in Kiev and continued to invest resources in
technology, security and compliance. By the end of 2016, Wirex dominated
the cryptocurrency market with 70% market share and 1m customers
globally. In October, we won the Fin/Sum start-up competition, beating
more than 30 companies from all over the world. The Fin/Sum award was a
trigger for Wirex’s success in Japan and our decision to establish an office
in Tokyo.

2017

The firm raised funding from SBI Group, one of the most significant players
in the FinTech and cryptocurrency arena. As a result of the participation and
support of Japanese investors and overwhelming growth in this market,
Wirex decided to incorporate Wirex Japan, a 100% subsidiary of Wirex UK
Limited. By the end of 2017, Wirex had maintained its market share and the
number of employees quickly grew to 100 people across three offices in
London, Tokyo and Kiev.

2018

2018 was the year in which investments in IT and Compliance paid
dividends for Wirex. Wirex was one of the first UK crypto-friendly
companies to be licensed as an Electronic Money Institution by the UK

7

Wirex Token [ WXT ] Whitepaper
Version 1.0 [ June 2019 ]

Background

Financial Conduct Authority. A big believer in the token economy, Wirex
added support for LTC, ETH and XRP, in keeping with their objectives
of expanding their list of supported currencies. Wirex also introduced
another world-first feature in the form of Cryptoback™, an exclusive
cryptocurrency reward programme that earns users 0.5% back in digital
currency on all in-store transactions.
With 2 million customers across over 130 countries, Wirex is expanding
rapidly. New subsidiaries Wirex Singapore, Wirex USA and Wirex Canada
were incorporated. To expand card programmes globally, agreements
with BIN sponsors from Singapore, USA and Canada were signed off and
integration begun.
2019

Q1 of 2019 saw Wirex pick up where they left off in 2018. The introduction of
new currencies including DAI, the platform’s first stablecoin, Wollo, Waves,
Nano and XLM provided exciting new investment options for Wirex users,
while a new Community Champions programme gave fans and enthusiasts
the unique opportunity to work closely with the Wirex team on beta tests,
launches and product development.
In February 2019 Wirex launched Wirex 3.0 – the next-generation Wirex
platform offering 9 cryptocurrencies, 11 traditional currencies, access
to interbank and OTC exchange rates and a refreshed visual identity. The
redesign was completed in collaboration with Pentagram – the world’s
largest independent design consultancy.
As part of the Wirex 3.0 release, Wirex released Wirex Business, the world’s
first B2B solution for businesses dealing with digital assets. In the first four
weeks of operation, Wirex Business received more than 3,000 applications
from corporate customers.

2.3

Addressable market
Given the growth of the token economy so far, we anticipate mass adoption
across both emerging and developed economies. With advances in

8

Wirex Token [ WXT ] Whitepaper
Version 1.0 [ June 2019 ]

Background

technology, we believe that blockchain-based payments will become an essential
tool for the unbanked population – currently numbering around two billion people
worldwide. At the same time, blockchain technology has revolutionised the entire
e-commerce ecosystem by providing tremendous benefits to both merchants
and customers in developed and developing economies.
The $3 trillion global retail e-commerce market is now growing at almost
20% a year. It is currently dominated by Visa and Mastercard but is
set to be disrupted by blockchain and stablecoins in particular. These
represent a substantially more efficient method of remittance by providing
instant settlement capabilities along with a significantly lower cost-pertransaction.
At the moment, high transaction fees and long settlement periods put
significant pressure on SMEs. These problems can be mitigated using
blockchain-based payments thanks to lower costs and near-instantaneous
settlements.
By providing an easy solution for merchants and their customers to accept
and make payments in the form of digital assets, the existing e-commerce
market will eventually be reshaped by alternative (blockchain-based)
payment rails.
Such a solution should be capable of instantly issuing, redeeming and
exchanging multicurrency stablecoins. This is exactly what Wirex is building.

2.4

Client base forecast
Despite the crypto winter and general decline of cryptocurrency interest
amongst the general public, Wirex’s retail and corporate client base keeps
growing steadily. There are three main factors that account for this fast growth
in the face of challenging market conditions:
Firstly, Wirex has always focused on real use cases, such as payments. Almost
all crypto-native companies report a decline in trading volume and active
customers because there is less speculation and long periods of low market
volatility, suggesting that cryptocurrencies are becoming less volatile

9

Wirex Token [ WXT ] Whitepaper
Version 1.0 [ June 2019 ]

Background

Secondly, Wirex is a first-mover and true innovator. While we are aware
that competing companies try to imitate what Wirex is doing, in reality, the
competition is very low. In fact, there is no single company in the world that
offers Wirex’s services on a global scale in a regulated environment.
Lastly, global expansion accounts for the fast-growing client base. We have a
well-defined and tested approach to global expansion, in which compliance
and regulation play a key role. Our typical approach is to obtain the required
licences, grow the team, localise the product (translate the app and add local
payment options), grow the community, and grow the client base.
2.4.1

Retail customers
Currently, Wirex has over two million registered users and the customer
base doubles every year without significant marketing operations. In fact,
the customer base is expected to continue doubling as we move forward.
Wirex has 700,000 customers on the waiting list for the Wirex Visa Card in
APAC and North America (the card launch is planned for Q3 2019). We are
targeting a global client base of 25 million in the next 3 years.

10

Wirex Token [ WXT ] Whitepaper
Version 1.0 [ June 2019 ]

Background

2.4.2

Corporate customers
Wirex Business is relatively new. As of April 2019, we have over
100 businesses live on the platform (including top-tier exchanges
and OTC brokers including Huobi, ZBX and Enigma Securities) and
3,000 on the waiting list to use Wirex Business. The main reason for
such outstanding demand is that there is no single platform in the world
offering the same breadth of services as Wirex Business, e.g. secure
crypto wallets, corporate bank accounts and instant exchange
at OTC/interbank rates.
While our first-mover advantage has served us well, we understand it
will not last forever. To maintain our leading position, we plan to do what
we do best – innovate and incorporate new and exciting features for
businesses that will help them unlock the potential of token economy
and blockchain-based payments. Wirex plans to open 300,000 Wirex
Business accounts for corporate clients by the end of 2022.

Wirex Platform
The Wirex platform is designed from scratch and 99% built in-house.
This unique approach has enabled Wirex to build systems free from legacy
constraints using technology that transforms the payment experience –
making transactions faster, more efficient and more secure for everyone.
The Wirex platform is an integrative model utilising cloud-based microservices. Each has a specific responsibility and can be updated or replicated
without a lengthy maintenance process. When we designed the platform,
we paid particular attention to security and safety. Wirex’s infrastructure is
audited and pen-tested on a regular basis. In addition, the Wirex platform
is PCI DSS Level 1-certified, meeting the industry’s highest security
requirements.

Core services

3.1.1

Liquidity engine

has integrated a number of external liquidity providers:
•
•
•

We employ AI and ML-based features to discover and prevent new fraud
related patterns.

Banking infrastructure
Wirex is integrated with a number of banking partners to create and close
individual and corporate bank accounts, initiate and receive bank transfers
and exchange currencies.
We offer our customers multi-currency international bank accounts
connected to SWIFT/SEPA/Faster Payment/ACH and we are constantly
adding more local payment rails.

3.1.5

Visa infrastructure
The Wirex platform is deeply integrated with Visa’s global network to offer
issuing and acquiring capabilities. Visa network integration allows powerful
and scalable payment processing that’s certified by Visa. It supports Chip
and PIN (EMV), magstripe, virtual and contactless card processing across
prepaid and debit card rails. We manage and control all important elements
of the network, including customer on-boarding, card creation, card delivery,
card transaction processing etc.

3.2

Wirex app (B2C – retail product)

Wirex offers fully-featured mobile wallets supporting more than 20
currencies, digital and traditional, as well as Wirex Visa cards that allow
clients to spend their money with 40m+ merchants around the world.
More than 2 million people have registered on the Wirex platform so far
and we welcome thousands of new customers to the platform each day.
While cryptocurrency has huge potential in the payment space, poor
merchant acceptance is a big obstacle for mass adoption. In fact,
the number of merchants around the world that accept digital assets
as a means of payment is still only in the tens of thousands, a figure
insufficient for the mass market. The Wirex Visa card solves this problem
by allowing customers to use their digital money at the best possible
rates anywhere Visa is accepted.

14

While it is clear that blockchain-based P2P payments represent the
future, we believe that integrating digital money into existing merchant
networks is a vital first step on the road to mass adoption. The Wirex
app helps users manage digital and fiat currencies and provides secure
accounts for everyday use, as well as convenience and versatility.

3.2.1

Features
Multi-currency accounts (digital & traditional)
Wirex boasts the only mobile banking app that combines digital wallets
(9 cryptocurrencies) with multi-currency bank accounts (11 traditional
currencies) that support multiple in/out funding options (crypto transfers,
ACH, SEPA, SWIFT, Faster Payments and debit/credit cards).
Instant exchange
Wirex’s exchange engine can instantly convert any combination of 9
cryptocurrencies and 11 traditional currencies at the best rates on the market.
Best exchange rates (OTC / Interbank)
Wirex is integrated with 3 exchanges, 3 OTC brokers and 2 FX brokers. At
any point in time, Wirex can provide the best exchange rate regardless of
currency pairing.
Visa card with dynamic 3D-Secure
Wirex Visa cards allow customers to seamlessly spend their crypto or fiat
currency in over 40 million merchants worldwide. The range of Wirexsupported currencies underpins multiple use cases: a primary payment card,
a travel card, and a solution for numerous crypto-based remittances. The fact
that all Wirex cards support the dynamic 3D-Secure protocol makes all online
transactions as secure as possible.
Cryptoback™ / Wirex Rewards
Cryptoback™ is the world’s first crypto-based rewards program. It offers
0.5% back on every in-store purchase paid in Wirex tokens (WXT).
Cryptoback™ has proved to be an excellent instrument for increasing
customer engagement and retention.

Wirex will issue 26 fiat-backed Wirex stablecoins. A partnership with the IBM
World Wire network will enable funds to be sent globally, allowing for cheaper and
faster payments than the existing traditional options currently on the market.
Spending analytics and budgeting (coming soon)

up any transaction you make with your Wirex card to the nearest whole
number and place it in the customers savings account.

Crypto-backed loans (coming soon)
Eligible customers will be able to use their digital assets as collateral for
crypto-backed loans. Based on currency and terms, Wirex will provide the
best possible offer via a network of loan originators. Crypto-backed loans can
be a fast and tax-efficient way to unlock cryptocurrency savings.

Wirex Business (B2B — corporate product)

Wirex Business is a regulated corporate finance solution offering secure
multi-signature wallets, corporate bank accounts and the best exchange
rates available.
The cryptocurrency industry is growing fast, but many of the companies
dealing with digital assets struggle to open bank accounts or integrate with
the existing banking and payment infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a
secure, regulated and cost-efficient environment in which businesses can
manage digital and traditional money without artificial limits or huge fees.
We believe that compatibility with traditional infrastructure will accelerate
innovation and encourage more companies to focus on real use cases; this will
facilitate the mass adoption of cryptocurrency.

3.3.1

Features
One-stop on / off ramp solution (Digital<>FIAT)
Wirex Business combines cryptocurrency custody (for 9 cryptocurrencies)
with multi-currency fiat accounts (11 currencies) and supports multiple
funds in / out options (crypto, ACH, SEPA, SWIFT, debit / credit cards).
Deep liquidity pool
Wirex is integrated with 3 exchanges, 3 OTC brokers and 2 FX brokers,
allowing us to process multi-million dollar orders at some of the best market
rates.
OTC rates
Wirex has democratised access to OTC exchange rates with no minimum
order size.
API
REST API and WebSocket API provides access to the entire functionality
available in the Wirex Business UI, which means businesses can integrate
the Wirex platform into their existing infrastructure.

Stablecoins

Wirex is about to start issuing 26 different fiat-backed stablecoins backed oneto-one by a corresponding fiat currency. For example, Wirex will hold £1 for
every GBPW, $1 for every USDW and so on. These funds are held in segregated
bank accounts that are constantly monitored and audited. In addition, the Wirex
platform offers the instant exchange of fiat-backed tokens at interbank rates.

3.4.1

Auto-tokenisation for fiat balances
Wirex stablecoins are automatically available for retail and corporate
customers. Once a customer deposits fiat currency, Wirex instantly
tokenises it by issuing the equivalent in stablecoins; clients can decide to
use stablecoins or traditional banking rails to pay their partners or suppliers.
For example, if Bob deposits 100 USD via ACH transfer, the Wirex platform
instantly issues 100 USDW. Bob can send the USDW to friends, pay bills or
purchase goods with his Wirex Visa card.

3.4.2

List of stablecoins and supported bank-in/out methods

Wirex stablecoins are fully collateralised fiat-backed tokens in 26 currencies,
offering real-time interbank exchange rates.
Stellar-based
The Stellar platform offers high-speed transactions. The platform can process
4,000 transactions per second, with each transaction taking between 3-5
seconds to confirm. The platform is not only scalable but also extremely
efficient as the cost-per-transaction is less than $0.00001. In addition, Stellar
offers a built-in compliance framework and the ability to freeze and reissue
funds in case they are lost or stolen. See 3.5 below for further details.
Regulated, audited and compliant
Wirex stablecoins are based on existing Wirex E-Money infrastructure
(audited, tested and regulated).
Focus on payments
While fiat-backed tokens can be used for hedging and numerous other use
cases, the main focus for Wirex stablecoins is payments: everyday payments,
cross-border transfers and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) transactions.
Real-time monitoring
The Wirex platform allows anyone to monitor the amount of fiat and issued
tokens in real-time, making Wirex stablecoins the most transparent fiatbacked tokens on the market.
Decentralised issuance
Wirex uses governed networks and consortium, which lets any institution
that satisfies the requirements issue Wirex stablecoins.

3.4.4

Use cases
Hedging
Cryptocurrencies fluctuate in price according to market supply and demand.
Tokenised fiat money does not fluctuate in value. Instead, it remains price-

27

Wirex Token [ WXT ] Whitepaper
Version 1.0 [ June 2019 ]

Wirex platform

pegged to the value of its underlying asset. This makes price-stable tokens
useful for providing fiat connectivity and hedging risks on crypto exchanges,
particularly on exchanges that do not provide traditional fiat on and off-ramps
– as long as the price is truly stable and effective protective measures around
the minting and redemption of such tokens are in place.
An investor may choose to protect themselves from bitcoin’s fluctuating
value by trading their BTC for USD/GBP/EUR tokens on a supporting
exchange. In this case, they can rest assured that the value of those tokens
will not fluctuate.
Merchant payments
At present, any business takes a significant risk accepting cryptocurrencies
as a method of exchange due to the significant volatility of this asset
class. Stablecoins hold the potential to unlock the mainstream adoption of
cryptocurrencies for day-to-day payments for businesses and commerce;
price stability is a key reason why merchants and retailers around the world
do not usually accept crypto transactions. Additionally, merchants stand to
save 3-5% in fees compared to debit/credit card payments.
Cross-border payments
Stablecoins eliminate the price volatility risk as crypto payments are
processed. To stay relevant in this context, transactions have to be confirmed
rapidly in order to provide a good user experience and a noteworthy
improvement on conventional transfers (international bank transfers currently
take up to three days).
Token transfers take 3-5 seconds to confirm. Both counterparties can
leverage the Stellar compliance framework in case they need additional
information about the sender or recipient. In case of cross-currency transfer,
exchange rates can be provided by Wirex or via the Stellar DEX – during the
exchange process, the tokens of one currency are destroyed while the tokens
of another currency are created.
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) payments
Stellar-based stablecoins are ideal for microtransactions. They are fast and
cheap compared to competing blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.
Wirex stablecoins built on the stellar infrastructure can process 4,000
transactions per second, which makes them capable of processing millions of
M2M transactions. Reports suggest that there will be 20-40 billion connected
devices by 2022; we believe that M2M payments will be a huge new market in
the very near future.

3.4.5

Governance
Wirex uses a decentralised issuance model, in which any financial institution
can join the Wirex consortium to issue tokens backed by a local currency.
One of the requirements for such issuance is that corporates have to store
their funds in Wirex Business accounts, so we can guarantee both the
transparency and safety of tokenised funds.

3.5

Stellar partnership
Stellar is an open-sourced, distributed payments infrastructure, built on
the premise that the international community needs “a worldwide financial
network open to anyone.” The project meets this need, connecting individuals,
institutions, and payment systems through the platform.
In February 2019, Wirex started implementing Stellar-based stablecoins in
26 currencies, in close collaboration with the Stellar Foundation. In addition,
Wirex set up three full validators and joined other companies such as IBM in
the Stellar Consensus protocol.

3.6

IBM World Wire partnership
Using blockchain technology and the Stellar protocol, IBM Blockchain World Wire
provides shared distributed ledgers for atomic payment clearing and settlement
in near real-time. The network uses digital assets (that serve as the agreed-upon
store of value exchanged between parties) to settle transactions while integrating
payment instruction messages. The main benefits of this are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Increased transparency
Immutable transaction history
Decreased need for intermediaries
Shared distributed ledger system
Near real-time remittance
Easy consensus between stakeholders

Wirex is in the process of joining the IBM World Wire payment network and
plans to be an active market maker and participant of World Wire. The World
Wire network will complement existing Stellar<>Wirex integration and opens
multiple possibilities in the remittance space. Given that 97% of all banks
in the world work with IBM, we recognise this IBM initiative as a first step
towards achieving a standard for stablecoin-based payments.

List of innovations

3.7.1

Crypto debit card
The world’s first prepaid card linked to a bitcoin wallet was issued by Wirex
(formerly E-Coin) in January 2015.
By issuing a card product like this, we attempted to solve one of the major problems
in cryptocurrencies, namely their poor adoption and acceptance. Instead of
convincing all merchants in the world to start accepting cryptocurrencies, we were
able to use existing Visa and Mastercard merchant networks and connect with over
40 million merchants in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.

3.7.2

Crypto-backed reward programme — Cryptoback™
The world’s first cryptocurrency reward programme was created by Wirex
in 2018. Cryptoback™ offers 0.5% back in cryptocurrency on every in-store
purchase made with the Wirex Visa card.
Cryptoback™ has been a tremendous success from the very beginning. Tens
of thousands of people pay by Wirex every day and collect Cryptoback™ when
they buy a cup of coffee, groceries or clothing. The Cryptoback™ programme has
neatly eliminated the major problem of legacy loyalty point schemes, such as the
inability to spend, exchange or transfer collected points. Because Cryptoback™
is paid in cryptocurrency, it is instantly redeemable and spendable.

3.7.3

Crypto-friendly business accounts
In February 2019, we launched the world’s first-ever FCA-licenced,
crypto-friendly business account.
As blockchain comes into its eleventh year of existence, consumers can
enjoy myriad options for managing their cryptocurrency, whether on
exchanges, payment platforms or private offline wallets. There are also
growing numbers of fintech start-ups that offer services in the digital
payment space to help open the market to more mainstream adoption.
However, when it comes to businesses, things are not quite as simple. A
lack of regulation in the sector has restricted the scope for crypto-friendly

30

Wirex platform

business offerings. Today, many crypto and blockchain-focused start-ups
still struggle to find banking partners that can accommodate their needs
due to widespread institutional reluctance. Wirex offers corporate multicurrency IBANs with access to SWIFT/SEPA/Faster Payments/ACH, secure
cryptocurrency wallets and exchange at OTC rates in a one-stop, elegant
solution - the Wirex Business platform.
3.7.4

OTC rates for retail customers
In February 2019, Wirex started providing OTC exchange rates to retail
customers. We were the first on the market with such an initiative.
Not many people realise that the OTC market for digital assets is bigger than
the exchange market. Exchanges might set the price, but medium-to-large
trades do not take place there.
The main reason why centralised exchanges are still popular is that the OTC
market is not accessible to everyone. OTC rates are widely accepted to be
the best available, yet only institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals
or large corporations are allowed to access them. Further barriers to OTC
trades are prohibitively large minimum order sizes.
At Wirex, we think it’s unfair that retail customers and SMEs (small and medium
enterprises) cannot trade on the OTC market. We are very excited to be the first
company in the world to democratise access to OTC and interbank rates. It is
now possible to exchange up to 20 digital and traditional currencies at the OTC
or interbank rate on the Wirex platform, regardless of currency pair or order size.

3.7.5

Multi-currency stablecoins (26 currencies)
Wirex is introducing another world-first — 26 multi-currency stablecoins,
which can be instantly and seamlessly redeemed, transferred or exchanged.
Wirex fiat-pegged tokens are unique in that they are used to auto-tokenise
the entire fiat balances on the Wirex platform (Wirex app and Wirex
Business), which makes them instantly available for our 2 million retail
customers and 3,000 corporates.

M2M platform
Wirex is currently implementing the world’s first Machine-To-Machine (M2M)
platform (code named W-Pay) based on Wirex fiat-pegged tokens (multiple
currencies with instant exchange), Stellar scalability (4,000 transactions per
second) and IBM World Wire capabilities (97% of banks use IBM). Once built,
the platform will be able to process thousands of transactions per second
on a global scale. It will integrate seamlessly into existing banking/payment
infrastructure and will comply with existing E-Money regulation.

Summary
To fully exploit and take advantage of blockchain-based technologies in the
payment sector, a platform that integrates with traditional local and international
payment rails while providing easy access to blockchains and digital wallets is
required. Such a platform should be properly regulated and compliant.
Having built all of the above, Wirex set a solid foundation for future growth
and development. The Wirex native token is another important milestone.
It allows us to offer benefits to our customers, increase Wirex’s capabilities
and share our achievements with the entire blockchain community.
