Explanation of Roadmap 2018 Updates
As we have recently updated our HomeBlockCoin roadmap, we would like to take a closer look at what are the
most important and progressive milestones of the 2018 roadmap.
This statement details the 3 „highlights” in the first two quarters of this year.

HomeBlockCoin Cloud-Mining Solutions
Objective:
HomeBlockCoin Mining by Burst
Become one of the largest hard disk cloud miners through Burst mining.
Burst is mined by providing hard disk space. Basically, therefore, everyone who has free memory space can
mine the coin from home.
Through the HBC cloud mining solutions with burst mining, HBC finds one of the first applications. It will be
possible to purchase mining power, or in this case memory space directly from the back office.This memory
space can be paid only with HomeBlockCoin.
By purchasing „mining power“ in the back office, real Terabytes in form of Hardware are purchased. These are
supplied and plotted in a hall with maintenance, insurance, cooling and power supply. Every TB of mining
Power is plotted and ready to mine. In its own Burst mining pool, it is possible for every user to view the
memory space and the obtained blocks. Thus, the control over any mining revenue is available at all times.
Contracts have already been signed with major disk manufacturers. In this collaboration, the implementation
of the largest hard disk cloud mining is now implemented.
Advantage for the costumer:
In addition to HomeBlockCoin, every HBC member who uses the HBC Cloud mining solutions also earns Burst
Coin through mining. HomeBlockCoin offers a real-world product and finds great additional usage. At this time,
a provisioning is planned for every purchase of HBC cloud mining. Thus, a further earning opportunity is
created and the benefit of each HBC is supported.

HomeBlockCoin Bundles (Node) Concept
Objective:
Deploy a node system by holding an exact amount of HomeBlockCoins (one node/bundle) which generates
additional profits to lending/mining/staking.
With HomeBlockCoin Bundles we introduce a completely new node System which you can participate from
HBCs Transaction and Internal Exchange fees.
A HomeBlockCoin Bundle will require 500, 2,500 or 10,000 HomeBlockCoins which is locked for 30, 60 or 90
days. At the point the HBC Bundles system is released an upgraded interface in your back office will make
„bundle“ your HBC possible as soon as the amount of coins you hold qualify for these rewards. Users lock-in
their coins 500, 2.500, or 10,000 HBC and in return they will receive interest based on the number of units
frozen. The rewards depend on how much transactions are on the HBC Network and how much trading volume
are on the internal HBC exchange.
Advantage for the Costumer:
With the HomeBlockCoin Bundles (node) concept a further income opportunity is created and HBC finds
another way of use. With this option, the community will be reimbursed for the transaction fee and the fees
incurred by an Exchange.

Online Shop Payment Solutions
Objective:
The goal of Online Shop Payment Solutions is to create the first real payment connection for HomeBlockCoin.
Through this external connection, it is possible to integrate HomeBlockCoin as means of payment for the first
online shops. Now, for the first time in 2018, it will be possible to buy physical and digital products in online
stores and use HBC for real transactions.
Advantage for the costumer:
This online shop solution enables the customer to find a real benefit for their HomeBlockCoins. An exchange
point that changes real goods for HBC is created and the benefits and value stabilization of HomeBlockCoin is
supported.

Consideration

HomeBlockCoin by yourself. Please do not believe in other people or ask someone else to invest for you to
prevent muggers to deceive and impersonate HomeBlockCoin.
All investors are requiered to register directly on HomeBlockCoin website and invest by their money only.
