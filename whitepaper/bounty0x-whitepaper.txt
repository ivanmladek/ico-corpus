Abstract
We believe in a tokenized economy. Bounty0x.io will advance the vision of a
decentralized future and streamline bounty management by accomplishing three keys tasks:
(1) enabling anyone to host and manage bounty campaigns by posting bounties, and
disbursing payments to bounty hunters (2) enabling users seeking to participate in a bounty
program (hereinafter “bounty hunters”) to search bounty listings, participate in said bounties,
complete bounty tasks, and receive rewards and payments (3) automating the process of
reviewing bounty task submissions by enabling third party reviewers (hereinafter “bounty
sheriffs”) to ensure the accuracy and quality of bounty submissions by staking BNTY tokens
in exchange for value.
Companies utilize bounties as a means to recruit community members to complete
tasks in exchange for receiving a reward. Currently, the options available for teams seeking
to have tasks accomplished is inefficient. In order to have bounties completed, startup teams
are often required to spend time posting on forums or chat groups in order to advertise what
bounties are available to potential bounty hunters. It can be difficult for users to locate which
(companies/organizations/ICOs/entities) are accepting bounties and which have already
been completed.
Additionally, ensuring that all bounties have been completed accurately, and that the
user who completes the bounty receives payment to the correct address can be difficult. The
entire process is inefficient and time consuming. Because the process is inefficient, it limits
the scope and breadth of bounties that bounty hosts can outsource to bounty hunters.
Bounty0x.io will enable companies and startups to accomplish more tasks thanks to the help
of thousands of bounty hunters who contributed to the project.
Bounty0x.io will be a one stop shop for Bounty Hosts and Bounty Hunters to
collaborate in a mutually beneficial arrangement. Teams will be able to easily and efficiently
disburse payments to contributors who have fulfilled the requirements of any bounties using
their own native token. A verification process and reputation system will be built in to verify
that each task was successfully completed before payment is disbursed.

Introduction
In the ‘Old West’, the government used to post bounties for the capture of dangerous
criminals. Nowadays, a bounty program is an offer made by many startups, companies, and
entities which enables individuals to receive recognition and compensation for performing
highly specific tasks. Bounties are often used in the context of online marketing, consulting,
research, journalism and software development.
Bounty programs are also a frequently used tool used by ICO startups. In 2017
blockchain entrepreneurs raised more funds through initial coin offerings (ICOs) than
through traditional venture capital investments. So far in 2017, blockchain entrepreneurs
have raised over $2 bln through ICO offerings and even exceeded the funds raised through
VC’s in the months of June and July. This will only continue to grow in 2018 and beyond.
Startups are accordingly relying even more on bounty programs in conjunction with
upcoming ICO's to accomplish pre-ico tasks.
Bounty0x was conceived as a ​district0x proposal and was selected among the top
four district proposal. The proposal is ​currently being voted upon in order to become the next
district which will be built on the district0x platform. The Bounty0x network will eventually
migrate over to the district0x network platform when the d0x infra protocol is ready, and at
such time enable DNT token holders to stake their DNT in order to take part in Bounty0x
platform governance.
Bounty campaigns nowadays are highly centralized, which makes them susceptible
to fraud, highly inefficient and limited in scope. Bounty0x solves these problems with a
decentralized bounty hunting network and an automated review system for submissions.

4/25

Vision
In the short term, we will develop a trustless platform where bounty hunters will be
able to receive payment in tokens in exchange for completing bounty tasks for ICO startups.
With hundreds of new blockchain startups being formed and holding ICO’s every month, this
is already a very significant market. ​Our ultimate goal is to increase the efficiency of
industries that would benefit from a decentralized workforce and bounty-oriented reward
model.
1. Online marketing
Banner advertisements are losing effectivity due to a fenomena known as “Ad
Blindness”. On the other hand, influencer marketing on social media and blogs is exploding
in popularity. Our platform brings influencer marketing to the crowd by allowing anyone from
anywhere, to endorse brands through our marketing bounties.
2. Software development
Bugs and security issues are a growing pain in our digital world. A small team of
developers might miss a bug that could potentially be disastrous for a company. Security
audit firms charge astronomical sums for their services and companies often want to get a
second or third opinion. Our platform enables Bounty Hosts to expose their code to
thousands of programmers that carefully analyze and review it. Bounty hunters only receive
a reward if they actually find a vulnerability.
3. Consulting
Adapting to the latest industry trends is a big challenge for global consulting firms. It
often involves extensive training of their employees and the hiring of new ones. This is an
unsustainable process in a world where industries change at an accelerating pace. We
believe that the solution to this problem is to completely decentralize the consulting industry.
On our platform, Bounty Hunters can submit improvement suggestions and solutions to
highly specialized business situations.
4. Research
Governments, Corporations and NGO’s can set bounties on the completion of certain
research oriented goals e.g. Finding a cure for breast cancer.

5/25

Case study
The following are three use case studies illustrating the shortfalls of bounty programs
as they are presently handled. Bounty0x offers a streamlined bounty management platform
which diminishes the opportunity for fraud, expands the scope of potential bounty tasks, and
enables teams to easily distribute rewards and monitor contributions.
1) For Bounty Hosts.

How startups manage submissions today using excel (pictured above).

During the Status and Bancor ICO, the two platforms each received thousands of
submissions by bounty contributors. Verifying that each bounty was completed successfully
and that individual users received their rewards was time intensive. Members of the Status
and Bancor team sorted through slack channel archives in order to identify contributors,
utilized a makeshift system comprised of post reactions, and created various spreadsheets
containing lists of contributors addresses and the amount each contributor was entitled to
receive. Naturally the process was very time consuming, and was susceptible to fraud.
Despite the efforts made by the previously mentioned companies, there were still numerous
complaints about long waiting times until the bounties were eventually reviewed and
moderated, as well as complaints of incorrect distribution of tokens once the campaign was
completed. Bounty0x offers Bounty Hosts a better alternative.
Bounty0x is not only beneficial for difficulties faced by bounty campaigns receiving
thousand of contributions, but can also be useful for smaller programs expecting to receive,
a couple hundred submissions. Even a few hundred bounty submissions can be completely
overwhelming for a small team.

6/25

2) For Bounty Hunters.

How bounty hunters find and participate in campaigns today (pictured above).

Bounty0x also solves a big pain for Bounty Hunters. Currently, it is difficult for Bounty
Hunters to find bounties that they want to participate in. Usually, Bounty Hunters find
bounties through word-of-mouth on forums. Consequently, bounty campaigns only receive a
fraction of the contributions compared to if there was a platform that startups and Bounty
Hunters could use. Also, Bounty Hunters with a track records of success are unable to gain
recognition for their prior work and command a higher price since there is no proper
reputation system in place. Genuinely good startup bounty campaigns are unable to attract
bounty campaign contributors because of difficulty locating their bounty campaigns.
At the present time, Bounty Hunters spend countless hours searching forums in order
to identify interesting campaigns. Thereafter, they must message team members and offer to
complete bounty related tasks. Moreover, the team can not be sure if there has already been
someone assigned to complete a bounty. It can be difficult to determine which tasks have
already been completed, and what tasks are available. Furthermore, team members spend
countless hours communicating individually with contributors verifying the contributions meet
the minimum job requirements and have been completed adequately.

7/25

Distinguishing Bounty0x from existing platforms.
At the moment there are no existing platforms that enable Bounty Hosts to manage
bounty programs in a decentralized and autonomous way, and Bounty Hunters to receive
trustless payment for completing bounties. As mentioned earlier, the interaction between the
Bounty Host, and the Bounty Hunter usually occurs through forums or email. All organization
of the bounty campaign requires Bounty Hosts to maintain detailed excel spreadsheets with
payment addresses, and lists of bounty submissions. This has proven to be highly inefficient
and time consuming. More importantly, it limits the potential scope of the bounty campaign.
As it requires companies to hire dedicated bounty campaign managers to organize and
verify all bounty submissions. Consequently none of the existing platforms solve these
problems.
We have extensively researched whether any of the freelancing sites like Ethlance or
UpWork could potentially solve the problems that are unique to bounty campaigns. At the
moment Bounty Hosts and Bounty Hunters do not utilize freelancing sites in order to manage
bounty campaigns because they are not specialized enough to meet the demands of bounty
campaigns. Some will draw comparisons between Bounty0x, Bug Crowd and Hackerone
and other sites. The latter are focused on cyber security issues whereas Bounty0x offers
support for broader bounty targets and none provide a decentralized verification mechanism.
Our conclusion is that current freelance and job platforms are ​not ideally suited to
take on the task of bounty management ​for 4 main reasons​:
1) Bounty task reviewing system
At present, there are no freelance job sites which enable users to perform a
reviewing service of the quality of the submissions. Bounties receive thousands of
submissions during the course of a bounty campaign, this makes them uniquely positioned
to benefit from an automated verification system.
2) Payment system
Bounty0x differentiates itself from freelancing sites by enabling Bounty Hosts to
allocate a certain percentage of their ICO tokens in such a way that they will be
automatically distributed to bounty contributors upon completion of the ICO. Currently,
freelance job platforms don’t have a structure in place that could track the work of Bounty
Hunters and later disburse payment once the tokens are transferred from the genesis
contract to an escrow account. Furthermore, with the exception of Ethlance, which is
focused on freelancers, most websites do not even support payment in ERC20 compliant
tokens. Finally, few platforms enable management of hundred or even thousands of
submissions.

8/25

3) Individual assistance
It can be very challenging for a company to decide on the mechanics behind their
bounty campaign. Some of the most common doubts are associated with the tasks that
should be offered and the amount that should be allocated to rewards. These factors vary
greatly depending on the nature of the company.
Freelance platforms today are unable to provide guidance with regard to bounty
platform management. On the other hand, at Bounty0x there will be a section of the website
dedicated to educational content to educate companies interested in holding bounty
campaigns as to best practices in a bounty campaign. If a customer needs a more
personalized assistance, we will provide a how it works section similar to Seller Central on
Amazon, and “How it works” on Upwork.
4) Advertising and marketing audience
Because of the fact that Bounty0x will be specifically built for bounty management, it
will be the go to solution for anyone holding bounty campaigns. Today multiple platforms
exist for hiring freelancers. Bounty0x is unlike any of these platforms as it is specifically
tailored towards assisting Bounty Hosts with the unique requirements associated with bounty
campaigns. At the moment, no other job site enables third party reviewers to verify that
submissions are completed appropriately allowing them to receive payment in exchange for
doing so.

9/25

Our solution - Bounty0x
At Bounty0x we are building a network enabling anyone to post bounty tasks which
Bounty Hunters will be able to accept and complete. Bounty0x makes it easier for users
seeking to complete bounties to search and accept bounties. The benefit of this approach
are twofold. First, this allows Bounty Hosts to focus exclusively on developing their product,
and second, it makes it easier for Bounty Hunters to find new campaigns to join. By using
the Bounty0x Network, companies, governments, and entities, will have access to a pool of
reputable Bounty Hunters, and a verification mechanism to ensure the tasks are performed
correctly.

Alpha platform search page (pictured above)

The ​Bounty0x Alpha​ platform launched on October 15th and already has over $750k worth
of bounties on it. Bounty Hunters can sign-up and start earning rewards. Companies or
start-ups can get in touch with us at ​contact@bounty0x.io​ to post a bounty campaign.
Start-up registration will be released in the next update.
It is important to note that the Alpha does not even scratch the surface of what Bounty0x will
ultimately become. It’s main purpose was to test the concept before raising any funds.

10/25

Meet the players
Bounty Hosts
Anyone can post bounty tasks and set a reward for the completion of each task. In
the past, in order to manage a bounty campaign, Bounty Hosts would need to verify that
users are legitimate, assign tasks to individual users, verify completion of each task,
determine the payout address of the Bounty Hunter, and eventually disburse payment and
resolve potential mistakes which occur throughout the process.
With Bounty0x, companies, entities or governments simply sign-up, setup a
campaign, post a new bounty listing which indicates the requirements of the bounty and
bounty details and payouts. Thereafter, users search and accept bounties they seek to
complete. Upon completion, the bounty is thereafter flagged for review by a Bounty Sheriff,
who confirms the accuracy of the bounty task.
Bounty Hosts may elect to post and hold campaigns for a variety of bounty tasks. The
bounty completion verification mechanism may vary depending on the type of bounty task
that the startup seeks to complete. For example, some bounties may be verified through an
automated process, other bounties may be verified solely through the Bounty Host, and still
other bounties may be verified through the use of Bounty Sheriffs .

Bounty Hunters
Bounty Hunters can directly participate in any bounty they wish. Following a search of
available bounties, Bounty Hunters can accept bounties, and submit their work directly
through the platform. Bounty Hunters will find a reward counter in their profile. Bounty
Hunters need to manually withdraw the tokens from their Bounty0x dashboard to a
compatible wallet.
Bounty0x has a built-in reputation system to enable startups to use our platform to
identify potential candidates to hire. Every time a Bounty Hunter receives tokens for his
work, Bounty0x will convert those coins into their ETH value and rank users based on that
figure. Overtime Bounty Hunters will build up a trustworthy reputation for completing work,
and will have incentive to provide quality work in order to maintain their reputation, and to
continue completing tasks on the Bounty0x Network in order to build their reputation score
for future bounties. The network will also have a leaderboard ranking Bounty Hunters for
each bounty category.

11/25

Bounty Sheriffs
Bounty0x will support an option enabling Bounty Hosts to verify that bounty campaign
tasks have been successfully completed prior to disbursing payment. This review role will be
filled by third party reviewers called “Bounty Sheriffs”. Anyone will be able to purchase BNTY
tokens on the open market, and stake their BNTY coins in order to earn a badge and
become a Bounty Sheriff who is authorized to verify that bounty submissions are completed
correctly.
Staking BNTY and performing correct reviews entitles users to a payment. If a
Bounty Sheriff performs an incorrect review, a portion of his staked BNTY will be burned.

Bounty types
Bounty0x seeks to become a one stop platform for Bounty Hosts seeking to launch
their bounty campaign. In order to achieve this, we will be supporting popular bounty tasks.
There will be a feedback form enabling users to submit suggestions for additions of new
bounty tasks.
On the Bounty0x network, bounties are sorted according to the following three
categories: Simple bounties, Sheriff bounties and Super bounties. This categorization
system allows Bounty0x to expand into any imaginable bounty task.

1. Simple bounties
Bounties belonging to this category will be automatically checked by Bounty0x
algorithms and API’s. No humans are involved in the reviewing process. This approach
works for tasks that are of a quantitative nature.

2. Sheriff bounties
Bounties belonging to this category will be reviewed by Bounty Sheriffs on our
platform. These users receive a reward for performing correct verifications. This approach
will be used for bounty tasks that are of a qualitative nature, but that can be reviewed by
non-team members of the startup.

12/25

3. Super bounties
Private bounties are tasks where the project owner or admin decides whether a
submission will be accepted or not. This approach will be used for highly technical or
subjective bounty tasks.

BNTY Token
500mln Bounty0x tokens (BNTY) will be minted in the genesis contract. BNTY will be
distributed during a pre-sale, and a main sale (details of each below). The BNTY token is a
Utility token, and has 4 primary purposes on the platform:
1. BNTY will be used by Bounty Hunters (Q4 2018)
-

How: Bounty Hunters need to stake BNTY to participate in ‘Super Bounties’. If a
Super Bounty submission is rejected, like for example a bug report, the Bounty
Hunter will lose a portion of his staked tokens. Bounty Hunters also need to stake
BNTY for opening a dispute, if a Hunter thinks that a Bounty Sheriff made an
incorrect verification, he can open a dispute which will be reviewed by a Bounty0x
admin. If the dispute is not legitimate, staked BNTY are burned.

-

Why: ‘Super Bounties’ are checked manually by a team member of the startup.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that all submissions are of a superior quality to
avoid wasting the individual’s time. By incorporating a staking mechanism for
disputes, Bounty Hunters are incentivized to only open legitimate ones.
2. BNTY will be used by Bounty Sheriffs (Q2 2018)

-

How: Bounty Sheriffs will be able to stake BNTY to review bounties. If a verification is
performed incorrectly, staked BNTY are burned. If performed correctly, they will gain
additional BNTY.

-

Why: As a quality control mechanism. Bounty Sheriffs are financially incentivized to
perform reviews correctly.
3. BNTY will be used by Bounty Hosts (Q3 2018)

-

How: Bounty Hosts need to purchase BNTY which will be used for rewarding Bounty
Sheriffs. Bounty Hosts can also stake BNTY for upgrading their bounty listing to a
“trusted” one.

-

Why:​ Incentivizes Bounty Hosts to only post qualitative bounties.
13/25

BNTY token distribution values
The launch of Bounty0x and the corresponding token creation process are organized
around smart contracts running on Ethereum. The BNTY genesis contract will mint a total of
500mln BNTY tokens. The main contribution period will last two weeks. Based on the
feedback we have received from the community, we have determined that the crowdsale
structure should be based on the following principles.

Distribution
We are seeking to maximize contribution distribution. We are also seeking to enable
anyone who wants to contribute to the token during the crowdsale the opportunity to do so.
In the spirit of decentralization, we want to avoid centralization of the coin by preventing a
few people holding all the tokens. We aim to achieve this through a variety of strategies
ranging from the token sale structure, to the use of bounty campaigns, and community
development incentives. We also want to prevent the token sale from selling out prematurely
before everyone who wants to participate is able to do so.

Coin Price
The price of BNTY is fixed. Each BNTY will cost $0.0165 during the contribution
period and $0.0132 during the pre-sale. That’s a 20 percent discount for pre-sale
contributors.

Modules
Bounty0x will enable Bounty Hosts to incorporate bounty campaigns with external
platforms such as GitHub for bounty tasks that would benefit from this integration, like for
example security audits.

District0x - Bounty0x Decentralized Governance
Bounty0x will eventually operate as a completely decentralized DAO following the
implementation of the district0x district creation platform and d0xInfra protocol. The
Bounty0x platform will transition into a district on the district0x platform. Staking DNT in the
Bounty0x district will entitle users to a quarterly profit distribution and to participate in the
governance of the platform through the associated Aragon entity.
The bounty0x district will be the primary location for managing and governing the
Bounty0x platform. We believe that bounty hunters should be able to assist in the
governance of Bounty0x, since changes made to our platform have a direct impact on them.
Bounty0x district stakers will be able to utilize the corresponding ​Aragon ​entity to participate
in the bounty network governance. Turning our platform into a district is a key milestone on
our roadmap. In the meantime our district proposal can be voted on ​here​.

Contribution Period Risks
BNTY Bounty0x coins are not securities, equity or profit-share mechanisms. Coin sale
members should understand the risk of purchasing coins and read this Bounyt0x whitepaper
in full before participating. Bounty0x staff are available to answer any questions at
https://bounty0x.io live-chat and contact@bounty0x.io Technical Risk: Bounty0x BNTY
contract is based on the ERC20 standard. All efforts will be made to ensure the contract is
free from technical bugs but once submitted to the Ethereum network, it is unable to be
modified. Contributors should be intimate with Ethereum and blockchain technology to
understand these risks. Contributors should understand the risks around private key storage
and transmission. Hackers and criminal intervention: The Bounty0x contract address will be
made available via https://bounty0x.io. History has shown that sometimes criminal elements
attempt to take over computer and email servers in order to trick people into sending money
to the wrong address. This may include social engineering. Bounty0x will implement all best
practice security measures to thwart potential attacks. Contributors must make all
reasonable efforts and follow all instructions from Bounty0x to ensure they are dealing with
the correct contract address. Contributors should not use any smart-contract address
published outside of https://bounty0x.io as it could be a scammer pretending to represent
Bounty0x. Buyers should follow all security best-practice procedures as directed by
Bounty0x. Tax & Regulatory risk The coin buyer must conduct their own due diligence to
ensure that the jurisdiction they operate in complies with all local laws regarding
cryptocurrency, tax, securities and other regulations. The Bounty0x contribution period may
in the future be subject to local regulation. Disclaimer

Viewing the materials available hereafter may not be lawful in certain jurisdictions. In other
jurisdictions, only certain categories of person may be allowed to view such materials. Any
person who wishes to view these materials must first satisfy themselves that they are not
subject to any local requirements that prohibit or restrict them from doing so. In particular,
unless otherwise determined by the Company and permitted by applicable law and
regulation, it is not intended that any offering of the tokens mentioned in such materials (the
"Tokens") by the Company should be made, or any documentation be sent, directly or
indirectly, in or into, Australia, the British Virgin Islands, Canada, Japan, Jersey, New
Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, or the United States (each, a “Restricted
Territory”) and nor should it be accessed by any person who is a national citizen or resident
of a Restricted Territory, including corporations, partnerships, or other entities created or
organised in any such jurisdiction.
The materials are for information purposes only and do not constitute or form a part of any
offer or invitation to sell or issue, or solicitation of any offer, to purchase or subscribe for the
Tokens in any jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which such offers or sales are unlawful prior to
registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. In particular,
the Tokens have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), and may not be offered, sold, resold, pledged, taken up,
exercised, renounced, transferred or delivered, directly or indirectly, in or into the United
States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Securities will not be registered under
22/25

applicable securities laws of any state, province, territory, county or jurisdiction of a
Restricted Territory.
Accordingly, unless an exemption under the relevant securities law is applicable, the Tokens
may not be offered, sold, pledged, taken up, exercised, resold, renounced, transferred or
delivered, directly or indirectly, in or into a Restricted Territory where to do so would
constitute a violation of the relevant laws of, or require registration thereof in, such
jurisdiction.
There will be no public offering of the Tokens in the United States. If you are not permitted to
view materials on this webpage or are in any doubt as to whether you are permitted to view
these materials, please exit this webpage.
