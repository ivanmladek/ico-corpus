Publica - The 1 st Protocol
For Decentralised Publishing

Publica’s protocol for decentralised publishing on the
blockchain is a reinvention of Gutenberg’s press for
the 21st century. Even if it becomes a de-facto largest
publisher, it maintains no inventory. Nonetheless, the
books that it publishes can last forever, both for the
readers who own them and for the world.
A

book’s

access

keys

are

represented

by

an

Ethereum ERC20 token that Publica calls the BOOK
Token, unique to each literary work. A BOOK Token
balance is mapped to the public key of its owner in

Literary works will be stored in decentralised immutable
storage built on top of continuously advancing solutions
for decentralised immutable storage. Publica protocol is
experimenting with solutions offered by IPFS, Storj, Sia,
MaidSafe and upcoming Filecoin, EOS and eventually,
Swarm for Ethereum.
Publica’s protocol is powered by its currency called
Pebbles (PBL ticker, an ERC20 token), issued in a fixed
and locked supply.
The protocol’s application layer of customer-facing apps
will be built by the protocol team as white label, open
source tools available to the community for branding,
extending, and embedding into other applications, to
enhance current ink-readers and e-readers with a walletmodule supporting Publica’s protocol.

Why do authors support Publica’s protocol?

1. Immediate direct payments, buyer to seller, reader to
author.
2. Transparent sales ledgers — no audits required.
3. Expanded range of business models. Crowdfunding,
online storefronts, scholastic and scientific institutions,
patronage, serialization, collaborations, peer reviews,
pay-as-you-read, public libraries, non-profits, etc.
4. Authors and their agents are as creative in their
business models as in their books but are traditionally
bound by a controversial “license” and EULA. 1 Publica’s
protocol replaces them with an access key that frees
authors to discover new business models. The Publica
protocol also supports time-limited BOOK Tokens
that can

be

used

for

similar

limited-ownership

business models.

1

License agreements are how centralized publishers like Amazon, Rakuten/Kobo, etc., control ebooks. License agreements

can be optionally used alongside the Publica protocol but they’re not part of the protocol. License agreement
violations can’t be enforced by Publica — BOOK tokens can’t be remotely erased from their owner’s wallet —

but

agreements can be enforced by courts and legal jurisdictions in the normal manner. The Publica protocol supports timelimited BOOK tokens that can be used for similar limited-ownership business models.

5

Crowdfunding? Consider an ICO for a book, where
the author sells BOOK Tokens as access keys to fund a
book

that

will

be

written,

edited,

proofread,

illustrated and packaged with the proceeds of the token
sale.
5. Freedom to market, publicize, and sell to the whole
world, without geographic restrictions, without fear
of chargebacks, errors, or cheating. Sell in proprietary
online storefronts too.
6. Strong resistance to censorship and tampering by
the immutability virtue of blockchain-based storage.
Finished works are automatically dated and fixed, no
matter how many editions or variations are sold. 2
7. Direct control over what to publish, at what price, in
an ever-more-decentralised world of global ecommerce.
8. Long-lived ebooks, never abandoned by a publisher’s
fortunes or licensing model. The Publica protocol
continues working even if Publica-the-organization
goes away.

2

Copyright rules require a creative work to be dated in a fixed and tangible form of expression.

What does the Publica protocol offer readers?

1. Lower prices. Payments go directly to the author’s
wallet with no intermediaries required.
2.

Irrevocable

ownership.

Your

ownership

of

a

BOOK Token linking you to decentralised storage is
immutable.
3. Secondary markets and persistence. Sell or give book
keys as you wish. Ebooks on decentralised storage don’t
disappear.
4. “Radical inclusion.” Authors can include their readers
in crowdfunding and other business models that provide
the capital to produce great book projects.
5. Lower-priced paper books. The protocol supports
paper books with a participating print-on-demand
partner. Print-on-demand where the reader is, no
shipping. Eliminate waste in traditional large print runs
and warehousing.

Protocol benefits for some publishers

Some publishers benefit from the status quo. Others
benefit from innovation.
Protocol benefits for some publishers:
1. Direct control of publications-in-process, including
review

copies,

editorial

and

illustration

copies,

pseudonymised peer review copies, translation copies,
etc., and their ecommerce.
2. Direct, discrete, transparent transactions including
wholesale, print-on-demand, new kinds of online
storefronts, etc. Business secrets like negotiated prices
aren’t revealed.
3. Lower cost persistent, decentralised storage.
4. Business models that don’t require End User License
Agreements (EULA). Tokens aren’t book copies subject
to first-use and exhaustion rules.

9

Incentives for early contributors into protocol

1. Own a piece of the protocol. The Publica protocol
requires Pebbles (PBL tokens) in a fixed supply. Pebbles
are the sole medium of exchange in the Publica workflow.
2. Be an important part of tokenizing access and
decentralizing storage of the world’s information that’s
suitable for ecommerce. Wallet-to-wallet, starting with
how big ideas and deep knowledge are shared - in books.

10

Benefits for classic liberalism and humanism

1. Independence. The Publica protocol is open source,
decentralised and immutable. Smart contracts, once set
on a blockchain, work without third-party mediation.
2. Democratizing value and trust. Book buyers vote only
with their own wallets. A radical inclusion of buyers and
sellers, with their incentives aligned, mediated only by
blockchains.
3. Spreading books to the under-booked, and the
underbanked, around the globe.

Protocol components and App layer

Publisher app-wallet for authors
• Enables deployment of book-specific smart contract
containing the terms of sale for an access key to the
book, volume discounts, the total supply of access
keys (BOOK Tokens) and other commercial features.
• Enables submitting literary work to the decentralised
immutable storage and linking it to the deployed
smart contract.
• Cryptocurrency and token wallet functionality to
pay for the services of the protocol and get paid in
protocol currency
Smart contract for PBL tokens - protocol currency
• Standard ERC20 contracts containing mapping of PBL
owners with their balances and standard Approve
function to allow interaction with other contracts
within the protocol.

E-reader app-wallet for readers
• Enables discovery and purchase of the protocol
currency, and any literary works published with
the Publica protocol
• Permits rendering of downloaded content in e-reader
•

Enables storage and transfer of PBL and BOOK
Tokens (wallet)

• In-app authorization and decryption, or sending
requests to a remote node signed with a private key.

15

Decentralised storage
• Stores a literary work in a zero-knowledge distributed,
decentralised, immutable storage.
• Preferably supports affordable re-encryption or
access layer logic.
• Access, metered-streaming, and download operations.
Wallet Module for existing ink-reader
and e-reader apps
• Wallet module to introduce private key and signing
of requests to a conventional reader.
• Connector to a decentralised storage to request and
download content that is linked to your BOOK
Tokens, stored in your wallet and sent to the
application for on-screen rendering.
Customer-facing apps will be built as white label, open
source tools, available to the community for branding,
extending and embedding into other applications such as
enhancing current ink-readers and e-readers with a wallet
module supporting the Publica protocol.

Update the library of the books available
to read (matching your BOOK Tokens).
In the simplest form, parsing smart contracts.

Select a book you want to access
that is not available in your local storage.

The application verifies that your private key
matches a public key stored in the book’s
BOOK Token smart contract, and grant
access to the storage.

Content is read from storage such as a mounted
drive or collected from immutable shards.
Ideally, storage has access logic layer that can
verify request signing with a private key.
