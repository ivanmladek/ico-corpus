OVERVIEW
About EventChain
EventChainTM is an advanced decentralized blockchain token network that powers a unique
smart contract ticketing system (SmartTickets™). EventChain solves many of the problems with
current event ticketing systems available today while providing the additional benefits of using
a blockchain as the foundation. Both the EventChain system and its tokens (“EVC Tokens”)
encourages everyone in the ecosystem, including all stake holders such as event managers of
sport and concert events, party organizers, social clubs and ticket purchasers to sell or buy
SmartTickets using EVC Tokens and other traditional payment methods.
EventChain will provide a simple user interface for event managers to manage and execute
SmartTicket sales globally for small to large events supported by the underlying blockchain
technology and EVC Tokens, empowering a true peer-to-peer network for buying and selling
tickets to events.
EventChain has the opportunity of becoming the first real world blockchain application that is
widely adopted by the general public without any need to understand the underlying
distributed technology.

Decentralization
EventChain will develop a decentralized modular SmartTicketing network upheld by a peer-topeer platform. Centralized event ticketing infrastructure is vulnerable to malicious attacks and
single points of failure. By selling SmartTickets and processing transactions on the decentralized
EventChain token network built on the Ethereum blockchain, everything is secured by 256-bit
cryptography that will protect from fraud and prevent malicious attacks against the network.

Mission Statement
EventChain’s mission is to:
1. Solve a long list of issues for event ticket sales by providing the advanced functionality
of SmartTickets using EVC Tokens. See following sections for details.
2. Provide holders of EVC Tokens with benefits such as early bird tickets, priority seating
and discounted pricing.
3. Foster the utilization of EVC Tokens inside the EventChain SmartTicketing platform.
Although EventChain will utilize various payment gateways that accept EVC Tokens to
purchase products and services from over 205,000 vendors across 182 different
countries, all significant ticketing benefits will be available only to those using EVC
Tokens.

Interaction with the Ethereum Blockchain
EventChain's Ethereum blockchain backbone provides the necessary framework to implement
scalable, fast, and cryptographically secure SmartTicket transactions. The system will utilize
smart contracts as the underlying technology for the creation of SmartTickets, harnessing the
functional power of EVC Tokens as a proof-of-purchase. EventChain’s ticketing platform can
operate with fiat currencies; however, the SmartTicket utility is optimized when using EVC
Tokens.
SmartTickets act as a proof-of-purchase for any event, containing enforceable pre-set
conditions programmed into the ticket’s underlying smart contract code using Ethereum’s
native programming language Solidity. These conditions can be tailored to store immutable
information for any type of event imaginable.
Implementing EventChain’s blockchain token network for event management presents the
opportunity to upgrade the current event ticketing industry to faster transactions, indisputable
ticket vouchers, transparency from event hosts and fully programmable functions using EVC
Tokens.
The Ethereum network provides a decentralized, Turing complete, virtual machine capable of
running a multitude of dapps, decentralized applications, including smart contracts, token
systems, distributed file and data storage and the creation of decentralization autonomous
organizations (DAOs). Anyone can implement smart contracts to solve any computational
problem, implementing logic from other programming languages and translating it to
enforceable contracts in Solidity [1]. Ethereum is the ideal foundation for EventChain’s
SmartTicket system.

Payment Processing
Event goers can purchase SmartTickets directly on the EventChain network through a variety of
payment gateways.
Ideally, EVC Tokens will be used primarily for SmartTicket purchase but other ERC20 tokens
including Ether (“ETH”) may also be accepted. Event managers will also have the capability to
accept fiat currency for SmartTicket sales through payment gateways.
EventChain will utilize various payment gateways that accept EVC Tokens to purchase products
and services from over 205,000 vendors across 182 different countries. Payment gateways
convert the EVC Tokens in real time to the vendor’s currency.

SmartTicket Computational Costs
Blockchain costs are limited to a variable “gas” fee on the Ethereum network. Gas exists only
inside of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is calculated based on the amount of work being
performed inside of a transaction. For larger and more complex SmartTickets (in terms of the
amount of work needed to compute the programming in the underlying smart contract) the gas
fee will be higher. The Ethereum blockchain currently averages only a few cents per
transaction, significantly lower than credit-card and bitcoin transactions.

Centralized Event Industry
The major event ticketing companies today run a billion dollar industry in a monopolistic
fashion. The majority of the ticket sales are facilitated by Ticketmaster, consistently driving
prices higher than the original ticket price and forcing ticket purchasers to abide by their rules
while offering no available alternatives. The current business practices encapsulate a capitalist
mentality that adds little value to the event experience, yet hoards a disproportionate share of
the profits.
Countless numbers of event goers have waited for tickets to go on sale, only to have them soldout nearly instantly by scalpers or bots which resell them for outrageous mark-up prices, on top
of the already ridiculous service charges. Ticket companies even sell directly on the secondary
market, shifting the profits from scalpers back to themselves and extorting event goers instead
of addressing and fixing the problem.
Many artists have attempted to wage wars with ticket service provider giants in the past, only
to fold. With the arrival of EventChain, we are putting the power back in the hands of event
goers by adding a level of transparency to event ticketing that rivals current big business event
management options.
Three of the biggest companies in the centralized event-ticketing industry are:

EventBrite
Eventbrite charges a service fee of 3.5% and $0.60 per ticket sold, plus another 2.5% of the
ticket price for processing payments, all in US dollars. In other currencies, the fees are up to 8%
per transaction [2]. While these charges are typically less than that of Ticketmaster’s infamous
“convenience” fee, they are still unnecessarily high. Eventbrite’s centralized platform hosts
around 2 million events per year and processes an average of 4 million tickets each week.

Page 6

Ticketmaster/Live Nation
Ticketmaster’s current monopolistic domination of the ticketing industry produced $8.3 Billion
in revenue in 2016 [3], with the majority coming from convenience fees, processing fees and
transaction fees. In many cases, these “convenience” fees are unavoidable and there is no
alternative because Ticketmaster prohibits alternative purchasing methods.

StubHub
StubHub is owned by eBay and went from providing a small service to buy and sell tickets for
events on the resale-market, to running an international ticketing marketplace. They take a
commission fee from each ticket purchase. StubHub’s fourth quarter gross merchandising
volume was $1.24 billion in 2016 and has grown 20-30% year-over-year [4].

TICKET INDUSTRY ISSUES ADDRESSED
EventChain will provide solutions for the following issues in the event ticketing industry:

Ticket Issues
•

Counterfeit tickets are created and sold for events.
o A finite amount of immutable SmartTickets will be available for each event and
are tied to an event’s smart contract. Each SmartTicket has a unique nonce, or
unique sequence number that makes it impossible to be sold multiple times or
counterfeited on the network. Proof of ownership can be verified through the
Ethereum blockchain by implementing zero-knowledge proofs whereby a
purchaser can prove ownership of their ticket without revealing any information
besides the fact the ticket is theirs.

•

Tickets are often hard to resell with undeniable proof that the ticket is an authentic
original ticket.
o EventChain can seamlessly transmit tickets through the blockchain to anyone for
gifting or reselling. SmartTickets have the ability to maintain data in the form of
smart contract code and can be interpreted through the EventChain Oracle, so if
a SmartTicket is resold all of the original ticket information is still embedded on
EventChain’s framework.

Resale Issues
•

Allegations of event ticket vendors and resellers scalping their own tickets and then
reselling them for as much as a 200% mark-up on their own subsidiary platforms are not
uncommon.
o SmartTickets are fully programmable, enabling smart contract code that can peg
tickets at a permanent price, designate a maximum markup value, or attribute
any other individual or group ticket pricing variables on both the primary and
secondary markets.
o To prevent massive ticket purchases from scalpers, event ticket distribution
options can be tailored with any custom range on the amount of tickets available
to single users or groups, and optional constraints that allow for alternative
distribution methods.

•

Ticket scalpers deceive purchasers into buying re-sale VIP tickets at outrageous prices,
but do not qualify them for VIP features because the tickets are VIP ineligible under resale terms.

Page 8

o EventChain will have an integrated ticket resale reputation system, allowing
event ticket vendors and resellers to build and grow their reputation as they sell
SmartTickets. Scalpers will be clearly identified by their SmartTicket reputation.

Other Issues
•

Pre-sale ticket offerings are often not transparent.
o Using the Ethereum blockchain as a foundation brings a higher level of
transaction accountability, scalability and fungibility to the event ticketing
industry than any existing centralized ticketing architecture available. The
EventChain network on the blockchain brings complete transparency to all
parties involved.

•

Event ticket services opt-in ticket purchasers into unnecessary subscriptions to media
and marketing material in a deceptive manner during the ticket purchasing process.
o Where EventChain will not lend themselves to deceptive tactics, SmartTickets
underlying smart contract code is fully programmable and SmartTickets could be
created in a fully transparent manner to incorporate add-ons like food and drink,
parking, 50/50 draws, merchandise credit and any combination of products or
services.

Website Issues
•

Large volumes of ticket purchasers can simultaneously flood an event ticket sales
website when tickets are released and often overload and crash a ticket system.
o Because EventChain’s transaction framework is decentralized, the purchasing of
tickets will not be limited to EventChain’s website and mobile applications.
EventChain will develop a ticket purchasing interface that can be distributed on
an unlimited number of websites, all selling tickets through a plugin, dispersing
traffic from a centralized server, avoiding potential crashes and allowing
significantly more people to buy tickets simultaneously.

•

Event ticket services have been affected by DDoS attacks against their Domain Name
Servers, crashing their websites at the time of ticket purchasing.
o The EventChain distributed platform will pull information from the Ethereum
blockchain and verify it through validating nodes distributed globally.
Distribution protects the network by incentivizing positive behavior and
eliminating single points of attack.

EVENTCHAIN FEATURES
EventChain Oracle
EventChain’s Oracle will be set-up to push and pull data from smart contracts to alleviate
computational stress from the Ethereum Virtual Machine and will communicate through an
integrated EventChain plugin, distributable across the web for access to ticket purchases and
interaction with the SmartTickets system. [6]

Data Analysis
SmartTicket meta-data about event related information can be used for statistical analysis. For
example, event creators can forecast future ticket sales using variables like the quantity of
SmartTickets sold for each event, how many were initially available and how quickly they sold
and at what prices. This information is recorded in real-time so the amount of SmartTickets
remaining to upcoming public events is transparent for everyone to see.

Forwarding Contracts
When an RSVP deposit or partial payment for an event is needed, EventChain will utilize
“forwarding smart contracts” where transactions can be initialized and the terms are
guaranteed by the SmartTicket system, enforceable until the event is completed or whenever
the custom timestamp expires.

SmartTicket Digital Collection
Each SmartTicket purchaser will have access to a permanent record of which events they
attended based on their transaction history displayed through the EventChain transaction
framework on the EventChain Oracle, creating a digital collection of ticket stubs and a literal
“chain of events” to recollect memories over and to share with friends and family or on social
media.
These extra features incentivize the adoption of the SmartTicket platform. As the network
grows, so will the utility of the EVC Tokens for operation and value added features.

EVENTCHAIN TOKEN SALE
By taking part in the EventChain token sale, participants understand they are making a
contribution into a Smart Contract System for the development of the EventChain SmartTickets
platform as described in this whitepaper. The first event of the token sale is to create 84
million EVC Tokens which will be the total supply of EVC Tokens. The supply is capped and no
further EVC Tokens can ever be created. Throughout the token sale, 54.6 million EVC Tokens
will be made available to participants (65% of the total supply). Any tokens remaining at the
end of the token sale will be assigned to a locked account for a period of 3 years.
EVC Tokens are an Ethereum ERC20 token; following widely adopted token implementation
standards and containing functional properties in the Ethereum blockchain. Tokens in the
Ethereum ecosystem can represent any fungible tradable good: coins, gold certificates, IOUs,
and in this case SmartTickets [5]. Since all tokens implement some fundamental features as a
universal standard, the EVC Tokens will be compatible with any Ethereum wallet or other
application that use the same ERC20 standards.

Participation Terms
To participate in the EventChain token sale contributions will be accepted to aid in the
development of the EventChain platform. Contributions will only be accepted in ETH.
EVC Tokens will be created during the token under the terms of this Whitepaper and the EVC
Token Agreement. ETH will be exchanged for EVC Tokens as follows:
Number of EVC/ETH
Phase-1 Token Sale
1,140
Phase-2 Token Sale
920
Phase-3 Token Sale
800
When participants contribute ETH, they commit to the terms and conditions of this Whitepaper
and EventChain’s EVC Token Agreement.

Phase-1 Token Sale
Phase-1 will launch on September 13, 2017 at 4:00 pm UTC and will stay open until it is fully
subscribed or EventChain decides to close the Phase-1 offering, at which time unsubscribed
Phase-1 tokens will be allocated to the Phase-2. Upon the closing of Phase-1, ETH received
during Phase-1 will be moved to EventChain’s multisig wallet to mitigate security risks.

Page 19

Phase-2 Token Sale
The Phase-2 starts when the Phase-1 offering completes and also includes any unsubscribed
tokens from the previous Phase to give participants a second chance to acquire EVC Tokens
before the contribution period ends.

Phase-3 Token Sale
The Phase-3 starts when the Phase-2 offering completes and also includes any unsubscribed
tokens from the previous Phases to give late adopters a final chance to acquire EVC Tokens
before the contribution period ends.

advisors and corporate partners will be vaulted under the same terms as EventChain’s EVC
Tokens, with a two year vesting period and a six month cliff with a 25% release each
subsequent six month period, beginning from the date that participants receive their EVC
Tokens. Early contributors that receive EVC Tokens in lieu of wages will not be vaulted.
After a period of three years, EventChain will have the option to continue to utilize the bounty,
sponsorship and early contributor accounts or to assign any portion of the unused EVC Tokens
remaining in the three accounts to EventChain’s legal entity.

Funds Allocation – Years 1-3

EventChain will allocate the ETH as follows:
Marketing (58.4%) – EventChain’s goal is to change the global event ticketing paradigm. To
accomplish this goal, marketing is crucial and will include a global marketing initiative of social
media, internet marketing, traditional advertising, trade shows, events, sponsorships, etc.
Keynote to our success, will be bringing awareness, education and understanding of the
advantages of the SmartTicketing platform, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to a
worldwide market.
Development (18.1%) – design and development of EventChain’s SmartTicket system, Oracle
and mobile applications. See the further development considerations below for details.
Operations (12.1%) – Ethereum network, bandwidth, server, general operational overhead
expenses and office space.
Staffing (10.1%) – management, staffing and contractors.
Legal (1.3%) – incorporation, worldwide legal assistance, trademarks and international
compliance.
Development considerations:
• Develop an EventChain Database and Oracle.
• Develop EventChain iOS and Android applications.
• Hire Ethereum developers for the EVC transaction framework.
• Design and develop EventChain’s web application including UI/ UX.

ROADMAP
EventChain’s preliminary development roadmap is outlined below. While the initial design and
development has already started, EventChain is still in alpha stage. The roadmap will be subject
to strategic changes based on upcoming research and unexpected challenges in order to
achieve EventChain’s goals by its deadlines.
Token funds will be used for the development of EventChain’s SmartTicket platform including
the Oracle, mobile applications, desktop client and the transaction framework. The
Development of the modular web application API will give users the infrastructure for accessing
the framework to buy and sell SmartTickets from any device.

2017 Q4 - EventChain Professional SmartTickets
EventChain.js will integrate a SmartTicketing infrastructure which harnesses exclusive benefits
enabling functional programming inside of SmartTickets. Here are a few examples of variables
programmable into SmartTickets:
• VIP access and special amenities.
• Early ticket sales and transparent pre-sale benefits.
• Priority seating.
• Merchandise or food & beverage credits.
• Multi-day event passes & festival passes.
• Digitally signed tickets, digital albums, or artwork.

2018 Q1 - EventChain Ticket Exchange Interface
EventChain will create a ticket exchange interface to enable users to effortlessly buy, sell and
trade their authentic tickets in a matter of seconds. Users will utilize an interface that pulls
available information from the EventChain database in order to exchange SmartTickets.

2018 Q1 - EventChain Database
The EventChain database will hold relevant information of user data, event information and
ticket history. Storing excess data on the Ethereum blockchain can be very costly and
ineffective at this point. By leaving the Ethereum blockchain focusing solely on completing
transactions users will have a faster and smoother ticketing experience.

2018 Q1 - EventChain Oracle
An external Oracle will act as a communication channel between users and the Ethereum
Blockchain for implementing further functionality into SmartTickets including smart contract
functionality. Oracle based contract execution communicates to users with the Ethereum

Page 24

blockchain, verifying the validity of SmartTicket transactions in a reliable and efficient manner.
The EventChain oracle will store external personal and historical data to remove excess
computational stress from the blockchain.

2018 Q2 - EventChain Mobile Wallet Client
EventChain will develop a mobile platform for accessing the SmartTicket framework on both
iOS and Android apps. With the majority of users transitioning primarily to mobile computing,
these applications will likely be the principal source for buying and selling tickets conveniently.
With the EventChain apps, anyone will be able to purchase a ticket for an event quickly and
easily. An event goer could theoretically purchase a ticket outside of a venue and within
seconds have an immutable ticket on the blockchain for attending an event.

2018 Q2 - EventChain Desktop Wallet Client
EventChain’s standalone desktop system will enable users to access EventChain’s platform from
any computer or mobile device. It will also include an Ethereum ERC20 light wallet for holding
and managing EventChain EVC Tokens and other ERC20 tokens, checking balances and quickly
buying or selling SmartTickets with other users directly. In the case where purchasers don’t
have a mobile device, printing a ticket or writing down the public and private SmartTicket keys
on a piece of paper can prove SmartTicket ownership entering an event with no portable
technology needed.

2018 Q4 - EventChain VR SmartTickets
EventChain in partnership with the SPH VR Network will release a Virtual Reality based
VRTicketBox to purchase tickets for VR and non VR events.

COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS
What is the Total Supply of EventChain Tokens?
The total supply of EVC Tokens is a finite amount of 84,000,000. The supply is capped and no
further EVC Tokens can ever be created.

What are the Legal Considerations?
The cryptocurrency industry may be governed by the Participants’ security or exchange
commission. This Whitepaper is not a prospectus, an IPO or a solicitation for the sale of
securities. Anyone that owns ETH has the option to participate in the EventChain platform. EVC
Tokens are designed for specific functions in the EventChain platform and at no time will
EventCoin token holders have equity or a shareholding in EventChain. The value of EVC Tokens
will depend on many factors beyond the control of EventChain including how well SmartTickets
are adopted and the direction of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.
Participating in the token sale involves risks including that EVC Tokens will not be used within
the SmartTickets system and may not be exchangeable for other tokens. In no event or
circumstances will EventChain be liable or responsible for any potential damages or losses
incurred as a result of participation in EventChain.

CONCLUSION
EventChain’s project will be launched to develop a SmartTicket system for events built on a
peer-to-peer, decentralized blockchain platform where SmartTickets carry special properties
detailed in smart contracts that are not available on any traditional event management ticket
sales system. EventChain envisions an ideal world where everyone is able to attend events
through the use of a more honest, transparent and accountable event ticketing system that
provides additional benefits to event hosts and fans.
We have long searched for a convenient method of getting a ticket for anything, even minutes
before the start of an event, with little to no hassle, through a secure system accessible to the
whole world. Now with the power of EventChain and Ethereum, we will have that freedom.
