ABSTRACT
There are over $43 trillion of invoices sitting in companies' balance sheets waiting
to be paid. The Traxia ecosystem allows those short-term assets to be digitized, tokenized
and ultimately to be tradeable in a decentralized market. Traxia envisions a system where
Sellers upload their invoice, Buyers approve it with their private keys, Issuing Providers
write it into a smart contract, Liquidity Providers distribute cash liquidity, Listing providers
manage the marketplace and Investors trade the newly created digital assets. Think of it
as factoring on a blockchain. We have built a real use case using Liqease Ltd as our Listing
provider, Porsche as the Buyer, mediaman and Vok Damns as the Seller and a corporate
investor as the Liquidity Provider. Although, the Ethereum blockchain has been used in
this first case to issue the smart contract, Traxia intends to build upon the Cardano
blockchain. Traxia and LiqEase are the first investment of Cardano through their
investment arm Emurgo.

Background
On any given day around the world there are around $43 trillion of accounts
receivable or accounts payable on the books of businesses, of which, banks only finance
around $3 trillion of the total (Kemper, 2016). On a more granular level, there is a gap in
global trade finance of around $1.6 trillion, most arising from Asian companies (Asian
Development Bank, 2016). The International Chamber of Commerce refers to trade
financing as the ‘oil’ in the engine of international commerce and highlights the unmet
demand for such financing (International Chamber of Commerce, 2017).
This gap is a result of a misalignment in terms of the demand for trade related
credit and the liquidity of funds provided. It is disproportionately available to
multinationals and large corporates – the top end of the market – and consistently absent
in the SME segment (International Chamber of Commerce, 2017). Simply said, SMEs are
faced with little choice but to accept their large customer’s payment terms, no matter
how onerous they may be.
Financial Technology (FinTech) companies have come up with solutions to this
gap in global trade finance. However, in the absence of new instruments and
marketplaces that connect and bring together different trade actors, new ventures have
been unable to make a major difference, yet.
The current trade finance gap is due to the following major issues (International
Monetary Fund, 2016):
1.

Absence of trust and cooperation between banks
A continuous decline in correspondent banking relationships has lead to
an economic fragility that has not been compensated by the limited
growth in open account financing or Letters of Credit (L/C).

2.

Limited transparency due to a lack of reliable data points along the trade
finance value chain
In periods shaped by a lack of trust and transparency, trade finance
actors (private banks, export credit agencies, and regional development
banks) seem to pool their resources (World Trade Organization, 2008)
which creates difficulties in terms of obtaining comprehensive and
reliable data on those trade finance transactions.

3.

Limited Cash Liquidity in the markets and higher spreads
Large banks have been reporting on several occasions that the lack of
access to competitive funding has made them to drop out of several
finance trade operations.

4.

Bureaucracy and endless paperwork
Digitalisation in trade finance is far from being mainstream. Providers
have been promising digital letters of credit and bills of lading for years,

yet most corporates and banks still routinely exchange paper documents
(International Chamber of Commerce, 2017)
SMEs account for more than one-half of the world’s GDP and employ two-thirds
of the global workforce (World Economic Forum, 2015). The number one barrier to
growth faced by SMEs around the globe is access to financing (International Labour Office,
2015). This is not a new issue and the 2008 financial crisis only worsened the problem.
Many local retail banks, who are often the primary and only providers of SME financing,
have lost their appetite for taking on higher-risk SME loans. It is estimated that SMEs
faced in 2015 a $2 trillion USD global credit gap (World Economic Forum, 2015).

What is Trade Finance?
Global and local banks support international trade through a wide range of
products that help their customers manage their international payments and associated
risks, and provide needed working capital. The term “trade finance” is generally reserved
for bank products that are specifically linked to underlying international trade
transactions (exports or imports). As such, a working capital loan not specifically tied to
trade is generally not included in this definition. Trade finance products typically carry
short-term maturities which reflect the typical shipping times and payment terms of 30,
60 or 90 days or more. (Bank for International Settlement, 2014).
Actors

For the purpose of this whitepaper, we will solely focus on the actors of the
‘financial supply chain’. Financial intermediaries, in a broader sense, offer services that
allows an easier, faster, and cheaper execution of financial contracts between originators
and acceptors.
This comprises the gathering, for example via brokers, rating agencies, or stock
markets, of information to inform investors about borrower quality and/or risk. In general,
disintermediation in trade denotes the omission of actors within a supply chain, as e.g.
intermediary distributors or retail sellers. But, disintermediation in financing is the
substitution of the traditional bank intermediation by the means of alternative forms of
intermediation with regards to liquidity between investors and parties seeking capital.

Objects

Objects of finance include fixed assets, i.e. those assets that permanently provide
a basis for the business operations, and working capital, which is variable on a day-to-day
basis.

Production facilities, which provide the underlying logistic networks, as well as the
equipment needed for customs clearance and the transport within the network are
considered fixed assets within a supply chain. The term working capital comprises all
current assets transformable into liquid assets within one production cycle or at least
within one year. Circulating assets minus the short-term liabilities are called net working
capital. A key figure which, in this context, is suited for an examination of the cash flow is
the cash-to-cash-cycle. The latter is calculated as follows:
Cash-to-cash-cycle = average turnover period + period of receivables - period of payables
The cash-to-cash-cycle is the period of time needed for a company to transform
the cash drain resulting from paying the suppliers into cash inflow from customers again.
The cash-to-cash-cycle thus is a key figure to a dynamic and holistic treatment of the net
working capital performance both within the company and within the supply chain.
Terms

Supply chain finance has three dimensions: 1. The amount of assets to be financed
(volume of financing), 2. The duration of the financing and 3., the capital cost rate
(financing cost). Multiplying these three factors together gives the total capital cost that
a company has to generate at least for an investment to be profitable:
Capital costs = Volume * duration time * capital cost rate
The most important starting point for the optimization of the financing within a
supply chain beyond classical logistics measures is thus the capital cost rate.

Traditional Trade Finance Products
Many SMEs find it difficult to finance their production cycle, as most buyers
demand around 60 days to pay for goods from the date of delivery. In any transaction, a
seller will issue an invoice, which they account for as an account receivable. The buyer
then accounts for the invoice in their accounts payable. Accounts receivables are illiquid
assets until payment is received.
Factoring

Factoring is a type of supplier financing, in which firms sell their credit-worthy
accounts receivables at a discount (generally equal to interest rates plus service fees) and
receive immediate cash. Factoring is not a loan and there are no additional liabilities on
the firm’s balance sheet, although it provides working capital financing. In addition,
factoring is often done “without recourse”, meaning that the factor purchasing the
receivables assumes the credit risk for the buyer’s ability to pay. Factoring is a
comprehensive financial service that includes credit protection, accounts receivable
bookkeeping, collection services and financing.

Letter of Credit

One of the most common and standardized forms of bank-intermediated trade
finance is a letter of credit (L/C). L/Cs reduce payment risk by providing a framework
under which a bank makes (or guarantees) the payment to an exporter on behalf of an
importer once delivery of goods is confirmed through the presentation of the appropriate
documents.
For the most part, L/Cs represent off-balance sheet commitments, though they
may at times be associated with an extension of credit. This can occur, for example, if an
import L/C is structured to allow the importer a period of time (known as “usance”)
before repaying the bank for the payment it made on the importer’s behalf. Banks may
also help meet working capital needs by providing trade finance loans to exporters or
importers. In this case, the loan documentation is linked either to an L/C or to other forms
of documentation related to the underlying trade transaction.
Supply Chain Finance (SCF)

To avoid confusion, it should be mentioned that supply chain finance is only a
subset of trade finance and has been defined by the International Chamber of Commerce
(ICC) as ‘the use of financing and risk mitigation practices and techniques to optimize the
management of the working capital and liquidity invested in supply chain processes and
transactions. [Supply chain finance] is typically applied to open account trade and is
triggered by supply chain events. Visibility of underlying trade flows by the finance
provider(s) is a necessary component of such financing arrangements which can be
enabled by a technology platform.’
Reverse factoring is the most widely used form of financing under this category
(PwC, 2017). In contrast to traditional factoring as described above, reverse factoring is
initiated by the buyer and not by the seller. The ‘factor’ is a financial intermediary and in
more detail the entity that is providing short-term cash liquidity. The factor acts on its
own economic risk and advances a payment to the supplier and then, at the invoice
payment due date, a transaction from the buyer to the factor is initiated.

Securitization

Fi g ur e 2 – a ty pi cal s ec ur i ti zati on pr oc ess

Before discussing in detail on how blockchain may change the securitization
lifecycle, a brief high-level review of securitization (Figure 2) may be helpful.
It begins with originating and underwriting2 of loans, which are then serviced
regularly, similar to traditional bank lending. An issuer or originator pools together many
loans, places them in a bankruptcy-remote trust or special purpose vehicle (SPV), and
structures the securities. An auditing firm reviews the pool and provides a pool audit
letter and an agreed-upon procedures letter covering the pool statistics provided to
investors. Rating agencies may be asked to express an opinion on the securities’ creditworthiness by providing a credit rating.
The underwriters’ task is to raise investment capital. They work with a counsel
and the transaction sponsor to prepare an offering document. The underwriters then
price and bring the securities to market, where investors make purchases based on their
risk-reward preferences.
Trustees manage the trust entity and represent investor interests. A servicer
collects borrower repayments, pools them, and forwards them to a trustee, who allocates
distributions to security holders based on the payments waterfall defined in the
transaction documents. Rating agencies monitor the securities’ performance and update
ratings if needed. In secondary markets, investors continue to review and reassess the
securities based on performance. Broker-dealers make markets among investors trading
the securities and establish new prices.
Securitization, due its current level of complexity and the participation of
numerous intermediaries, is mostly used for larger trade deals that range in the millions

of US Dollars. Shortcomings of the current setup and efficiency gaps in the securitization
value chain are: non standardized processes and dependencies on central clearing houses
and custodians.
In this context, blockchain can have a large impact in transforming and
enhancing securitization.

Market Opportunity for a blockchain powered solution
Opportunities for blockchain solutions in the trade finance securitization process
are summarized by Deloitte in the flow below. This is the platform that Traxia will create
(Delloite, 2017):

Fi g ur e 3: Bl oc kc hai n an d S ec ur i ti zati o n - a p ossi bl e l o ok at t h e fu tur e

Step 1: As a borrower and lender agree to the terms of a loan, a new electronic asset is
created on the blockchain and time-stamped. Ownership information and other
pertinent underwriting data, such as supporting documents or Credit scores, are
attached to the loan and recorded on the blockchain. This information cannot be altered
without a new consensus between the borrower and loan owner.
Step 2: Relevant information about the loan is automatically coded into a smart contract
which governs the automated servicing of the loan. As the borrower makes or fails to
make payments, this history is added to the loan-level data and supports future servicing
decisions, such as the possible need to engage a default servicer if the borrower does not
pay. Ownership rights of the asset are also automatically immutably recorded and
timestamped.
Step 3: The sponsor/issuer pools together loans and transfers them to an SPV, which
records the transfer and the related loans on the blockchain. The ‘automatable’ portion
of the transaction’s terms, including its cash-flow model, are written in a series of smart
contracts, which the sponsor/issuer, underwriter, rating agencies, trustees, and other
relevant third parties verify and agree to.

This consensus creates a single governing model for the transaction.
Rating agencies, investors, and other relevant stakeholders reference this model and, if
desired, also the underlying loan-level data to perform their assessment of the newlycreated securities. In addition, relevant portions of the offering and legal documents are
also automatically created with smart contracts. Regulatory compliance is largely
automated, as smart contracts are programmed to immediately note any potential
irregularities.
Step 4: A separate smart contract to service the securities is layered on top of the SPV
and the smart contract developed for the transaction itself. This new contract collects
payments from loan servicers, references the cash-flow model specified in the contract
governing the SPV, and distributes payments to the beneficiary holders of the security
with only minimal delays for settlement. This information stream is related to rating
agencies and the secondary markets.
Step 5: Ratings monitoring software sometime referred to as ‘Oracles’ are placed on the
blockchain to match the security performance with expected cash flows and trigger rating
reviews when discrepancies arise.
Step 6: Trading or market information platforms are constructed with blockchain
technology to interoperate with the blockchains used for the transactions and enable
market makers to create robust secondary markets in securitized assets. With the help
of market makers, securities trading on the blockchain is near-instant and low cost, with
regulatory compliance close to automatic, as data on asset ownership is reported in realtime to regulators while it remains hidden from competitors. Large investors could
potentially directly trade on these platforms without having to go through broker-dealers.
Step 7: As the securities are created and traded, beneficiary information is stored and
updated in a separate repository, which acts as a custodial entity. This updated
beneficiary information is referenced to facilitate future security servicing. To maintain
confidentiality, only relevant trustees and regulators possess full access to this
information. Less sensitive data such as ratings or underlying payments information
could be made available to other actors.

The growth of Factoring

Commercial, non-bank factoring enterprises are playing a large role in the US, UK,
and China, and with the rise of FinTechs, non-bank players will have an increasingly
significant impact on the industry. The explosive growth of the industry, especially since
the start of the financial crisis, is in large part inspired by an improved perception of risk
globally, but also stemming from a shift from overdraft/unsecured credit facilities to
receivables-based financing (International Chamber of Commerce, 2017).
Combined growth of national and international factoring:

Total factoring volume from 2010 to 2016:

Those trends allow Liqease and Traxia to tap into a massive market with huge
growth potential which is supported by increasingly favorable macroeconomic data and
validated by startups operating in similar segments.

Traxia’s solution: a decentralized trade finance ecosystem
The vision of Traxia is to establish an open and decentralized ecosystem to
improve trade finance globally. Traxia combines blockchain and an open, connected IT
architecture to create a new ecosystem for trade finance. It allows corporates to create
smart contracts — automated, self-executing digital contracts that trigger payments and
receipts in real time as goods move through the supply chain.
Tracking of goods through modern Internet of Things (IoT) solutions can further
eliminate uncertainty about where physical goods are; blockchain helps to verify identity
and ownership and could conceivably simplify compliance and governance, as well as
reducing manual work and human error. The transparency gain from such advancements
ultimately leads to better access to finance in several ways:

1. Trust and Transparency - an inherent feature of blockchain technology, further
enhanced with smart contracts
Recording and confirming a trade on the Traxia blockchain will create higher levels
of trust in B2B trades. A Seller and Buyer are asked to sign such trade transaction
using their private keys to record and create an immutable entry on a blockchain.
The technology makes it seamless to assign privileges to data entries in
accordance to the role of each participant such as: Trading Businesses, Investors,
Regulators, Logistic Providers etc. therefore combining data ownership with a
new level of transparency as needed. Use cases around IoT and business process
automation will be the focus of our next phase. Such use cases have the potential
to further increase supply chain transparency.
2. Securitization and Standardization – the initial Traxia focus, with LiqEase
developing the use case
Securitization can be attractive to both bank and non-bank investors. For banks,
securitization allows them to economize on capital and/or liquidity and reduce US
dollar funding needs, while preserving a return on firms’ expertise/comparative
advantage in originating and managing trade finance loans. Distribution to outside
investors can also free up counterparty space on balance sheets and reduce trade
loan concentrations.

For non-bank investors, direct or indirect investment in trade finance assets offers
a potentially attractive return relative to risk. We will introduce how Traxia will
use blockchain technology to streamline the securitization process below.
Standardization ranks among the Top 3 challenges of having more institutional
investors entering export finance (International Chamber of Commerce, 2016).
The Traxia Ecosystem will provide standardized processes and products to make
the issuance of a Smart Contract backed by trade more seamless with the support
of our technology provider LiqEase Limited.
3. Access to capital markets through decentralization
Traxia will decentralizes trade finance technology and will work closely with
international regulators to make such an open market possible. The largest global
banks account for a quarter to a third of the global supply of bank-intermediated
trade finance, with local and regional banks providing the remainder
(International Chamber of Commerce, 2017). Such centralization comes with the
disadvantage of dedicated market knowledge that favours local and regional
banks. Those banks on the other hand face the disadvantage of L/Cs being 80%
denominated in US Dollars which makes refinancing in US Dollars a hurdle and
major obstacle for those banks (Bank for International Settlement, 2014). In
result, 61% of banks perceive that there is more demand than supply for trade
finance (International Chamber of Commerce, 2017). Decentralization has the
potential to stabilize the trade finance markets. New entrants such as fixed

income funds can get access to a standardized trade finance product similar to a
corporate bond. Such a digital platform can also provide credit risk insurers with
an additional channel to sell their products directly to SMEs.

Our proposed model for optimizing financial flows in supply chains, turns the
actors within the supply chain into intermediaries who can overcome the problem of
asymmetric information between capital markets (e.g. banks) and the parties seeking
capital.

The Smart Contract

Traxia creates a new trade finance platform that operates through smart
contracts running on a blockchain. Those smart contracts hold information such as
volume and duration of an underlying trade, while also becoming interoperable with
existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems, Payment Networks such as SWIFT,
[Ripple Settlement System] and others. Traxia is also a tool to model and automate
business processes to save time, costs and generate a higher efficiency for corporates
along their respective supply chains.
As argued by Hans-Christian Pfohl and Moritz Gomm in their paper ‘Supply chain
finance: optimizing financial flows in supply chains’, the proposed model for financing the
supply chain, turns the actors within the supply chain into intermediaries who can
overcome the problem of asymmetric information mentioned above.
Traxia will take their scientific model that has been proven successfully using a
qualitative approach, as our underlying assumption to improve cash allocation into traderelated financial products. In a nutshell, their model assumes that the information
asymmetry between actors within the supply chain and financial institutions providing
cash liquidity can be solved by making the supply chain actors part of the financial supply
chain. We therefore make the B2B trade intermediaries (Buyers, Sellers) part of the
financial supply chain by letting them issue the trade related smart contracts using our
technology. We therefore propose the following Actors to be part of the Traxia
Blockchain Ecosystem for Trade Finance. Besides the Traxia itself, we have companies
engaging in a B2B trade which we call Sellers and Buyers, as well as Investors, Issuing
Providers, Listing Providers and a facility to warehouse loans.

The Actors
1. Seller
A company that is offering a product for sale. In our ecosystem, it also represents
the party that is looking to improve its cash liquidity and, solely or jointly with the
Buyer, looking to issue a smart contract representing a trade obligation. In the
Traxia ecosystem, these are often SMEs.

2. Buyer
A company that is purchasing the product. In the Traxia ecosystem, the Buyer is
often a larger corporation which generally has a better credit rating than an SME
Seller. Better ratings can be used to mitigate the risk for the Investors if the smart
contract representing the trade obligation is jointly issued, which is similar to the
reverse factoring model. In short, a large company like Porsche, is more than likely
to pay than a smaller company and that ability to pay can help the credit rating of
the contract.
3. Investors
A person or organization that puts money into financial products, assets, etc. with
the expectation of achieving a profit.
4. Issuing Provider
Due to the novelty of putting trade-finance on a blockchain, Traxia came up with
the concept and role of the ‘Issuing Provider,’ which is the technology provider
that setups and maintains the Traxia platform.

The issuing provider creates a platform to streamline the process of uploading
and validating business and trade details by combining commonly used web
technologies with a modern blockchain infrastructure running on the backend in
a manner that is transparent to the Buyer, Seller or Investor. The only exposure
that the actor would have to the blockchain is the need to sign a transaction with
an individual private key/passphrase that has been assigned to the user.
The issuing provider will be responsible for the technical integration of rating
agencies and data providers e.g. accessing directly via Oracles or more traditional
via API interfaces as well as provide access to licensed payment gateways to make
settlement of fiat currencies possible between actors.
To sum it up, the Issuing Provider:
Sets up and maintains the technical infrastructure to gather information
relevant for issuing the smart contract on behalf of the Buyer and/or Seller
representing a B2B trade and including information such as ‘Contract Volume’,
‘Contract Currency’, ‘Contract Duration’ etc..
Implement standards to guide Buyers and Sellers through a due diligence
process including KYC and AML checks based on Business Certificates, staff
Passports, Financial Statements, audits, letters of good standing etc.
Take necessary technical precautions in terms of data safety and
Implement the public key, asymmetric encryption method to let Buyers and
Sellers digitally sign their smart contract and digital asset issuing transactions
5. Listing Providers
A Listing Provider is a marketplace that matches investors of securities with listed
and unlisted securities. A listed security is a financial instrument that is traded
through an exchange. Exchanges have listing requirements to ensure that only

high-quality securities are traded on them to maintain the exchange's reputation
among investors.
Although there is increased scrutiny of regulators regarding cryptocurrencies and
increased targeting of fraudulent ICO business practices, there is in no jurisdiction
that has a dedicated set of rules and laws in place to categorize a digital asset
and/or blockchain token. Also considering that accounts receivables are in fact
categorized as current assets under international bookkeeping standards, it
seems unlikely to see a new set of rules approaching that will transform accounts
receivables into a security, as traditional factoring services have been in operation
for many years. In some markets, like the US, UK and Brazil, factoring is
unregulated, giving commercial factors an advantage over their bank
counterparts in the traditional factoring field.
6. Loan Warehousing
Loan Warehousing is the initial process of acquiring debt from various sources,
as an example, a bank or similar institution providing funds to a borrower
without using the bank’s own capital. In the Traxia ecosystem, debts that arise
from B2B trade transactions that do not “find” an immediate Liquidity Provider
are warehoused.

Traxia is implementing loan warehousing to ensure that the the matching
process does not become a bottleneck for the ecosystem. The Traxia owned
warehousing facility will be used at launch for the initial trial period to prove the
concept, and make decentralization possible over the mid- to long-term. Traxia
is not a specialist in pricing debt so will be working with Creditsafe,1 a rating
agency whose scores are recognized by major Credit Insurers such as Euler
Hermes and Coface.
Tokenized access to the Traxia platform

Our membership model is straightforward and involves two types of access a) accessing
the ecosystem through Issuing and Listing services and b) membership fee on a per
transaction basis to be settled in Traxia Membership Token (TMT) at the conversion rate
of when the Issuing and Listing services have been provided.
The following diagram illustrates the business model:

As illustrated in the graphic above, the technology provider LiqEase is providing the
services of Listing and Issuing to interested Buyers and Sellers to access the ecosystem.
LiqEase can be compared to the Ethereum Switzerland GmbH which is associated to the
Ethereum Foundation and is entitled to use the funds of the Crowdsale according to the
statute of the Foundation. For establishing the basis of the Traxia Ecosystem, LiqEase as
well as Traxia are therefore entitled to a share of the overall proceeds as illustrated above.
Whereas Issuing and Listing Fees is allocated to LiqEase and Ecosystem fee to Traxia.

What we already built

Figure 4: LiqEase home page

Award winning LiqEase2 is a Limited company registered in Hong Kong since 2017
and borne out of a project that begun in 2016. LiqEase is the technology provider within
the Traxia ecosystem providing Issuing and Listing Services to Buyers, Sellers and
Investors.
LiqEase has thus-far built a simple and user-friendly Web-Interface that can be
used today by Buyers and Sellers to upload their invoice. In the backend LiqEase is running
a blockchain application layer for various blockchains such as Ethereum and will build
upon Cardano when ready. LiqEase Limited operates as a Listing provider i.e. running an
Over-The-Counter market which targets professional investors as defined by the
regulators in Hong Kong [15]. You can find out more about LiqEase at http://liqease.co
The workflow of the current product built by LiqEase is as follows:

As the assets created on the platform are merely a digital representation of a real
trade asset issued by the Buyers/Sellers, there is no need for an International Security
Identification Number (ISIN). In addition, there is no custodian as the digital version of
the asset has already been digitally signed by the Supplier and/or Buyer with their
respective private keys and recorded on a blockchain. As the blockchain is distributed,
this adds an additional layer of trust as compared to a traditional central custodian
safekeeping the asset. The asset is then listed on the marketplace instantly and
settlement times can easily be reduced to minutes rather than days.

Initial Proof of Concept

In one of its first use cases, LiqEase was the Issuing Provider and Listing Provider
for a Porsche Digital Innovation Project (the Buyer) who listed a 30 days invoice worth
around $ 50.000 in total. The Seller was VOK Dams and a 3rd party corporate investor was

the Liquidity Provider. The smart contract was registered on the Proof Ethereum
Blockchain under the transaction number:
http://www.proofsidechain.com/#/transaction/0x7453e318039cc04c08cfb475ec62b21
07bc9898361138de71eef32285a7b9475.
LiqEase is currently working on another project involving another German car
manufacturer, as well as on projects in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector.
LiqEase expects to work on a number of different financing projects during 2018.
Focusing its activity on the multi-billion-dollar trade corridor between Europe and China.

Traxia and LiqEase

Traxia is a non-profit foundation being established under the laws of Switzerland.
It is the creator and initiator of the blockchain model described in this paper. The Traxia
foundation’s mission is to promote and support the Traxia platform through
development and education and provide buyers, sellers and investors around the world
with a more accessible, transparent and more trustworthy system to engage in global
trade.
The Traxia foundation will support projects like LiqEase and can invest in entities
and projects that support the purpose of the foundation as stated.
LiqEase operates a for profit businesses and is building the gateways and
applications to connect and be part of the Traxia ecosystem. LiqEase is an Issuing and
Listing Provider and is in fact the first successful proof of concept of the Traxia ecosystem.
Coming back to our initial assumption, the Traxia platform creates more
transparency within a supply chain by integrating smart contracts into business processes
and is creating the basis for Buyers and Sellers in B2B trade to become active participants
in supply chain finance, hence improving the information symmetry between the supply
chain and capital markets. Higher information transparency between actors, increases
the likelihood that financing can be provided for an asset that is issued by a Seller/Buyer.
The development of LiqEase increases the demand for the TMT and improvement
of the Smart Contracts, creating higher levels of transparency within the supply chain
powered by the Traxia Foundation.

Business Strategy
Our strategy focuses on creating a network effect as our decentralized trust and
transparency ecosystem enables us to do so. We will use the well-known bowling pin
strategy i.e. start with a niche market, and then move to other niches and broader
markets.

Stage 1

Focusing on the supply side first: Traxia will work to accepted and used by sellers
to finance their B2B trade. Establishing partnerships with distributors that have an
existing relationship with those suppliers and a vetted interest in successfully financing
such deal can enable instant scale.
To achieve that, we will partner with distributors, importers and exporters
focusing on the FMCG market segment first in particular the trade corridor between
Europe and China. We are already in positive talks with major players and working
together with a team belonging to Intermarché which in 2016 had a turnover that
surpassed €30bn USD.
To get a head start and accelerate growth, the Loan Warehousing Facility will
provide a strategic advantage over competitors and makes it possible to streamline the
process from the originating of the debt to the bundling and securitization aspect which
is relevant for institutional investors to deploy their money efficiently.
The goal is to use the Warehousing as an entry strategy for different markets with
large gaps in trade credit and traditionally low default rates. It will be replaced by
independent banks and investors at a later stage to fully decentralize the market.

Stage 2

Educate the initial client base and foster word-of-mouth campaigns through the
creation of a referral program.

Stage 3

Broader market adoption by targeting global investors such as hedge funds. The
more Traxia is recognized as a reliable ecosystem, the easier it will be to expand globally.
Education will again be key. Traxia will need to show investors how they can tap into a
new market of standardized trade assets on the basis of immutable smart contracts that
is only accessible through the Traxia Ecosystem and its partners.

Product Architecture and Development Roadmap
Concerning our product development, our roadmap looks as follows:
V1 (alpha) January 2018
V1 (beta) March 2018

Monolith API (PHP), web clients (Angular 4 / Typescript)
V2 April 2018
Monolith API (PHP), web clients (Angular 4 / Typescript)
V3 June / July 2018
Microservice API (NodeJS/Typescript/GraphQL), webclient
(ReactJS/Typescript/Redux), mobileclient (React Native/Typescript/Redux)

V1

In terms of architecture, we have three entities working together.
First, we build the core of the project around our first use case and initial focus to
make the Traxia ecosystem viable i.e. our CMS, Liqease.com. This CMS has been
developed using robust technologies such as (PHP, Typescript, Angular). The CMS has a
monolith architecture API (PHP) and uses Angular 4/Typescript as client.
Second, we have a marketplace where professional investors can trade digital
assets that are collateralized by invoices and other relevant contracts in relation to such
a trade. This marketplace is powered using an open source projects (currently proofsuite
and we are in close contact with their development team and CTO - Tai Kersten). We are
also working with other open source projects for operating such a marketplace such as
e.g. Lykke and are in touch with their Singapore team (Zheng Wei Quah and Alan Laubsch).
Third, the ecosystem will be powered by a membership/voucher Token (TMT) that
remunerates and incentivizes the participants and technology providers within the
ecosystem.
V2

Our second version will have a different approach, based on the latest client
feedback as well as the product roadmap and the necessary flexibility within that
roadmap. The key philosophy is to ease the process and make the platform as easy to use
as possible for our users.
Traxia will also develop the next generation of the CMS and use a microservice
API architecture (NodeJS/Typescript/GraphQL) that will be responsible to organise the
different services and clients. Our platform clients will be web client
(ReactJS/Typescript/Redux) and mobile client (React native/Typescript/Redux)
The second version of the product will be built on the Cardano Blockchain
Infrastructure. The TMT Token will be made available on Cardano and we believe a more

seamless integration between the Traxia Ecosystem requiring TMT to pay for the
technical services provided by LiqEase.
V3

The third version will focus on the Smart Contracts and making them ‘truly smart’.
Our focus in V1 and V2 is to satisfy market demand and prove that a blockchain-based
solution is viable for trade finance. Operating a stable and scalable product that solves
the trade finance gap utilizing a blockchain for securitization of the underlying trade will
give us the necessary fundamentals to evolve the product over time and integrate smart
contracts into the enterprise systems and workflows.

Traxia Membership Token (TMT) Sale
To fund the initial operation and creation of the Traxia platform, we will be
offering the sale of TMT tokens.
The supply of TMT is limited to a maximum of max. one billion (1,000,000,000)
tokens in total, including those available for sale during the Token Sale. The tokens will
be generated upon the token launch and will be distributed in the following manner:
70%
of the tokens will be eventually allocated amongst the community. Distributed in
the following order 30% + 30% + 5% + 5%
20%
will be allocated to the foundation creation, development team, early backers.
10%
will be allocated to treasury with the purpose of providing TMT Liquidity if
necessary as well as being a contingency fund.

The Traxia crowdsale and the corresponding token creation process will be
organized around smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain. Participants
willing to support the development of the Traxia project can do so by sending Ether (ETH)
and ADA tokens to the designated address. By doing so, they are purchasing TMT at the
rate of 1 TMT per US$ 0.15 which will be sent to their ETH wallet after the sale. Any ADA
and ETH that is send to the designated address will be converted to TMT at market rate
of ETH, ADA to US$ each day during the sale at 12.30 pm (UTC+8). ADA, ETH that has
been transferred within the 24 hours previous to 12 pm (UTC+8) on each given day during
the sale will be included in the daily conversion and TMT distributed to the ETH address
that has been provided by the purchaser.

Token Demand and Supply

The price for the TMT will be priced by markets and exchanges, identical to any
other token. As our network and ecosystem grows — more Buyers and Sellers issuing
their digital assets using the services from Issuing and Listing Providers in the ecosystem
— the total amount of TMT remains fixed to max. 1,000,000,000 Tokens. Such an upper
ceiling triggers traditional market dynamics, as soon as Buyers and Sellers issue smart
contracts representing their B2B trade obligation, generating TMT demand since a
membership is required to access the ecosystem.
Token Amounts and Discounts during Pre-Sale and Sale

The total amount of TMT Tokens sold in will be 400,000,000.00 in this first Token Sale.
The price for the TMT will be reduced during the pre-Sale and early phases of the sale as

Legal
Important Notice
This document contains the terms and conditions (the "Terms") which govern the Token
Generating Event ("TGE") of the Traxia Foundation ("Traxia Foundation"). In the TGE, the
Traxia Foundation will issue [ERC20] tokens (the “Traxia Tokens”) to participants making
contributions in the course of the TGE (the “Participants”), which grant certain rights as
set out herein and in the Traxia Foundation's Whitepaper (the "Whitepaper").
Participants must read, understand and consent to both the Terms and the Whitepaper
and sign a pertaining Token Purchase Agreement, all available at
https://www.traxia.co/terms-and-conditions, before they participate in the TGE.
The Traxia Foundation is a foundation established under the laws of Switzerland and
registered in the commercial register of the state of Zug; its legal domicile is in Zug. The
projects which the Traxia Foundation pursues are described in detail, though not
comprehensively, in the Whitepaper.
No Solicitation
Participants interested in supporting the Traxia Foundation and its projects may do so by
acquiring Traxia Tokens and following the procedure set out herein as well as in the
Whitepaper, having agreed in advance to the Terms and the Whitepaper.
Neither these Terms nor the Whitepaper do constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of
an offer to buy, an interest in any jurisdiction in which it is unlawful to make such an offer
or solicitation. Neither the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nor any other federal, state, or foreign
regulatory authority has approved a contribution to the Traxia Foundation or the
acquisition of the Traxia Tokens. Furthermore, the foregoing authorities have not
confirmed the accuracy or determined the adequacy of these Terms, nor is it intended
that the foregoing authorities will do so. Any representation to the contrary is illegal.
Accordingly, Participants will not be afforded the protection of respective laws.
Furthermore, Participants confirm that they have not been solicited to make a
contribution to the Traxia Foundation or to acquire Traxia Tokens, but that any of their
contributions were made upon their own request.

Experience and Suitability
Participants shall only participate in the TGE if and when (i) they have carefully considered
and thoroughly reviewed the information contained in these Terms as well as in the
Whitepaper, (ii) they fully understand the risks, costs, and benefits associated with
receiving Traxia Tokens, (iii) they agree to be bound by these Terms, and (ii) the
Whitepaper and the Terms are acceptable for them.
Significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of
cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based software systems are essential for
Participants to participate in the TGE. The Participants bear the sole responsibility to
determine if the acquisition of Traxia Tokens or the potential appreciation or depreciation
in their value over time has tax implications for the Participants in their home jurisdictions.
Participants shall not construe these Terms as investment, legal, tax, regulatory, financial,
accounting, or other advice, and they are not intended to provide the sole basis for any
evaluation of a contribution. Prior to acquiring Traxia Tokens, Participants should consult
with their own legal, investment, tax, accounting, and other advisors to determine (i) the
potential benefits, burdens, and other consequences of such investment, including
without limitation a Participant’s financial situation and goals, and (ii) suitability and
appropriateness of the acquisition, holding and disposition of Traxia Tokens. Participants
are entirely responsible for the financial risk of their contribution during the entire term.
Rights related to Traxia Tokens
By participating in the TGE and obtaining the Traxia Token in the course of the latter,
Participants acquire no rights whatsoever, neither expressed nor implied, related to the
Traxia Foundation or its projects. In particular, Participants will have no influence over
the governance of the Traxia Foundation, and no control over its distribution, allocation
and use of the Participants’ contributions, which may include covering costs incurred
before the TGE, strategic reserves, and awards for beneficiaries (including without
limitation parties affiliated with the Traxia Foundation, any related legal entities or the
projects) who in the Traxia Foundation’s view significantly contributed to the projects. It
is thus in the Traxia Foundation’s sole discretion how and to whom Participants’
contribution will be given in the context of its projects; it will do so as it deems fit.
Participants’ contributions in the course of the TGE are final and non-refundable. The
Participants acknowledge that the Traxia Foundation is not required to provide a refund
for any reason, and the Participants will not receive money or other compensation for
any Traxia Tokens that are not used or remain unused.
A participation in the TGE involves a high degree of risk, volatility, and illiquidity.
Participants need to be aware that by participating in the TGE, their entire contribution
to the Traxia Foundation may be lost for whatever reason, in particular due to the fact
that the Traxia Foundation and its project are still under development, and no warranties
can be given that it will be successfully completed. The Traxia Foundation will – on a best
efforts basis – take economically reasonable measures to issue the Traxia Tokens and to
release the project, but it may be possible that the project launch will not occur, or that
the Traxia Tokens, even if successfully developed and maintained, may not meet
Participants’ expectations at the time of purchase. As a consequence, the Traxia Token
may have no value after all. Contrary to traditional start-up financings, Participants do
not have any comparable rights at all; they are neither shareholders (equity financing)
nor creditors (debt financing), and they do not have any corresponding rights whatsoever.

Furthermore, the Traxia Foundation may at any given time cancel the TGE for whatever
reason and in its sole discretion. In addition, no guarantees can be given that the TGE will
be carried out or completed in accordance with the time-frame as set out in the
Whitepaper.
Authorization
Participants represent and warrant that they are authorized to acquire and obtain Traxia
Tokens in their relevant jurisdiction, that they are not subject to a jurisdiction where the
distribution, acquisition, holding and resale of Traxia Tokens is restricted, and are of a
legal age to be bound by these Terms.
They shall make their own investigations and evaluations of the contributions that will be
delivered pursuant thereto, including the merits and risks involved. Participants shall
inform themselves as to the legal requirements applicable to them in respect of the
acquisition, holding, and disposition of the Traxia Tokens upon their delivery, and as to
the income and other tax consequences to them of such acquisition, holding, and
disposition. They shall accordingly observe all applicable restrictions.
These Terms shall not be used or relied upon by any person who is subject to laws which
for whatever reason prohibit or restrict the distribution, publication, availability or use of
these Terms and the Whitepaper or any actions taken thereunder, such as the
distribution, acquisition, holding and resale of Traxia Tokens (including without limitation
citizens or residents of the U.S., Canada, U.K., Singapore, North and South Korea, Hong
Kong, China).
With regard to the aforementioned, including without limitation in case of regulatory
actions against Participants who acquired Traxia Tokens despite any applicable limitations
in their jurisdictions, Participants further represent and warrant that they will not hold
the Traxia Foundation, its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees,
advisors and suppliers, now or in the future, liable for any losses, costs or any direct,
special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way related to, the
TGE or the Traxia Foundation.
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements contained in the Terms or the Whitepaper constitute forward-looking
statements. Such forward-looking statements, including the intended actions and
performance objectives of the Traxia Foundation, involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties, and other important factors that could cause the actual results,

Annex – Technical Details
Introduction
The smart contract represents an asset issued by a business entity after a trade
has been confirmed. By providing the necessary infrastructure, issuing and listing
providers earn TMT tokens for providing such services. The tokens TMT and the smart
contracts make the creation of such an ecosystem therefore viable.
The purpose of this section is to
(1) Introduce the Traxia Network, provide an overview of the transaction scheme and
logic and looks at some components in more detail.
(2) categorize and define a decentralized liquidity network (DLN) and argue for Traxia as
a DLN.
(3) Formalizes verifiable assets and constructs two scenarios, Liquidity Provision and a
Liquidity Retrieval, governed by the information written to and read from smart contract,
respectively.
(4) Discusses use cases, connections to other systems, and how to make use of the
ecosystem.
Our smart contracts provide liquidity and retrieval services from a network of
independent liquidity providers and payment service providers to settle transactions
through traditional channels. (a) issuers pay to get access to liquidity providers (b)
liquidity providers get paid through traditional banking channels4 (c) issuing and listing
providers earn tokens by providing the technical infrastructure
(1) Fundamental Components
The Traxia network and its tokens build upon two unique components:
1. Decentralized Liquidity Network (DLN): a network of independent entities that
provision liquidity through issuing and listing providers. The Traxia network is an
incentivized, auditable and verifiable DLN construct.
2. Verifiable Assets: Liquidity provision requests and retrieval requests are modeled
as traditional orders on the markets provided by the Listing Providers within the
Traxia network. Verifiable assets ensure that payments are initiated when a
service has been legally agreed upon between a Buyer and Seller.
Participants
Any active business can participate as a client and make use of the services
provided. Liquidity Providers need to hold the necessary licenses and may be classified
as professional investor in the jurisdiction they are operating in.

4

This is subject to change depending on the regulatory environment. Settling all transactions on a
blockchain does of course make more sense from a efficiency and technology point of view.

Clients pay to access additional liquidity through the technical infrastructure provided by
the Traxia ecosystem and its partners (Issuing and Listing Providers) within the DLN.
Liquidity Providers and Issuers settle their trade individually.
Issuing and Listing Providers are required to provide the services as described
under section ‘Traxia’s Solution’. For the near future, the foundation is exclusively
working and supporting LiqEase to guarantee quality and compliance since Traxia’s board
controls LiqEase. It will be a guided decentralisation process driven by the foundation due
to the regulatory uncertainty and the need for guidelines and laws in the respective
jurisdictions to make a truly decentralized Traxia ecosystem feasible and compliant.
Proof of issuing needs to be submitted by the Issuing Provider to the Network that
an asset has been generated at a certain point in time. Missing proofs can be used to
impose penalties on the Issuing Providers.
Listing providers need to proof that an asset is verifiable, liquidity has been
provisioned and retrieved.
The Ecosystem
All users and partners that are providing software and infrastructure to make access to
the Traxia network possible, are defined as one abstract entity: The Ecosystem.
The Ecosystem acts as an agent to manage, validate and repair potential mistakes within
the network.
The Ledger
Our smart contracts are applied on top of a ledger-based technology and we intend to
use Cardano for our future development. The Ledger is accessible by the users at any
given time. The Traxia DLN can be implemented and deployed on top of any other ledger
that allows for the structure of the smart contracts as defined in this document.
The Issuing Providers
Issuing Providers offer the technological infrastructure to make it seamless and smooth
for businesses to issue their assets using traditional web technologies in a combination
with modern blockchain elements.
The Listing Providers
Liquidity (Supply) and the Demand for such is met at the markets operated by the Listing
Providers. In brief, Issuers and Liquidity Providers set the prices for the services they
request by submitting their orders to the markets. Those markets provide a way for users
to identify suitable offers and execute deals.
Smart Contract Overview
The smart contracts are the basis of the Decentralised Liquidity Platform. Issuers (Buyers,
Sellers) who make use of the smart contract ‘template’ and list their individual assets will
need to purchase TMT to access the ecosystem.

The purchase and distribution of TMTon behalf of the Issuer will be automatically
handled by the smart contract. (a) verifying the amount of a to be issued asset in the
currency chosen by Buyer and/or Seller via their digital signature (b) posting transaction
and currency settlement requests to payment service provider (c) initiate TMT purchase
order and distribution in accordance with the prices defined between Issuers and Issuing
and Listing Providers.
The Traxia DLN can handle liquidity provision and retrieval requests Listing
Providers and their markets. Issuers and Issuing, Listing Providers set the prices for the
requested services.
Issuing and Listing Providers are independent business entities that act and
conduct business on behalf of themselves and in their own best interest. To some extent
they can be compared to mining providers where an offline hardware infrastructure is
needed but the service is completely automatized and essential for the ecosystem to
function and therefore necessary part of the Traxia ecosystem and network.

Definition of a Decentralized Liquidity Network
A Decentralized Liquidity Network (DLN) runs as an autonomous system that
aggregates liquidity from various independent liquidity providers, providing liquidity
provision and retrieval markets for Issuers in a self-coordinated way. Having a
decentralized coordination without trusted parties in place is technically feasible through
the use of protocols to verify and coordinate operations that are carried out by individual
Issuers.
A DLN is governed by two main principles:
Put(asset) ! identifier: Clients execute the Put request to issue an asset under a
unique identifier.
Get(identifier) ! asset: Clients execute the Get protocol to retrieve asset
(information) that is currently stored using the identifier.
Properties
Integrity
No attacker can convince Issuers to accept altered or falsified assets.
Definition: A DLN scheme provides asset integrity if: for any successful Put execution for
some asset (a) under identifier (i), there is no computationally-bounded adversary (A)
that can convince an Issuer to accept falsified asset (a’) at the end of a Get execution for
identifier (i).
Retrievability
This property captures the requirement that, given our fault-tolerance assumptions of, if
some asset has been successfully stored in and issuing and listing providers continue to
follow the standards defined in a SPA token template, then users can eventually retrieve
the asset.
Definition: A DLN scheme provides retrievability if: for any successful Put execution for
asset under identifier, there exists a successful Get execution for identifier for which a
user retrieves the asset.
Publicly verifiable
Definition: A DLN scheme is publicly verifiable if: for each successful Put, the network of
issuing providers can generate a proof that the asset is currently being issued. It must
convince any efficient verifier, which only knows the identifier and does not have access
to the asset.
Auditable

Definition: A DLN scheme is auditable, if it generates a verifiable trace of operation that
can be checked in the future to confirm liquidity was indeed provisioned for the right
duration of time.
Incentive driven
Definition: A DLN scheme is incentive driven, if: Issuing, Listing and Liquidity Providers are
rewarded for successfully offering liquidity and retrieval service, or penalized for
misbehaving, so that the Issuing and Listing providers' dominant strategy is to provide a
working technology infrastructure to make the provision of liquidity possible.
Lifecycle of a Digital Asset (Smart Contract) backed by a B2B Trade
1. Put: Buyers and Sellers issue digital assets using the smart contract infrastructure.
Buyers and Sellers can issue their assets by paying Issuing and Listing Providers in TMT
tokens. With a Put request, Buyers and Sellers issue a digital asset via an Issuing Provider
and subsequently trigger a bid order on the market operated by a Listing Provider. After
matching such a bid order with a ask order from a Liquidity Provider, the Buyers and
Sellers send the digital asset to the Liquidity Provider. The parties sign the order and a
transaction is recorded on the blockchain. The pricing of such orders is been made
between Issuers and Liquidity Providers.
2. Get: Buyers and Sellers retrieve digital assets using the smart contract infrastructure
The Get request is defined upon issuing in the Smart Contract already and executed in
accordance with the maturity of the digital asset that has been defined by the Issuer upon
creation. In general the duration should not extend 270 days but it is to the sole discretion
of the Issuer to set such duration and maturity date.
Liquidity Provision and Retrieval Markets
Traxia makes use of markets that are operated by Listing Providers and aim to be
decentralized in the future. Structure and Design of those markets is inherently defined
by the requirements of TMT and the smart contracts representing a B2B trade. They are
created and adapted around those given necessities.
The Liquidity Provision Market allows the Issuers to pay Listing Providers to list their
assets on their marketplaces. The Liquidity Retrieval Market is an intrinsic requirement
that is given by the smart contract structure and due to the limited duration and validity
of any such listed digital asset represented by such smart contract. Issuers and Liquidity
Providers can set their own supply and demand driven prices to initiate transactions
based on available offers on the market.
DLN Requirements and Guarantees
To achieve integrity, retrievability, public verifiability and being incentive driven, the
Traxia DLN established the following guidelines.
Integrity:
A Put request is initiated by Buyer and Seller after both parties signed such a request with
their individually assigned private keys. The cryptographic hash resulting from such action

is assigned to the digital asset and therefore allows to verify the integrity of the asset
during the time of listing.
Retrievability:
Storing the asset in a decentralized way is a default feature of the blockchain we are
building on. The digital asset is stored fault tolerant on various instances within the
Ecosystem and a user can therefore increase the likelihood of recovery if one instance
crashes or disconnects.
Public Verifiability and Auditability:
Issuing Providers are required to submit proofs of issuing to the blockchain. The validity
of those blocks can hence be verified by any user in the Ecosystem using those proofs
without the need to accessing the detailed information associated with the issued asset.
Being stored on the blockchain, those immutable proofs are a trace that can be audited
at any given time.
Incentive Compatibility:
Issuing and Listing providers are both rewarded for the services they are providing. When
Issuers initiate a Put request, Issuing Providers are required to generate proofs and Listing
Providers to have a fully operational marketplace to list the asset on behalf of the Issuer.
Issuing Providers that do not create proofs will be denied access to the Listing Provider
and are not entitled to any rewards. Listing Providers that don’t operate a working
marketplace as defined herein are not entitled to any rewards.
Confidentiality:
Issuers that desire their assets to be private, can list and offer those assets to preselected
Liquidity Providers only.
Trade Validation and Settlement - Verifiable Digital Assets
Transactions that are traditionally conducted between Buyers and Sellers for the
exchange of goods and services can only be validated to a certain extent. We however,
need and require those transactions and underlying assets to be verifiable so that actors
can verify the legitimacy of the asset and trade between Buyers and Sellers. Verifiable
digital assets need confirmation via digital signatures from two or more parties and the
transactions are transparent. Verifiable assets are a digital representation that aims to be
stored in a decentralized fashion. Issuing and Listing Services are provided by
independent parties. Issuing can be verified by the participants of the Ecosystem and the
orders and transactions that are initiated on a Marketplace operated by a Listing Provider
are recorded on a blockchain.
A verifiable asset can be issued with the intent to receive liquidity and be retrieved due
to the limited amount of time such a digital asset is valid. Its existence and ownership
status can be accessed at all time during its lifecycle on a blockchain explorer.
Future Work on Smart Contracts
Users will be able to interact with the smart contract by sending transactions to trigger
specific functions. We aim to optimize those contracts to execute features that are

desired by participants in the Traxia ecosystem. An example would be the interaction
with a trusted Oracle to gather and verify data that is linked to the Issuer and the
underlying collateral of a trade.
Those digital asset related contracts can have a variety of useful features such as
contracted issuing and listing, predefined remuneration schemes, escrow services and
more complex operations such as updating data associated with the asset based on the
actual status of the trade and supply chain.
As mentioned above, our initial production system is currently running on Ethereum and
an Ethereum Sidechain. There is a significant work in progress in terms of creating bridges
between the different blockchains. We are most bullish on the developments of Cardano
and intend to base our entire solution (TMT and the Smart Contract framework) on their
technology. Our overall aim is to use and bring the most advanced technology to the
Issuers and participants of the Traxia ecosystem and we will therefore support such
initiatives, as well. Depending on the regulatory environment it would be great to
integrate into crypto funds and cross border payment settlement systems such as SWIFT
and others.
This document provides a clear path towards the construction and establishment of the
Traxia Ecosystem. We still consider this work to be the initiator for discussion and further
research on potential of a Decentralized Liquidity Network. Our ongoing work consists of
adapting our current system to the features and principles described herein. Operating a
system gives us the opportunity to develop according to market demand and feedback.
Our future work will therefore be driven by the users and participants within the Traxia
Ecosystem and we aim to make those works publicly available by the end of 2018 to get
and make use of additional feedback from the community.
