As the blockchain industry approaches its post-inception phase, lots
of key technology foundations are now mature enough to build
robust consumer-facing products that are available to a wider
audience. Blockchain is propelling change in many areas of
traditional business, forcing incumbents to adapt their more
traditional business models. All sectors (such as banking, insurance,
logistics and governance) are affected as new products are
redefining the way we think of money, transactions, value and trust.
Despite the industrial disruption and technological advancement
brought about by blockchain, the swift digital payments between
buyers and sellers of physical services is still untapped. Digital
payment systems have been experiencing quite a number of
hindrances in traditional institutions, banks and credit banks.
Despite the benefits of very low fees, speed and low barrier of entry
associated with crypto payments, clear and developed advancement
in transactional security has not been implemented to the market.
Users seek a robust consumer protection system that protects their
purchases and other forms of transactions. Wouldn’t it be amazing if
we could solve this dilemma? This is what the SagaCoin platform
plans to solve.
Our aim is to offer seamless utility on public market. SagaCoin is
designed to be easily integrated into several applications, including
payment platforms, exchanges and marketplaces. We focus is to
build a next-generation payment gateway that gives developers,
investors and members of the general public that are not tech -savvy
to leverage the power of cryptocurrency in buying goods and
services with confidence from merchants. We aim to drive the
adoption of the platform by the public thereby providing a means to
shield them from the risk of accepting cryptocurrency.

SagaCoin was inspired from the word Saga which means “a long
story of heroic achievement, especially a medieval prose narrative in
Old Norse or Old Icelandic.” That’s the reason we use the old Viking
style as SagaCoin's theme.
SagaCoin leverages the best minds in blockchain technology with a
mature ecosystem and progression propelled by a dedicated
foundation team. We aim to build a global payment platform that
gives the assurance that cryptocurrency is not only meant for tech savvy people. Our goal is to ensure that SagaCoin becomes widely
used in every city in the world.

SagaCoin was launched as an open source cryptocurrency on 3rd
December, 2017. It is a decentralized and secure masternode
network project with long term goals. Our focus is to create a
cryptocurrency that can be accessed by everyone as a global
payment platform for developers, investors and the general public as
a whole. SagaCoin is maintained by a friendly and committed
community. We have many projects on ground that will help us to
innovate and build on our reputation to launch into the mainstream
as the most trusted and exciting cryptocurrency project in the
market.

SagaCoin will be a revolutionary global payment platform that will
enable developers, investors and the general public to use
cryptocurrency to pay merchants. We provide users with the safety
and convenience associated with consumer-protection. We combine
the best payment protection features of current generation fiat
systems with the innovative features of blockchain while combining
the unique features provided by our platform.
Our platform will provide the user protection that buyers take for
granted in traditional online transactions. We want to build upon the
features of cryptocurrencies to give room for fast transactions, lower
fees and low cross-border transaction friction, thereby enabling
merchants to sell to a growing worldwide audience of crypto -holders.
All these features will be integrated to create an incredible product.
We are also taking a step beyond creating an innovative product by
giving everyone in the world the opportunity to become a supporter.
Our platform will bring tangible value to our supporters and also
drive the growth of global payment transactions. We believe
cryptocurrencies are evolving and become much more than
speculation and are here to stay in the minds and wallets of
consumers. SagaCoin will be a game-changer that will change how
merchants and buyers utilize cryptocurrencies.

SagaCoin’s low transaction fee is one of the reasons why it
should be adopted.
SagaCoin’s minimum transaction fee is 0.000001 SAGA per
1000 bytes of transaction data. It is less than 250 bytes per
coin transaction, so usually only 0.000001 SAGA is required
for the transaction fee.

Fast Block Time
SagaCoin has a block time of 120 seconds. That’s 5X faster
than Bitcoin. This makes the confirmation of transactions
faster, thereby giving room for more capacity in transactions.

Big Block Size
SagaCoin has a maximum 2MB block size, That’s 2X Bitcoin’s
block size. This block size enables SagaCoin to have twice as
many transactions compared to Bitcoin in a single block.
With faster block time and bigger block size, SagaCoin has
10X more transactions compared to Bitcoin. This makes it
possible to avoid high transaction fee.

The masternode feature of SagaCoin helps it to handle the
spreading of transactional data. Masternode is an essential
element of cryptocurrency as they handle the spreading of
transactional data. It is what makes a coin decentralized. This
helps SagaCoin to use one server to distribute new data.
A masternode is a specific type of decentralized server that is
used to perform certain tasks on a coin’s blockchain, such as
adding privacy function.
It is a cryptocurrency full node or computer wallet that keeps
the full copy of the blockchain in real-time, just like Bitcoin full
nodes and is always up and running. Masternodes are not
standalone but they are always communicating with other
such nodes to make a decentralized network.
The masternode feature also makes SagaCoin resistant to
Sybil attacks which is where imposters disguise themselves
as several servers so that they can manipulate the blockchain
as they want.

SagaCoin performs every single transaction by using
Darksend. This keeps payments private and cannot be
tracked by anyone. Privacy guarantees are designed to
benefit legitimate users who do not want to disclose their
financial details to the public.

SagaCoin utilizes advanced Scrypt hashing to protect
blockchain network. Scrypt algorithm was specifically
designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom
hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory.

SagaCoin features payment to be sent or received worldwide
easily. Its low transaction fees and block time make it much
cheaper and faster compared to ordinary remittance or money
transfer service. SagaCoin transaction can be executed in
approximately 2 minutes or 120 seconds.

Proof-Of-Stake is a type of algorithm by which a
cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed
consensus. In Proof-Of-Stake, a person can mine or validate
block transactions according to how many coins he or she
holds. Thus, anyone can become a miner. This makes it more
decentralized in comparison to Proof of Work. Staking not
only provides extra coins to holder but also secure the
network to move forward even if there is no single miner for
PoW.

Atomic Swap

Atomic Swap is a very new concept and feature in cryptocurrencies,
the main purpose of Atomic Swap is to allow for the exchange of one
cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency without the need for a
trusted third party. In traditional cryptocurrencies a trusted third
party such as an cryptocurrency exchange, is necessary to perform
a swap of cryptocurrencies in order to prevent one party from
sending a currency without receiving a currency in return.
An Atomic Swap system uses a hash time-locked smart contract so
that a party must deliver the currency to be swapped within a
specified time, or else the transaction will be cancelled. This
preserves atomicity in that either the swap will take place, or no
currency will be swapped.
As at now, there is no timeline for implementation of Atomic Swap for
SagaCoin since it is still a very new concept. However, we are
working on researching and finding the best implementation
methods. We are very excited to have this great feature in future.
Once it is implemented, you will be able to swap SAGA to BTC or
vice versa.

SagaCoin aims to be one of the popular cryptocurrencies that widely
use as payment transactions. In order to reach this goal, we have to
implement payment gateway so that consumer can pay goods or
services by using SAGA. Our plan is to implement a self -hosted
payment gateway for SAGA to be used by early adoption of SAGA in
payment, and later will apply to be listed in those popular
cryptocurrency payment gateways that available as a plugins for
e-commerce platforms such as Wordpress, Zen Cart, Magento, and
others.
To make it simple, we will design it in such a way that it can be used
by people that are not tech-savvy, and easy integration into online
store.

SagaCoin has a very special masternode reward, the reward is
calculated based on PoS (Proof-Of-Stake) instead of PoW (Proof-OfWork). Each PoS block generates different amount of SagaCoin
based on the coins staked.
There is only one masternode winner for each PoS block, the winner
is designated by hash calculation similar to PoW. Therefore, a
masternode could earn rewards in three continuous PoS blocks, and
a masternode could also earn nothing in thousand PoS blocks.
SagaCoin has 200% PoS block reward in the first year, 180% is
allocated to masternode and 20% for coin staker. The PoS
calculation based on formula:-

nSubsidy = nCoinAge * COIN_YEAR_REWARD * 33 / (365 *
33 + 8);

For example:
Total coins staked at block 100,000 is 324 SAGA, therefore 291.60
SAGA rewarded to masternode winner and coin staker get 32.40
SAGA.

The reason behind halving is to avoid the scarcity of the
cryptocurrencies as the miners and investors are of abundant rate
and are growing up like a skyscraper. But as the height increases,
there is a high chance of complete demolishment with a little quake.
It was introduced into cryptocurrency mining to improve the stability
of the system and to give out plentiful of opportunity for everyone.
SagaCoin’s rewards halving (PoW and PoS) first time at the second
year, and second time at the third year. Coding as following:

static const int YEAR1_BLOCKS = 262800;
static const int YEAR2_BLOCKS = 525600;

(Total seconds per day = 86,400 seconds / SagaCoin ’s block time =
120 seconds) X Total days per year = 365 days = 262,800 blocks per
year.
There are estimated total 720 PoW blocks per day or 21,600 blocks
per month or 262,800 PoW blocks per year. And estimated 240 PoS
blocks per day or 7,200 blocks per month.

Since SagaCoin calculates reward halving by PoW blocks only, the
actual halving date should be earlier than ONE YEAR which is stated
in our specification. According to our table above, the estimated first
halving should happen in September 2018 instead of December
2018, and the estimated second halving will be in Jun 2019.
Full PoW block reward is 25 SAGA, so first halving is 12.5 SAGA
and second halving is 6.25 SAGA. PoS block reward also reduces
from 200% (180% masternode + 20% coin stake) to 100% (90%
masternode + 10% coin stake) at first halving, and 50% (45%
masternode + 10% coin stake) at second halving.

Important notes:
Actual total PoW 9,644 blocks + PoS 17,634 blocks = 27,278 blocks
from 1 st Apr 00:00:00 to 30 th Apt 23:59:59 (from block 130,088 to
block 157,365), which is less than estimated 21,600 (PoW) + 7,200
(PoS) = 28,800 blocks. This is because of PoW difficulty and coins
maturity in PoS.

SagaCoin is a PoW and PoS coin. Initial PoW block reward is 25
SAGA, and 200% of PoS reward. More details can be found under
the Halving section.
SagaCoin has estimated total PoW 21,600 blocks per month. Hence
estimated total 21,600 X 25 = 540,000 SAGA per month with PoW
difficulty = 1, but we have actual average of 350,000 SAGA monthly
only over the past 5 months due to high PoW difficulty, so we will
use 350,000 SAGA as the estimated PoW mined coins per month.
Thus, estimated PoW halving amount is calculated based on
350,000 SAGA (first halving = 350,000 / 2 = 175,000, second halving
= 175,000 / 2 = 87,500).
It is very difficult to estimate PoS coins generated because of PoS
difficulty and total SAGA locked in masternodes (coins locked in
masternodes do not stake). According to our actual past 5 months
statistics, we have 216,931.1743 SAGA in the first month and
average incremental of 30,000 SAGA per month. Estimated PoS
halving amount is calculated based on incremental 30,000 SAGA
(first halving = 30,000 / 2 = 15,000, second halving = 15,000 / 2 =
7,500)
SagaCoin has total 5% premined from maximum coin supply, which
is 2,100,000 SAGA reserved for developer fund, coin development
such as marketing, exchange listing fee and etc. And most
importantly to ensure staking well for masternode reward in the early
stage.
