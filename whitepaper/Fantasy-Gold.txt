Acknowledgements
Fantasy Gold would not have been possible without the prior works of the respective Bitcoin,
Peercoin, Blackcoin, Talkcoin, Dash, PIVX, and Bulwark teams. We would like to thank these
teams for continuing to improve upon open-source Blockchain technology which has been a
springboard for new innovations and a new digital revolution.
Our most important thanks is to the original DFSCoin community who HODL’ed through it all.
They supported our project and believed in us. They say that Blockchain empowers the people,
but without a community it’s just bits of data in cyberspace.

Introduction
Built by the developers of DFSCoin, the Fantasy Gold Blockchain replaced DFS on April 30th,
2018 through a 1:10 swap as a means of capitalizing on the latest advancements in masternode
technology and decentralized community governance. Fantasy Gold is a peer-to-peer
cryptocurrency serving the growing fantasy sports and eSports industries in both the B2B and
B2C spaces. Functioning as both in-game and prize payout currency for contest entry, Fantasy
Gold also acts as a secure currency payment processing network. This payment processing
network is able to process transactions quickly at only a fraction of the cost compared to
traditional options. By using Fantasy Gold Coin, and it’s open ledger, players can be confident
their deposited funds are safe and used only to pay-out prize pools.
Fantasy and eSports players can secure Fantasy Gold Coins in their own downloadable private
digital wallet. They can then send Fantasy Gold Coins from their unique wallet to their personal
account on fantasy sports sites in order to enter contests. The Fantasy Gold wallet can be
encrypted, backed up, and saved off-line to a USB or other air-gapped device. The wallet only
needs an internet connection to sync with the Fantasy Gold Blockchain, send transactions, or
when used as a staking wallet once the cryptocurrency enters its proof-of-stake phase.
The Fantasy Gold Blockchain is an encrypted structure of data that represents an open financial
ledger and as such, Fantasy Gold deposit addresses can be easily and publicly verified. This
allows site owners to publicly display the total amount of deposited funds being held to cover
prize pools or the total available Fantasy Gold Coins available to cover guaranteed prize pools
and tournament events. Using an open financial ledger, players can be assured that deposited
player funds are properly segregated from company expense accounts.
Fantasy Gold transactions cannot be reversed which eliminates the increasing risks and fees
associated with chargeback fraud. Because the Fantasy Gold Blockchain and network is
decentralized there is no central authority that can freeze funds unlike with traditional
centralized payment processors and banks. In effect merchants, players or even casual holders
of Fantasy Gold Coins are acting as their own bank and payment processor. When end-users
make deposits or purchases using Fantasy Gold Coins, merchants can store funds in coldstorage offline, in a private encrypted desktop wallet, or stowed away on a paper wallet.
Transactions sent offline can still be monitored and confirmed by simply viewing the Fantasy
Gold block explorer.
An open source and free to use Fantasy Gold API will be published on the projects block
explorer. Also free, is the source code for the explorer in the Fantasy Gold public software
repository which is hosted on GitHub along with the full Fantasy Gold source code for public
inspection.

Instead of using traditional centralized payment processing, the Fantasy Gold project does not
charge any additional transaction or service fees to use the payment network. Senders pay a
small transaction fee that is awarded to miners who process the transactions and Masternodes
who verify the transactions. Anyone with access to standard desktop graphics cards can act as
a miner and anyone who holds 10,000 Fantasy Gold Coins can run a Masternode on a basic
VPS, a server or even a raspberry pi with a static IP address.

What is a Blockchain?
A blockchain is the structure of data that represents a financial ledger entry, or a record of a
transaction. Each transaction is digitally signed to ensure its authenticity and that no one
tampers with it, so the ledger itself and the existing transactions within it are assumed to be of
high integrity.
This ledger of past transactions is called the blockchain as it is a chain of blocks. The
blockchain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. The
transactions are collected in blocks, which are found approximately every ninety seconds in a
random process called Mining.
As transactions transfer ownership of Fantasy Gold Coins, each of these blocks represents an
update of the user's balances on the network. By following the blockchain from the Genesis
Block and applying all transactions that were validated in each block in the correct order, you
arrive at the current status quo.
These digital ledger entries are distributed among a decentralized network infrastructure of
masternodes. These additional masternodes and layers in the infrastructure serve the purpose
of providing a consensus about the state of a transaction at any given second; they all have
copies of the existing authenticated ledger distributed amongst them. Masternodes are
authoritative in the sense that they check the work provided by miners.
When a new transaction or an edit to an existing transaction comes in, generally a majority of
the masternodes within a blockchain implementation must execute some algorithms. This
process evaluates and verifies the history of the individual blockchain block that is proposed by
coming to a consensus that the history and signature is valid. Once this stage is complete, then
the new transaction is accepted into the ledger and a new block is added to the chain of
transactions.
Conversely, if a majority of masternodes do not concede to the addition or modification of the
ledger entry, then it is denied and not added to the chain. This distributed consensus model is
what allows blockchain to run as a distributed ledger without the need for some central, unifying
authority dictating what transactions are valid and (perhaps more importantly) which ones are
not.

What is Mining? (Proof- of- Work)
Mining serves two purposes:
1. To verify the legitimacy of a transaction, thereby avoiding “double­ spending”.
2. To create new Fantasy Gold Coins by rewarding miners for performing the previous task.
When sending a transaction this is what happens behind the scenes:
•
•
•
•

Transactions are bundled together into what we call a block.
Miners verify that transactions within each block are legitimate.
To do so, miners should solve a mathematical puzzle known as a Proof -of--Work
problem. A reward is given to the first miner who solves each block’s problem.
Verified transactions are stored in the public blockchain.

This “mathematical puzzle” has a key feature: asymmetry. The work, in fact, must be
moderately difficult for the requester side, yet easy to check for the network. This idea is also
known as a CPU Cost Function, a Client Puzzle, a Computational Puzzle or a CPU Pricing
Function.
All network miners compete to be the first to find a solution for the mathematical problem that
concerns the candidate block. This problem is a problem that cannot be solved in other methods
such as through brute force. Essentially, the problem requires a large number of attempts to
solve.
When a miner finally finds the right solution, they announce it to the network and at the same
time receive a cryptocurrency prize (the reward). In the Fantasy Gold Blockchain’s case a
reward of Fantasy Gold Coins is provided by the protocol.
From a technical point of view, the mining process is an operation of inverse hashing: it
determines a number (nonce), so the cryptographic hash algorithm of block data results in less
than a given threshold.
This threshold, called “difficulty”, is what determines the competitive nature of mining: the more
computing power added to the network, the higher this parameter increases, thereby increasing
the average number of calculations needed to create a new block. This method also increases
the cost of the block creation, pushing miners to improve the efficiency of their mining systems
to maintain a positive economic balance.

What are Masternodes?
Masternodes help secure the Fantasy Gold network by making it more decentralized and
providing a consensus for every transaction.
Masternodes are nodes (servers) that run the Fantasy Gold wallet software that provide
additional services to the network, including instant and private transactions. For providing these
important services, Masternode owners are rewarded a portion of each block. Block rewards will
be split between POS and masternodes. Please see the block rewards and circulation table
below for a breakdown.
These changes in the block reward split and the switch from Proof--of -Work to Proof--of--Stake
happen automatically and are hard -coded into the Fantasy Gold Blockchain and cannot be
changed any one-person, central authority or bad actor. We are able to give the times at which
changes will occur because these events are programmed to take place when the blockchain
reaches a certain height or number of blocks. The Genesis Block, or first block to be created, is
block zero (0) and a new block is created every 90 seconds. The 90 second block spacing
means that 960 blocks will be created every 24 hours.

What is Proof -of- Stake? (PoS)
Unlike the Proof--of -Work (PoW), where the algorithm unfairly rewards mass-miners solving
resource-exhausting mathematical problems with the goal of validating transactions and
creating new blocks at an unevenly distributed rate, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards all holders of
the coin by creating new blocks in a deterministic way, depending on wealth, also defined as
“Stake”.
Once Fantasy Gold switches to a PoS network, wallets holding Fantasy Gold will “Mint” coins by
letting them mature. The minting process involves first holding coins in a wallet, then unlocking
that wallet, and simply staking those coins. Wallets that stake will earn 20% percent of the block
reward, this will begin at block 43201. This algorithm, known as Proof--of-Stake allows users to
generate more coins without the need for any specialized mining hardware or with the expense
of higher electricity costs.
Because of its advantages, PoS is a better protocol than Proof-of-Work to validate transactions
and achieve the same distributed consensus. It is still an algorithm, and the purpose is the same
as Proof-of-Work, but the process to reach the goal is more efficient.

Specifications
Dark Gravity Wave 3.0
Dark Gravity Wave is employed by Fantasy Gold from the start as a method of retargeting PoW
difficulty. It uses a simple moving average that can respond to large nethash increases or dropoffs in just a few blocks. This alleviates the “stuck block effect” often caused by multipools and
prevents one person adding a substantial amount of computing power from instantly solving
more than a few blocks.

NIST5 Hashing
What is NIST5?
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) opened a public competition on
November 2, 2007, to develop a new cryptographic hash algorithm – SHA-3, which augments

the hash algorithms specified in the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180-4,
Secure Hash Standard (SHS). The competition was NIST’s response to advances in the
cryptanalysis of hash algorithms. NIST received sixty--four submissions in October 2008, and
selected fifty--one first- round candidates on December 10, 2008; fourteen second--round
candidates on July 24, 2009; and five third -round candidates – BLAKE, Grøstl, JH, Keccak and
Skein, on December 9, 2010, to advance to the final round of the competition. Eighteen months
were provided for the public review of the finalists, and on October 2, 2012, NIST announced
the winning algorithm of the SHA-3 competition – Keccak.
NIST5 chains together the 5 final-round candidates for SHA-3 hash competition, which were all
selected for their performance & security (BLAKE Grøstl JH Keccak Skein). For more
information on the NIST competition see here:

Feature Set
Masternodes
Masternodes are, a decentralized network of servers that serve the Fantasy Gold blockchain.
Masternodes perform important network functions and receive part of the block rewards.
Masternodes help the Fantasy Gold ecosystem by stabilizing coin supply, processing
transactions, and securing the network. Masternodes require 10,000 Fantasy Gold Coins to
activate and modest technical knowledge to operate. Any Fantasy Gold wallet holding at least
10,000 Fantasy Gold Coins can set up a masternode.
Obfuscation / Coin Mixing
Fantasy Gold has Obfuscation features, based on CoinJoin, coin mixing is done in a
decentralized fashion through masternodes allowing for an additional layer of privacy. While not
perfectly anonymous, Obfuscation via node mixing has security advantages over normal bitcoin
transaction. For example, all Bitcoin transactions are transparent. For Fantasy Gold, if a bad
actor gained control over 50% of the operating masternodes they would still have less than
0.5% chance of de-anonymizing a single transaction that was mixed with 8 rounds of
Obfuscation (Kiraly 2017b). This important feature provides a high -level of anonymity and
security for Fantasy Gold users that elect to obfuscate their transactions
SwiftTX
Masternodes, like simple nodes, are authoritative in nature, but using SwiftTX provides
masternodes with the ability to lock and consensus transactions. When a transaction is
submitted to the network, a group of masternodes validate the transaction. If those masternodes
reach consensus on the transaction’s validity, they are locked for later introduction into the
blockchain, greatly increasing transaction speed compared to conventional systems (like

Bitcoin’s 10-minute block times with multiple confirmations). SwiftTX makes it possible for
multiple transactions to take place before a block on the network is mined with the same inputs.
This system is based on Dash’s InstantSend. (Kiraly 2017a).
Sporks
The Fantasy Gold network employs the multiphase fork mechanism known as “sporking”. This
enables the Fantasy Gold network to implement new features while minimizing the chances of
an unintended network fork during rollout. Spork changes are deployable via the network and
can be turned on and off as necessary without requiring node software updates (strophy
2017). This feature is extremely useful and allows the network to react quickly to security
vulnerabilities.
TOR & IPV6 Masternodes
Fantasy Gold users will be able to run their Masternode from either an onion address or an IPV6
address. With TOR Masternode support, masternodes can be run as a TOR hidden service.
This allows users to operate masternodes out of their home network without revealing their
home IP or location, thereby avoiding dangers of potential cyber-attacks.
Governance System
The Fantasy Gold community is the most important factor behind the long-term success of the
project, and their ability to meaningfully influence the future of the coin is paramount. Delaying
the activation of this system will give us time to develop the underlying framework necessary for
a positive user experience and maximize block rewards available to miners and masternodes.
We will utilize a multi-phase process for creating and submitting proposals. Each step will need
to be fully completed. Failure to complete the steps outlined will likely result in a proposal not
being activated. A basic outline of these steps are as follows:
• Start in our Discord chat and talk with some of the seasoned users. Gauge interest and if the
response is positive, move to the next phase.
• Utilize multiple social media platforms to discuss and get feedback. Remember that Fantasy
Gold has a diverse user base and differing levels of governance participation, reaching a portion
of the user base will often require some footwork. Take note of these discussions and be able to
cite them in the formal pre-proposal. The more citations provided, the better.
• Be open to suggestions from the community and developers. Be flexible and willing to
incorporate external ideas and suggestions in your proposal.
• Create a formal pre-proposal on the Governance->Pre-Proposal section of our website.
Provide citations for all discussions that occurred from the previous step. Treat your preproposal as if it is what will be submitted to the blockchain for voting.
• Upon completion of these steps, you will submit your proposal to the blockchain. Be prepared
for two fees, one at the time of submission and a ballot fee paid to the developer that activates

your proposal on the blockchain. The submission fee is non-refundable, and the balloting fee
will only be paid upon approval and activation of your proposal.
• Everyone is free to adjust their proposal to include the reimbursement cost of these two fees.
Please make sure in your formal proposal you state that you are adding reimbursement to the
stipend requested.
• Be sure to get back in touch with everyone you spoke with so your idea will be voted on. For a
proposal to be paid out, 10% of the eligible masternodes must vote ‘yes’ on your proposal.
This process of getting a 10% consensus can be much harder than it sounds, so be diligent,
informative, and respectful in procuring the votes necessary for your proposal to be paid.

Conclusion
Fantasy Gold Masternodes offer the Fantasy Sports and eSports Industries a platform where
their payment processing gateways will help pay for themselves rather than being an
unnecessary additional cost. Ultimately, Fantasy Gold offers a secure means to save the
Fantasy Sports Industry and the eSports Industry hundreds of millions of dollars per year in
merchant fees. In planned updates its open-source decentralized blockchain allow fantasy
sports developers to build and integrate their own applications, distributed content, and more.
Fantasy Sports developers can already take advantage of our Daily Fantasy Sports API located
at https://api.draftdaily.com
