WHITEPAPER
Version 9.0 – 9 May 2018

Abstract
Across the globe, individuals and governments face the reality that people are not saving
enough to meet their retirement needs. We are living longer, and the implications of
longevity are broader and more urgent than many of us are willing to acknowledge. Globally,
1
life expectancy has grown by nearly 50% since 1950 and 30% since 1980 alone . These
changes are occurring at a time when the need for financial advice has never been greater,
as savers grapple with global and geopolitical uncertainty, prolonged low and negative
interest rates, and longer lifespans.
Retirement savers are often left out of decision making. They are inadequately addressed
and feel disenfranchised. In addition, they are not offered the transparency needed to be
well informed and are treated in a paternalistic manner.
2

Furthermore, client preferences have changed. A recent Accenture study found that clients
increasingly prefer to have a mix of robo and human advisory. In addition, they feel more
and more comfortable to tailor their own portfolios.
However, for many retirement savers, creating a saving portfolio can seem like an
overwhelming task. In recent years, dedicated, but local retirement plan services like
Betterment and Wealthfront or Nutmeg have addressed this need for tailored, transparent
and robo-advisory driven retirement portfolios.
At Auctus we believe we can even go a step further, cutting out all middlemen by utilizing
blockchain and smart contracts, as well as allowing retirement savers to aggregate their
entire retirement savings, from regulated 401k/IRA plans, voluntary traditional investments
as well as cryptocurrency investments. This holistic approach allows running analytics and
robo-advisory on the entirety of savings, enabling the retirement saver to take better
decisions and ultimately reach their saving targets faster.

1 – Vision
Auctus’ mission is to put retirement savers back in control of their retirement plan, by offering
access to a global investment platform that allows users to create optimized portfolios of
bonds, stocks and cryptocurrencies, by providing the information needed to take well
informed decisions, by using blockchain to increase transparency and automation, and
ultimately increasing trust towards the chosen retirement plan.
Robo advisory, transparency, automation and record keeping are thereby an integral aspect
of the Auctus Platform, as well as a marketplace that allows the retirement community to
come together without middlemen.
Auctus’ vision is to create a platform from the community, for the community and aspires to
be as decentralized as possible and as much community driven, owned and managed as
feasible.

2 - Value Proposition
Decision Power
Traditional retirement plans are rigid, leave very little room for decisions and keep their
customers in the dark about performance and fees.
Auctus’ ambition is to provide data transparency, fee transparency as well as validation of
advice. The Auctus Platform was designed to give the users the information needed, take
well informed decisions and ultimately be in control of their retirement savings.

Holistic Approach
Instead of having a regulated retirement plan (such as a 401k/IRA), some investment
platform for equities and bonds and some wallets with cryptocurrencies, users will be able to
consolidate all of their different retirement savings in the Auctus Platform, having full
overview and control.
It will be possible to upload the asset allocation of your regulated 401k/IRA plan, traditional
voluntary investments and combine it with your cryptocurrency investments.
This holistic approach allows the user to focus on the overall risk/return characteristics
instead of analyzing them individually. This offers unparalleled diversification opportunities,
thanks to the low correlation between fiat and crypto assets.
Only a holistic approach will allow retirement savers to obtain the necessary information to
run holistic portfolio analytics and determine the suitable investment strategy to reach their
retirement saving goals faster.

Long-term focus
In comparison to other investment services, Auctus is specialized on retirement saving. This
means the platform is set up with the purpose of long-term saving and payout. Our analytic
tools go beyond classic risk calculations and allow you to model your savings from
contribution amount, time period as well as payout amount.

Removal of cost layers
The Auctus Platform is turning the retirement plan model upside down. Instead of having
multiple cost layers from expensive fund structures, portfolio managers and further
middlemen, we are replacing everything with analytic tools and robo advisory. If desired,
human advisory can be purchased at the best global market rate.

Transparency
Transparency is a buzzword in the blockchain space. However, transparency is more than a
buzzword in the case of Auctus. The retirement plan industry is one of the few industries
which hasn’t been disrupted. Information is often kept hidden and customers aren’t being
informed properly.

4

Offering complete transparency is therefore key, no matter when it comes to investments, or
operating the Auctus platform itself.

Result oriented fee structure
Our robo-advisors and human advisors have a result-oriented fee structure to incentivize
good advice. Users won’t have to pay for mediocre advice.

5

3 - Market Overview
3.1 - Market Size
Worldwide, total retirement plan assets were estimated at USD 36 trillion at the end of 2016.
The US accounts for 62% of global pensions assets, followed by the UK (7.9%) and Japan
3
(7.7%) . Total United States retirement plan assets in 2016 were USD 19.1 trillion, of which
4
roughly 35% was defined contribution and 65% defined benefit plans .

3.2 - Competition
In recent years, dynamic investment platforms, as well as specialized retirement plan
platforms have experienced strong growth as they fill the desire of customers for low fees
and tailored solutions that can be assembled by the user.
We believe that Auctus is positioned in a unique way, bridging between the cryptocurrency
space and specialized retirement saving platforms, while integrating the latest robo-advisory
and analytic features.
To compare Auctus’ positioning in the existing ecosystem, we plotted some of the most
notable companies on two axes, as shown in the chart in Figure 1 below.

The vertical axis ranks the impact on the industry in terms of innovation, the horizontal axis
ranks projects and companies from generalist to specialist. With specialist, we mean

3
4

Towers Watson - Global Pension Assets Study, 2017
Federal Reserve - Statistical Release Report, 2017

6

retirement plan and goal-based investment focus, with tailored analytics and advice for
5
retirement savers .

Cryptocurrency Generalists
Whereas Iconomi is an innovator in terms of being the first cryptocurrency based investment
platform, it is a centralized solution. Melonport and Blackmoon have blockchain based,
decentralized business models and follow a generalist approach, meaning they aren’t
offering dedicated retirement and goal-based investment tools.

Centralized Specialists
Wealthfront, Betterment and Nutmeg are innovators in the retirement space. They all offer
tailored platforms for retirement savers, have innovative robo-advisory and analytic tools.
However, they are all local (Wealthfront and Betterment US only and Nutmeg UK only), they
also are centralized platforms, without the involvement of the community. The tools are static
and cannot be extended or amended by the users.

Traditional Specialists
Companies like Fidelity, Prudential or Vanguard have long-standing reputations in the
retirement asset management space. They offer large-scale solutions. Even though some of
them show interest for new technologies, they are usually late adopters in terms of
technology and won’t be taking any risks for the sake of innovation.

Traditional Generalists
Many banks and investment managers have established online investment tools. Usually,
there is little innovation with these players. They focus more on proven strategies, business
models and technology.
Auctus is positioned as an innovative, decentralized and cryptocurrency specialist, focusing
on the retirement plan and goal-based investment industry, by utilizing the decentralized
nature of the Ethereum network, enabling to be community driven, owned and potentially
even managed and by providing the latest robo advisory and analytic tools to empower
users of the platform.

4 - Issues
4.1 - Challenging Market Environment
Since the financial crisis, the need for financial advice has increased, as existing challenges
are gaining in magnitude and are supplemented with new ones. Volatile markets, record low
yields, aging populations and lack of financial literacy, or access to advice are jeopardizing
the future retirement income of individuals. Incidents that could be absorbed in the
pre-financial crisis environment are now impacting retirement plans more severely and are
thus exposed more frequently.

Record Low Yields
Low interest rates are usually desired, because cheap borrowing costs encourage spending
and capital investments, which fuel economic activity and growth. Low rates also offer relief
for debt-laden governments and consumers, who can now refinance existing loans at better
terms.
However, for retirement plans, low interest rates mean low yields on bonds. Low bond yields
make it harder for retirement plans to secure future income for their members, given that
reserves required to fund future liabilities increase when bond yields decrease. Many
retirement plans have found themselves underfunded because of low bond yields, forcing on
them a hard choice between insolvency and taking on uncharacteristically high investment
risks to escape it.
Low interest rates also lead to higher valuations on equities, which are a major component of
retirement plans’ portfolios. With stocks more expensive, expected future returns are lower,
making the problem of meeting pension promises even more severe.

Aging Population
A demographic crisis for retirement plans, driven by longer life expectancies and declining
birth rates, has now become critical, thanks to historic low bond yields across the world. The
result is enormous deficits. In the US, retirement plans run by companies in the S&P 1500
index were underfunded by $562bn by the end of last month, according to Mercer — nearly
$160bn more than just seven months earlier thanks to further drops in bond yields. For US
public plans — which are allowed to assume far higher interest rates than are available in
the bond market, making their liabilities look unrealistically cheap — the problem is far
worse.

4.2 - Outdated Business Models
Changing Lifestyles
Providers of retirement solutions often have a long history and heritage. Although experience
is important, there is often a lack of innovation and flexibility of adapting to new
circumstances. Lifestyles have changed over the past decades, employees are changing
their employer more frequently and might even change their domicile and jurisdiction over

8

their career. Current retirement systems are not set up for this kind of profile, despite it
becoming a standard.

Lack of Engagement
At a time when the need for financial advice is so great for so many, levels of engagement
6
with financial advisors are disappointingly low . Approximately 17% of individuals surveyed
in both the UK and Germany and 14% of individuals in the Netherlands currently use the
services of an advisor. In the US, only 28% of individuals surveyed use a professional
financial advisor. Further, more than one-quarter of those surveyed who previously used
advice had stopped taking advice because it had become too expensive. Disengagement
with advisors is especially prevalent in jurisdictions where regulators have prohibited
commissions from financial product suppliers (e.g., mutual fund managers) to financial
intermediaries as they seek to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. This lack of consumer
engagement is compounded by low levels of financial literacy, which may negatively
7
reinforce individuals’ willingness to engage with financial advisors .

Inadequate Communication
Many providers of retirement plans treat their members in a paternalistic way. Members get
only occasional updates, without proper engagement, nor the necessary transparency.
Furthermore, members feel as if they are not in control of their retirement saving. Ultimately,
this is leading to a completely disenfranchised customer base that is only loyal due to lack of
alternatives.

4.3 - Existing investment platform issues
Mediocre advice
Without a proven track record of previous advice and a fee structure that allows users to pay
for advice only when the returns are satisfactory, retirement savers might end up paying for
bad advice that will result in retirement income gaps and ultimately by not achieving their
saving target.

Hidden Costs
Most retirement plan members are not aware of all costs involved. Asset management fees
represent only part of overall costs. There are many other costs involved; minimizing these
8
costs can lead to a transparency problem as described by Gail Moss and the IPE .
Retirement costs are comprised of transaction, trading and asset custody fees, but also
include regulation, administration and reporting costs. These costs are often hidden. Hidden
costs reduce net investment returns and can significantly lower funds accumulated for
retirement income.

5 - Why Smart Contracts & Blockchain
Many of the issues affecting the retirement plan industry can be solved by business model
reengineering, others by adding robo-advisory and analytic tools and lastly others by
applying smart contracts and blockchain technology.
At Auctus we are utilizing the Ethereum network in various areas with the following
purposes:

Smart Contract Powered Fee Structure
Smart contracts make it possible to create a result-oriented, transparent and low fee
structure. AUC Tokens stay in a trustless escrow and fees are paid only for periods that
robo-advisor predictions are right. This system also brings fee transparency, allowing each
user to know exactly what they are paying.

Blockchain Robo and Human Advisor Tracking Record
Blockchain’s inherently immutable record-keeping system brings the possibility to provide a
permanent track record of all suggested portfolio allocations and robo-advisor predictions.
So it is possible to explore robo-advisor performance by comparing expected vs actual
returns and against our competitors.

Allowing to be community driven
The Auctus Platform is a community driven platform. This means that eventually, anybody
around the world will be able to create or purchase tools and advice without any middlemen
in between. Ultimately, our goal is to make the entire platform community driven. The
characteristics of the Ethereum network, along with smart contracts allow us to be truly
decentralized and will ultimately empower retirement savers.

Being truly global
We believe that there are significant advantages of having a global community. Not only will
the community be larger and thus more powerful in size, but it will enable to take the best
ideas and products from around the world. Since the Auctus platform will be community
driven and decentralized, it will remain dynamic and adjust to local customs, laws or
preferences. For example, what might be popular in Germany, might not be popular in
Indonesia. On the other hand, there might be a user from China interested in a service from
the US.

Enabling a decentralized market place
Part of the Auctus Platform is a marketplace for retirement apps. Apps that help users to
customize their retirement management dashboard, to analyze data, as well as
robo-advisory apps. Instead of having someone managing the marketplace, we’ll have it
organized as a decentralized marketplace with smart contracts and automated payments
according to smart contract terms.

10

Fee transparency
Needless to say that blockchain allows to increase transparency. Since fee transparency is a
common issue in the retirement plan industry, the Auctus Platform will be offering full fee
transparency.

Payment Gateway
The Ethereum network is allowing for an efficient and global payment network. This will
simplify global standardization and allow for a truly global platform.

Trust
Trust is another issue of the retirement plan industry that Auctus will solve by utilizing the
transparency, record keeping capability and immutability of the blockchain. Furthermore, by
having a global community with various backgrounds and cultures, but a common and global
marketplace, smart contracts that can be audited will increase trust into the platform and its
processes.

Decentralization of ownership, decision making and operational processes
One of the features of the platform is a decentralized marketplace that is
sustained/supported by the community. Token holders using the platform will be able to
evaluate/rank the services and products offered on the marketplace, taking part on the
quality control process.
The platform will also allow users to post, comment and vote for new ideas, such as new
features to be included be the development team or new asset classes that should be
included in the analytic tools.
Ultimately we aspire to even organize the operations in a transparent and decentralized way,
from decision making to accounting. Auctus intends to use Aragon’s platform
(https://aragon.one/), or a similar solution, to achieve this goal.

Tokenization of Assets
As tokenized digital versions of traditional assets become more available, it is becoming
easier to manage traditional investments using the power of blockchain technology and
smart contracts. It is faster, more secure, easier and less costly to trade and store tokens
instead of actual assets, which is a further advantage of being a blockchain and smart
contract driven project.

11

6 - The Auctus Platform
The Auctus Platform is a global smart contract-based retirement and goal-based saving
platform with specialized portfolio management services for traditional equity and bond
investments, as well as cryptocurrency investments.

Source: Auctus Platform

The platform provides the user an aggregated view of all retirement savings, from
government regulated IRA/401k plans, voluntary traditional retirement plans, as well as
crypto wallets. Only by having this holistic view, well informed decisions and a professional
long-term strategy can be established.
In an initial phase (alpha version), all holdings will simply be uploaded virtually. Once all
retirement savings have been uploaded to the platform, the user will be able to run analytics
and robo advisory on the entirety of the retirement savings. At a later stage, it will also be
possible to trade cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets straight from the Auctus Platform,
enabling further features such as automated rebalancing between cryptocurrency and
traditional holdings.
In addition, the Auctus Platform has a marketplace for retirement apps, which allows you to
customize your user experience.

12

The Auctus Platform provides the following features:
●
●
●
●

Allows a mix of traditional and cryptocurrencies investments
Gives the user a holistic overview of all retirement savings
Allows to run and consult analytics and robo-advisory on the entirety of retirement
savings
Enables users to make well informed decisions
Is community run and can be tailored to individual needs with customized apps
Provides transparency and trust

Traditional Assets and Cryptocurrencies
Having a mix of traditional and cryptocurrency assets has multiple advantages ranging from
risk/return aspects to diversification.
A study run by Signal Plot calculated the correlation between 1400 ETFs vs. Bitcoin. The
study calculated a correlation between bitcoin and other financial assets of -0.1 and +0.1,
which is extremely low.

Source: Signal Plot
This is a strong argument for including bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with similar
correlations, as a significant part of a portfolio of risky assets. Finding and adding an
uncorrelated asset to a portfolio can act as a powerful source of diversification by increasing
the portfolio’s ​sharpe ratio​. There are extremely few assets that are this uncorrelated with

13

other assets and that makes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with these correlation
characteristics extremely desirable from a portfolio construction perspective.
The Auctus Platform will be a retirement focused investment platform which will enable users
to construct portfolios consisting of traditional and cryptocurrency assets.

Source: Auctus Platform

Holistic Overview
Holistic ​portfolio construction is all about approaching your investments as all part of a
whole, as opposed to viewing them as separate. The holistic strategy treats the portfolio as
the sum of all its parts, connecting each investment in an overall web of risk and return.
Proper retirement or goal-based saving, requires this holistic view and needs to consider all
factors. That’s why the Auctus Platform will show users all of their holdings in a
straightforward and transparent user interface.
Even though this is a simple feature, traditional retirement saving often doesn’t give this
aggregate view, leaving the retirement saver with a multiple of portfolios and investment
strategies that might be even conflicting and not properly optimized

14

Source: Auctus Platform
Users will have the possibility to virtually upload assets that are managed outside of the
Auctus Platform, such as existing government pensions, IRA or 401k plans.

15

6.1 - Products
The Auctus Platform consists of two products that are accessed both via the same user
interface. Analytics & Advisory, as well as Investment Services.

6.1.1 - Analytics & Advisory
Analytics & Advisory consists of services such as risk analysis, projections and risk/return
metrics, as well as advice ranging from robo and human advisory services, as well as the
apps and services marketplace.

Analytics
Once the user has added the totality of savings to the platform, a suitable portfolio strategy
can be defined.
Users will get an array of tools to analyze their portfolios, including stress testing (scenario
projections), risk metrics, portfolio optimization, crisis hedging, and actuarial analysis. These
tools will help users to have a full understanding of their portfolios.
Projection tools will enable users to get an idea of what to expect based on their chosen
asset allocation and timeframe. We believe this is especially important as nowadays

16

retirement savers are often left alone and have no idea what the long-term impact would be
if they were to change the composition of their retirement portfolios.
See Appendix B for more information on the risk analytics mentioned above.

Robo Advisors
A robo-advisor is an online, automated portfolio management service that follows a set of
rules to choose appropriate investments based on the users risk tolerance and time horizon.
Robo advisors can automatically select investments and build a diversified portfolio. Once
the users funds are invested, the software automatically makes changes to the investments
to align the portfolio back to the chosen target allocation.

17

Source: Auctus Platform
The Auctus robo-advisor provides a variety of services, such as peer analysis and
recommendations based on optimized risk adjusted asset allocations. Users can even give
permission to the robo advisor to automatically make trades that follow a set of rules, such
as tax optimization or diversification adjustments.
The user will be able to add further robo features via the Auctus Marketplace.

Human Advisors
Besides robo advisory, users will be able to consult human advisors whenever they feel a
need for it.
9

KMPG recently did a survey on robo-advisors to find out how the ideal way to offer such
tools would be. Participants were asked to rank the attractiveness of different features and
capabilities:

9

KPMG - Robo advising, 2016

18

In the image above, the three most attractive features according to the survey are illustrated:
the first one was account aggregation - followed by auto investing and the ability to consult a
human advisor when necessary.
Account aggregation was rated with a 4 or 5 on the attractiveness scale by more than 73
percent of participants. Auctus will increase aggregation by treating crypto and traditional
investments as one, allowing to run robo advisory and analytics on the combined portfolio
(crypto/traditional).
Human advisory will also be provided via the Auctus Marketplace, allowing members to
purchase services from human advisors by paying with AUC token.

Marketplace
The Auctus Platform will feature a marketplace with an app store and services store.
The services store will be a marketplace for human advisory. Advisors will be able to offer
their services and earn AUC tokens in return. Retirement savers will have a transparent and
cost-efficient way to get personalized advisory. Users will be able to rate advisors, thus
further increasing transparency.
The Auctus Platform will be an open platform. The community will be able to create widgets,
add-ons and other features and either offer them for free or against an AUC token fee, either
in the form of a small purchase price, or in a freemium model. Users will therefore be able to
get the customized experience they desire.

6.1.2 - Investment Services
Investment Services consist of all trading activities of tokenized traditional and
cryptocurrency assets, as well as related features.

19

Trading
By using the Ethereum network it is possible to create a global contribution gateway in which
users are able to contribute to their voluntary retirement savings using ETH or any other
tokenized ​currency.
The contributions will need to be converted into the assets that compose each user’s
portfolios. The Auctus platform will ultimately have a seamless exchange mechanism using
the 0x open protocol (​https://0xproject.com/)​, ​or a similar mechanism, to trade between any
kind of token on the Ethereum network.
A hybrid approach can be used in the initial phase, connecting to centralized exchange APIs
until the decentralized approach achieves good liquidity.

Tokenization of Traditional Assets
Tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a
blockchain. Currently, there are several projects (such as LAToken, latoken.com) that are
working on getting traditional assets tokenized.
Auctus aims to facilitate trading of traditional assets via tokenized assets. This has the
advantage that all Auctus transactions could be tracked on the blockchain, it would facilitate
24/7 trading and would most certainly bring significant cost advantages.

Automated Portfolio Rebalancing
Automated rebalancing allows users to rebalance their portfolio in an automated way, based
on a set of predefined rules. This can be rebalancing in terms of asset mix, for example in
order to automatically convert cryptocurrencies to fiat investments if the cryptocurrency
allocation surpasses a certain percentage of total holdings, or rebalancing in terms of tax
optimization.
The rebalancing timeframe, as well as the set of rules, are variable and can be predefined by
the user.
Automated rebalancing enables the user to maintain a conservative retirement plan, while
keeping a healthy portion of upside in the overall portfolio, as well as taking tax
considerations into account.

Recurring Funding
Pursuing a long-term saving goal, such as retirement or any other major financial target
requires thorough planning. Small changes can have major impacts in the long-run. A small
difference in return, or slightly smaller contributions towards the savings plan can lead to
major differences in the long run.
To facilitate and smoothen regular funding, Auctus intends to add a feature to automate
regular payments. For fiat contributions, this can be achieved via a bank wire gateway, for
cryptocurrencies a payment request platform, such as Request Network
(​https://request.network​) could be used.

20

7 - Technology
Platform Architecture Overview
Our main architectural goal at Auctus is to build a platform which is able to sustain high
traffic of a global user base. Therefore, the platform should be able to proper escalate on
heavy load moments and, thus, guarantee a fluid and robust experience for our users or API
consumers.
Auctus development team, based on previous experiences of similar platforms and market
best practices, carefully evaluated the best development practices combining cloud /
containerized computing, micro-services and the emerging Ethereum Network technologies.
The overview of this architecture is depicted in the diagram below:

Smart contracts
The backend of the Auctus Platform is built upon the Ethereum Blockchain using smart
contracts developed using the Solidity programming language as the main mechanism to
provide automation, transparency and a result-oriented fee structure.
The smart contract that defines the AUC token is compliant with the ERC-20 and ERC-223
standards.

Technical Paper
Since technology changes rapidly, our paper will evolve over time. We have, therefore,
published a more detailed technical description about the platform architecture and the use
of smart contracts in a separate document: ​Auctus Technical Paper​.

21

8 - Token Model
To unite participants around the platform and assure the quality of third-party tools and
services provided, a utility token was designed: the AUC token. The token fuels the platform
and helps to create a balanced ecosystem.
The Auctus Platform will have built-in goal-based tools and robo advisors, but will also serve
as a marketplace for third-party financial advisory services, allowing users to get tailored
recommendations (how much to invest and asset allocation) from human and robo advisors.
The fundamental role of the AUC Token is to provide a result-oriented, transparent and low
fee structure, aligning the interest of human and robo advisors with savers’ goals and
ensuring transparency.

In addition to being a platform currency, which enables efficient and frictionless transactions
between participants, the AUC token will also be used to help preventing users from paying
in advance for bad services or advice. In cases where the nature of the service or tool
purchased involves portfolio suggestions and predictions (of returns and risk), the transfer of
tokens between the user and the provider can be bound to the results.
The user initially transfers the corresponding amount of AUC tokens to a platform smart
contract where it will be held in escrow. He receives a portfolio recommendation (with asset
distribution according to his profile - desired returns and tolerated risk) and all the
parameters are recorded in the Ethereum blockchain using the platform smart contracts. The

22

AUC held in escrow in exchange for a particular recommendation can be gradually released
to be transferred to the human advisor or developer if the returns meet the predictions, as
well as the fluctuations (volatility) do not exceed tolerated levels of risk. The parameters
such as vesting period and tolerance will be auditable prior to the purchase of the service or
tool. Users can redeem the tokens in case of bad advice. To compare the recorded
predictions with the real results, trusted oracles can be used to record data in the platform
10
smart contracts using, for instance, the Oraclize approach . This user flow is illustrated in
the following diagram.

Source: Auctus - Token Model Illustration
The platform will be exclusively accessible through the AUC token, which is an integral part
of the Auctus Platform. Users holding a higher amount of AUC tokens in escrow can have
access to additional and/or premium features and lower annual fees for built-in features.
However, AUC token cannot be used for investing in the assets through the platform, nor
can be exchanged for (converted into) such instruments in the future. Any portfolio
investments shall be done through other means e.g. fiat money, cryptocurrencies.

10

23

8.1. Who should use AUC tokens
Retirement savers
Everyone interested in getting access to a goal based savings platform with built-in analytic
tools and robo advisors will need AUC tokens held in escrow to create portfolios, use
planning tools, hire services from the marketplace and pay low annual fees. Users will be
able to create custom portfolios with an automated rebalancing of assets and a mix of
traditional assets and cryptocurrencies.

Financial advisors
To be listed in the human advisory marketplace, users will also need to hold AUC in escrow.
Tokens are locked as collateral to enforce good behavior (advisors can be penalized for not
completing/providing a service or for any kind of malicious behavior). Customers in the
marketplace can choose advisors according to their ranking position, price and service
description. Services are paid using AUC tokens through smart contracts, and customers
that used the services can evaluate the advisors.

Developers
The first version of the platform will have built-in robo advisory and risk analysis tools
developed by the Auctus team and its partners. Shortly after, it will be possible to offer third
party plugins/add-ons developed by community members holding AUC token in escrow.
These will be offered in a second marketplace, a Retirement App Marketplace, intended to
decentralize the development and maintenance of risk analysis tools, robo advisors,
notification and alert plugins and any other kind of enhancement tool for retirement savers to
track their portfolio, optimize their results or get a better projection.

8.2. Legal status of AUC token
AUC token is a functional utility token designed specifically for the Auctus Platform. AUC
token is not a security and we do not recommend buying AUC tokens for speculative, or
investment purposes.
You should buy AUC tokens to participate in the Auctus Platform. AUC token do not grant
the right to receive any profits, income, payments, returns, dividends from Auctus Project
Inc, or any entity from its group of companies, nor is it intended to be a digital currency,
security, commodity, bond, debt instrument or any kind of financial instrument or investment
carrying equivalent rights. Accordingly, any protections offered by the law in respect to the
purchase, holding, or sale of the instruments and investments referred to above shall not
apply to your purchase, holding, or sale of AUC tokens.
AUC tokens are sold as a software product under the laws of British Virgin Islands. We do
not recommend purchasing AUC tokens, unless you have prior experience with

24

cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based software. Once you purchase AUC tokens, they
cannot be refunded.
U.S. and Singapore persons, residents, green card holders, same as citizens and residents
of Kuwait and People’s Republic of China are not allowed to participate in AUC Token sales,
or to purchase AUC tokens, AUC tokens may not be purchased for, or on behalf of any such
person. The term “U.S. and Singapore persons” refer to any person or entity – resident of
the U.S.A. and Singapore, including those citizens that live abroad. If necessary, Auctus may
reimburse any U.S. and Singapore persons who bought AUC tokens.
It is the liability of the user to ensure that the funds used to purchase AUC token were not
derived from, invested for the benefit of, or related in any way to the governments of, or any
Persons within, any country under a U.S. embargo enforced by OFAC, or any Persons who
are named on the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons maintained
by OFAC, or EU Restrictive measures (sanctions) list, or on any other similar list maintained
by OFAC, EU Counsel, EU Commission pursuant to any authorizing statute, executive order,
or regulation.

9 - Go to Market Strategy
Auctus aims to penetrate the market as first mover. Auctus is an innovative global retirement
plan platform, as well as a leading Blockchain and Ethereum Smart Contract based
retirement plan provider. Following a fast market entry, the ultimate goal is to capture a
substantial market share of the USD 36 trillion global retirement industry.
Our go to market strategy follows a multi pillar approach. Initially, we intend to target private
retirement investments and individual retirement plans. This allows us a fast market entry on
a global scale with relatively low regulatory hurdles. In a second phase, we plan to enter
employer-sponsored retirement plans. This second phase requires local adaptation and will
face a lot of regulatory constraints.
Our first phase is designed to create a global movement, which should facilitate the launch
of phase two.

Level 1 – Early Adopter Platform
The initial level is targeted at early adopters: users with an interest in Fintech and
cryptocurrency. This initial solution will enable users to create retirement portfolios with a mix
of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. Subsequently, users will be able to run analytics
and get consulted by robo advisory, assuring maximum transparency.
To simplify and accelerate a global market rollout, the first level will feature a virtual upload
of assets. Thus funds won’t be stored on the Auctus Platform itself. It will be possible to
virtually upload existing traditional retirement plans, or savings portfolios, as well as existing
cryptocurrency positions and subsequently consult robo advisory and analytics

26

Level 2 – Cryptocurrencies
Level 2 will have all features of level 1, but the platform will be holding cryptocurrency
investments.
Having control over the asset allocation will unlock new features such as automated
rebalancing.

Level 3 – Crypto and Traditional Assets
Level 3 will have all features of level 1 and 2, with the addition of traditional investments.
Access to traditional investments will be granted by giving access to traditional portfolios, by
either collaborating with a third-party or creating the portfolios itself.
Combining cryptocurrencies and traditional assets will allow the user for example to keep the
crypto allocation at a maximum of 10% in an automated way.

Level 4 – Individual Retirement Plans
Level 4 will be the entry into regulated retirement plans. We plan to first enter the individual
retirement plans market, as this is relatively lightly regulated.
Despite the likelihood that regulators do not allow cryptocurrency as an asset class in
retirement plans, we will be able to provide portfolios mixing traditional assets with
cryptocurrencies.
From an operational point of view, we will create two portfolios. A traditional portfolio, in line
with prevailing laws and regulations, as well as a cryptocurrency portfolio that will be entirely
private and non-regulated.
However, our robo advisory and analytic tools will be treating the regulated and crypto
assets with the same holistic overview as described previously. This will allow the user to
simulate and analyze the optimal mix of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. In the case
of tax-exempt defined contribution plans, this also allows the user to secure the maximum
feasible amount of tax deductibility.

12 - Development Milestones
Auctus will develop a series of releases with increasing complexity and features. The
purpose of the development strategy is to be positioned as the first mover in the blockchain
retirement plan market, as well as keeping maximum upside to evolve in a fully integrated
platform.

12.1 - Auctus Demo
The first development milestone for Auctus was the release of the demo platform
(​https://demo.auctus.org/)​, which was released on Nov 7​th​, 2017. The demo was created to
illustrate the emulation of retirement plan constraints, for example 401(k) plans, into smart
contracts using the Ethereum Network.
The demo was developed in C#, using the .NET Core cross-platform and open-source
framework. The idea was to create a friendly user interface using the MVC pattern to
simulate a retirement plan where the backend code dynamically generates and deploys
smart contracts in the Ethereum test network Rinkeby.

33

The processor power was divided into 2 servers: one for the web layer of the application and
the other for running Ethereum nodes. The communication between the servers is made
through a shared database. The client communicates with the Front Web Server nodes, that
save client’s data in the database. Geth Node Servers subsequently receive this data,
publish the smart contracts and generate Rinkeby Network transactions. After that, both
servers initiate a polling process to monitor contracts/transaction creation and update client
data.

In the demo, the user is able to input the constraints of the simulated employer-sponsored
retirement plan (employer match rate and ceiling, as well as vesting period) and define a
static asset allocation for the plan. Certain assumptions and simplifications were made, such
as historical data to simulate portfolio returns and the static allocation used.

34

Source: Auctus Demo
Afterwards, a smart contract is generated using a template where the chosen parameters
are replaced in the code and the contract is deployed in the Ethereum testnet (users are
able to track contract creation and transactions using​ ​https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/​).

35

Source: Auctus Demo
The final step of the demo is the user dashboard, where it is possible to simulate
contributions (all deposits are represented by Ethereum transactions in the testnet) and track
portfolio performance in a total of five years.

Source: Auctus Demo
The result is shown in a chart that is updated every time a transaction is confirmed in the
testnet. The links to all transactions are shown in a table and it is possible to track them on
Etherscan.

36

Source: Auctus Demo
At any moment, it is possible to end the simulation withdrawing the funds (also recorded on
Ethereum testnet) and the amount the user will get respects the vesting rules and the period
simulated.

37

12.2 - Auctus Alpha
The next development milestone is the release of an alpha version of the platform.

The alpha will illustrate the portfolio recommendation features of the full platform, as well as
the human advisory marketplace. Users will be able to set their goals and get a portfolio
recommendation with expected returns. They will also be able to register themselves as
advisors and make projections for different portfolios. Those recommendations will be
offered in a public marketplace.
Some of the architectural aspects used in the demo and the lessons learned are useful for
the alpha, but at the same time a lot is being improved. The transition from the alpha to the
full platform will include adjustments based on alpha testing and feedback from the
community.

12.3 - Development of the automated investment product
In parallel with releasing the alpha platform, the development team is planning the inclusion
of investment features, such as asset management, automated portfolio rebalancing and
exchange execution.
The idea is to treat the two core groups of functionalities in the platform as separate products
that will be later combined to give the users the full experience. The first group consists of
analytics, robo and human advisory marketplace and the tools and dashboard to track
performance. The second group consists of asset management, automated investments,
recurring funding and exchange between tokenized assets.
The third milestone is to start the development of the features in the second group of
functionalities, which will be guided by the definitions made together with the business
development team, such as applying for licenses, partnering with providers of tokenized
11
traditional assets, integrating with a decentralized exchange protocol (0x protocol ) and

11

https://0xproject.com/

38

integrating with other platforms that might provide functionalities that are out of the scope of
Auctus platform.

12.4 - Blockchain and token integration
After thoroughly testing the alpha and gaining feedback from the community and advisors,
the next milestone is to integrate the AUC token with the platform and deploy it on the
Ethereum network.

12.5 - Auctus Beta
The beta platform will consist of all alpha features, including improvements and adjustments
made during the testing period, plus the robo advisory marketplace, additional built-in tools,
all integrated with smart contracts and using the AUC token as the only payment
mechanism.
The Auctus Beta will be released on Ethereum mainnet. The trading and asset management
features will be gradually added on later releases and updates.

39

13 - Token Sale & Allocation
Auctus conducted a token sale between 20 to 31 March and 10 to 17 April 2018. The
intention was to conduct the token sale in a best practice approach, according to the
following principles:

No Offloading of Ethers
We have seen many other companies exchanging Ethers (ETH) for fiat currencies right after
the token sale, thus placing downwards pressure on ETH’s price. We believe that the
strength of the Ethereum network and community is an integral part of our success. We view
ETH offloading as unhealthy for the market and also economically disadvantageous for our
project. We therefore keep our funds to a large extend in ETH and only exchange to
conventional currency whenever expenses need to be made. To guarantee this, our raised
Ethers are locked by smart contract and vested as follows:
● 40% of raised ETH after token sale
● 5% of raised ETH per month

Vested AUC Token for Team Members
The entire Auctus team has vested AUC token to incentivize fundamental long-term
success. Auctus has a long-term vision and wants to significantly grow the community over
the years. To guarantee this, team members have vested AUC tokens to make sure there is
a strong incentive to reach milestones and achieve long lasting success.
AUC Tokens for Auctus team members are vested as follows:
●
●

2-year vesting period
6 month cliff

This means Auctus team members aren’t able to transfer AUC token immediately after the
token sale.

Token Sale Summary
●
●
●

Token Sale conducted between 20 - 31 March and 10 - 17 April 2018
Total of 6,656.2 ETH raised
Total of 17,917,657.55 AUC distributed

Token Supply (as of 9 May 2018)
●
●

Total Supply: 65,829,657.55 AUC
Circulating Supply: 17,917,657.55

40

13.2 - Token Allocation
Note: On 17 April 2018, at close of Token Sale, 74.3% of public contributor tokens were
burned, reducing the original total supply from 106,000,000 to 65,829,657.55 AUC. The
following allocations are still being displayed as pre-burning values.

Public Contributors (51%)
51% of all tokens will be made available to the community. The intention is to create a
diverse and strong community with the maximum amount of long-term supporters, ideally
with an interest of using the Auctus Platform.
Tokens will be immediately transferable after close of token sale.

Auctus Core Team (20%)
20% of AUC supply will be allocated to Auctus’ Core Team (founders, early backers and the
development team) for a long-term alignment of interests.
Vesting: 2 year vesting with 6 month cliff. This means tokens will ​not be immediately
transferable.

Reserve for Future Stakeholders (18%)
To allow for possible capital raises in the future, 18% of tokens will be reserved for future
stakeholders. This stakeholder reserve will be locked via smart contract for 12 months. It will
only be used if there is a need, or opportunity, to accelerate the growth of the company. This
reserve can be used for strategic partnerships, to encourage the adoption of the Auctus
Platform and the provision of capital in case of excessive devaluation of ETH. If deemed
unnecessary, these tokens will be burned.

Partnerships and Advisory (9%)
9% of tokens are allocated for partners and advisors.
Vesting: 80% of tokens with 6 month vesting and 3 month cliff. 20% of tokens will be
immediately transferable after the close of token sale.

Bounties (2%)
Max of 2% of tokens are allocated for bounty campaigns to help us spread the word about
Auctus: Bitcointalk Signatures, Bitcointalk Translation, Facebook, Twitter, blog articles,
media publication, thread support, etc.

41

14 - Use of Proceeds

Product Development (42%)
The main use of funds will be to release the Auctus platform. If the minimum cap is reached,
the development will continue with current team size and current offices.
The 42% allocated for product development includes:
● Software licenses and server expenses;
● Design (UI / UX);
● Office expenses;
● Salaries;
● Security audits / technical due diligence.
In the case where more than the minimum is reached, Auctus will be able to expand the
development and design teams and move ahead faster.

Business Development (28%)
There is a big challenge ahead of us to get where we want to be, as we have the intention of
expanding the MVP to the full platform with asset management and automated investments.
We will use 28% of the funds raised for this. The business development costs include:
● Hiring specialized law firms to help us with regulatory and licensing frameworks for
the investment platform and entering retirement markets;

42

●
●
●
●
●

Educate users on the use of the platform;
Secure strategic partnerships with other companies and projects, both traditional and
blockchain;
Onboard of more business advisors, new clients,
Sales staff;
Travel expenses to attend conferences and events.

Communication and Marketing (18%)
We will have PR partners and run marketing campaigns to increase platform adoption and
project awareness. The allocation of 18% of funds raised for this includes:
● Building local communities (marketing campaigns in different languages aiming at
different markets);
● Keep the social networks and communication channels updated and well managed;
● Produce videos;
● Regular press releases with project updates.

Other Expenses (12%)
We estimate that other costs that are not directly related to development, business or
marketing will consist of 12% of the total. Those expenses include administrative and
operational costs, human resources consultancy for expanding the team, a small reserve for
unforeseen events and other services (calls, printing, Ubers, etc).

43

15 - Marketing Strategy
Auctus plans to be the first mover in the retirement cryptocurrency / robo-advisory space.
This allows us to run a tailored marketing strategy that is based on three pillars:

Targeting Innovators and Influencers
We are initially targeting tech-savvy consumers with lower barriers of entry. Employees of
other cryptocurrency projects, that seek to have an innovative retirement solution will be our
initial target clients.
Innovators, the alpha-dog of influencers, take pride in being the first to know about, try
and/or have something before everyone else. We will target this client segment by working
with targeted social media articles, but without banners. Quality marketing and getting
referrals from influencers will be at the center of our marketing strategy.

Fintech and Retirement Plan Events
As we’re an innovative product, we can relatively easily get featured in retirement and
Fintech magazines/websites. To increase chances of publication, we plan to take part in
major Fintech events as well as retirement plan conferences.

Social Media
As a third pillar of our marketing strategy, we intend to launch targeted social media
campaigns, aimed at the cryptocurrency community. A mix of information, education and
gamification of our platform should get the necessary intention and traction.

Disclaimers and Risks
THIS WHITEPAPER SETS FORTH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PLANNED AUCTUS
PLATFORM AND THE USE OF AUC TOKENS, WHICH IS BEING PROVIDED FOR
INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS WHITEPAPER IS NOT A BINDING LEGAL
AGREEMENT OR DOCUMENT OF A SIMILAR NATURE. AUC TOKEN SALE SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY A SEPARATE LEGAL AGREEMENT “TERMS OF AUC TOKEN SALE”,
AVAILABLE ON AUCTUS’ WEBSITE. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN TERMS
OF AUC TOKEN SALE AND THIS WHITEPAPER, THE TERMS OF AUC TOKEN SALE
SHALL GOVERN. THIS WHITEPAPER DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN ADVICE NOR A
RECOMMENDATION BY AUCTUS, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MANAGERS,
EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS OR CONSULTANTS, OR ANY OTHER PERSON TO
ANY READER OF THIS WHITEPAPER AS TO THE PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN
SALE.
PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN SALE CARRIES SUBSTANTIAL RISK AND MAY
INVOLVE SPECIAL RISKS THAT COULD LEAD TO A LOSS OF ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL
PORTION OF CONTRIBUTION. IF YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT AS TO THE ACTION YOU
SHOULD TAKE, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR LEGAL, FINANCIAL, TAX OR OTHER
PROFESSIONAL ADVISOR AND IMMEDIATELY NAVIGATE AWAY FROM AUCTUS’
WEBSITE; DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE AUC TOKEN SALE IN THIS CASE.

No potential use
As of the date of this whitepaper publication, AUC Token has no known potential uses
outside of the Auctus Platform and is not permitted to be sold or otherwise traded on
third-party exchanges.

Risk of loss
Do not participate in the Token Sale unless you are prepared to lose the entire amount you
contributed for purchasing AUC Tokens. AUC Tokens should not be acquired for speculative
or investment purposes with the expectation of making a profit or immediate resale.
No promises of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to AUC Tokens,
including no promise of continuing payments, no promise of inherent value and no guarantee
that AUC Tokens will hold any particular value. Unless prospective participants fully
understand and accept the nature of Auctus Platform and the potential risks inherent in AUC
Tokens, they should not participate in the Token Sale.

Third party data
This whitepaper includes references to third party data and industry publications. Auctus
believes that this industry data is accurate and that its estimates and assumptions are
reasonable; however, there are no assurances as to the accuracy or completeness of this

45

data. Although the data are believed to be reliable, Auctus has not independently verified
any of the data from third party sources referred to in this whitepaper or ascertained the
underlying assumptions relied upon by such sources.

Legal uncertainty
Auctus is in the process of undertaking a legal and regulatory analysis of the functionality of
AUC Tokens. Following the conclusion of this analysis, Auctus may decide to amend the
intended functionality of AUC Tokens in order to ensure compliance with any legal or
regulatory requirements to which it is subject. In the event that Auctus decides to amend the
intended functionality of AUC Tokens, Auctus will update the relevant contents of this
whitepaper and upload the latest version of this to its website at auctus.org. AUC Tokens
could be impacted by regulatory action, including potential restrictions on the ownership,
use, or possession of such tokens, which may demand that the structure or application of
AUC Tokens be altered, all or in part. Auctus may revise mechanics to comply with
regulatory requirements. Nevertheless, Auctus believes that it has taken all commercially
reasonable steps to ensure that its planned mechanics are proper and in compliance with
currently considered regulations.
Auctus’ intended activities are subject to various laws and regulations in the countries where
it operates or intends to operate. Auctus might be obliged to obtain different licenses or other
permissive documents in each jurisdiction where it intends to operate its business, therefore,
Auctus’ business in such jurisdictions shall always be subject to obtaining such licenses or
permissive documents, if so directed by applicable laws. There is a risk that certain activities
may be deemed in violation of any such law or regulation. Penalties for any such potential
violation would be unknown. Additionally, changes in applicable laws or regulations or
evolving interpretations of existing law could, in certain circumstances, result in increased
compliance costs or capital expenditures, which could affect Auctus’ ability to carry on the
business model and the AUC Tokens model proposed in this whitepaper.

Forward looking statements
This Whitepaper, content of Auctus’ website, press releases, public statements etc. may
contain forward looking statements, i.e. statements related to future events. Forward looking
statements often address the expected future business and financial performance of Auctus,
the performance and effectiveness of Auctus Platform, often contain words such as “expect”,
“intend”, “plan”, “believe”, “will”, “would”, “ultimately”. All statements regarding Auctus’
financial position, business strategies, plans, future functionality of the Auctus Platform and
prospects and the future prospects of the industry which Auctus is in, are forward-looking
statements. Such forward looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to
different degrees, uncertain. Auctus undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking
statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this whitepaper. Auctus cannot
guarantee that any forward looking statements made by it or expected results of operation of
Auctus Platform will correlate with the actual future facts or results. You must understand
that Auctus Platform may not have all of the expected functionality. Auctus does not take any

46

responsibility in regards to the functional capabilities of Auctus Platform, which is provided
“as is”.

Risk of theft
Auctus will make every effort to ensure that the funds received from the Token Sale are
securely stored and held. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, there is no assurance that there will
be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, sophisticated cyber-attacks,
distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the Auctus’ website, in
the smart contract(s) on which the escrow wallet and the Token Sale rely, on the Ethereum
or any other blockchain, or otherwise. Such events may include, for example, flaws in
programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. In such event, even if
the Token Sale is completed, Auctus may not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised
and\or use such funds for the development of the Auctus Platform. In such case, the
development and launch of the Auctus Platform might be temporarily or permanently
curtailed. As such, distributed AUC Tokens may hold little worth or value.

Technological risks
An open-source development comes with risks related to hacking and cyber attacks that can
cause a negative impact. To mitigate that risks the team will be allocating resources in
auditions and security tests, to ensure the platform's safety.
Also blockchain development is relatively new and there will be a challenge requiring human
resources with this specific knowledge.
In addition, as Auctus plans to have a fully system-controlled marketplace there is a risk that
robo advisor platform can't adapt to increasing business volumes and changes. To mitigate
this we plan to allocate resources in server scaling and have 24/7 infra support.

Business risks
Having a technology-based platform might reduce the amount of clients Auctus can reach.
Some investors are still reluctant in trusting your portfolio's investment in a robo advisor than
in a human expert. To mitigate that risk we are also implementing the possibility of human
experts developing portfolio suggestions to the platform. Another risk involved is regarding
investment's goal and investor's risk. Since those parameters are inside the platform that can
be a misunderstanding in assets allocations according to the investor's real needs.

Risks related to the functioning of Auctus Platform
The Auctus Platform shall be operated by another entity from Auctus’ group of companies,
and any events or circumstances which adversely affect it or any of its successor operating
entities may have a corresponding adverse effect on the Auctus Platform. Such adverse
effects would correspondingly have an impact on AUC Tokens.
Auctus Platform may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in its network or
services, hardware or software defects, security breaches or other causes that could
adversely affect the Auctus Platform.
47

No warranty
Auctus does not make, or purport to make, and hereby disclaims, any representation,
warranty or undertaking in any form whatsoever to any entity or person, including any
representation, warranty or undertaking in relation to the truth, accuracy, and completeness
of any of the information set out in this whitepaper.

Unanticipated risks arising from the AUC Tokens

Appendix A: Historical Context
First Retirement Plans
The history of retirement plans goes as far back as Ancient Rome (753 BC to 476 AD),
where soldiers were guaranteed income after they retired. The first pension funds were
recorded in the 17th century in Germany. For example, in 1645, ​Duke Ernest the Pious of
Gotha​, founded a widows' fund for clergy, and another for teachers in 1662. Subsequently,
various schemes of provision for ministers' widows were established throughout Europe
around the start of the eighteenth century. Some were based on a single premium, others
based on yearly premiums to be distributed as benefits in the same year.

First Pension Plan in Europe
The first national pension plan was enacted in 1889 by the Prussian Chancellor Otto von
Bismarck. Pension payments started at the age of 70, decreased to 65 in 1916. Although
notoriously named ‘iron chancellor’, Bismarck also introduced an individual basic income
insurance for the elderly, injured and ill in 1889. In England, the first ‘old age’ state pension
was introduced in 1908. In The Netherlands, the Dutch Civil Servants Pension Fund (ABP),
now among the five largest pensions funds in the world, was founded in 1922.

First Pension Plan in the US
In the US, public pensions got their start with various ‘promises’, some informal and some
legislated, made to veterans of the ​Revolutionary War (1775) and, more extensively, the
Civil War (1861). The first corporate pension in the U.S. was established by the American
Express Company in 1875. The plan applied to workers who had been with the company for
20 years of service, and had reached age 60. By 1950, nearly 10 million Americans – or
about 25 percent of the private sector workforce – had a pension. Ten years later in 1960,
about half of the private sector workforce had one.

Defined Benefit Plans
After a few pension plans began to fail, the government-enacted ​Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974 made pension plans more secure by establishing legal
participation, accountability and disclosure requirements. With ERISA came the ​Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation​, which insures employee benefits should a pension plan fail.
This type of guaranteed pension came to be known a defined benefits plan. Workers knew
exactly how much they would get in retirement, because it was a defined dollar amount or
percentage of salary.

Defined Contribution Plans
In 1978, the so-called 401(k) retirement plan was introduced in the US. The 401(k) is a
well-known example of a ‘defined contribution plan’. In defined contribution plans, the

50

employee bears the risk attached to his or her retirement benefits. In return, the employee
has more control over his or her retirement investments than in the case of a defined benefit
plan. Other examples of defined contribution plans are 403(b) plans, 457 plans and Thrift
Savings Plans.

Pension Funds in a Changing World
After World War II, state pension schemes became more widespread. Simultaneously,
corporate pension funds gained prominence. Liberalization of financial markets and
privatization of pension schemes in the 1980s and 1990s brought the sector a more
prominent role in money markets and capital markets. Following the credit crisis, volatile
financial markets and increasing regulation force retirement plans to rethink their future.
Simultaneously, increasing mobility, individualization and technological change confront
retirement plans with new challenges.

Appendix B: Analytics & Projection Tools
This section provides information on the risk analytics that will be available on the Auctus
Platform.

Stress testing (Scenario Projections)
Users can view the estimated performance of their portfolios, and of the assets in their
portfolio, under various macro-economic scenarios and over any time range. If a users
wished, robo-advising algorithms will proactively run scenarios for users and alert them to
possibly important results.
Scenarios can consist of various components. They can contain shocks to assets or
macro-economic indicators. For example, US inflation could be shocked positively, thus
creating a “high inflation scenario”, allowing the user to see how high inflation would affect
his portfolio’s performance. Scenarios can also specify hypothetical trajectories for
macro-economic indicators. For example, a scenario could specify that the oil price goes to
100 US dollars in the coming year. Again, the estimated effect of this development on the
user’s portfolio would be instantly available.
The third component of macro-economic scenarios are various kinds of economic behavior.
For example, the Federal Reserve Bank can be explicitly modelled as a central bank
controlling the US interest rate based on its monetary policy. By including such explicit
behavioral modelling in scenario projections, they become less reliant on “black box”
statistical projections, more realistic, and better able to present users with the actual risks
that their portfolios face. The scenario generator used by Auctus is unique in its ability to
combine advanced statistical modelling with economic behavior.
The scenarios available to users on the Auctus platform can combine shocks, hypothetical
trajectories and economic behavior in arbitrary ways. Predefined scenarios will be available
to users who want to quickly stress-test their portfolios. Advanced users can also change
predefined scenarios, or build new scenarios of their own. Users will have the ability to share
scenarios they have created on the platform.
Scenarios can be calculated over any time range. Some users may be interested in the
near-term effects of certain shocks, say in the next 6 to 12 months. Others may select a
much longer horizon, say 5 – 10 years, to see how a scenario affects the value of their
portfolio as they get closer to actual retirement.

Risk Metrics
The following risk metrics will be available for users’ portfolios. All metrics are available
based on historical data (backward looking) or scenarios (forward looking):
1.​ ​Risk & return:
Portfolio return and its volatility. The full probability distribution of returns is available
for advanced users.

52

2.​ ​ Value-at-risk:
The portfolio return such that only in a certain, low percentage of cases compounded
return will be lower.
3.​ ​Expected shortfall:
The expected portfolio return in a certain, low percentage of worst cases.
4.​ ​Maximum drawdown:
The maximum decline in portfolio return.
5.​ ​Impact on risk-return profile:
Comparison of a portfolio’s risk and return with a fixed, e.g. historical, risk-return
profile. For example, if the risk and/or return of a user’s portfolio significantly
worsens, the user can be alerted so he or she is able to make changes.
6.​ ​Portfolio calculator:
Simulation of a portfolio’s value given intended monthly or yearly deposits or
withdrawals.

Portfolio Optimization
Users will be able to optimize their portfolios’ asset weights under various well-known
measures. These include the Sharpe Ratio, Information Ratio, Sortino Ratio and M2.
Optimization can be done based on historical data or scenarios. Advanced users have
access to the full efficient frontier, giving risk-minimizing portfolios at desired portfolio
returns.
Users are able to add asset weight restrictions to the optimization. For example, they can
specify that a certain cryptocurrency’s weight should be between 5% and 10% of the
portfolio. Also, users can construct subportfolios. A user may for example have a
“cryptocurrency subportfolio”, next to a subportfolio of traditional assets. In the optimization,
the weights of the subportfolios might be changed, but their internal compositions remain
fixed.
A user may also be interested in only a partial optimization of his or her portfolio. For
example, the user may consider selling a traditional asset and buying a cryptocurrency, but
keeping the rest of the portfolio unchanged. Such a “bilateral optimization” will be possible.
Moreover, the user will be presented with the best possible alternatives for an asset he or
she is considering selling. These alternatives will be taken from a large international dataset
covering all major investment assets.

Crisis Hedging
Users may be specifically interested in protecting their portfolios’ performance under adverse
economic circumstances. In order to do this, they are offered a list of the best crisis-hedging
assets tailored to their portfolios. Adding one or more of these assets to their portfolios
provides a diversification of risk when it is needed the most.
