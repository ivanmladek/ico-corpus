1. Background Introduction
In the future, idealized global luxury, jewelry and artwork trading
system should be based on fair, open and transparent product
information as well as highly efficient trading environment. The
combination of block’s decentralized system and AI (Artificial

intelligence) image recognition technology can fully meet the
above requirements. We have developed the RC product
based on the above two aspects. The full name is RealChain.

The RealChain foundation is the R & D and operator of
RealChain products. It will work closely with TaoDangPu
holdings to develop a new generation of high-end consumer
goods trading system. RealChain product aims to improve
transaction transparency and reduce fraud risk and transaction
cost by block chain technology and AI technology in the trading
scene of luxury goods, jewelry and art.

In the whole operation system of foundation, we hope that all
members of the entire ecosystem will be able to participate in
the management. Our vision for the future is to build RealChain
into a public product based on high-end consumption, so as to
provide secure and reliable business services for system
members.

2. Market and Opportunity
The latest report released by Bain & Company and Italy Luxury
Industry Association shows that the global luxury consumption
scale will reach 249 billion euros in 2016, in which Chinese
account for 32% and is the largest consumer group.

Latest release information by Euro Monitor International: Global
sales of global jewelry are $316 billion for 2016.
In 2016, global art auctions totaled $12.45 billion, with China
holding the world's largest share for $4.8 billion.

In addition, the volume of the global used high-end consumer
goods is also quite huge. According to statistics, second-hand
transactions will reach more than 20% of the new trade volume.

2.1. Huge pain buried under the hundreds of billions of
dollars in the trading market

At present, the opaqueness of high-end luxury goods trading is
very serious and information is quite opaque. There are three
pain points in the whole field of circulation: high risk of
transaction fraud; information opaqueness; Low efficiency and

high cost of appraisal and evaluation.

2.2. High Risk of Trade Fraud

At present, forgery and counterfeit sales are serious due to the
advanced fraud technology and the consumer's lack of
knowledge on luxury goods, jewelry, and art.

The cost of some high-end imitation is about 10% of the real
goods price. For example, the genuine Hermes leather bag
costs 10 thousand dollars, while the cost of high imitation
goods is even more than 1000 dollars. Imitation technology
become more sophisticated due to the increased costs, which
is impossible for consumers to defend effectively.

As what has been showed as follows, it’s basic Cartier "blue
balloon" series of men. The pseudo control chart is generated
based on the amplification results in 3-10 times. For the
inexperienced consumers, it is too difficult to identify the real
goods.

Figure 2. Authentic and pseudo luxury goods comparison chart

2.3. Information Opacity
At present, no matter new or second-hand goods, the opacity of
high-end luxury goods transaction is quite serious, including:
the opaque transaction price, the opaque source of goods and
the opaque transaction records.

The price of luxury goods or jewelry can be different due to
different colors or materials. As consumers have little
knowledge and lack of experience about these goods, the sales
prices are sometimes determined by man.

For example, Hermes crocodile skin "Birkin bag" is potentially
designed with grade mark in the bag opening:

Grade “Λ” represents that materials come from wild crocodile.
Thus, the price can be the highest.

The logo “。。” represents that materials come from the
domestically reared crocodile.

If "S" is marked under Made in France, the bag is a discounted
item.
The seemingly same crocodile skin bag may have different
materials, technical qualities or prices. However, not all
consumers know about this.

2.4. Low Efficiency and High Cost of Appraisal and
Evaluation

At present, luxury jewelry appraisal is mainly concentrated with
a few appraisal institutions. Except for a few jewels that can be
queried for appraisal reports, there is no inquiry record for
luxury goods. It is impossible for consumers to obtain an
identification report for a short time in an impulsive
consumption scene.

At the same time, repeated evaluation and appraisal in the
transaction may increase the cost of circulation.

The Traditional Appraisal System has high appraisal deviation,
high cost and low efficiency since it mainly depends on human
judgment. At the same time, the mobility of appraiser is large,
which may cause poor result traceability. Moreover, the moral
hazard and responsibility traceability can be high.

2.5. New Opportunities Brought by Blockchain
2.5.1.Fully Trusted Authentication Service
RealChain achieves full de-trust through block chains: there is
no need to trust other participants and there is no centralization
of single point failures. The combination of identification
mechanism and artificial intelligence image recognition will
greatly improve the accuracy of identification. RealChain can
solve the consumer's most important concern: the authenticity
of high-end consumer goods. In the future the financial
institutions that will be connected to RealChain, which can
reduce the risk through RealChain services.

2.5.2.Distributed Identification Ecology
There may be high infrastructure and maintenance costs may
occur in forming an identification data cloud through building a
centralized server. The mobile terminals provided by RealChain
will make each institution and appraiser form an independent
node, thereby greatly reducing the connection cost. In addition,
the involvement of TaoDangPu can also make RealChain have
a natural advantage. The partner institutions will directly be
removed from the RealChain network if they are caught for
illegal operations or fraud.

The services provided by RealChain will enable high-end
commodity transactions to realize the following aspects:
(1) Information exchange between appraisers and
authenticators without trust;
(2) Low cost of identification and appraisal of goods;
(3) The creation a mobile and transparent market for high-end
consumer goods;

In addition to the access of database and cooperative agencies
of TaoDangPu, RealChain will set up a distributed identification
ecology in the world: Any RealChain foundation accreditation
agency may choose to connect the database to the RealChain
and obtain the user's consumption RCT token returns without
worrying about data leakage and tampering. In the first stage of
RealChain, RealChain will integrate the identification agencies
across various luxury sectors, so that more data providers can
participate in this platform.

2.5.3.Incentive Mechanism Realized by Encrypted Tokens
The RealChain based on the Ethereum blockchain will ensure
that the data providers share the value directly through the
Smart Contract. Once the user's uploaded data is used, it will
automatically get RealChain’s tokens RCT.

2.5.4. Information Desensitization
Users of high-end consumer goods are particularly interested in
the pursuit of privacy and personal information security. At
present, centralization requires a trusted third-party solution
that can be used to collect and analyze user data without user
authorization. However, the user data of RealChain is
determined by the user's own open permissions.

2.5.5.Greatly Improve Transaction Efficiency
It's hard for users to sell or mortgage high-end consumer goods
quickly due to lack of authoritative endorsement of the current
high-end goods market. Most of the users who can't find the
right price have to bear the loss. The characteristics of
blockchain technology fully meet the needs of real scene
tracking and inspection of real information, such as multiple
party confirmation, transparent accounts and non-modified
historical records. The high-end items are identified by the
TaoDangPu and other institutions that have access to the
RealChain, that is, a "block", which can realize the following
contents:

(1) Fast transaction verification: Fast transaction verification of
second level can be realized key trading links, such as
signature algorithm, consensus mechanism, book storage, etc.

provided by the Ethereum public block chain.
(2) Transaction intelligence contract: An intelligent contract is a
set of commitments defined in a digital form. RealChain can
generate intelligent contracts based on different scenarios,
such as auction, second-hand luxury goods, and more. The
blockchain, as a participant in the contract, is responsible for
maintaining and saving the contract and executing it
automatically.

According to the above needs and pains, RealChain' s team
firmly believes that the combination of the technology of
blockchain and the AI image recognition system can solve the
above problems in the future.

3. The Cooperation Between RealChain and TDP
There are currently hundreds of appraisers working for TDP
worldwide. Every article appraised will be kept in archives in
videos, pictures and word descriptions. More than 200,000 of
high-end consumer goods have been valued and recorded
since the beginning. Records include data to validate against
the counterfeits, circulating information of second-hand goods,
and price changes over the years.

TDP has more than 5,000 cooperating partners all over the
world, including but not limited to financial institutions, luxury
brands, large e-commerce platforms, auction houses, and

luxury MDs.

TDP is three core business includes authenticating, appraising
and analyzing the appraisal. We believe that the blockchain
technology together with AI pattern recognition will greatly lower
the artificial error and moral hazard, improve the transaction
transparency, reduce transaction cost and enhance
effectiveness.

TDP is planning to migrate its operations of dealing secondhand luxury, luxury hypothecated loan, luxury and consumer
finance entire on RealChain, becoming the first migrants of the
RealChain ecosystem. Meanwhile, TDP is bringing its archives
and transaction details onto the RealChain as database.

Namely, TDP’s involvement will be the first step of RealChain
expanding its business territory. Once the system is matured
enough, it will forge a scale effect to bring in other platforms
and systems in accordance with economic stimulating effect of
tokens and its industrial ecology.

4. RealChain Blockchain Protocol and RCT Token
RealChain is a new blockchain protocol being developed and
specifically designed and optimized for transactions of high-end
consumer good and financial service applications. The protocol
will consist of a blockchain based “virtual machine” and defined
modules of middleware software stacks, which operate outside
the chain to support decentralized processes governed by
smart contracts implemented on the network.

RCT is the native crypto token currency being created to be
integrated with and used on the RealChain network, and on
decentralized applications on the network.

Initially, RCT is proposed to be issued and implemented on the
public Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 compliant token.

RCT is designed to use in the following scenes:

1. To reward and incentivize community members to contribute
computing power and maintain the integrity of the network.
When e-commerce market participants (sellers, buyers, and
marketplace makers) utilize the network services, they would
provide RCTs to network maintainers.

2. To be consumed by authorized institutions when uploading
files to generate digital anti-fake labels.

3. To be consumed by users when searching for information.
Info providers will acquire RCT as rewards automatically.

In order to create the RealChain ecosystem, substantive
research and development into blockchain technology itself is
needed.
TDP has already developed a novel blockchain
protocol to support complex business transactions, known as
“smart business
contracts” in blockchain networks, with RCT to be the native

token for this new blockchain protocol.

5. Application Case Analysis of RealChain in Various
Scenes
TaoDangPu will be the first commercial application of
RealChain products.

The blockchain technology in the RealChain product will make
the transaction process, appraisal and evaluation process, and
the whole process of fund transfer distributed in each node. All
parties in the business chain will have a fair and open
information process. At the same time, it is convenient for the
downstream agencies of the business chain or two traders to
inquire at any time.

Secondly, image recognition system based on the artificial
intelligence in RealChain products can greatly save appraisers'
labor cost, reduce human errors and moral risks and improve
the cost of artificial fraud and appraisal efficiency.

TaoDangPu will introduce the RealChain on its whole business
line.

5.1. A Case of RealChain in Luxury Trading Scene of
TDP
In TaoDangPu system, RealChain will access the high-end
consumer goods pledge, second-hand transaction, consumer
finance and other fields. We will then introduce the business

process after the RealChain product is connected to the
second-hand luxury transaction module of TaoDangPu.

Figure 3. Luxury Trading Module of TDP
In process of luxury transaction, TaoDangPu is an intermediary
mediator. The commodity information will be uploaded to the
RealChain network, and the articles are classified and stored
by artificial intelligence image recognition system. The image
and video content is encrypted to the central server. The
SHA256 information of the file is stored in each node of the RC
and pays RCT to the RealChain network.

Both buyers and sellers can ask the RealChain system to query
commodity information and pay RCT when querying. Only
authorized institutions have the authority to upload information.
RCT shall be paid when uploading information. The RCT
reward can be rewarded to those who have uploaded.

After TaoDangPu is linked to the RealChain system, a large
number of luxury goods are released through the blockchain
platform. It has become a reference for other accreditation
institutions and reduces the professional moral hazard of the
TaoDangPu appraisers. For buyers and sellers, the trading

behavior of both sides is also uploaded to the block chain
platform, bringing the transaction reliability security a great deal
of improvement. In the future, the second-hand goods will be
tracked in the two circulations and the three circulations. This
will facilitate the next buyer's purchase judgement, and facilitate
the evaluation and pricing of other intermediary organizations.

5.2. A Case of RealChain in the Scene Mortgage Loans of
Second-hand Good in TDP

The borrower may apply to other financial institutions or
individuals to apply for secondhand luxuries, jewels and other
pledge loans via TaoDangPu, as the intermediary and appraisal
institution. In this process, the access of the RealChain system
will increase efficiency and reduce costs.
➢ TaoDangPu compares the borrower's pledge information
with the same RealChain items; verifies the authenticity and
liquidity of the goods based on historical transaction data
and identification results on RealChain.
➢ The borrower can give an appraisal report on the
TaoDangPu based on RealChain' s historical transactions
and identification records. There will not be a lot of objection
to the borrower's assessment of the price and authenticity of
the pledge.
➢ Financial institutions will also go to the RealChain block
chain platform to query the pawnshop to give an
identification report, determine the assessment level of risk
given by TaoDangPu, so as to reduce the rate of bad debts
and improve the efficiency of the disposal of non-performing

assets.

5.3. Authorize Co-vendor Agency for RealChain Program

In the future, RealChain will be connected to a network of
businesses and institutions. As the commodity information
needs to be authenticated by authority, the access agencies will
be approved by the RealChain foundation. Then they can have
the permission to upload information to RC.

It is expected that the access institutions include brand
manufacturers, partner manufacturers, auction houses, highend consumer goods trading intermediaries, jewelry and art
research institutions, etc., while appraisers or evaluators shall
be bounded. Everyone who can upload information is also
certified by the RealChain foundation.

Ordinary personal or non-certified organizations can only query
commodity information through RealChain' s public version of
APP. If you want to upload the goods in your own hand to
RealChain, you can upload information through a certified
certification body. The APP of RealChain provides the address
and contact mode of the nearest certification vendor
organization.

5.4. Upload RC Information
The uploaded information includes but not limited to:

Commodity photos: Submit high definition picture information

with different magnification and different angles on the basis of
different commodities.

Commodity Video: High definition video of the whole process.

Commodity basic information (including but not limited to):
origin, price, owner, material, service life, description of
circulation, etc.

Identification process and operator: identification method shall
be uploaded, appraiser commodity anti-counterfeiting
information: anti-counterfeiting logo or unique technology for
unique commodity.

The information must be uploaded in accordance with the
RealChain format. The RealChain foundation also provides
video, photo collection hard devices and related systems to
access agencies.

5.5. Good Content Inquiry

Any user can download the RC public version of APP. The
information in the RC library is queried through the code
identification of the goods, such as the core code of the watch,
and the unique information of the luxury goods that uniquely
identifies the goods. Moreover, RCT fee is paid by the user as
part of the inquiry.

The RC Public Edition APP also supports intelligent query of
image recognition, uploading different photos based on query
contents, intelligently judging commodity attributes, querying
content, primary information query, authenticity identification
and price evaluation for goods.

However, there will be a deviation from the query result for the
public version due to mobile camera performance constraints.
We will also sell the certified hardware to the public to improve
the detection rate.

5.6. On Protection of Privacy Information
As high-end goods have the need for privacy protection,
RealChain will hide a lot of personal information when it is
designed or sensitization of key information will be done.
Information disclosure authorization: what circumstances
should be labeled when uploading, or what time limitation, what
kind of guest group can authorize to open what information
content.

5.7. Preservation and Security of Data
Due to a large number of high-definition pictures and high

definition video content, the RC system will not keep this
information in a single centralized node.
The commodity information will be stored on multiple servers,
and the nodes are used only to keep SHA256 information of the
archived data, so that the content uploaded to the server is
secure and impartial information.

In the future, an increasing number of luxury goods related
transactions as well as financial services will greatly improve
their credibility after integration with RealChain. RealChain will
help them significantly improve its work efficiency and risk
reduction, including auction, C2C transaction, high-end
consumer goods storage management, logistics and so on.

The incentive mechanism of RCT can enormously improve
activity and enthusiasm of every link in the RealChain
ecosystem. It helps to connect more related scenes to
RealChain, thus making RealChain a necessary link in the
world's high-end consumer goods circulation.

5.8. AI Image Recognition System
In the future, the core process of RealChain is the appraiser.
With the reduction of human input, there will be a
corresponding decrease in the subjective bias and thus an
increase in objectivity of the overall process

With RealChain team, in the future, the identification service
which is judged by human vision and human experience can be
realized by artificial intelligent image recognition system.

The principle is such that similar to the traditional image
recognition system which is applied to many aspects, such as
traffic, finance and so on. For example, traffic safety: the image
recognition system is used to determine whether a vehicle runs
a red light.

The image recognition system of RealChain is closer to the
face recognition system. We will take the original product as a
sample of the comparison. For example, select the core point of
multiple comparisons, such as the hand, chain, appearance
and other core components of the watch. There are dozens or
hundreds of detection points for each type. The evaluation
results are compared with the differences between the detected
objects and the original products.

The automatic learning of artificial intelligence is to take many
true and false samples and learn constantly to improve the
accuracy of judgment.

It is just as the cultivation of a junior appraiser into a senior
appraiser. It requires a lot of practical operation, a lot of
practical experience, so as to judge the authenticity and value
of the goods by their own memory and experience.

Compared with the face recognition, RealChain, the image
recognition system will be simpler and more efficient from the
technical perspective. Human faces are too similar. More
collection points are used to judge the authenticity, and the data
points collected are generally greater than 500 points. There

are too few samples of the wrong single body, and the learning
space is limited due to its difficulties

Furthermore, RealChain image recognition system has a fixed
and correct basis for image judgment, and there are more
individual samples: a package, a piece of watch shipments is
very large. The accuracy of the judgment is theoretically higher
than the face recognition system.

The one of the challenges that RealChain faces, is to collect
data samples of the correct items. The larger the sample, the
higher rate of accuracy, including subtle differences in each
new and old version, the usage under different circumstances.

The large database of TaoDangPu plays a critical role in
RealChain. Since 2013, the TaoDangPu has begun to
accumulate its own database. All the items that have been
identified, whether new or old, genuine or fake, have a
complete picture and video record. The total amount is over
200,000. These data can help fully train and test RealChain' s
image recognition system.

The application of artificial intelligence image recognition
system can greatly lower the user's threshold and improve the
user's usage frequency. RealChain can be promoted faster to
the high-end consumer goods industry.

technology and applying system of studying and extending
human’s intelligence. It is a branch of computer science which
aims to find the essence of intellectuality and produce a new
machine who can react similar to human. Research in the area
includes robots, sound recognition, image recognition,
language processing and expert system.

RealChain has developed its own AI SYSTEM to conduct
pinpoint anti-counterfeiting, image recognition, appraising,
rating and providing reference.

7. RealChain Foundation
The RealChain ecosystem is envisioned to be a community of
partners, including blockchain node operators, validators,
service providers, marketplace operators, businesses, and end
users. They could provide or utilize the network services, and
exchange RCT on the RealChain platform. The RealChain
Foundation is intended as an independent, not-for-profit
company that maintains and facilitates democratic governance
for the members of this ecosystem.
The RealChain
Foundation’s mission is:

To enhance transparency and fairness in the high-level luxury
trading with blockchain and AI image recognition system.

7.1 Three structural principles of The RealChain

Foundation

Managed solely to develop RealChain blockchain and
applications;

-

Separate legal entity from TDP and any other member
company;

-

Directors act independently of RealChain, and wellrespected within the tech community.

• Governance
-

Serves the interests of RCT holders, to develop a robust
and scalable system;

-

Collaboration with TDP based on arms-length commercial
agreements;

-

Token issuance and distribution managed by the RealChain
Foundation;

-

RealChain Foundation is a separate legal entity, with distinct
operations and its own governance framework;

-

Advised by top-tier professionals;

-

Implement best practices from other established
foundations;

-

Additional measures in response to regulatory changes and
requirements.

7.2 The principal functions of the RealChain Foundation
• Open governance of its resources together with other
ecosystem partners;
• Support and advance the technology related to RealChain
blockchain network’s implementation; and
• All matters related to ecosystem membership.

The RealChain Foundation’s mandate is to grow an open
ecosystem of digital services that consumers can easily explore
and find value in, while giving developers an open and
sustainable
platform to develop, deliver, and enhance those services and
attract users. To fulfill its mission, the RealChain Foundation
will dedicate resources to three specific goals related to
research,
development, and governance as described below.

A. Governance goals

The Foundation proposes to dedicate resources to establish a
fair and transparent governance process that will take into
account the voices and needs of all participants within the
ecosystem.
This open governance model would oversee
decisions related to the membership process, participation
rules, token issuance, pricing rules, legal matters, and content
and compliance guidelines. The RealChain Foundation would
be responsible for administering and
overseeing the security of the RCT reserve, as well as
transparency in its use of RCT and any token proceeds.

B. Research goals
The RealChain Foundation aims to foster an environment of
innovation by working with partners to test new ways to
participate in the ecosystem and drive value creation and
beneficial network effects. The RealChain Foundation could
fund research and development efforts to support an
autonomous network that is secure and effective in providing
business transaction services.

C. Development goals
The RealChain Foundation proposes to direct and fund the
development of the RealChain blockchain itself, as well as tools
that give ecosystem partners the ability to build, grow, and
create value for the platform. As part of this process, TDP
proposes to make its own database available as an open
source project that can be leveraged to power new
communities and add capabilities to existing ones.
The
RealChain Foundation would further this work by engaging
development teams to continue improving the technology suite
supporting the RealChain ecosystem, and will maintain an open
