1. Background
1.1 The Challenges in Centralized Architecture of IoT
Systems
Internet of Things (IoT) is a major development and revolutionary opportunity in
information

field.

It

highly

integrates

advanced

information

technology,

communication technology, sensor technology and computer technology to establish a
global dynamic network infrastructure. All smart objects (RFID tags, sensors,
smartphones, wearable devices, etc.) are interconnected and all information and data
are shared and transmitted for full awareness, reliable delivery and intelligent
processing. Currently, the IoT adopts the centralized technology and operation mode in
the fields of intelligent transportation, smart home and medical care, i.e. the "chimney"
IoT architecture, and faces the common problems in connection costs, trust, data value
and business models.

Cost of device connectivity. In recent years, as the price of components such as
computing devices, storage devices and sensors has declined, IoT devices are exploding.
IBM Research Institute predicts that by 2020, the world will have over 30 billion
connected devices. However, the existing IoT solutions are high costs and mostly
"chimney-type" vertical architecture. The data centers are built for one single project
and each IT system has its own management tools and databases, forming an isolated
island of information in the era of billions of connected devices. Therefore, the current
inefficient architecture cannot satisfy the demand. In addition, most of IoT devices have
long life cycles and the profit is far lower than that of intelligent terminals with fast
consumer goods properties, such as PCs and smartphones. But the manufacturers need
to maintain the corresponding IT systems for the long term and the profits are not
enough to support maintenance costs. So the equipment manufacturers are
unsustainable.
3

Privacy concern. The internet needs to be built on trust. Events such as Snowden also
prove that "trusted third parties" are not 100% trustworthy. People have lost much of
their privacy ever since the internet came into the big data age. Therefore, at the
beginning of the development of the Internet of Things, privacy must be integrated into
the IoT infrastructure to ensure that users enjoy more convenient and smart services
without revealing their personal information, and allowing users to truly own the data
they create and its value. In addition, the concept of "closed is safe" in the current
centralized architecture is out of date. The new technology represented by the
blockchain is building a brand-new "open is secure" interconnection of all things.

Data value. IoT systems generate large amounts of data at all times. These data are of
great value in both commercial applications and research fields. For example, based on
traffic travel data, deep learning is used to train more accurate and efficient path
planning algorithms. Medical care organizations can design more customized care plans
using sensor data such as cameras to more accurately determine the patient's condition.
However, under the "chimney-shaped" island system, a large amount of traffic data is
held by a few centralized platforms, in which case efficient interconnection cannot be
achieved. Small and medium-sized companies cannot take advantage of these resources,
and universities and other research institutions have difficulty in obtaining high-quality
data sets, which seriously hinders the progress of scientific research and the value of
the data cannot be fully reflected. In addition, most of the IoT devices connected to the
Internet alone is meaningless. Only comprehensive analysis of big data will create value.
If the data cannot be connected, the value cannot be thus delivered.

Business model. Networking, computing, storage and other functions of IoT devices
bring about an increase in costs. But for most of the traditional devices such as sensors,
networking is not the core function, and relying on the mode of selling hardware alone
cannot support the huge overhead incurred by the long-term maintenance of
corresponding IT system. Under the current centralized architecture, most
4

manufacturers cannot make full use of the IT function system of the IoT device, and the
business model is simply selling user data. This is allegedly infringing upon the rights
and privacy of users. With the IoT system further development and openness and usersâ€™
safety awareness, the current business model will certainly usher in change.

1.2 Blockchain Technology Brings New Potential to the
Internet of Things
As an emerging technology, blockchain has shown its great potential in solving data
security and privacy issues. At present, many researchers and enterprises have
introduced blockchain technology into more and more fields. Among them, the
combination of the Internet of Things and the blockchain is one of the most promising
directions. Blockchain technology has the opportunity to reshape its basic structure and
solves a series of challenges in the current centralized "chimney" system.

Significantly reduce the cost of equipment interconnection. The core concept of
Blockchain technology is distributed ledger, that is, an open, distributed database
maintained by multiple parties. Based on the blockchain, we can build a decentralized
and distributed IoT data platform, which can effectively solve the "isolated data island"
problem. Manufacturers no longer need to establish a complete set of data solutions for
their single products, significantly reducing the cost of equipment interconnection and
post-IT system maintenance. Therefore, the decentralized IoT system, based on the
blockchain technology, is sufficient to carry tens of billions of connected device data.

Significantly protect the privacy. The biggest advantage of blockchain technology
lies in the security of privacy brought by decentralization. Without any third party
controlling user data, there is not a large amount of data stored in a centralized data
center, which reduces the risk of hacker attacks and malicious disclosure. The Internet
of Things based on blockchain is a fully open and secure decentralized system for users
to control their own data and protect their privacy and interests.
5

Realizing the share of data. The blockchain-based IoT system is a peer-to-peer
decentralized network where all participants can participate equally in the data sharing
process. All users can authorize their own data access, data applications and legally get
a large number of valuable data at a lower cost from service providers, and on this basis
to create more intelligent services, to realize the value transfer through the real-time
data flow.

Create the brand-new business model. Blockchain technology changes the roles of
users, IoT devices and vendors in the IoT system. Unlike the current centralized
architecture, users in the new IoT system can dynamically develop data authorization
mechanisms and interaction rules with devices, etc. Not only does the device perform
a single function. The blockchain not only simply interconnects the device, but also
enables devices to interact with each other autonomously. Vendors no longer need to
maintain hundreds or thousands of IT systems in different systems. Changing roles will
attract more participants, reshape market rules and create entirely new business models.

1.3 Commercial blockchain systems are facing the bottleneck
problem of scalability
Although blockchain technology brings a high degree of security and privacy,
scalability is the bottleneck of its application to large-scale industrial systems. The
existing blockchain system architecture is not enough to support the demand of highthroughput, high-concurrency commercial systems.

High cost of data storage and calculation. Blockchain is a decentralized database
maintained by a large number of nodes, which has a high storage and computing cost.
However, the public blockchain application platform inevitably carries large-scale data.
Under the current storage cost of blockchain, large-scale of the public blockchain based
data platform is not practical.
6

Low efficiency of consensus mechanism. Consensus algorithms based on PoW in the
current blockchain consume a great deal of computational resources. In many
application scenarios, users cannot obtain strong computational power and all miningbased consensus algorithms will face the bottleneck of trading speed. If the scalability
of the blockchain system cannot be solved, the decentralized application cannot really
fall to the ground.

Under the above context, Cyber-Physical Chain (CPChain) is focus on the scalability,
security and real-time issues of data and transactions in the integration of the Internet
of things and blockchain technology. First, a parallel distributed architecture of
distributed cloud storage system and decentralization blockchain system is proposed to
solve the scalability problem of large-scale data storage and sharing. Second, CPChain
presents a new hybrid consensus protocol for large-scale public blockchain based on
collaborative optimization design of computing and communication. Finally, a side
chain consensus system with high security, real time and high concurrent machine
transaction is designed by combining edge computing and hardware security methods
in the industry chain.

2. Parallel Distributed Architecture of
CPChain
CPChain aims to construct a basic data platform for the IoT system, providing a full
process solution for data acquisition, storage, sharing and application. CPChain will
break through the core underlying technology of the application of block chain in the
Internet of things system, and provide the infrastructure for the sharing and transaction
of the data in the Internet of things. On CPChain, we can build data aggregation and
real-time data flow applications to maximize the value of Internet of things data. The
decentralized blockchain system requires the whole network node to operate on the
same transaction (data), which has great disadvantages from the point of view of
calculation and storage. It cannot give full play to the cooperative ability of the
distributed network system. The decentralized system can only follow the "barrel
principle", so it is not scalable. CPChain proposes the idea of separating data layer from
control layer, constructs parallel architecture to enhance system scalability, provides
open data sharing function while protecting user privacy, and adopts distributed storage
scheme. The user data is encrypted and uploaded to the cloud to reduce the storage
burden of the block chain and to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data.

Figure 1 shows the hierarchical structure of CPChain system, which is made up of
physical layer, data layer, contract layer, application layer and control layer. Block chain
is used as a vertical control layer to supervise data interaction. The physical layer is the
basis of data acquisition in CPChain, including smart phone, sensor, data gateway and
so on. The intelligent device joining the CPChain network needs to run a blockchain
node or communicate with the blockchain network. At the same time, it also acts as a
running environment for the decentralization application, dealing with encryption,
consensus and so on. The data layer processes the main data, designs different data
structure and compression algorithm for different applications, improves the efficiency
of data reading and writing, and the original data does not need to upload block chain.
Upload only hash values as unique identification of data and credentials for integrity
and correctness. Raw data is encrypted on the user side and stored in a distributed hash
table (DHT). The contract layer is the core of the system function. Because the
intelligent contract is deployed on the blockchain, it is difficult to change the contract
rules. Therefore, the design of the contract should be basic and concise, and more
interactive functions should be placed in the application layer. The application layer is
an interface between user and contractual interaction, which can be developed
according to different requirements. The function of the control layer is accomplished
by the block chain. In the beginning, the public chain platform such as Ethereum, which
supports the intelligent contract, is used to speed up the development of the prototype
system.
The decentralized system based on blockchain technology is different from the
traditional distributed system. In the decentralized system, computing and storage tasks
are redundant. Each node in the decentralized node stores the same data and performs
the same computational tasks. On the one hand, this kind of redundant storage and
calculation allows the blockchain system to operate independently of a trusted third
party, ensuring the integrity of the data, untamperability and the consistency of the
system; on the other hand, excessive redundant data also aggravates the system's burden,
making the addition of new nodes more and more expensive. In the long run, this model
is not scalable and unsustainable. In bitcoin, for example, the size of the bitcoin
9

blockchain has exceeded 130GB, which makes the new node spend a lot of time for
synchronizing data. As the time goes on, the difficulty of entering new nodes continues
to increase. Redundant computing ensures the consistency of the system state, which is
valuable and essential. However, the large amount of redundant data storage makes the
system burden heavier and not extensible. In order to solve the scalability problem of
data storage, sharing and transaction, a parallel distributed architecture is put forward,
as shown in Figure 2. The main chain, the industry chain network and the distributed
storage system are combined organically. As the control layer of CPChain platform, the
blockchain no longer stores all the data of the system, but only uploads the identification
and credentials of the data, which not only greatly reduces the storage burden of the
platform, but also ensures the consistency of the system.

Fig 2. Parallel distributed architecture of CPChain
In CPChain parallel distributed architecture, distributed cloud storage layer and
block chain layer are two parallel distributed networks for data storage and computing
tasks, respectively. The user data will be encrypted into blocks at the client side, each
part will enter different storage nodes, and the hash credentials will upload all the nodes
in the blockchain network, so that the data can be verified, confirmed, and so on.
Parallel distributed architecture separates the data layer from the block chain, which not
only preserves the security and decentration of the block chain system, but also
improves the scalability and greatly reduces the block size. At present, many block
chain platforms are faced with the problem of capacity expansion, such as increasing
10

block capacity, but only increasing block capacity will increase the maintenance cost
of blockchain nodes, resulting in fewer nodes and lower system security. With
CPChain's system architecture, the number of transactions that can be packaged in a
single block is greatly increased with the same block size, which can dramatically
enhance the platform's transaction processing speed.

11

3. Key Technologies of CPChain
The parallel distributed architecture which separates the data layer from the control
layer by CPChain can greatly improve the transaction speed and system extensibility
without changing the block capacity. But it also faces new challenges. For example,
after separating the data layer from the control layer, it is necessary to build a distributed
storage network and ensure efficient interaction with the blockchain, and an effective
connection must be established between the two parallel architectures. At the same time,
the security and efficiency of the system should be guaranteed. In addition, if the data
layer is independent, the block chain itself will be abandoned to protect the privacy of
the data, so we must design a privacy protection scheme based on encryption
technology. The encryption function based on re-encryption or homomorphic
encryption has certain requirements for computing resources, but the block chain itself
has limited computing resources and high cost, so it is necessary to strike a balance
between privacy and availability.
In large scale P2P networks, due to the large scale of nodes and the heterogeneity of
data, there is a great challenge to ensure the consistency in the process of node state
synchronization and data security storage. However, the current block chain distributed
network based on the power of work (POW) consensus protocol has some problems,
such as scalability, waste of computational power and limited block speed. CPChain
adopts the two-layer consensus protocol solution, designs the dynamic committee
security election mechanism, solves the low throughput and the high delay problem,
enhances the data consistency and the system security. In addition, CPChain is oriented
to the characteristics of the Internet of things industry and adopts a cross-chain
architecture. That is, based on the main chain, CPChain provides industry-oriented sidechain network function expansion for diversified practical application scenarios. The
main chain network is mainly used for the high-speed control channel of IoT data
exchange.

12

3.1 Parallel Distributed Encrypted Storage and Computation
CPChain uses a parallel distributed architecture in which the typical Internet of things
data upload and share process is shown in Fig. 3. To guarantee data security, reliability
and efficient sharing in the network, CPChain creatively combines distributed storage
technology with re-encryption technology as well as homomorphic encryption
technology to achieve efficient data access control mechanism, which is elaborated in
the following specific two aspects.

l DHT-based distributed encrypted storage
The distributed storage process of IoT data is shown in Fig. 4. The system separates the
data layer from the control layer, all raw data is encrypted locally and signed by the
owner. After partitioning, the data are stored in different nodes with DHT method,
making it impossible for the host to know the raw data. At the same time, the hash value
of the data is stored in the block chain as a proof of the integrity and correctness of the
data and the identification of the data. In the first phase of CPChain, we select Ethereum
as main chain to speed up system prototyping and application testing.
The block chain also has access control over the data. When the owner of the data
stores the data, the block chain stores access rights for each data record, which can be
13

accomplished by sending a transaction containing the data identity. When a user wants
to retrieve the data, he or she must provide proof that the identity of the data is satisfied
to obtain the right to access and use the data. If a malicious node exists in the system,
it may ignore the access rights. But the data is encrypted and each node only saves a
random part of the data in DHT. Therefore, malicious nodes have a limited impact.
Since all data are encrypted on the user side, it is necessary to design an effective data
authorization access mechanism to share data. The traditional distributed hash table
only holds the key-value pair of data, which is far from enough for the CPChain
platform. Therefore, at the data layer, CPChain will introduce a modified DHT to record
the correspondence between the key and the data block, where the key has been used at
the data encryption level.

Encryption and decryption of data will consume a certain amount of computing
resources. In the face of the huge amount of data generated by the Internet of things
system at every moment, it is undoubtedly a huge waste of computational power to
encrypt each data record separately. Therefore, it is necessary to design appropriate data
structures and encryption mechanisms for different types of IOT data to meet the
requirements of data security and processing efficiency at the same time. The data
generated by the CPChain platform will be arranged in chronological order, organized
in a chain structure, and the time period T will be set to package the data in a period
14

into blocks. On this basis, the encryption interval e and the upload interval u are selected,
so that a block record can ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data in the u blocks
of the whole interval.

l Data sharing and application based on encrypted computation
To ensure data security and privacy, CPChain platform stripping the data layer from the
blockchain. All the original data are encrypted on the user side. Because data is not
visible to third parties, how to implement the computing or sharing of encrypted data is
the primary challenge in parallel distributed architecture. The public key encryption
system used in the block chain platform will no longer apply after the introduction of
distributed encryption storage, because the public key encryption technology requires
the receiver's public key to encrypt the data, as shown in Fig. 5. Only one-to-one
authorization can be implemented. In the CPChain platform, it is hoped that the data is
encrypted one time and used many times, which is abbreviated one-to-many
authorization as shown in Fig. 6. Therefore, the CPChain platform will deeply develop
re-encryption and homomorphic encryption technologies. The combination of
encryption technology and blockchain technology will achieve more secure and more
efficient data sharing and services.

Fig. 6. a) Traditional public key encryption; b) CPChain encryption

To implementation one-to-many authorization, CPChain proposes a combination
scheme of symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption based on re-encryption
technology. The user employs a symmetric encryption key in each encryption interval
to encrypt data, that is, the encryption and decryption use the same secret key, and
records the correspondence between the encrypted data block and the secret key in the
improved DHT. To improve the security of the data, each encryption interval needs to
update the secret key. The re-encryption system based on asymmetric encryption is used
to transmit the key used to encrypt the data, thus data authorization is limited to a single
encryption interval.
Re-encryption technology can partially solve the problem of data sharing in parallel
distributed architecture. But its data is visible under the smart contract, so it faces some
security and privacy problems. To this end, CPChain will further introduce
homomorphic encryption technology to realize computing and application functions
under encrypted data, such as distributed encryption matching and searching, so as to
enhance the protection of user privacy.

3.2 Hybrid Consensus on Large-scale Public Blockchain
In the large-scale CPChain system, the realization of node state consistency and
distributed data storage face many challenges due to the large scale of network and the
massive data of Internet of things. CPChain will develop a hybrid consensus protocol
16

with extendable performance and propose a dynamic committee election mechanism to
overcome scalability problems of the existing POW consensus protocol based systems.
The main core problem in the main chain structure lies in determining which nodes
to complete the data collection, packing the chain on the block, and how to ensure the
block data security and consistency. Traditional distributed fault-tolerant algorithms,
such as PBFT and Zyzzyva, rely more on communication complexity to guarantee the
consistency among nodes. For example, the PBFT algorithm applies a three-phase
protocol to guarantee the system consistency even if there is a malicious Byzantine
node and the recovery of node failure. However, the system scalability is poor due to
its more dependence on communication to ensure the security of its algorithm. The
performance declines faster with the number of nodes increasing; when the number of
nodes exceeds a certain threshold, the system will not be available. Due to its reliability
and availability at a small scale, the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm is
more suitable for the private blockchain and permissioned blockchain environments. In
response to this problem, CPChain's core solution is to design a dynamic voting
mechanism for the dynamic committees and elect credible committees to collect the
data of the blocks and pack the tasks of the blocks.

l Two-layer consensus
Traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms cannot be applied to large-scale
public chain scenarios, and POW consensus protocols consume a huge amount of
computing resources, which leads to inefficiencies. CPChain proposes a committeebased two-layer agreement to enhance CPChain consensus performance. In the first
round of consensus, the system performs a local electoral algorithm at the beginning of
a fixed round (when a block is added, called a round) to determine the level of the nodes
in the rounds. If the result is high, then the node has the right to record the round; In the
second round of consensus, the process of block packing, verification, and the whole
network broadcast will be completed. The consensus process is shown in Fig. 7.

17

Fig. 7. Two-layer consensus structure of CPChain

l Commission election and dynamic update based on credit evaluation model
The main difficulties of CPChain's main chain consensus agreement include: 1) make
the whole network agree with the member node in P2P network; 2) identify each other
after the establishment of the committee; 3) make sure that the node level information
cannot be forged. For these problems, CPChain constructs node credibility model to
evaluate the node credibility. Based on the node credibility, each node presents a local
trust computing to determine its role. Through the committee to carry out intra-group
consensus, we can achieve block data collection, packaging, and new block creation.
In the election process, the randomness of the election process can be enhanced by
the uniformly distributed probability lucky value. The malicious nodes can be
prevented from making targeted cumulative credit attacks to control the behavior of the
whole network. And the enhancement of randomness makes it possible for some nodes
with low reputation to participate in the packaging of blocks. During the verification
process, some incentives for some negative nodes are added.
Consensus agreement will last for t rounds and will be re-elected. During the process
of adding a block, the credit value will be penalized if there is a high-level node
downtime or malicious behavior. When the credit value is lower than a certain threshold,
it will be deleted from the committee, and the committee changing information is added
to the block so that at the beginning of the next round, a corresponding number of nodes
can be dynamically re-elected to join the committee, as shown in Fig. 8.
18

Fig. 8. Committee dynamics in the main chain of CPChain

3.3 Side chain consensus system with high real-time and
security
As the basic data platform of IoT system, CPChain is a common IoT data control layer.
However, different vertical applications of IoT, it has different performance
requirements. Typical harsh real-time applications include unmanned vehicular, fleet
coordination and so on. In such applications, CPChain needs to support secure
communication and interaction with real-time control signaling in order to work
efficiently and collaboratively among the various equipment nodes in the Internet of
Things. If the data interaction is still completed through the main chain, it will face a
great delay, which cannot guarantee the real-time requirements of all kinds of
applications. In order to meet the requirements of high frequency, fine granularity, high
security and real time of machine data transaction, we will select typical application
scenarios and develop a lightweight side chain consensus protocol. Specifically,
CPChain will design the side chain consensus system with edge computing and
hardware security method in the industry chain to ensure that all kinds of applications
can meet the delay requirements. Therefore, the high real-time and high security of the
industry chain network are realized, as shown in Fig. 9.

19

Fig. 9. Altruistic cooperation model with hardware acceleration

l

Data gateway & embedded encrypted algorithm

Due to the heterogeneity of the data collected by the sensors in the Internet of things,
the sensors themselves often do not have the computing power or computing power is
very limited. If the cognitive computing of the sensor data processing is placed in each
sensor node, it will bring more delay. Because the gateway equipment deployed in the
Internet of things has more powerful hardware support than the sensor node, it can
provide faster computing power, and the power of the device is not limited. By using
the data gateway deployed in the Internet of things, the sensor data is aggregated to the
edge gateway for data processing and encryption computation. On the one hand, the
computing delay caused by the data processing is reduced. On the other hand, the
computational load of sensor nodes in the Internet of things is reduced, and the lifetime
is prolonged.

l

Incentive and security mechanism for consensus algorithm of industry chain

The Internet of Things system consists of mesh network or wireless ad hoc network.
There are many wireless communication technologies in different IoT industry, such as
IEEE 802.11p, NB - IoT. Therefore, the consensus of machine transaction in the Internet
of things can make full use of the characteristics of wireless network system, and embed
the consensus process in the network communication protocol, so that the information
interaction in the consensus process does not need to involve the data layer. The delay
in the process is reduced only through the lower layer of communication layer. In
addition, considering the high concurrency, real-time and security requirements of
20

machine transactions, CPChain will develop efficient altruistic cooperative incentive
mechanism and security mechanism based on evolutionary game theory. For example,
altruistic cooperative incentive mechanism based on directed acyclic graph directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) data structure. Thus, the application of CPChain side chain is
more efficient, faster and safer.

21

4. Typical Applications of CPChain
As a common platform for data acquisition, storage, sharing and application in the
Internet of things, CPChain can be widely used in intelligent transportation, intelligent
manufacturing, intelligent city and other industry systems. As shown in Fig. 10, taking
traffic data as an example, CPChain can provide a full process solution for personal
navigation optimization, auxiliary driving, traffic scheduling optimization and
customization of vehicle personalized insurance.

In the era of big data, the value of data is well known. The huge amount of data
generated by CPChain will also be of great value, and CPChain will use block chain
technology to make all data available to and at the disposal of users. It avoids big
companies monopolizing data.
A large number of Internet of things equipment and user interaction data in the field
of business and scientific research have very high value with the development of
22

artificial intelligence. High-quality data is essential, especially for small and mediumsized companies and scientific research institutions such as colleges and universities.
With this open IoT data platform of CPChain, we can access to large amounts of real
data at low cost, which will greatly facilitate technological progress. At present,
research institutions must cooperate with large companies or rely on open data and open
platforms of large companies in order to effectively carry out the training work of deep
learning models. In fact, the vast majority of data held by large companies are derived
from users, but users cannot control their own data. The CPChain data platform will
change this situation in the CPChain data market, where users can authorize their data
to different agencies and service providers to protect the privacy and rights of the data,
as shown in Fig. 11. For users, the sharing of data is rewarded, and a large amount of
real and trusted user data can bring greater business value.

Personalized auto insurance
Existing insurance programs generally have a very low level of customization. The
novices or experienced drivers almost have the same plan options. Experienced drivers
are often not coming with an accident within a few years, while the novice is more
23

likely to apply for their insurance. For insurance companies, due to the lack of adequate
data support for different drivers, the driving habits of them are difficult to judge, it can
only consider the risks and benefits in a general sense to design auto insurance products
for different drivers. Furthermore, the cost of customized different auto insurance
products is too high, which is not feasible.

Fig. 12. Personalized auto insurance based on CPChain
The CPChain IoT data platform collects a large amount of vehicle data. Through the
modeling and analysis of each vehicle data, the driver's driving style can then be
evaluated well. And the insurance company can calculate the driver's risk more
accurately with these results and then design more personalized car insurance, see Fig.
12. With advances in the sensor technology, combined with the CPChain data platform,
unmanned set-loss and claims can be realized. After an accident happens, the
responsibility can be distinguished with on-board sensors and road cameras and other
equipment; the insurance company can automatically enter the claim phase through
blockchain smart contract, saving a lot of time and manpower.

4.2 Applications of real-time data flow based on CPChain
Shared travel
In the application of shared travel, the three parties involved are passengers, drivers and
shared travel service contracts respectively. As shown in Fig. 13, a real-time
24

communication system based on CPChain allows drivers and passengers to encrypt
their information and broadcast it to the vehicular ad hoc network at the same time.
Secure side chain consensus algorithm implements fast matching and secure transaction.
The travel service is deployed in the blockchain as an smart contract. The contract can
access the information of the driver and the passenger and store the data in the cache
temporarily. According to the matching algorithm within the contract, the contract can
find the matching vehicle for the passengers.

Real-time traffic sharing and driving assistance
At present, the map app (e.g. Baidu map and Gaude map) can provide real-time traffic
data. But the real-time data acquisition cost is high due to the lack of underlying traffic
data platform such as CPChain. The traditional detection methods of road condition
information mainly include the installation of sense coil, speed radar and video
monitoring tools on the main roads of the city. These devices are mainly used to detect
the occupancy rate of roads, traffic flow, speed and other coarse-grained road condition
information.
With the improvement of vehicle intelligence and sensor technology, combined with
the real-time sharing of CPChain side-chain data, a more efficient real-time traffic data
sharing application can be constructed. Vehicles upload their real-time sensor data to
the CPChain platform for rewards. The real-time data sharing application collects,
analyzes and provides data to the vehicles with the need. Vehicles can learn about the
25

traffic jam in advance and find out more about emergencies in time. For the unmanned
vehicle, the real-time road condition information can be added to the driving strategy
to obtain a better control scheme and real-time adjustment.

Swarm control of unmanned vehicle fleet
In unmanned vehicle fleet control, the interior of the swarm needs intelligent
identification and detection of traffic environment through real-time, reliable and secure
message transmission, determine the current travel status and energy usage of the
cluster members, and thus realize the safe intelligent swarm control. Combined with
CPChain real-time data sharing, each vehicle historical data (including the movement
status, location, terrain and other key information) can be real-time accessed and shared,
so that each car can obtain more reliable and complete unmanned vehicle fleet swarm
status information at a lower cost, which also will promote the optimization of cluster
control algorithm. Moreover, the CPChain data real-time sharing increases system
flexibility in the dynamic membership administration, completing the real-time swarm
reconfiguration, and improving self-governing capabilities of unmanned vehicles and
the ability of secure control in the malicious attack environment.

7. CPChain Economic Models and Usage
CPC is a primary asset on CPChain, CPC's value origin is that it can easily characterize
and measure digital economic activity on CPChain. The value of CPC is based on two
practical business needs. One is that the use of CPChain consumes a certain amount of
CPC as fuel. The other is holding CPC is a symbol of participating in CPChain
community governance.
1) The total amount of CPC is 1 billion, which will be generated when the main network
is online.
2) Ordinary nodes in the CPC network (non-DAPP application nodes) have the right to
send a fixed number of free transactions every day. If this number is exceeded or the
transaction frequency is too fast, the system will charge a fee.
3) In order to ensure the balance of communication and computing resources, DAPP
application developers must hold a corresponding amount of tokens according to the
resources to be occupied by the application, and may lease them if the number of tokens
is not enough.
4) For transactions resulting from DAPP applications, DAPP developers bear the
corresponding costs, and pay leasing fees to miners who provide rental tokens.
The CPChain Foundation will charge CPC from developers and service providers of
various smart contracts and pays for the gas required for the operation of smart contracts
to ensure the operation of all business smart contracts. The majority of CPC revenue
received will be rewarded to node providers, while the remaining part is used for
funding follow-up day-to-day operations, commercial promotion and technology
development;
The smart contract service provider pays CPC to acquire GAS to provide BaaS
(Blockchain as a Service) smart contract services to the companies it serves. Based on
their business rules and the added value contribution, the contract is provided to its
client company, Application development provider receive CPC to provide smart
29

contract services;
The application development provider will further develop and process the acquired
smart contract services based on the needs of the end customers and provide its
traditional enterprise customers or end users with application products and receive the
CPC as the enterprise revenue. The end user may pay CPC to get business products and
services.

CPChain's governance adopts the three-tier governance structure of the CPC Holders'
Conference, the Decision-making Committee and the Executive Committee.
The CPC Holder Conference allows the holder to participate in the governance of
the community through preset code rules. The decision-making committee is
responsible for the CPC holder conference and the executive committee is responsible
for the execution.
The Executive Committee is responsible for the daily operation of the CPChain
project. The Executive Committee consists of several management centers including
Strategic Investment Center, Financial Management Center, Operations Management
Center, Community Service Center and Innovation Management Center to guide the
respective business units.
