EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Blackmoon is part of the Blackmoon Financial Group, a ﬁnancial technology company founded in
2014. The Blackmoon team has extensive experience in setting up and managing investment
funds, as well as developing automated investment interfaces and asset management tools while
effectively working with regulatory authorities.

Blackmoon’s vision is to create a new standard for tokenized investment vehicles that will bridge
the gap between the ﬁat* and crypto universes. The Blackmoon Platform focuses on all aspects
of tokenized investment vehicles, from technology and infrastructure, to legal compliance and
corporate structuring. The Blackmoon Platform will be the one-stop solution for asset managers
to create and manage tokenized funds.
This white paper outlines the value proposition of the Blackmoon Platform and the company’s
business model.

WHITEPAPER: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

VISION
Blackmoon is part of the Blackmoon Financial Group, a ﬁnancial technology company
incorporated in Ireland with a solid track record since 2014. We bring investment transparency,
globalization, and decentralization to the next level by implementing blockchain technology -- all
with a commitment to sustainable continuous development in cooperation with ﬁnancial
regulators.
We combine our ready-to-use technologies with our deep expertise in structuring investment
funds both internally and through our partnerships with external investment teams. Working
closely with the best investment managers, lawyers, and ﬁnancial authorities, we are creating a
solid bridge between the blockchain universe and the classic investment world by providing a
transparent and legally compliant framework for tokenized fund structuring and operation.
We are helping to expand the boundaries of investment possibilities and to encourage regulators
to recognize blockchain tools as the new reality in classic ﬁnancial markets. Ultimately,
Blackmoon aims to set the benchmark for tokenized investment funds and vehicles that invest in
traditional investment instruments as well as in emerging distributed economy opportunities.

WHITEPAPER: VISION

VALUE PROPOSITION
Blackmoon addresses the main issues of the current tokenized investment vehicles, such as: lack
of diversiﬁcation, non-compliance with existing and foreseen regulation, and lack of
standardization. Our goal is to become the industry standard and one-stop solution in setting up
tokenized funds, regardless of whether such funds invest in the ﬁat or crypto world. Blackmoon
bridges the gap between these two worlds while taking advantage of both.

KEY VALUE PROPOSITIONS

Best of both worlds

Sustainability

Currently the majority of tokenized investment
vehicles are either fully crypto-oriented
(invested in cryptocurrencies) or pegged to
some tradable asset (such as the US dollar or
gold). Each of these approaches is siloed,
hindering diversiﬁcation. Access to ﬁat
investment opportunities provides
unprecedented diversiﬁcation in terms of
income sources while retaining all the
beneﬁts of the crypto universe, including
decentralization, transparency, and
exchangeability.

Funds’ legal structure is reviewed and approved
by our legal advisors to ensure they are compliant
with existing laws and regulations. As many
current investors in tokenized funds are at best in
Terra Incognita, this eye toward legal
responsibility dramatically decreases legal risks
for the investors. Blackmoon has vetted the
proposed structure with several ﬁnancial
institutions and has received an indicative
approval that it will pass internal procedures,
enabling funds to be transferred from and into the
crypto world. By sorting out these risks from the
beginning, Blackmoon improves investor
conﬁdence and provide necessary sustainability of
the investment process.

Standardized platform
Setting up the proper investment structure is
a costly endeavour. Not all tokenized funds set
up a proper structure, which leads to greater
regulatory risk. Blackmoon believes that now
is the right time to introduce industry
standards for setting up tokenized investment
vehicles that can attract investments from
private individuals and institutional investors
of any kind. We undertake this effort in order
to reduce or remove regulatory risk from
investors.

BLACKMOON

Scalable fund creation
Using the system put in place by Blackmoon, the
Blackmoon Platform, any approved investment
manager is able to set up and run a tokenized
investment fund without having to go through the
pain and effort of creating the necessary IT and
legal infrastructure. This effectively eliminates
the barriers for tokenized fund creation, which is
an important milestone toward bringing the ﬁat
and crypto economies into the same realm.

Transparency

Bringing in new liquidity and users

Tokenization of interests in funds (share in
proﬁts) provides auditability and transparency
to the investment process as well as to the
results. This transparency means the
investment funds are no longer “black boxes”
for the investors, with reporting full of ﬁne
print. This much-needed transparency will
substantially improve accountability of the
investment managers.

We believe that the Blackmoon Platform is a
turnkey solution that leads to further
proliferation of the decentralized economy.
Investment managers from the ﬁat world are now
able to easily create compliant tokenized
investment funds and offer their existing
customers all the beneﬁts of the blockchain that
has been a buzzword among investment
managers for several years.

WHITEPAPER: VALUE PROPOSITION

ADVANTAGES FOR INVESTORS
Tokenized investment funds on the Blackmoon
Platform provide any type of investor with
important advantages over existing investment
opportunities.

ADVANTAGES FOR
CRYPTO INVESTORS

ADVANTAGES FOR
FIAT INVESTORS

• New opportunities to access assets from
the ﬁat world, without leaving the
crypto universe.

• Higher net return, thanks to the
cost-efﬁcient structure of tokenized
funds. (For comparison, the setup cost of
a structured note is at USD 50,000 to
100,000 plus 2% - 5% of the invested
assets, which is a substantial drag on
the net result to investors.)

• Unparalleled diversiﬁcation
opportunities, thanks to low correlation
between ﬁat and crypto assets.
• Access to a wider range of investment
opportunities with a lower risk proﬁle
to complement and balance existing
speculative exposures.

• Access to new classes of assets thanks
to lower barriers for funds set up and
administration on the Blackmoon
Platform.
• Exchangeability and anonymity as the
inherent features of the tokenized
assets. (KYC process is still required
upon deposit and withdrawal of ﬁat
currencies.)

WHITEPAPER: ADVANTAGES FOR THE INVESTORS

MARKET OVERVIEW
Blockchain has been a buzzword in the ﬁnancial sector since 2009. It has sparked substantial
interest in the industry through its advantages of a distributed ledger, value transfer, and
resilience to counterfeiting.
The creation of Ethereum (ETH) introduced smart contracts to a wide range of business users.
Application of these smart contracts leads to increasing decentralization and democratization of
contractual relationships, effectively leaving no place for interpretation of the ﬁne print in the
agreements and introducing dramatic cost advantages. This has resulted in the proliferation of
various tokenized investment vehicles, from which we can single out three main types: currency
trading, venture capital funds, and tokens pegged to assets (such as gold, the US dollar, etc.).
New entrants to the ﬁnancial technology market aim to disrupt the highly concentrated and
over-regulated ﬁnancial industry. In this environment incumbents are taking steps to keep up
with the pace of technology and with customers' demands. For example, in mid-2017 it was
unveiled* that Barclays had been in discussion with the British ﬁnancial regulator Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA) about bringing cryptocurrencies into play.
Regulators themselves are also moving to embrace blockchain and cryptocurrencies. For example,
Bitcoin** is accepted in Japan, and Swiss tax authorities conﬁrmed*** Bitcoin VAT-free status. Still,
there is much that needs to be done to make the tokenization of these investment vehicles a
seamless, transparent, and regulatory-compliant process.
Blackmoon is the company to bridge the existing gap. Tokenized investment funds are the future
of the ﬁnancial industry, offering compelling advantages such as transparency, tradability, and
cost efﬁciency.

To compare Blackmoon positioning in the existing ecosystem, we plotted some of the most
notable companies on two axes, as shown in the chart in Figure 1 below.

The vertical axis ranks the impact on the industry, measured as a magnitude of market size
change or other inﬂuence on the blockchain universe. The horizontal axis measures the
diversiﬁcation introduced to the crypto world. The more investment options are offered, the more
diversity is brought to the ecosystem. New currencies traded, new companies created, and new
asset classes used as a source of income increase the diversity of the crypto world and thus
efﬁciency.
Along these axes, the quadrants move from the low-impact, low-diversity Scalers, to the
high-impact, high-diversity Market movers.

ICONOMI introduced token repurchases in 2Q 2017. Still, there is no rule how much money will be allocated each
quarter to this program. Thus there is no certainty of cash ﬂows as opposed to Blackmoon tokens held by Continuous
Contributors (as deﬁned further).

** It is stated that “ICONOMIs management will be provided by an EU legislation compliant and regulated service
operator.”Still it is not clear whether the investment vehicles themselves will be legally compliant or whether the
company has such a goal, as opposed to Blackmoon’s mission to create a fully legally-compliant tokenized funds
ecosystem.
*** Melonport’s CEO has extensive experience in ﬁnancial institutions and funds. However Blackmoon’s team has the
advantage of having set up from scratch and successfully running venture capital and alternative ﬁxed-income funds.

OUR HISTORY
Blackmoon Financial Group is a ﬁnancial technology and investment management company
incorporated in Ireland that has been operational since August 2014, having its roots in venture
capital investments in ﬁnancial technology since 2012.
The company is lead by Oleg Seydak*, entrepreneur, ﬁnancial technology investor, founder of
Blackmoon Financial Group, former co-founding partner of Flint Capital; and Ilya Perekopsky**,
entrepreneur and IT angel-investor, and former vice president and chief commercial ofﬁcer of
VK.com. Following is a timeline of the company’s history, from the initial vision in 2014 to the
new opportunities of today. (See the Leadership Team section later in this document for more
details.)

2014 VISION
Oleg Seydak has a talent for identifying
opportunities for automation among lenders.
Through Flint Capital, the venture capital ﬁrm
that he co-founded, Oleg participated in the
pre-IPO buy-out investment of LendingClub and
the buyout of Prosper, as well as in investments
in a set of alternative lenders in Europe.

Company proﬁles

Oleg and his friend Ilya Perekopsky, then vice
president at VK.com, teamed up to found and
make initial investments in Blackmoon Financial
Group.

Lending Club operates an online lending platform that
enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to
purchase notes backed by payments made on loans.
Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer
lending platform.

Blackmoon’s ﬁrst alternative debt fund was
incorporated to make ﬁxed-income investments
in August 2014.

Flint Capital is an international venture capital fund
investing across the US, Israel, and Europe. The fund
was founded by Oleg Seydak and Dmitry Smirnov,
former managing director and former CEO of the
FINAM Global Investment Fund, respectively.
VK.com is the largest European online social media
and social networking service and is ranked 17 (as of
June 2017) in Alexa's global Top 500 Sites.

Prosper Marketplace, America's ﬁrst peer-to-peer
lending marketplace, enables borrowers to obtain a
loan and investors to purchase notes backed by
payments made on loans.

2015 DEVELOPMENT
Work began on technical development of the automation and machine learning algorithms to
process and assess loans issued by alternative lenders in the ﬁat world.
Blackmoon’s automated platform for institutional-class investment in alternative lenders was
created in May 2015 and testing began.
The Blackmoon Lending Marketplace platform was launched and the ﬁrst loan was processed in
June 2015.
By the end of 2015, Blackmoon had ten full-time employees, four originators, and nine investors
on the platform among three different European countries and had processed $3M in loans after
just six months in production.

WHITEPAPER: OUR HISTORY

2016 PROOF OF CONCEPT
The Blackmoon Lending Marketplace platform continued to grow in Europe. We expanded our
team to 16 full-time employees, and ended the year with eight originators among seven different
European countries, 17 investors on the platform, and $40M in aggregate loan value processed.
We made our US debut with demos and a company presentation at LendIt 2016 in San Francisco.

JAN — JUNE 2017 GROWTH
The Blackmoon Lending Marketplace platform processed its ﬁrst US-based loans as a proof of
concept in the US-based market, entered the Spanish market, and reached $13M in monthly
volumes.
Version 2.0 of the Blackmoon Lending Marketplace platform was unveiled at LendIt 2017 in New
York.
Discussions with other technology and service providers in the US solidiﬁed Blackmoon Lending
Marketplace platform’s unique competitive positioning of deal automation, third-party monitoring
and veriﬁcation, and transparency.
Based on market intelligence development began on an originator-facing interface.

JULY 2017 — TODAY NEW OPPORTUNITY
Blackmoon Financial Group identiﬁed an opportunity to leverage internal expertise in setting up
investment products for institutional investors and managing dedicated investment funds. Work
began on creating the ﬁrst tokenized asset management platform, Blackmoon Platform, to set up
and operate tokenized investment funds with a wide range of investment mandates.

DELIVERING SOLID RETURNS
Blackmoon Financial Group has a
proven track record of delivering
solid double-digit returns in EUR
to its investors. The chart shown
in Figure 2 below shows the
historical unaudited performance
of the ﬁxed-income fund with a
mandate to invest in the

THE BLACKMOON PLATFORM
The Blackmoon Platform is a set of technologies, techniques, interfaces, know-how, legal frameworks, and partnerships with banks and other licensed players in the ﬁnancial market. The
resulting platform allows investment advisors to structure, promote, and maintain tokenized
investment funds for their clients.

At the base of the structure is the holding company, owned by Blackmoon Financial Group, with a
subsidiary management company to manage the funds. The holding company develops all
aspects of the Blackmoon Platform, as well as work on attracting and evaluating investment
advisors, who establish tokenized funds within the Blackmoon Platform. These funds are
investment vehicles, each of which is dedicated to executing a particular investment strategy
under the management of its investment advisor. The management company, and by extension,
the holding company, is responsible for compliance, licensing, partnering with banks, and working
with legal advisors.

Holders of BMC tokens are able to register as Continuous Contributors to the Platform via the
Platform’s website. Continuous Contributors are able to deposit BMCs in a depository wallet
linked to their account. To register as a Continuous Contributor the holder of BMC tokens can
choose the role that she/he is willing to execute as a contributor to the Platform. The list of
available roles are publicly available on the blackmooncrypto.com website and are updated as
needed to reﬂect the current needs of the Platform’s continuous development. One of the main
roles will be that of an Investment Advisor. Other roles will be platform promoters, investment
analysts, legal advisors, public auditors, GR advisors, etc.
Each role has a speciﬁc minimum and maximum amount of BMCs that can be deposited by a
Continuous Contributor while executing such a role. The minimum limit will be mostly applicable
to Investment Advisors (please refer to the “Contribution of Investment Advisors” section below).
The majority of roles do not have a minimum deposit limit.

Continuous Contributors have the right to participate in “members-only” discussions regarding
the Platform strategy and development plan. At least once a year or as needed, the Platform will
initiate a vote among the Continuous Contributors to gather opinions of the contributing
community on strategic development matters. The results of such voting will not be binding but
will be strongly considered by the operational management.

Continuous Contributors from time to time conﬁrm the execution of their roles on the platform
to keep their status and depository wallets active. The process of the status conﬁrmation will be
speciﬁed for each role.

BLACKMOON

PAGE 14 OF 27
WHITEPAPER: THE BLACKMOON PLATFORM

IMPORTANT
Because of current regulatory uncertainty and before additional information is publicly released
by the Platform on the matter, green card holders of the United States or citizens or residents (tax
or otherwise) of the United States of America or Singapore, or other U.S. or Singapore Persons, are
not eligible to register as Continuous Contributors therefore preventing transfer of their BMC
tokens to a depository wallet to receive proceeds from them. At such time, Blackmoon will
evaluate the currently applicable legal framework and take all required steps to ensure
compliance.

Continuous Contributors who do not execute their roles or appear to violate the rules applicable
for Continuous Contributors (i.e. appear to be a U.S. or Singapore Person) may have their status
recalled, depository wallet closed, and their deposited BMCs will be transferred to the holder’s
personal wallet without accruing any proceeds.

It is important to note that Continuous Contributors will receive only proceeds from the funds
they contribute to. Participants of the Continuous Contributor program do not need to wait for the
company to reach breakeven to be awarded. All Continuous Contributors regardless of their role
will be awarded in BMC tokens. Participants of the Continuous Contributor program will have the
option to convert accrued BMC tokens to ETH via Bancor Protocol account. . Roles of Continuous
Contributors might differ from fund to fund, the roles available will be subject to the funds needs
and each role will have its own life span (expiration date). Meaning that not all roles last for the
same period of time. If in the case a certain role expires (i.e. fund completed their fundraising
stage) redemption fees, explained in the section below might accrue for a long term thereafter to
other active roles. For those roles which expire rewards will be accrued to the initially registered
BMC account.
Important notice: If the participant does not redeem BMC tokens within half a year (6 months)
the accrual of additional BMC tokens will be suspended and the unredeemed tokens will be
repossessed by the platform.

SOURCES OF PROCEEDS FOR
CONTINUOUS CONTRIBUTORS

SOURCES OF INCOME FOR
INVESTMENT ADVISORS

The Blackmoon Tokens, BMCs, provide proceeds
to Continuous Contributors who deposited BMCs
in depository wallets as follows:

Investment advisors working with the Blackmoon
Platform earn income as follows:

Creation fee

Management fee

0-10% from the amount of the issued
asset tokens. On average 2.5%. This fee
will be paid by investors of the fund
directly.

The management fee averages 2% per
annum paid daily.

Redemption fee

The performance fee is paid either
monthly or quarterly or yearly or upon
exit from investment based on the fund
distribution policy, and is on average
20% from the fund’s performance.
Calculation of the fund’s performance is
audited and published on the Blackmoon
Platform and cannot be different from the
one that is used for income distribution
among holders of the asset tokens.

All investors of a fund who choose to
redeem their asset tokens will pay a fee
for this type of operation. The fee of
redemption will depend on the asset
token redeemed. All redemption fees will
be stated in the fund’s info-window and
might be subject to change.

Continuous Contributors can hold their BMC
tokens in special depository wallets linked to
their accounts to receive their share of proceeds
in proportion to the amount of BMCs deposited
by the Continuous Contributor to the total
amount of deposited BMCs. Only BMCs held in
such a manner receive the proceeds. This is to
discourage transferring of the proceeds to
exchanges, holders that do not contribute to the
Platform in operational manner, or other
unrelated parties. Tokens stored on exchanges or
transferred to other wallets cannot receive
proceeds. Owners can withdraw BMCs from the
depository wallets and sell them to other parties
at any time subject to applicable regulations in
the jurisdictions of the purchaser and the seller

CONTRIBUTION OF INVESTMENT ADVISORS
To be qualiﬁed as an investment advisor on the Blackmoon Platform, an asset manager must (a)
contribute to the company and (b) hold a speciﬁed number of BMC tokens in a depository account.
The amounts of the contribution and deposit will be case speciﬁc, but generally vary from 10,000
to 1,000,000 BMCs. This increases the level of partnership responsibility for the investment
advisor on the Blackmoon Platform and is the ﬁnal step of the qualiﬁcation process. Another
beneﬁt of this level of participation and partnership with the investment advisors is that it forms
a foundation for future self-regulation of the system.

THE FUND STRUCTURE
The fund structure can differ from one case to another. While it will evolve as new data becomes
available, it will be overseen by reputable legal counsel and summaries of such reviews will be
published.

Fully compliant with applicable laws, each investment fund is incorporated as a Limited
Partnership or another form as is suitable for the speciﬁc case
The fund tokenizer domiciled in the Cayman Islands or comparable jurisdiction is the only limited
partner of the fund. This tokenizer performs distribution of the asset tokens to attract ﬁat and/or
crypto-currencies, then the proceeds are transferred to the fund to provide capital for future
investments. All fund transfers will be transparent and their tokens will be continuously tradable
to provide investors with necessary liquidity, subject to any applicable legal restrictions in speciﬁc
jurisdictions, such as the United States and Singapore. An example of this process is shown in
Figure 4 below.

way, distribution of income provides liquidity of the asset tokens. Bought-out tokens are burned
so that income will continue to increase for the remaining asset tokens.

TECHNOLOGY
The Blackmoon Platform applies blockchain technology to create, manage, and govern
tokenized investment vehicles and the platform itself. The platform operates on
Ethereum-based smart-contracts.

OVERVIEW OF THE SMART CONTRACTS

Blackmoon Platform technology has a two-level infrastructure:

Tokens

Tools

• BMC tokens to receive income from
Blackmoon Platform for those registered
as Continuous Contributors and
performing certain roles in Platform
development.

• Asset Proxy

• Funds’ tokens that relate to the
investment activities of the respective
funds.

• Exchange
• Asset Interface
• Others

This combination of tokens and tools allows the investment
process to remain ﬂexible to accommodate the wide diversity
of the funds with various investment mandates and structures
that are available on the Blackmoon Platform.

WHITEPAPER: TECHNOLOGY

BLACKMOON PLATFORM BASE CONTRACT
The Blackmoon Platform base contract covers base roles (Contract Owner, Team member, Advisor, Holder)
and interfaces to Asset Proxies, Exchanges, BMC token and Asset Tokens.
The platform contract holds the deposit wallets’ logic based on Asset Proxies. Each Asset Proxy is an
ECR20-compatible contract and implements an interface between the depository Platform Wallet with
income, and external addresses such as exchanges or ETH wallets.

BMC TOKENS
BMC tokens are implemented as token-as-a-currency instruments and receive proceeds from the Blackmoon
Platform by Continuous Contributors. BMC tokens are connected to the platform via the platform Asset and
Asset Proxy interfaces.

ASSET TOKENS CONTRACT
The Asset Tokens contract is made up of speciﬁc contracts that govern the investment vehicle structure,
fees, and assets. It is implemented as a token-as-a-currency instrument and receives distributions from the
corresponding fund’s capital appreciation. Each contract connects and interacts with the platform via the
asset interface.

PLATFORM EXCHANGES
Platform exchanges hold the exchange rates (BMC-ETH, for example) and provide holders with the ability to
transfer their BMC tokens from the platform. Platform exchanges support major cryptocurrencies, such as
BTC and ETH. Other types of tokens as well as compatibility with ﬁat currencies are contemplated.

BLACKMOON TOOLS / INTERFACES
Blackmoon offers two main interfaces, aimed toward two types of users. The Fund Issuer
Administrative Tool is designed for investment advisors and asset managers; and the Token
Holder’s Analytical Interface is designed for fund investors.
FUND ISSUER
ADMINISTRATIVE TOOL

TOKEN HOLDER’S ANALYTICAL AND
MANAGEMENT INTERFACE

This tool is the comprehensive fund management
system that acts as a one-stop solution. It covers all
the aspects of running the tokenized investment
vehicle and provides the investment advisor or asset
manager with access to the Blackmoon Platform IT
and legal infrastructure. This system enables the
investment manager to:

The Blackmoon Investment Interface provides
tools for investment portfolio structuring and
management as well as a holistic view of the
available investment opportunities and the fund’s
historical and current investment performance.
The interface allows the investor to:

• Pick and order the legal structure of the fund,
including the incorporation of the investment
vehicle, opening up the bank account, and more.

• Analyse and pick investment opportunities from
the list of options that are available on the
Blackmoon Platform.

• Determine the structure of the smart contract for
