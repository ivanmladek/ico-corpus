THE BLOCKCHAIN ERA OF SWISS WEALTH
MANAGEMENT
Project Synopsis
The banking industry does not look the way it should in the age of digitalisation and
decentralisation.
On one hand, the blockchain ecosystem is experiencing exponential growth in asset value
creation while available financial management solutions remain extremely limited.
On the other hand, the off-chain financial ecosystem operates with obsolete technologies
and professional wealth management services that remain exclusive to elite clients while
the vast majority is strictly cut-off.
It is still difficult for the financial industry to confront reality despite signs of change in
clients’ expectations. There is an urgent need for a community-centric investment
framework.
Whether you are an individual, a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation), or a
financial expert, SwissBorg’s objective is to create a democratic, decentralised and
professional ecosystem to manage your portfolio of crypto assets.

In a nutshell, we are a cryptographic financial ecosystem that respects the fundamental
values ​of the blockchain: fairness, accessibility, transparency and trust.
Above all, we are strongly convinced that the community is the single most important
asset of an organisation. Off-chain companies tend to ​create monopolistic systems
favouring a privileged minority. Over time these companies lose their spark and are no
longer able to attract new talents and implement innovative thinking.
At SwissBorg, we aim to create a Cyber Wealth Management Platform using a
community-centric approach. Meritocracy and Swarm Intelligence will be at the heart of
SwissBorg’s ecosystem ensuring that investment services will always be delivered in
accordance with the community’s best interests.

Investment Management
Foreword
SwissBorg’s Investment Management Division is comprised of experienced
portfolio managers and financial advisors, providing innovative wealth management
solutions to the community. ​Our team capitalises on its successful previous experience in
achieving cutting-edge performances under strict risk management constraints.

Understanding and mastering portfolio management is an art that requires years of
experience. While ​cryptocurrencies are a brand-new and rapidly growing asset class,
investment strategies used in traditional asset classes can be applied to successfully
manage portfolios of cryptocurrencies.

The Cryptallion token Hedge Fund
Our Team has extensive experience in alternative investment strategies used by
Hedge Funds. These strategies look for edges (Alpha) to outperform the market. We apply
the same approaches when investing in cryptocurrencies. A Hedge Fund architecture
offers a more robust and dynamic leeway of management while keeping our constant
rigorous and transparent philosophy. Subject to stringent rules, Absolute Return Hedge
Funds like the Cryptallion aim to provide a higher level of investment safety and capital
preservation by investing in a diversified set of strategies and frequently hedging market
risk.
After several months of trading our own money and ​leveraging on 80 years of investment
experience to better calibrate our strategies, ​we have built a diversified set of
sophisticated investment strategies that will be employed by SwissBorg’s Flagship Fund:
The Cryptallion token Hedge Fund (CSB).

By combining cryptocurrencies market beta in the Indexes pocket and tactical trading
strategies in the opportunistic pocket, we provide investors with a double layer of
diversification.
The Cryptallion token Fund (CSB) will be offered exclusively during our token Generation
Event (“TGE”), that will be done in H1 2018. After that period, the CSB token will only be
accessible on a exchange trading basis.
The Cryptallion offers a highly competitive and unique proposition:
-

All of the tokens (100%) distributed to subscribers and without unfair discounts.
Most other token funds tend to have either high entry/exit fees and/or a team
allocation. Meaning that as soon as you invest you are losing money on day 1 as
your share of the total is smaller than what you put in. Discounts ​for token Funds
are another unfair practice in some other token funds. This practice automatically
generates a gain for investors with the highest discounts and a loss for investors
with the lowest, while they are all investing at the same point in time, with the same
risk.

-

Multi-Strategy with Absolute Return approach​. Most token Funds focus on long
only strategies such as ICO investing or top cryptos, which have a high level of risk
if the cryptocurrency market falls. The CSB aims to be materially hedged most of
the time to limit the risks from falling markets and instead benefit from a
diversified number of sophisticated investment strategies.

SwissBorg Crypto Index Strategies
SwissBorg provides investors with a transparent, diversified and unbiased source
of performance through indexed and advanced investment strategies with a competitive
fee structure.
We believe that diversification and quantitative tactical asset allocation are key to a
portfolio’s long-term growth.
By creating a full spectrum of Thematic Indexes, we are helping financial advisors,
investment managers and private investors from both off and on-chain worlds to build a
diversified portfolio allocation. To meet each investor's expectations, we plan to offer
strategies ranging from basic to more advanced solutions.

SwissBorg expects to launch two tokenized index strategies in H1 2018. The first one will
invest in a Large Cap Index and the second one will be a Mid Cap Index. Both strategies
will be passive with some smart beta rebalancing components to limit the weight of very
large cryptos.
Capitalisation Breakdown

We are currently developing the next Smart Index strategy, that is, the Mid Cap Index
Strategy and our plan is to start the development of Cyborg and Swarm Indexes after the
TGE.
SwissBorg Large Cap Index
The index holds the top 20 coins by market capitalisation, with a maximum
weight of 25% per coin to maintain sufficient diversification.
The index weights and their constituents are recalculated and adjusted on
an optimised basis.
Expected launch: Q1 2018

Smart Mandate
Smart contracts allow contractual clauses to be partially or fully self-executing,
self-enforcing, or both. The aim with smart contracts is to provide superiority to
traditional contract law, offer more transparency and reduce other transaction costs
associated with contracting.

Our experienced investment team of asset managers, private bankers and financial
advisors have extensively brainstormed to cover the limitations observed in the wealth
management off-chain world. By combining our professional experience with the smart
contract technology, we have built a holistic framework for Advisory: the “Smart
Mandate.”
By doing a rigorous profiling of a client’s expectations (returns, ethical bias etc..), risk
tolerance and common identity parameters (KYC, AML, Tax), our AI technology will
generate a tailored investment mandate. Finally, our user friendly client platform will
allow clients to access detailed and constantly up-to-date reports.

How Does the Smart Mandate Work?
Using the latest technologies in terms of AI and leveraging on the MAST (Meritocracy,
Accessibility, Swiss made and Trusted) philosophy, SwissBorg intends to fill the financial
advisory gap.

Crypto Off-chain Fund
In September 2017, the combined market cap of cryptocurrencies surpassed
$150bn, almost 7 times higher than the market cap at the beginning of the year. Despite
this strong momentum, traditional mutual funds specialised in crypto investments remain
very limited.
Bankers are eagerly awaiting products that offer the opportunity to diversify their
portfolios of traditional assets. The results of the graph below speak for themselves.

SwissBorg Calculations - Data: CoinMarketcap.com & iShares.com - Period: Jan. 2013 to Aug. 2017 - Allocation: Monthly
Rebalanced

We are in advanced discussions with institutional clients who wish to invest in
cryptocurrencies and trust our expertise. Due to mandate restrictions, regulatory
restrictions or lack of expertise, institutional investors do not want to invest directly in
tokens. We have decided to come up with a bridging solution: a crypto off-chain fund. By
doing so, we will offer institutional investors access to cryptocurrency investments with a
traditional off-chain fund structure that will hold the cryptocurrencies.
On the operational side, the fund is planned to start its seeding period throughout
November 2017 and being launched during Q1 2018:

SwissBorg Crypto Index MVP
Far beyond Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology has the potential
to transform the operational architecture of financial services.
We have designed an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), called SwissBorg Crypto Index
(SBCI), to show how smart contracts could be used to optimise the process of creation and
administration of an investment fund.
In the Off-Chain world, all of these operations are centralised, involve multiple
intermediaries and manual interventions. As a result, the mutual fund system is complex
and present hazard of operational errors and data corruption.
The purpose of our MVP is to develop a compilation of smart contracts to manage the
operations of an investment fund more securely and efficiently.
We begin by describing how the cycle of an investment works in the off-chain world. Then,
we analyse how we reinterpreted and optimized the same cycle with smart contracts.
The off-chain investment system is in general slow and expensive.

Average Entry/Exit Fees

The current subscription/redemption scheme for an off-chain fund is as follows:

Source
https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/lu/Documents/technology/lu_impact-blockchain-fund-distribution.pdf

Because the off-chain financial ecosystem is composed of privately owned databases
where multiple (often manual) verifications are required, the system is extremely slow. In
addition, the existence of multiple intermediaries increases the risk of errors.
The maths are not even necessary, if you compare human vs machine when you think that
an employee works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and a smart contract works 24/7.
We built our MVP, focusing on a strategy called SwissBorg Crypto Index (SBCI) by using a
smart contract to replicate the functioning of an off-chain fund.
We will use an updated version of this architecture for our Smart Indexes distribution.
By adapting the off-chain fund subscription model with smarts contracts, we obtained the
following figures:

With Micha Roon (Smart Contract Design & Dev)
Going forward, smart contracts in charge of handling subscription/redemption flows will
be configured to call for KYC/AML procedures or to be signed with an approved digital
identity.

Smart Mandate Design
The whole Smart Mandate architecture is under design and will be based on a
collection of multi-signature smart contracts providing all the necessary functionalities
for automated investment strategies. The designed multi-signature smart contracts will
allow for multiple actors to interact with the smart contracts. The actors will be either
financial advisors managing their clients’ investment universes, or the clients themselves.

Every Smart Mandate starts with a new or existing
Investor ID smart contract which represents an
investor and holds all the documentation issued from
the KYC process. Once established, an Investor ID
smart contract will be reusable for multiple Smart
Mandates.
We believe in the future and the security of the
blockchain; therefore, all the validated documents will
be stored encrypted by using existing solutions like
IPFS or Storj. The mapping between all the documents
and the Investor ID is done by storing all the addresses
of the documents in the smart contract.
The Smart Mandate is represented by a Main Account, which is a multi-signature smart
contract created through our web platform either by the investor or our financial
advisors. Every Smart Mandate is first linked to an Investor’s ID by linking its address in
the Main Account.

The core part of the Smart Mandate architecture is an Investment Universe, which can be
compared to an off-chain portfolio. Each investment universe’s smart contract regroups
all the tokens, crypto-currencies and smart contracts of the same level of investment risk.

The current Ethereum blockchain does not provide the capabilities and the performance
needed to implement real-time Artificial Intelligence: the latency required by the
blockchain to approve any new transaction does not meet today’s live investment needs.
Therefore, we will externalise this AI computation off the blockchain by intercepting

events occurring on the blockchain and send them to our backend microservices’
architecture through an Oracle.

Our microservices environment will implement all the necessary security and end-to-end
encryption to mitigate nowadays security threats and gain our clients’ trust. All the
incoming events from the blockchain are analysed and dispatched to dedicated
microservices which will take investment decisions based on mathematical analysis and
heuristics.
Our web-based dashboard will display state of our clients Smart Mandates, but will also
include investment analysis, reports and tools for our clients and financial advisors to
manage their investments 24/7.
All our solutions will have an associated native mobile solution for the top most popular
mobile devices. We also believe our clients should not be limited to a specific platform.
Our clients should be able to work transparently between the web-based and mobile
applications, by switching from one to the other seamlessly. Such functionality is mainly
brought by the nature of the blockchain itself and the accessibility of our backend services
at any time of the day.

Investment Fund Cryptographic Audit
Only a few exchanges are providing “Proof-of-Reserve” today. Therefore, we have
built a Hybrid Audit Process using the IFPS protocol, to offer investors an extra layer of
protection and transparency. This solution offers the flexibility required to execute
alternative investment strategies while offering investors a solid level of trust.
Passive investment products are predictable and do not try to exploit a specific edge,
therefore making the portfolio public in real time is not an issue. In the case of actively

managed products, the positions reveal part of the strategy of the manager, and therefore
the full information cannot be made public in real time, or other participants may take
advantage of it, to the disadvantage of the investors in the token fund.
SwissBorg aims to provide as much transparency as possible into the holdings in real time
via IFPS plus a periodic third party check with auditors.

Cold Storage & Hot Wallet
There are several types of wallets that provide different ways to store and access
your digital currency. Wallets can be broken down into three distinct categories –
software, hardware, and paper. Software wallets can be a desktop, mobile or online.

the most rigorous industry standards.

C-Share & Swiss Cooperative
Before ICOs, investing in disruptive technologies was only available to well
connected insiders, high net worth individuals, and top clients in private banks.
Initial coin offerings are a new way for startups to raise capital and for investors to benefit
from the growth potential of early stage businesses. However, in our view, the way it is
done today is going to change. In that perspective, we are preparing SwissBorg to
embrace the foreseeable upcoming changes in the blockchain world.

Our view is that the next wave of ICOs (ICO 2.0) will provide an explicit link between a
company and the digital certificate of ownership (i.e the token).
Today Cooperative comprise more than one billion members around the world, their
activities range from agriculture to football teams like FC Barcelona. In Switzerland there
are more than 9,600 cooperatives and Raiffeisen Bank with its 1.7 million members was
an inspiration to us.
But what kind of organisations are they exactly? Emmanuel Kamdem, an expert on
cooperatives with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) gives this definition:
“When people unite to create wealth on a democratic basis, and when that wealth is
redistributed in an equitable manner, we are talking about a cooperative. Cooperatives
are therefore not just an economic phenomenon but a philosophy; a particular
entrepreneurial model based on values like democracy, equality, solidarity and
reciprocity.”
Cooperatives have done better at weathering the financial crisis of 2008-2009 than other
banking institutions. This is because their members are both customers and owners, and
as a result have more control.
As soon as the C-share protocol will be ready to operate, we will consider the option to
implement it in the context of SwissBorg.

Meritocracy
"Where the establishment emphasised humility, prudence, lineage, meritocracy celebrates
ambition, achievement, brains & self-betterment". Christopher Hayes - American liberal political
journalist, and author.

Meritocracy is a trendy word in political speeches today, but it is never really applied
anywhere mainly due to a lack of transparency built on asymmetrical information
structures.
At SwissBorg, we believe that the essence comes from swarm intelligence and that
everyone who contribute to the project should be fairly rewarded. Swarm intelligence
focuses on the collective behaviours that result from the local interactions of the

individuals with each other and with their environment, by using decentralised control
and self-organisation.
By creating a virtuous circle where all members are advanced on the contribution they
produce, the dynamic initiated is an elegant and efficient way of building a strong and
perennial organisation. Moreover, by being rewarded for every relevant contribution to
the community, every member pulls in the same direction as all interests are aligned.
With the issuance of the the SwissBorg Network Token (‘CHSB’) a multi-utility token, we
will be the very first community-centric wealth management platform 100 % aligned with
the interests of all users. Token holders will have the opportunity to participate in the
development of the SwissBorg network through the concept of “proof of meritocracy”.
A core feature of the CHSB Token is giving holders the ability to choose the direction in
which the network will be developed. The CHSB token is used to generate a referendum
token, called the “RSB token”. For each decision, the RSB token is used by the holders to
make decisions on the referendum proposals. The voting power will be weighted based on
the amount of CHSB tokens users hold at the time of the referendum announcement and
it will not cost any CHSB tokens to vote.

The wisdom of the community is a powerful asset often underestimated in today’s
monopolistic banking system. Having a trustworthy source of opinion results in higher
customer satisfaction and access to swarm intelligence results in higher profit margins for
the company.

One major drawback of today’s financial institutions is the lack of influence their users
possess over the networks themselves. Despite being the end-user, we are often
powerless, having no say on how the scope of services should evolve. We aim to
democratise this power, giving our community a direct influence over all decisions within
the network.
Having the willingness to promote the intrinsic values of the blockchain, we have
dedicated ourselves in creating an investment paradigm aligned with them.

LEADERSHIP
Revenue Model & Business Development Plan
Our Revenue Model is clear and straightforward. We have two main categories of
revenues stream:
1. By providing investment solutions to the community, we will receive a fair
portion of the management and performance fees.
2. By providing investment services to the community, We will receive transaction
fees, via the SwissBorg Trading Exchange Platform for example.

We have a strong commitment on generating revenues from day one. By positioning
ourselves as a bridge between off-chain & on-chain investment world, our main objective
is to offer investment solutions that can fit both worlds.

more tokens will be distributed to him. The remaining amount of tokens will be allocated to the newly appointed
team member.
