Abstract
In today’s day and age, blockchain-based technology and its
applications have advanced the innovation in many fields, such
as the electronic money transfers, personal banking, online
payments, Internet of Things, distributed storage, digital voting
and others. While most of the cryptocurrencies have a
dystopian future in vision, in which the end-user is 100%
disconnected from the finance industry, some new players have
started to fill in this gap (Ripple, Populous, etc.) by becoming a
bridge between financial institutions or companies and the
cryptocurrency adopters. In the same fashion, FOIN aims to be
the cryptocurrency for the finance sector, enabling the coin
holders to gain from its inherent cryptographical model (Proof
of Stake) and from the range of financial instruments made
available through the FOIN ecosystem.

The cryptocurrency for the finance sector

foin.io

State of the art
Since the dawn of the modern age, all major currencies have been issued and controlled by
central authorities. The ancient Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle once said about the
creation of money as a new element in society: "When the inhabitants of one country became
more dependent on those of another, and they imported what they needed, and exported
what they had too much of, money necessarily came into use" (1). Until recently, societies
have depended exclusively on central authorities and financial institutions to process
payments and to offer financial services. While this is satisfactory for most actors in the
scene, this centralized approach suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based
model (2). With the advent of cryptography, financial transactions had been redefined
forever. The first and most popular finance-related cryptography application has been
Bitcoin, the first P2P (peer to peer) network that can prevent forgery in a trustless
environment by solving the "Byzantine Generals Problem" (3). While digital currencies have
been known for quite some time now, only recently real progress has been made regarding
the actual implementation of trustless, decentralized, distributed cryptocurrencies.
However, in spite of all this, the only way of gaining wealth through cryptocurrency
investments has been to speculate on the future value of the cryptocurrency when valued
against fiat currency and holding on to the electronic token. Unfortunately, this has paved
the way for countless cryptocurrencies and initial-coin-offerings (ICOs) taking advantage of
the inexperience and uneducated investors who, out of the fear of missing out on potential
returns, have jumped on any opportunity they might have had in their way, regardless of
the potential utility of the coin or token. Because of these and its unregulated nature,
cryptocurrencies have been either forbidden or strictly regulated in several jurisdictions,
including some very highly populated ones, such as China, Singapore or United States. It is
expected for this trend to refract on other jurisdictions in the coming years.
Today’s investment scene, at a global level, is highly prohibitive and limiting. An investment
services provider, defined as a set of connected funnels forming a complex whole, does not
describe the currently siloed payments networks and financial instruments that lack effective
inter-connectivity to deliver on the demands of today’s investors. As for its global reach, due
to the high costs, legal jurisdiction issues and inefficiencies of cross-border payments, many
investors are missing out from potential investment opportunities, instead having to rely on
the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies.

Introduction to FOIN
Currently addressing the issue of the global siloed investment scene, but not limiting itself to
this sector for the future, FOIN aims to be the cryptocurrency bridging the finance sector
with the personal investors by acting as a highly curated investment medium. FOIN will act
as the de-facto cryptocurrency coin within this ecosystem made of financial services
providers, blockchain applications and A.I. (artificial intelligence) modules.
From a technological point of view, the FOIN network uses the PoS (Proof of Stake)
mathematical model to reach network consensus. Proof of Stake is a novel consensus
mechanism for cryptocurrencies that is an alternative to PoW (Proof of Work), which is the
most widely used consensus mechanism implemented in Bitcoin, Ethereum and the majority of
cryptocurrencies. From a technical point of view, FOIN is a hybrid cryptocurrency, meaning
it uses Proof of Work for the initial distribution of coins (which is what the majority of
cryptocurrencies use) but then switches to fully Proof of Stake to provide the network
security. Under this hybrid design, after the initial mining using Proof of Work is complete,
the Proof of Work consensus mechanism is irrelevant for the long run. From the user's point
of view, Proof of Stake is the only consensus mechanism available, thus providing a more
secure, environmentally friendly and more cost-competitive peer to peer cryptocurrency. In
FOIN, Proof of Stake is the core consensus mechanism used to settle transactions.

Brief history of cryptocurrencies
1998 – 2009 Pre-Bitcoin
Although Bitcoin was the first established cryptocurrency, there had been previous attempts
at creating online currencies with ledgers secured by encryption. The first proposals for
distributed digital scarcity-based cryptocurrencies were Wei Dai's b-money (4) and Nick
Szabo's bit gold (5).

2008 – Satoshi Nakamoto
A paper called "Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System" (2), authored by Satoshi
Nakamoto, was posted to a cryptography mailing list. The paper described methods of
using a peer to peer network to sustain a trustless system for electronic transactions.

2009 – Bitcoin begins
On January 3rd, 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi Nakamoto
mining the genesis block of Bitcoin. Embedded in the coinbase of this block was the text:
"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."

2010 – First Bitcoin transaction
Because it had never been exchanged for goods or services before, it was impossible to
assign a monetary value to the bitcoin units of the emerging cryptocurrency. The value of
the first bitcoin transactions were negotiated by individuals on the bitcoin forum with one
notable transaction of 10,000 BTC used to indirectly purchase two pizzas. If the buyer had
hung onto those Bitcoins, at today’s prices they would be worth more than $100 million.

2011 – Altcoins
As interest in Bitcoin increases and the idea of decentralized and encrypted currencies
appeal to a wider audience, the first alternative cryptocurrencies appear. These are
sometimes known as altcoins and while the majority of them are based on Bitcoin's source
code, they try to improve on the original Bitcoin design by offering greater speed,
anonymity or some other feature. Among the first to emerge were Namecoin and Litecoin.
Currently there are over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation with new ones frequently
appearing.

2012 – The Bitcoin Foundation
In September 2012, the Bitcoin Foundation was launched to "accelerate the global growth
of bitcoin through standardization, protection, and promotion of the open source protocol".
The founders were Gavin Andresen, Jon Matonis, Patrick Murck, Charlie Shrem, and Peter
Vessenes (6). 2012 was also the year that Bitcoin saw wider acceptance, with merchants
such as BitPay reported having over 1,000 merchants accepting Bitcoin and even big
services such as Wordpress.com starting to accept Bitcoin.

2013 – Bitcoin price crash
In February 2013, Coinbase reported selling US $1 million worth of bitcoins in a single
month. Towards the end of the year, shortly after the price of one Bitcoin reaches $1,000
for the first time, the price quickly begins to decline, following a ban from the People's Bank
of China. On 5 December 2013, the People's Bank of China prohibited Chinese financial
institutions from using Bitcoin. After the announcement, the value of bitcoins plummeted to
around $300.

2014 – Mt. Gox
While the Bitcoin network continued to grow, exceeding 10 petahash/second for the first
time in 2014, in early February 2014, one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox,
9

FOIN

The cryptocurrency for the finance sector

foin.io

suspended withdrawals citing technical issues. By the end of the month, Mt. Gox had filed
for bankruptcy protection in Japan amid reports that 744,000 bitcoins had been stolen.

2016 – Ethereum and ICOs
This is the year Bitcoin's dominance had been diluted with altcoins gaining more traction. The
platform called Ethereum uses cryptocurrency known as Ether to facilitate blockchain-based
smart contracts and apps. This also enabled the emergence of ICOs (Initial Coin Offering),
a term specifically chosen to resemble the financial acronym IPO (Initial Public Offering).
However, in spite of the technical advances made by the Ethereum platform, there had been
multiple instances where the ICOs failed to deliver on their promises.

2017 – The Bitcoin ecosystem
As more and more businesses and services started to accept Bitcoin as an alternative
payment method to legacy payment methods, the Bitcoin ecosystem gradually widened and
legitimized the blockchain applications and cryptocurrencies themselves. This, in turn, has
attracted more and more investors of various sizes, 2017 being the year where some of the
big players in the US finance sectors joined the Bitcoin game. During this year the
cryptocurrencies landscape had witnessed tremendous growth, from a total market cap of
17 billion dollars in January 2017 to almost 800 billion dollars in late December (and
eventually crossing the 800 billion dollars mark in early January).

PoS vs PoW
Introduction
In broad terms, a blockchain application can be viewed as a distributed database, keeping
track of the users' balances. But instead of a traditional database, where it's kept on a
single server (therefore vulnerable to hacking), a blockchain application such as a
cryptocurrency is distributed, with replicas of the database scattered across the world,
forming a large network accessible by everyone. This eliminates the hacking problem
because an attacker would have to hack all the participants of the network, which is
statistically and technically not feasible.
In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem (7) presents the problem of a distributed
data store being unable to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three
guarantees: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance. Cryptocurrencies are available
(every request receives a (non-error) response) and partition-tolerant (the system continues
to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped or delayed by the
10

FOIN

The cryptocurrency for the finance sector

network between nodes). To satisfy the consistency condition (albeit weak consistency
because of the confirmation blocks), a reliable consensus algorithm had to be developed
that could reliably work in a large network of trustless nodes susceptible to partition.
Considered to be Satoshi Nakamoto’s major breakthrough, the PoW (Proof of Work)
consensus algorithm tries to solve the consistency problem of the CAP theorem. It relies on
the processing power of the computing devices taking part in the network, without any
central authority. However, because of the algorithm's computationally intensive nature,
which is dependent on energy consumption, a new-age gold rush phenomenon had been
observed. Because of Bitcoin's deflationary nature, the race for more efficient computing
devices and mining installations had started. Unfortunately, the technical innovation in
computing efficiency cannot keep up with the demand for Bitcoin mining, meaning the Bitcoin
network consumes more and more electricity as it grows. This is kept profitable for the
participants in the Bitcoin network (miners) by a combination of market price inflation and
transaction fees, but it is obviously harmful to the environment and inefficient with the
computational resources.
The security of the Bitcoin network relies on the PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm
in the form of block mining. Each participant of the network is given a computationally
intensive puzzle to verify the validity of the block. The first node to successfully solve the
puzzle is rewarded with a fixed number of coins (block reward) and a variable number of
coins (transaction fees). The network is considered fair because the odds of a participant
node to solve the computational puzzle first are directly proportional with its computing
power relative to the total network computing power.
This network fairness aspect of Proof of Work introduces a theoretical vulnerability, the so
called "51% attack" (8), where an attacker with at least 51% processing power of the total
network power could forge transactions and verify them on behalf of the network. However,
because of the current network size and because coin mining uses physically scarce resources
(specialized hardware and electricity), it is cost prohibitive, if not impossible, for an attacker
to launch and sustain such an attack on the Bitcoin network or any other large Proof of Work
network.
The nature of Proof of Work rewards the first node that solves the puzzle. This translates in
an arms race to deploy more and more resources in crypto mining that consumes a
proportional amount of energy, without stop, 24/7. While there are other computationally
intensive tasks that also consume a lot of energy (3D rendering, video processing, weather
simulations, physics simulations, etc.), these tasks are computed incrementally and are
intensive because of the complex problems they need to solve. In Proof of Work, only the
11

FOIN

first node's work is taken into consideration and the work done by the rest of the nodes is
discarded. This inefficiency is a severe downside of the Proof of Work consensus algorithm
and it is one of the main reasons that triggered the search for alternative solutions.

Ethereum Energy Consumption Index Chart (10)
One of these alternative solutions whose security is not based on expensive computations
relies on PoS (Proof of Stake) algorithms. If in the PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm
the participant node is likely to be the first to create a new block and collect the block
rewards based on his computing power compared to the total network computing power, in
PoS (Proof of Stake), instead of computational resources, the probability to create a new
12

block and receive the associated reward and fees is proportional to a user’s ownership
(stake) in the system. An individual stakeholder who has X fraction of the total number of
coins in circulation has a X probability to be the first to create a new block.
The rationale behind this consensus algorithm is the following: users with the highest stakes
in the system have the most interest to maintain a secure network, as they will suffer the most
if the reputation and price of the cryptocurrency would diminish because of the attacks. To
mount a successful attack, an outside attacker would need to acquire most of the currency,
which would be prohibitively expensive for a popular system.

Proof of Work
In order to fully understand Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, one must understand the
mechanism from which it derived, Proof of Work. Because Bitcoin is the most popular realworld use case for Proof of Work, we will use it as our example in order to better
understand how the consensus algorithm works. The transaction data of the Bitcoin network
is stored as a linked-list of blocks. They are secured by mathematical functions and the older
a block is, the harder it is to alter or remove, which is what makes all transactions irreversible.
Among other metadata, the main data stored in a block are:
• block header (version number, hash of the previous block, Merkle tree root hash (9),
timestamp, target difficulty, block nonce)
• list of transactions.
The hash of the block is calculated by hashing twice the block header with the SHA-256
(10) function:
ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘 = 𝑆𝐻𝐴256(𝑆𝐻𝐴256(ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘 ))
In order to simplify the notation and to account for various hashing functions used in Proof
of Work algorithms, we’ll consider a generic hashing function
ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ(𝐵) ∈ [0, 𝑀]
where
• B is the block header of the current block
• M is the upper boundary of the hashing function
To successfully embed this block in the blockchain, the resulting block hash must be smaller
than the current difficulty target, which is given by the inequality:
ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ(𝐵) ≤

𝑀
𝐷

(1)

where:
•
•
•
•

hash(B) is the hashing function
B is the block header of the current block
M is the maximum value of the hashing function (upper boundary)
D is the target difficulty

14

FOIN

It is important to note that the Proof of Work mining process is not a constructive process,
where you calculate upon the results of the previous calculations. Instead, it is more similar
to a lottery, where the first miner to find the block hash to fit the criteria submits it to the
blockchain and ultimately gains the fees and reward that comes with the block. As you can
see in equation (1), the bigger the difficulty, the smaller the interval in which the hash must
reside. Because the hashing function’s output is unpredictable, it outputs a completely
different hash for even slightly different inputs. Therefore, miners must race to find a variant
of the block header (in practice they increase the nonce from the block header starting from
0) that completely changes the block hash, hoping that they will be the first to collect the
reward and the fees.

Proof of Stake
According to Proof of Work’s inherent rules, all participants in the network (miners) have a
fair chance of discovering the next block and being rewarded. The only thing they can
change is how fast they iterate through the possible block header variations by using
advanced hardware and consuming more power.
In comparison, Proof of Stake’s rules are changed to account for the user’s stake in the
blockchain network. Once the coins are “mature” enough, meaning they have a specific
number of confirmations, they can be staked. The equation from (1) is changed as follows:
ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ(𝐵) ≤ 𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒(𝑈) ×

𝑀
𝐷

(2)

where
•
•
•
•
•

hash(B) is the hashing function
B is the block header of the current block
balance(U) is a function that returns the balance of address U
M is the maximum value of the hashing function (upper boundary)
D is the target difficulty

Unlike the Proof of Work inequality, the Proof of Stake inequality inserts an easily
changeable factor, the user’s balance, which offsets the need for specialized hardware and
power consumption. In short terms, the higher the balance of a miner, the easier the difficulty
for him. This results in the need for expensive computation being eliminated. This also
enforces a fairness to the network: the statistical probability to mint a new block is directly
proportional to the miner’s balance of coins when compared to the current amount of coins
being actively staked.

15

FOIN

In order for the miner to collect the reward and fees, he must provide a valid proof of
ownership of the address being staked. In order to achieve this, he can sign the newly minted
block with the private key corresponding to the staking address. This ensure that only the
owner of the coins (holding the private key used to unlock them) can stake them, and no
other miners can hijack their address to stake the coins and collect the rewards for
themselves.

Consensus in FOIN
The FOIN cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency for the finance sector, uses a hybrid of PoS
(Proof of Stake) / PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm. The proof of work algorithm
is used for the initial distribution of wealth and now relies solely on proof of stake. Therefore,
we shall consider that the FOIN network is secured by a more secure Proof of Stake
algorithm, since this is the algorithm the great majority of the coin owners will use. FOIN is
among the only cryptocurrencies that uses the unmodified proof of stake approach,
according to which the user’s stake is computed as his share of total coin supply (more on
this in the Coin Minting topic).
The main advantages of Proof of Stake over other consensus algorithms are:
• Proof of Stake is eco-friendlier, as it is more efficient and does not require massive
amounts of electricity. It is estimated that the combined total electricity costs required
to run the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks amount to over 5 billion dollars in 2018
(14) (10);
• Proof of Stake discourages the forming of cartels that could present a threat to the
decentralization aspect of the network, therefore giving everyone a fair chance at
staking. 1 million dollars worth of coins will get you exactly 2 times higher returns
than $500,000 worth of coins, without any advantages a better funded PoW miner
would have by being able to acquire more expensive and more efficient specialized
hardware;
• There is no need for specialized mining hardware at all, so the barrier to entry is
dictated by how many coins a potential investor would want to buy. As opposed to
Proof of Work, where the mining hardware is mandatory in order to gain a marginal
profit, you need to accommodate the specialized hardware in a secure, temperaturecontrolled facility. The mining operation would also have to have access to a
sufficiently advanced electrical grid infrastructure capable of delivering the required
electrical load;
16

FOIN

The cryptocurrency for the finance sector

foin.io

• An extra channel of wealth creation (besides the value appreciation on partner
exchanges) by the PoS algorithm which rewards miners with a variable percentage
of their total staking coins, similar to how a bank deposit would function;
• Enhanced security for the "51% attack" vector that enforces a vastly discouraging
financial barrier to even attempt such an attack.
It is regarded by the crypto community as a whole, with even prominent figures from
Ethereum such as Vitalik Buterin (11) declaring that Proof of Stake is the most probable
direction for the future because it is truly decentralized, distributed, secure and ASICresistant. Because it is resistant to mining using specialized hardware, thus rendering null
the incentive for mass-mining the cryptocurrency, the coin will remain in the control of the
cryptocurrency owners, regardless of any exterior efforts to hijack or manipulate the
blockchain.

Coin minting
While in the Proof of Work consensus algorithm the generation of new coins is called “coin
mining”, for Proof of Stake algorithms the process is called “coin minting”. The FOIN network
is set to generate a new block in average every 90 seconds with a reward per block of 3
FOIN. That translates to roughly 1.16% inflation per annum. This approach ensures that the
new coins issued in circulation are kept in tight check as to not affect the existing coin owners
and to preserve the stability of the network. The total number of coins mined in the Proof of
Work initial distribution phase is 90 million and will be distributed to future coin owners
according to internal rules.
Coin minting works by “locking” your coins in your wallet and using these locked up coins as
a trust indicator that you are trustworthy. The more coins you are actively staking, the bigger
your weight in the network, the more coins you are earning from staking.
Because the FOIN network has a fixed reward per block, this open the door for competition
among the cryptocurrency owners to stake the longest. For example, if 100% of the coin
owners are actively staking the coin, all of them combined will receive 1.16% from the total
supply, distributed proportionally according to their share in the network.

17

FOIN

The cryptocurrency for the finance sector

foin.io

The share in the network is calculated with the following formula:
𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 (𝐴) =

𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑠𝐴

(3)

where
• share(A) is a function resulting the share of address A in accordance to the total
FOIN in circulation
• 𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 is the total number of coins in circulation at any given time
• 𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑠𝐴 is the total number of coins of address A
However, if only 20% of the coin owners are actively staking, they will be the only ones to
receive the block rewards to a combined total of 1.16% from the total supply, distributed
proportionally according to the following formula:
𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 (𝐴) =

𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔
𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑠𝐴

(4)

where
• share(A) is a function resulting the share of address A in accordance to the total
FOIN actively staking
• 𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 is the total number of actively staking coins at any given time
• 𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑠𝐴 is the total number of coins of address A
As one can see, the difference between the two formulas, (3) and (4), is the base from which
the share is calculated. The smaller the base, the bigger the rewards. The fewer people
actively staking, the bigger the rewards for those few coin owners. Continuing the example
above, where only 20% of the coin owners are actively staking, that would translate in 5
times as many coins according to their weight in the network. Based on industry data from
similar Proof of Stake cryptocurrencies, we estimate that there will be between 5% - 6%
increase in coins each year if a client is actively staking all year round. So, for a coin owner
with 100,000 FOIN actively staking since January 1st 2019, he will have around 105,000106,000 FOIN or more on January 1st, 2020.

Claim-Code
Because of its applications in the real world, a need for a more secure way of transferring
coins from one party to another had risen. Our approach to this need is a multi-stage
payments software solution, similar to an automated escrow system. This solution uses an
additional “Claim Code” that must be communicated to the intended recipient so that he can
gain possession of the funds. This solution will not be available at launch, but instead will be
deployed in stages. While the initial stage will be similar to a centralized solution, in the
long term, our focus will be on a fully decentralized solution.
For example, if Alice wants to send Bob funds in a secure way, Alice would opt for the
Claim-Code transfer instead of the regular blockchain transfer. The transfer would follow
these steps:
1. Alice visits the official portal for the Claim-Code and initiates a new sending
transaction. She can input the exact amount she would like Bob to receive (optional),
Bob’s address (optional) and an expiration date (optional) on period for this
transaction.
2. Alice will be given an address where to send funds along with a Claim-Code. At this
moment, the Claim-Code is considered private. Without it, Bob cannot receive the
coins.
a. If she entered the exact amount she wants Bob to receive, she will also be
shown the total amount to be sent (what Bob will receive + Claim-Code fees).
In this case, she will pay the Claim-Code fees.
b. If she didn’t specify a specific amount to be received by Bob, she will be
shown just the address where she needs to send as many coins as she wants.
In this case, the Claim-Code fees will be deducted from the total coins sent.
19

3. Alice sends the funds from her FOIN wallet to the address generated by the ClaimCode portal.
4. Alice then tells Bob that she has initiated a Claim-Code transaction and gives him the
Claim-Code.
5. Bob visits the Claim-Code portal and enters his Claim-Code.
a. If the Claim-Code transaction has not expired, Bob will see that there is a
transaction pending from Alice. He will be shown the transaction status and
the funds available for him. If Alice has chosen to send a variable amount of
coins, he will be shown the fees deducted from the total amount and how much
he will receive. If Alice had not specified a destination address, he must enter
his receiving address.
b. If an expiration date is specified and it is past, he will not be able to receive
the funds.

Claim-Code transactions protocol

This approach also brings with it an added privacy layer. Because all blockchain transaction
are public, anyone can see the direct transactions between Alice and Bob. However, using
the Claim-Code solution, the platform acts as a third party and all transactions between
Alice and Bob will be private. Also, by using this approach, any transaction is guaranteed
to arrive at its intended recipient. This translates to:
• no more lost funds sent to invalid addresses
• no more lost funds sent to addresses where the recipient doesn’t have the private
key to
• no more lost funds to MITM (man-in-the-middle) scams, where ICO websites were
hijacked and the crowd sale address swapped with the attacker’s
• ability to cancel a transaction before redeeming it by the recipient
• ability to send coins without knowing the destination address

AI integration
Artificial intelligence (AI) dates back to 1956 when it was introduced as a subdivision of
computer science, which was expected to operate intelligently and respond as efficiently as
humans. In computer science AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any
device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of
successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when
a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such
as "learning" and "problem solving".
In today’s fast-moving finance sector, FSPs (financial services providers) need to balance
automation and personal analysis to work more efficiently and effectively. Along with
FOIN’s deep implications in the finance sector comes a responsibility to offer a safe financial
medium for coin owner. This infers the problem of tailoring the investment channel for each
individual coin owner, ensuring both minimum risk and maximum ROI, which are at the
opposite sides of the spectrum. While on a small scale this problem is easily solved by a
human specialist (financial advisor, investment banker, etc.), when applied at a global scale,
it becomes much more difficult. Thanks to the recent strides in artificial intelligence research
and technologies, AI represents the perfect solution for making the problem more
manageable.

The AI (artificial intelligence) integration will consist of multiple independent modules and
will be deployed in stages. The main modules of the AI integration will be: Fraud Prevention,
Risk Analysis and Portfolio Recommendation.

Fraud Prevention
This module will ensure that the coin owners’ funds will remain safe throughout the entire
investment process, by safeguarding the deposit and withdrawal processes as well as the
investment analysis. This will make sure that all investments carried through the FOIN
ecosystem will be protected against malicious actors.

Risk Analysis
The RA (Risk Analysis) is mainly responsible for risk management and compliance. AI has
already been proven impactful in real-world applications regarding how financial service
providers manage their risk. It will use publicly and privately available data from FSPs and
their investment vehicles to score the risk behavior for a specific investment option.

Portfolio Recommendation
This module will use data from various other AI modules, including the Fraud Prevention
module and the Risk Analysis module. Combined with various datapoint specific to each
investor (e.g. country of residence, gender, age, marital status, household size, education,
income, monthly expenses, debt, savings, other data from social media profiles, etc.), the
analysis will output the investor’s risk profile that will grade one’s aversion to risk. Ultimately,
the investor risk profile will be matched with an appropriate FSP based on the FSP’s risk
analysis (see previous module). This will enhance the security of the invested funds, in such a
way that all investors, regardless of their size, will benefit from maximum ROI while
exposing them to the minimum risk, as computed by the machine learning algorithms.

Finance ecosystem
Because the FOIN cryptocurrency will address individual investors, it will act as the de-facto
cryptocurrency connecting them to various financial services around the globe. To begin with,
the built-in mechanism of value increase made possible by the Proof of Stake consensus
algorithm will offer returns on their investment guaranteed by the blockchain technology.
The theoretical minimum is 1.168% per annum, the best-case scenario is around 11-12%,
but using staking data from other PoS cryptocurrencies, the real-world ROI is expected to
hover around 5-6% per annum.
Furthermore, coin holders will have the ability to opt-in to invest their coins into financial
service providers who have registered beforehand to become part of the FOIN ecosystem.
Coin owners will be screened by an A.I. risk-assessment module, also part of the FOIN
ecosystem, which will output a risk profile and recommend zero or more financial service
providers within the ecosystem. With the rising pool of participants in FOIN, this will create
an incentive for financial service providers to join the FOIN ecosystem. Because of the
liquidity of the FOIN network, it is expected to generate interest to both well-established
financial service providers, as well as to other startups in the blockchain - fintech region as
well.

Conclusion
In conclusion, FOIN is a cryptocurrency that aims to bridge the gap between financial service
providers and individual investors, at a global scale. It uses a state-of-the-art consensus
algorithm which has been industry-proven to be future proof, Proof of Stake. This enables
coin holders to participate in the staking process, receiving between 1.16-12% per annum
of their staking capital (current data points to a 5-6% range), guaranteed by the
blockchain. Furthermore, by developing an ecosystem revolving around fintech and FOIN,
the coin owners will have the ability to opt-in to investment opportunities, according to their
risk profiles. The development and investments in the FOIN ecosystem along with an
innovative marketing strategy will inevitably increase the coin value on the partner
exchanges, resulting in a wealth increase for all FOIN cryptocurrency owners.
