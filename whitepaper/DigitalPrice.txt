Introduction
With the circulation of cryptocurrency becoming common, there is a need
for additional information. The scope of this “white paper” is to provide
that information.
If you are under the impression that blockchain technology is perfect and
faultless, you are wrong. Blockchain protocols can be very slow, especially
when tethered by lengthy block times. For instance, the Bitcoin protocol
processes one block every 10 minutes which conveys, on average, 7
transactions per second. DigitalPrice does better.
On 4 October 2014 the cryptocurrency DigitalPrice was launched and
traded under the symbol of “DP”. Currently this coin can be traded on
several well-known exchange platforms. The amazing team behind the
development of DigitalPrice describes their currency as representing the
“third generation of cryptocurrency”, introduced by a group of
cryptocurrency enthusiasts with the intent to gain trust and provide value
in the crypto space.
As a 3rd generation currency, not only are transactions secured, private
and fast, you actually get paid for holding DigitalPrice coins.
DigitalPrice uses the POS (Proof of Stake) method of consensus, and is
based on the SHA-256 algorithm. It provides protection on the network
from malicious attacks and provides the staking mechanism that
generates rewards for investors.

Every 120 seconds a block reward of 25 coins is mined and divided into
two separate rewards, granting 66% of each block reward to masternode
operators and 33% of each block reward to coin stakers.
Masternodes - Investors need to lock 25,000 coins in order to earn
rewards and participate in the network’s governance system. For example,
on 26 February 2018, with the price at $0.13 per “DP” and 348
Masternodes on the network, the user earns on average $3.95 (29 “DP”
coins) daily for supporting the network.
Staking - The investor can hold DigitalPrice coins in a “Wallet” installed
on a computer. If the wallet is kept online and available to operate as
support to the network, the user will earn rewards. The reward system is
based on the weight of the total possessed coins to the network.

Security: With the unique 256-bit hashes used in this algorithm, it is
secure. It is a “one-way” cryptographic function and cannot be decrypted
back to the original text. The increased complexity provides enhanced

levels of security in comparison to several other algorithms that are not
properly secured.
Effectiveness: The SHA-256 algorithm is quick to compute, resistant to
pre-image and second pre-image attacks, and is collision resistant.
BLOCKTIME: The block time for Bitcoin is 10 minutes, DigitalPrice block
time averages 120 seconds, significantly less than Bitcoin. This allows for
increased capacity of the network.
BLOCK REWARD: Each new mined block generates 25 new coins in
reward, distributed to masternode operators and coin stakers who
support the network.
MAXIMUM COIN SUPPLY: The maximum supply of coins will be capped
at 100 million and will be reached in 2031.

Unique Features and Functions of DigitalPrice Coin
Key features that make DigitalPrice coin different include:
 Proof of Stake (PoS)
One of the unique features of DigitalPrice is that it is a fully Proof of Stake
(PoS) coin, which ensures increased protection and safety on the network
from malicious attacks. Proof of Stake is a distributed consensus method
that can be used in decentralized anti-spam systems. Rather than the
users performing a certain amount of unsecured computational work with
expensive equipment (found in PoW consensus method in many

DP | www.digitalprice.org

cryptocurrencies), PoS requires the user to show ownership (or “stake”) of
the coin.
More simply, PoS occurs when a miner sets coins aside (like a savings
account), and uses their computer and software client to validate network
exchanges. The cryptographic estimations in PoS systems are
substantially less complex for personal computers to solve: the user must
merely demonstrate possession of a predetermined minimum level of the
total accessible coin supply. For example, if a user possesses 5% of the
coin supply, they would have the capacity to mine 5% of all exchanges on
the DigitalPrice network.
The DigitalPrice network also accounts for the “weight” of the total system
and the weight of every one of the coins that are currently staking on the
whole DigitalPrice network. Weight is a measurement akin to age; the
longer a coin has been staked, the greater the corresponding weight. The
coin in a user’s wallet that is accessible for staking has a weight which
grows with the duration of time that the coin has been staked, which will
correspondingly increase the chances of minting new coins through the
PoS system.
 InstantSend
InstantSend is a service that allows for near-instant transactions, for a
nominal fee. Through this system, inputs can be locked to specific
transactions and verified by consensus of randomly-chosen masternodes
in the masternode network. Conflicting transactions and blocks are
rejected. If a consensus cannot be reached, validation of the transaction
occurs through standard block confirmation. InstantSend solves the
double-spending problem without the longer confirmation times of other
cryptocurrencies.

 Private Send
PrivateSend is a coin mixing service which is native in the DigitalPrice
network. In its current implementation the service uses the masternode
network to add privacy to transactions by combining identical inputs from
multiple users into a single transaction with several outputs. Due to the
identical inputs, transactions usually cannot be directly traced,
obfuscating the flow of funds. PrivateSend makes DigitalPrice truly
fungible by routing payments in fractions of the total transaction amount
through the masternode network, clouding the original sender.
 Masternodes
A masternode is a server associated with the DigitalPrice network which
ensures a specific level of execution and service associated with the
PrivateSend and InstantSend modes of exchange. Masternodes are
compensated 66% of each block reward for their service as part of the
PoS consensus method.
Who can run a masternode? Anybody! The desired outcome of the
masternode system is a level of decentralization that keeps the network
safe from attacks associated with majority control of a network. However,
in order to keep actors honest, the operation of a masternode requires
the ‘locking’ of 25,000 DigitalPrice coins as collateral which will be forfeit
if the masternode operator acts in a malicious way. If the coins are forfeit,
the masternode will no longer be accepted on the network and will
therefore be barred from receiving any further block rewards.
While the intent of the masternode network is to achieve decentralization,
there is no harm in users running multiple masternodes as they will be

able to relay network information quickly while holding duplicates of the
full DigitalPrice blockchain. The more masternodes, the better and more
secure the DigitalPrice network.

DigitalPrice masternodes validate all InstantSend transactions within 4
seconds by communicating each transaction across all nodes on the
network to prevent double spending. When PrivateSend transactions are
initiated, masternodes perform the work necessary to make the
transactions difficult to trace, through a mixing process.
Key features and notes:
 25000 DigitalPrice coins are required to operate a masternode
 Users may run multiple masternodes
 66% of each block reward granted to the masternode
 10,000 DigitalPrice coins divided daily between masternodes.
 Pure PoS coin

Roadmap and Project
The DigitalPrice team has been working hard to ensure continuous
security and development of the network. The following is a list of some
of the ongoing projects:
Scrypto.io
Scrypto is an online networking platform intended for both retail

cryptocurrency enthusiasts and cryptocurrency developers in order to
bring producers and consumers together to exchange content, desired
products and services, and general information about the crypto space.
Scrypto will encourage the exchange of tips by hosting web wallets for a
number of cryptocurrencies within each users profile, making it very easy
to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency in return for content.

Users may make groups, share information about coins and rewards, or
just build a network in the crypto space.
In addition to the social function of Scrypto, the platform will offer the
ability to rate and host masternodes. Rather than the user needing to
configure a masternode on their own hardware, maintaining up-time and
paying for electricity and equipment, the user may host a masternode
with Scrypto (paying a nominal monthly fee) and not have to worry about
their own hardware and maintenance.

Wallet development
A cryptocurrency wallet enables the user to store and exchange coins with
other users. It is encrypted software on the user’s personal computer that
stores the private keys to all coins in the user’s possession. The
DigitalPrice wallet does not require any compiling or coding ability to set
up as it is contained in one executable file. The user is recommended to
encrypt and back-up their wallet (further instructions can be found at
DigitalPrice.org) for additional security.
In the DigitalPrice GitHub, wallets are currently available for:

DigitalPrice.io : Cryptocurrency Exchange

DigitalPrice Coin can be found on a number of different exchanges
around the world including Cryptopia, and Coinexchange. In addition to
these exchanges, the DigitalPrice team has launched their own exchange
at DigitalPrice.io, seeking to provide a place with reasonable listing and
exchange fees for interesting new projects. All listing and trading fees will
be paid to the DigitalPrice team and at random intervals every few weeks,
the DigitalPrice team will use these collected fees to buy back DigitalPrice
coin, thus providing additional demand for the asset.
