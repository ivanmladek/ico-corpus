ROADMAP

Introduction

Information technologies
With every passing year information
technologies deeper penetrate into
our life. Online banking, calling of a
taxi, paying for mobile
communications, food delivery—all
this routine actions are transferred to
smartphones, and now people do not
remember that there was the time
when these actions were performed
in another way.

Problem of the HoReCa global
market

Fast developing ﬁeld of
economics
As a result, HoReCa (Hotels, Restaurants,
Catering), or the hospitality industry, is the
most proﬁtable and fast developing ﬁeld of
modern economics.

But the HoReCa global market is
highly intensive with regard to the
key market parameters: capital,
management, marketing and
personnel, which greatly increases
the level of competition and
impedes appearing of new market
players.

Needs and Trends of
the Market

Today, automation of interaction
with the customer is the most
popular and preferred solution
towards which the whole market
is moving. However, purchasing
of expensive terminals and
spending millions of rubles on
software development is just
about copying of the functionality
of competitors.

The market feels the need of a
shared cloud platform which
could provide an access to
orders without involving a waiter
or a cashier and would not
require installation of expensive
terminals and development of
software but use smartphones of
guests of catering facilities
instead.

Global
Needs

User Needs

Today’s users have already used to
make their choice via a uniform
platform: it is very handy when you
can ﬁnd all facilities matching the
required criteria at once, read
reviews and see ratings.
Instead of many applications for
diﬀerent restaurants each of us
would prefer to have one
application with a uniform interface
that would not require from us to
sort it out over again.
Customers became more wellminded, more often they are
interested in discounts and special
oﬀers. Their expectations have also
changed: requirements to dishes,
quality and speed of service grew
up.
Various bank cash backs, loyalty
savings cards and group buying are
very popular now.
4

What if … ?
And what if users paying by card were getting
remuneration in a form of points for visiting a
restaurant in addition to a common cash back?
And these points could be spent in any catering
facility instead of a certain one. What if it were
possible to learn about promotions in
restaurants within a uniform ecosystem? What if
users were getting push notiﬁcations on
promotions in their favorite restaurants without
downloading an application for each of them?

5

Delizia
Application

Delizia is intended to address all these challenges. It is a
mobile application based on geolocation, blockchain
system, smart contract technology and use of QR codes.
The Delizia mobile application for iOS and Android, and a
web application accessible from any browser are
developed. The service will allow to speed up and simplify
the process of servicing in the HoReCa industry which will
make life of guests, staﬀ and restaurant keepers much
easier. Now it will be possible to manage your order in a
catering facility by your own using your mobile phone.

Project Description
The proposed solution consists of the following functional units:
E-Menu
The menu includes images of
dishes grouped by categories.

Loyalty System
A loyalty system is planned to be
implemented within the
application.

Comments and Reviews
In the Delizia application guests of a
restaurant will be able to leave their
feedback for the compensation.

Marketing and Analytics
Using Delizia a restaurant will be
able to analyze its work easily.

Automation and Payment
of Orders
A person paying via mobile
application do not feel that the
money is real.

9

E-Menu
The menu includes images of
dishes grouped by categories.

There is a pass-through unit with
recommendations that can be
edited by an administrator and/or a
manager

A restaurant keeper will be able to
create a combination of dishes by
recommendations: ordering one
dish a guest will be oﬀered to order
an accompanying dish, for example,
a tea or coﬀee for a dessert. This
way the application extends a
client’s order, and so an average bill
of the restaurant will be increased.

A restaurant keeper will be able to
change contents of the menu,
immediately put items on stop or
add new dishes without wasting
time or money on printing.
10

Comments and
Reviews
In the Delizia
application guests of
a restaurant will be
able to leave their
feedback for the
compensation in a
form of Delizia coins
(local currency of
the application).
Such reviews—
either about a facility
or a dish—made
under no pressure
will not be ‘bad’ or
‘good’ but as true as
possible instead.

Loyalty
System
A loyalty system is
planned to be
implemented
within the
application. Users
will get local points
for all purchases in
the application as
well as for any
reviews they leave
and grades they
give.

11

Marketing
and Analytics
Using Delizia a restaurant will be able to
analyze its work easily.
Restaurant keepers will get an opportunity to
know their clients in person and understand
their tastes and preferences. Analytics of the
Delizia system makes it possible to make a
full portrait of a guest including a potential one.
A guest’s name, age, location, average bill in
restaurants, grades given to dishes and
facilities, speciﬁc preferences of dishes—with
Delizia everything is possible. Thus, the
restaurant gets a powerful marketing tool to
set up a mailing list for the most interested
audience and with a high conversion.
A restaurant will oﬀer the dishes which a guest
will order with the utmost probability. Having a
detailed statistics and a full information about
each guest, a restaurant keeper with the help
of an artiﬁcial intelligence system with a
computer- assisted instruction which analyses
a huge body of data on user preferences can
conﬁgure a list of recommended dishes so
that any person would like to try them.
12

Automation and
Payment of Orders

Thus, if a bill is paid
via a restaurant
application, an
amount of an
average bill
increases by 10% to
15%. In case of noncash payment
people do not notice
that they spend more
money, their
shopping capacity
seems unlimited to
them. And spending
a bit more than usual,
they won’t be low in
pocket.

A person paying via
mobile application do not
feel that the money is real.
That’s why many guests
choose a higher percent
of tips without a
moment's hesitation.
13

Coin Model and Loyalty System
It is planned to implement our own
cryptocurrency within the Delizia project.

FAST
FOOD

Guests can use the Delizia coins to pay orders in
the application. The Delizia coin is a primary tool to
keep users inside the ecosystem and increase their
loyalty. The Delizia coins can be exchanged for ﬁat
money, i.e. turned to cashback paid to a user for
performing of target actions within the application
Every user can pay the whole order or a part
of it with the Delizia coins in a restaurant.

When a user tries to pay with the Delizia coins, an
oﬀer to sell the user’s coins on the internal exchange
of the application will be generated. After that, the
Delizia coins will be converted to the ﬁat money
which will be credited to the account of the
restaurant keeper. Thus, the user will be able to pay
the orders with the Delizia coins received within the
system which inspires the user to make more orders
in the system and to earn the Delizia coins by taking
particular actions.
