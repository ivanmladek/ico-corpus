ADVANTAGES
Operation Strategies
The most enduring and fundamental competitiveness
of Kucoin lies in its powerful R&D team, which ensures
a world-class stability and service quality. In the
meantime, Kucoin's capable operation team shall
create a bright and prosperous future through
long-term and large-scale online/offline promotion &
operation. Majority of the exchange commision will be
rewarded to active users who exchange, invest and
promote Kucoin. Incentive policies can sustain active
users' enthusiasm and make the business even more
vigorous. On the other hand, the invitation bonus plan
between users will tremendously boost Kucoin's
subscribers and trades. Shortly after, we will
accomplish the target of becoming one of the top 10
worldwide hottest exchange platform.

Financing-level
Stability
Learned from the design solution of the state of the art
underlying financial system, Kucoin core exchanging
system adopted an advanced multi-layer and
multi-cluster architecture. The bank-level
disaster-proof deployment with two locations and three
centers which can handle multiple tasks in several
locations simultaneously has been applied, from the
mass flow inlet of domain name resolution to the
underlying core exchanging system and accounting
system, thus ensuring the system stability in situations
like hardware failure, even natural disasters.

High-performance
Engine
The trading system has adopted the
hardware-accelerated and highly-efficient memory
matching technology whose order-making peak value
is 2 million+/second, order-processing peak value 1
million+/second. These statistics are hundreds times,
even thousands of times of the normal industry
standard. Therefore it can guarantee no delay or lag
throughout the whole core order process when the
market booms.

System Security
SYSTEM LEVEL:
It is constructed strictly following the financing-level
standards. The industry standard transfer encryption
protocol is applied to data transfer layers so as to
ensure that all user data and sensitive data stored
through bank-level data encryption. The multi-factor
dynamic authentication mechanism has been
introduced to sensitive operations like transaction or
withdrawal so as to provide maximum security for our
users.
OPERATION LEVEL:
Kucoin has established special internal risk control and
operation process departments which have designated
strict production data operation and usage standards. It
requires multi-level review and approval to check and
use all online data and the core data will undergo
desensitization so as to ensure the maximum security
for user data.

ADVANTAGES

Financial
Safety
Wallets in the platform has adopted multiple security
levels of storage solution in line with their storage scale.
We have stored the micro-withdrawal wallets in the
private network architecture built on Amazon Web
Services Cloud which has multi-layer firewall on the
basis of security isolation. The wallet document itself
has adopted industry-level multi-layer encryption
storage method whose cipher code will be preserved by
a special person everytime and this very code will be
altered on a regular basis. Any operation to the wallet
document requires strict review and approval through
internal control procedure and can only be
accomplished by two people deciphering
simultaneously with the key. Under normal
circumstances, macro-wallets will be stored in the
bank custody.

Efficient
Customer Service
Dedicated to resolve customers' needs without any
delay, Kucoin offers 7*24 customer services through
multi-channels, including webpage, hotline and e-mail,
etc. Kucoin's pre-pay and withdrawl safety will be
inspected by AI algorithm. Once the request passed the
inspection, automation system will executes entry and
remit instantly, ensuring both convinience and safety.

release a unique feature which can help cryptocurrency
managers or amateurs to self-register new
cryptocurrency pairs and start trading automatically.

Registration invite links and QR code will be distributed
to all the Kucoin users. Users will be able to enjoy the
direct and indirect promotion bonus by inviting new

TOKEN ISSUANCE
DETAILS
Known as Kucoin Shares or KCS for short, the
cryptocurrency issued by Kucoin Cryptocurrency
Exchange Platform maintains a total issuance volume
of 200 million. After buy-back disposal, it will be a
constant - 100 million. As a decentralized
cryptocurrency issued on the basis of Ethereum, also a

KCS Features
ACQUIRE KUCOIN BONUS
To improve user involvement and exchage vitality, Kucoin is going to award incentive bonus, which equals to 50% of the
total trading fees charged by the platform, to users who hold KCS in their accounts. Please note that this award proportion
could be adjusted based on the actual situation in the future. The initial amount of KCS is 200 million among which 100
million owned by the team and angel investors would not be taken into account when calculating the bonus. In addition, we
guarantee that at most 100 million KCS be calculated in the bonus plan during official buy-back and destruction. To obtain
the daily bonus, users would need to deposit their KCS into Kucoin Platform. Then the platform will conduct accounting
and award bonus based on to the KCS holdings in user's account at 0:00 (UTC+8) that day and all the trading fees charged
to the platform on the previous day.Then the bonus gained by users will directly put to their Kucoin accounts in the

volume is 30,000 BTC; based on the 0.1% rate from each side, the platform shall charge 30 BTC and 476 ETH as trading
fees. The bonus for every 10,000 holdings would be 10,000 by 100,000,000 (0.01%). So that the daily bonus from this very
cryptocurrency pair is 0.003 BTC and 0.0476 ETH (1 BTC and 17 ETH annually). Please note that this is ONLY the ETH-BTC
exchange pair BONUS. Other than ETH-BTC, there are still various cryptocurrency pairs on the platform, which creates the
trading fees in the corresponding currency and bonus based on the description above.
TRADING FEE DISCOUNT
When placing orders to trade, holding a certain amount of KCS in Kucoin account can lower the trading fee. Details will be
published through announcements.
