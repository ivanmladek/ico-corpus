1. VANTA
1.1 What is VANTA?
VANTA is an intelligent network for transmission and processing of real-time data which enables
individuals and companies to develop applications without additional infrastructure at lost cost. As a
result, creative services will be provided and integrated within the VANTA ecosystem, and VANTA
blockchain will be a practical blockchain that will greatly contribute to improving the daily lives of
individuals and operations of enterprise businesses.
Real-time networking technology covers a wide range of areas. The technology can be used for
messaging / file transfer / voice & video call development, large-scale, real-time video streaming, and
transmitting & processing various real-time data collected from IoT sensors. Besides addressing
these problems through the VANTA blockchain, VANTA will provide and expand enterprise-level
telecommunications network solutions to businesses and enterprise customers.
Using blockchain and cryptoeconomics designed for real-time networking, VANTA creates a system in
which nodes participating in the network contribute to real-time data transmission and processing
without relying on traditional centralized systems and networks. This system results in a low cost,
functional blockchain-based network. Anyone, regardless of existing platforms, can participate and
use the network by using an API, an SDK, or modules to integrate with existing applications or
platforms in use. VANTA, therefore, can easily expand the ecosystem through modules that integrate
applications and platforms that require real-time networking.

1.2 Motivation
The need for this network arises from the fundamental reason that the amount of real-time data
exchanged between people and devices is increasing exponentially. In addition to the number of
devices connected to the Internet, the amount of data that individuals produce and consume in
real-time is exploding. For instance, high-definition broadcast streaming and low latency data
processing for VR & AR require efficient and low-cost solution for real-time transmission.
Furthermore, as more IoT sensors become utilized in our daily lives, the industry sectors such as
traffic information control, factory operation, medical devices, etc. require a real-time networking
platform that may handle hundreds of thousands of data points per second without the single point of
failure while reducing cost and maintaining efficiency.

1.3 Market
1.3.1 Video streaming
According to global market researcher Research and Markets, the video streaming market in 2016
was $30.29 billion USD in revenue and will double by 2021 to $70.05 billion USD. Cisco also predicts
online video to account for 82% of internet traffic by 2022. In particular, the “real-time” video

statements at any time without giving notice and shall not be responsible in any way for any use of or reliance on such information

streaming market provided by Facebook Live, Twitter’s sports broadcasting services and video
broadcasting services such as YouTube and Hulu, accounted for only 3% of internet video traffic in
2017, but is expected to grow more than four-times to 13% in 2022. As a result, consumers’ demand
for larger bandwidth and higher quality video will increase dramatically, and the problems regarding
inefficient data transfers and expensive central server usage fees will heighten significantly.
1.3.2 IoT data streaming and processing
According to Statista, a market research firm, the size of the IoT industry will grow by 24.4% annually,
to $1.7 trillion USD in 2019. Gartner expects global IoT devices to grow to 20 billion by 2020, and BMI
Research estimates that by 2050 at least 40 billion “things” will connect to the Internet. As such, all
things are coming into the hyper-connected society that connects to the Internet; the emergence of a
hyper-connected society will dramatically increase the size of the IoT market.
That is, more data will be generated in real-time by various IoT devices and individuals, and the
number of corporations that want to receive such data in real-time will also increase significantly. At
some point in time, storing and processing the data produced by IoT devices on a centralized server
and delivering it to the users who need it will meet throughput and cost constraints. This will make the
IoT sensor or its connected IoT hub more directly connected to the device that requests the data and
transmits data in real-time. This means that there will be more devices connected directly to the IoT
sensor or IoT hub to receive data in real-time. VANTA’s real-time networking is an opportunity for
intelligent networks to be integrated into IoT devices and services. VANTA will allow us to reliably and
efficiently deliver the data produced by resource-limited IoT devices to more devices.

1.4 Problem and solution
VANTA will aim to solve the following problems through our decentralized intelligent network based
on blockchain technology.
1.4.1 Increasing Network Throughput and Cost
Current networks and infrastructures that support various real-time networking are reaching
throughput limits. This means that companies will not be able to provide reliable services, since
network and server costs will increase along with the increasing amount of data transmitted. VANTA
will solve the throughput and cost issues by making the common computers and mobile devices
around the world, whose performance rapidly increases each year, contribute to real-time networking.
1.4.2 Real-Time Networking Development Costs and Problems with Centralized Services
Many companies are limited (or even fail) to developing real-time networking services because of the
cost, time, and lack of skills required to develop and operate such services. As a result, an increasing
number of companies are utilizing centralized API services that help develop real-time networking
functions. Yet, there are some problems with centralized APIs. Once a centralized API is used, the fee
increases significantly as the usage increases. Moreover, if an API provider suddenly changes
policies, stops the API service without notice, or experiences temporary downtime, the company
developing the services based on the provided API will be adversely affected. Also, because the data
is stored on a centralized server, it cannot be free from hacking or privacy issues. These problems can
be solved by building a decentralized network for real-time networking that is not owned or controlled
by anyone, and this can be used to provide various real-time networking APIs for companies.

1.4.3 Privacy concerns resulting from transferring and storing personal data
In the future, more diverse personal data will flow within the network to be transferred between
devices and will be stored in various centralized servers in order to provide a smooth service
experience. However, if users cannot know whether if the data is properly encrypted, transmitted,
stored, and deleted from the server, users may become anxious due to various hacks, as well as
government & corporate surveillance. At the same time, personal data leakage will cause great
damage. With a blockchain, however, it is possible to transparently confirm the process of
transmitting / storing / deleting data. Decentralized nodes, in addition, transmit and store real-time
data, which prevent hacking and excessive/malicious use of personal data

1.4.4 Access to data generated by devices and the data usage fees
In the future, there will be an increase in the need to send and receive data in real-time between
people and devices and between devices. In such a situation, it is necessary to have a system that
can operate transparently and accurately according to the rules determined between the devices
without human intervention for acquiring the data access permission automatically, configuring the
temporary network for receiving the data, and paying the price for the data use. Therefore, VANTA
intends to create an efficient system that can quickly and safely send and receive data in real-time by
creating a competitive system that instantly configures networks according to each situation.

1.4.5 Trust in the communication between parties and trust in the data transferred from various
devices
Currently, various products, stores, and media are evaluated and shared by people. People evaluate
the purchase, use, and visitation of products, stores, and media, but there is no evaluation of people or
the devices people are communicating with. In the future, there will be more and more real-time
communication across people and devices, and credible evaluations will be needed. Whether it is an
individual engaged in daily life or a company conducting its business, trust will be achieved in the
future.

2. VANTA Positioning & Competition
2.1 Positioning
Unlike the existing blockchains, VANTA is a blockchain focused on real-time communication that both
traditional and decentralized applications may utilize the VANTA API to facilitate development in the
areas of messaging, call, data / media streaming, etc.
Ethereum or EOS can be classified as platform blockchains while Storj or Golem can be classified as
specific-purpose blockchains. Among these blockchains, VANTA is the intelligent network platform
that can be classified as both platform blockchain and specific-purpose blockchain. VANTA can be
positioned vertically as follows.

2.2 Platform & Module
VANTA will build its own ecosystem as a platform blockchain, bringing a variety of real-time
networking applications and services. However, VANTA will provide a core module in the form of an
SDK and/or API to provide platform-independent access to the VANTA network. Therefore, all
platforms and applications that want real-time networking capability can leverage these services,
leading to the rapid expansion of the VANTA ecosystem.

2.3 Benefits of using VANTA
2.3.1 VANTA-based service developers
With VANTA, it is possible to develop and operate scalable, stable, and highly secure real-time
networking services at low cost. Developers can quickly and inexpensively develop real-time
networking capabilities based on VANTA without building up separate server or developing real-time
networking from scratch. According to the staking-based token economy, developers may utilize

VANTA’s network resources by staking VNT tokens. It is available at no cost, except for a small fee
when VNT tokens are unstaked. If a developer does not have enough VNT tokens to secure the
resources it needs for its service, it has the option to create a policy requiring end users to stake VNT
tokens for all or a portion of its own resource usage. In other words, developers and users can share
staked VNT tokens to run a service. This creates a significant reduction in the development and
operational costs of real-time, networking-related services.
Compared to centralized services, services based on the decentralized VANTA network will be highly
secure and stable. In addition, it is easy to integrate and combine different services because they
communicate over a common standard. Even without a separate payment system, VANTA’s VNT
token-based payment model can be easily designed and applied to real-time networking services.
By providing those advantages for developers, VANTA can provide a development environment that
helps developers build services that benefit the end user. The network can also allow more flexibility
for service development to enable creative and innovative applications that are not bound to a typical
business model design.

Figure 3. Application business model
2.3.2 VANTA-based service users
End users using VANTA-based services benefit from lower service costs and privacy. When a service
developer stakes sufficient VNT tokens for the service’s network resources, end users usually do not
have to stake VNT tokens for their own resource usage. However, if the service is set up for end users
to stake VNT tokens to run the service as explained in the previous sections, each user needs to stake
VNT tokens for his/her own resource usage.
Users can also easily create a VANTA account without a separate subscription procedure or
authentication. This is possible because network participants communicate through an anonymous

hash value that cannot be used to track their identity. Also, users can create a new account at any
time, further assuring that an individual cannot be identified. Since there is no central control authority
and all data is encrypted and transmitted between peers, it is impossible to provide communication
records, data / media, etc. at the request of a central government or authorities. This means that it is
possible to use secure, decentralized communication services without privacy problems.

2.3.3 Benefits for organizations from adopting VANTA as a telecommunication network
Because VANTA is specialized in real-time networking and has various communication functions,
VANTA blockchain can be used by organizations such as governments, businesses, and schools that
want to build their own telecommunication network. The VANTA blockchain telecommunication
network can be built quickly and cost-effectively without the need for a separate server or
infrastructure.
VANTA will also provide direct consulting and customized development for cases in which the
government, company, or school, etc. has technical difficulties using VANTA as a telecommunication
network. Therefore, it is possible for each organization to build an optimized blockchain-based
network.

2.4 VANTA Blockchain Competitiveness
Existing blockchains don’t offer the features necessary in order to develop services with various
real-time networking functions such as those offered by Slack, Facebook, and Twitch. These services
require various functions such as text messaging, voice / video call, video streaming, and data
processing. Current distributed ledger technologies cannot communicate in real-time. To develop and
operate such services, real-time networking technology and an infrastructure for transmitting and
processing data is essential. The VANTA blockchain is a specialized blockchain for developing and
operating these real-time, networking-related services that can be used every day.

2.5 VANTA Team Competitiveness
VANTA is comprised of three teams: (1) researchers who have studied communication networks and
have experience in commercializing technology; (2) a university lab that has been conducting
research on communication blockchains for the past several years; (3) and a team that has
accumulated experience in global IT companies. Combined, they form the VANTA team, dedicated to
research and development of a blockchain-based network specialized for real-time networking. This
highly competitive team will conduct in-depth research and commercialize VANTA technology to the
real economy. The team utilizes the knowledge and results gained from previous research and
development of communication networks and brings it to VANTA. This gives VANTA’s team a great
advantage over other project teams.

3. VANTA Intelligent Network
3.1 Definition of Real-Time Networking
Real-time networking, or real-time communication, is a methodology that lets a device communicate
in real-time without transmission delays. In other words, it is a technology that makes it easy for
people to quickly find, access, and utilize the necessary information. Real-time networking allows us
to share a variety of information, and people in various locations can communicate as if they were
facing each other. Online education, audio / video conferencing, file sharing, gaming, collaboration,
social networking and machine-to-machine technology are implemented with real-time networking
technology. Our team believes that real-time networking technology is essential for everyday life.
VANTA designed the intelligent network to decentralize real-time networking to allow more people to
benefit from the technology.

3.2 Definition of Intelligent Network

Figure 4. The intelligent network of VANTA - The ARKAS protocol
VANTA's intelligent network is a decentralized network that performs real-time data transmission,
processing, and storage functions by selecting and evaluating peers. It is an evolving network that
strengthens the scalability, reliability, efficiency, and privacy of real-time networking by creating a
competitive system based on resources such as computing power, network bandwidth, memory, and
reliability.

3.3 How the Intelligent Network Works
VANTA constitutes an intelligent network by allowing participating nodes to perform data
transmission and processing operations accurately and reliably in a competitive manner. The VANTA
ARKAS protocol and the consensus algorithm are the keys to this structure. Nodes constituting the

intelligent network become intelligent node. In addition, installing the VANTA core client on your own
computer or mobile device or installing applications developed on the VANTA API will allow you to
participate as an intelligent node. Participants in the network compete with each other in order to
receive data transmission / storage / processing tasks requested by the network in real-time,
performing the main tasks as described in Figure 5.

Figure 5. How the intelligent network works
3.3.1 Peer Finding & Connecting
A node finds a specific node in the network and transmits encrypted handshake information so that
they can connect to each other in P2P fashion.
3.3.2 Data Relaying
A relaying node receives data from the sender and transmits the data to the receiver accurately and in
a stable manner. Depending on the situation, several nodes communicate and collaborate with each
other for data relaying. Data relaying plays a critical role for providing group chat, media streaming,
video conferencing, and online multi-user games. Its main functions are data multicasting and media
streaming.

3.3.3 Data Caching (temporary storage)
To increase efficiency of real-time transmission, a node temporarily stores data for a certain period of
time. When the client requests the data, the node effectively delivers it. The node also provides data
buffering and temporary storage of the streaming data.
3.3.4 Data Processing
A node processes media by converting the media stream to media format of various resolutions
through media mixing or available computing resources of each node. This enables streaming
services to be provided in the most suitable format to various smartphone and desktop devices.
3.3.5 Data Verification
A node verifies whether the nodes in the network properly perform the given task. There are various
verification tasks, such as verifying the requested job in the network, node selection by a VRF
(Verifiable Random Function), the work performed by the node, and various transactions and blocks.

3.4 Verifiable Random Function
A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is a pseudo-random function that provides a proof that can be
used to publicly verify the accuracy of its output. It is widely used within VANTA’s real-time
networking job competition model and blockchain consensus algorithm. A VRF is composed of three
polynomial-time functions G, F, and V, and the details are as follows:
●

G is a generator, probabilistic, and accepts one unary string (security parameter k) as an input
value. It returns two binary strings each used as public key PK and secret key SK.

●

F = (F1, F2) is the evaluator, and is deterministic. It accepts input x for SK and VRF as a binary
string, and returns the VRF result value F1 (SK, x) for x and its corresponding proof, F2 (SK, x).

●

V is a verifier and probabilistic like the generator. It accepts four binary strings, PK, x, v, and
proof as inputs, and returns YES or NO.

Let a : N −> N ⋃ {*} and b, s : N −> N ⋃ {*} be any three functions such that a(k), b(k), s(k) are all
computable in time poly(k), and a(k) and b(k) are both limited as a polynomial with respect to k
(except when a takes value *). (G, F, V) is defined as a verifiable pseudorandom function (VRF) with
input length a(k), output length b(k), and security s(k) if it meets the following properties:
1. The two conditions below have a probability of 1 − 2−Ω(k) for (P K, S K) ←R G(1k )

P ROB[(V (P K, x, v, proof ) = Y ES] > 1 − 2−Ω(k)
2. Unique Probability: ​∀ ​PK, x, v1, v2, proof1 and proof2 when v 1 =/ v 2 , and i is 1 or 2

T is successful under the condition that x ∈ {0, 1}a(k) , guess = r and x are not queried
by T.

3.5 Roles of Network Participants within the Intelligent Network
Because the intelligent network is based on P2P communication, nodes cannot trust each other by
default and can lead to connection stability issues. Therefore, to ensure fault-tolerant job processing,
each node with a specified role is selected based on a predefined set of rules. Data recorded on the
blockchain is used to select and verify processing nodes.
The intelligent network uses a new consensus algorithm that selects block producers based on the
number of real-time networking jobs a node has processed. We call the process of selecting job
processing nodes and verifying workloads as "Proof of Networking", which is a significant part of the
network since it is directly related to block generation. Therefore, VANTA needs to improve the
distribution and validation of jobs, as well as increase the accuracy of performance measurements
and records. The intelligent network uses Verifiable Random Functions to enforce randomness during
node selection, and inter-network trust with benchmarks and votes across different nodes. The
following is a list of roles assigned to each participant while processing jobs.
3.5.1 Requester
A device/client that requests a job related to real-time data transmission / processing / storage.
3.5.2 Target
The target device of the requester’s job. The device receives the data from the requester or sends the
data to the requester.
3.5.3 Job Tracker Node
The first node to receive a job request from a requester node becomes the job tracker. The job tracker
is valid only for the job request. Job trackers are responsible for verifying and broadcasting job
requests, managing nodes selected to process jobs, connecting existing workers and requesters, and
more. Job trackers also submit job transactions.
3.5.4 Worker Node
Worker nodes are nodes that actually execute the submitted real-time networking tasks. Because
primary workers may be selected based on the size of a VRF hash value (having the job request hash
submitted to the job tracker as a seed) being larger than its competitors, verifiable randomness is
also incorporated within the process of selecting worker nodes. Depending on the job, the worker is

connected to the sender or another worker, which is the actual data source or relayer. The sender
continuously transmits data to the requested receiver or another worker node after processing the
data according to the request. Worker nodes are divided into two groups, and more than one node can
be selected according to a job.
Primary Worker Node
This is the node that executes the actual task as soon as the processing of the job starts.
Secondary Worker Node
This is the node that waits until the end of the job processing. When the primary worker node
experiences a performance problem during processing or a network problem occurs, it takes over
the task immediately.
3.5.5 Verifier Node
Verifier nodes verify if the worker node has been correctly selected and the worker node has properly
performed the job. Subsequently, the node issues proof of the worker node's workload to the worker
node. Using the job request hash as the seed, the VRF function randomly selects different verifiers
based on their jobs.

3.6 Competition of Intelligent Nodes
When a job is submitted to the intelligent network and begins to propagate throughout the network, all
nodes that are registered for processing the job compete for rewards by processing the job and
accumulating proof of workload.

Every job contains the minimum requirement for each criterion set by the developer who developed
the service that generated the job. Jobs range from simple text messaging to group video calls, large
group video streaming, and data processing. The same jobs may require different computing power,
network bandwidth, and processing stability for each service.
3.6.2 Job Requests by Clients
1. A client for service A generates a job request for a real-time networking job and submits it to
1 or more nodes within the VANTA network. The client submitting the job becomes a job
requester.
2. A list of job trackers may be managed separately, and in the case of a connection timeout to a
node, it is removed from the job tracker candidate list. Another candidate is received and the
request is submitted again.
3.6.3 Selecting Job trackers
1. The first node that was assigned to a job request will begin its role as the job tracker. The job
tracker reviews job request content and signs it before disseminating it to the network.
2. Depending on certain situations and rules, a job tracker must return another job tracker’s list
to the job requester instead of performing the role of job tracker themselves.
3. If a requester’s target is experiencing data relay because of another worker, the worker list
must be returned to the requester.
4. After a job is disseminated, worker request is received by worker node candidates, and verifier
request is received by verifier node candidates. A maximum of i, j numbers of worker request
and verifier request will be accepted per 1 job. The rest will not be accepted.
5. A job tracker verifies and chooses candidates, then notifies the job requester and
disseminates the job transaction to the consensus network to add the job’s contents in the
blockchain.
6. Lastly, the job tracker combines account information and IP addresses of the selected
workers, verifiers, requester, and target and transmits the data to all nodes. The job tracker’s
role ends here, and the rest of the job processing is performed by the requester, target,
worker, and verifier, all communicating with each other.
3.6.4 Selecting Worker Nodes
1. A node receives several job requests at the same time and accumulates jobs in its own
queue. Each node judges which job to select based on the job price, which is the processing
price of the job specified in the request.
2. A node that participates and wants to compete as a worker node compares the job
processing requirements with its current node metrics such as its own computing power and
network bandwidth.
3. If the job processing requirements are met, the node will have the basic requirements to
process the job. It executes a VRF with the job ID as a seed to generate hash and proof, and
sends a signed worker request with the job request to the job tracker.
4. The job tracker should receive at least n worker requests.
5. The worker nodes for N number of worker requests are sorted based on the VRF hash value
of the candidates, and then the primary worker node and the secondary worker node are
sequentially selected from the node having the highest VRF hash value. For cases where the
primary/secondary workers are all malfunctioning, top n number of workers’ lists are used as
well.

3.6.5 Selecting Verifier Nodes
1. A node that wants to join as a verifier node executes a VRF, judges whether it can join, and
sends a signed verifier request with a job request, hash, and proof to the job tracker.
2. The job tracker should receive at least m verifier requests and ignore verifier requests
received after m.
3. The top 5 verifiers are chosen for a job based on the VRF hash values of m number of nodes
who sent verifier requests.
Each job is measured by the price of the job, which determined by a Net, a work unit of VANTA. The
price of a Net is specified by the service developer when staking the VNT to allocate resources for the
service. Each node checks the price of the job, and can decide if it wants to compete with other nodes
to handle this job. If the Net price is much lower than the current price but there are high
requirements, the nodes may decide not to participate in the competition. This will be the selection
criteria when jobs that have higher Net prices are requested at the same time. Therefore, when
measuring the value of a job, the Net market price can be formed independently of the VNT price.

3.7 Proof of Intelligent Nodes’ workload
Because the intelligent network can be joined by anyone, there can be nodes that maliciously behave
in order to maximize their own interests. A node in the intelligent network not only receives adequate
compensation depending on how many jobs the node processes, but also increases the probability of

becoming a block proposer in a specific consensus round. For this reason each node needs to
accurately performs its task, and prove it. This is very important because the quality of real-time
networking in the network depends on how thoroughly the operation and verification are executed.
Some of the jobs worker nodes do are defined as action. Worker nodes are rewarded based on the
workload, which is evaluated based on the amount of data transmitted as well as the duration of peer
connection maintained in order to achieve real-time data transmission.
When the first job is created, the nonce value for that job is incremented by 1 every minute starting
with 0. The verifier nodes prove that the primary worker node is performing the work on the
corresponding nonce value. The verifier monitors the state of the data transmission by
communicating with the sender, receiver, and worker every 10 seconds, and the workload verification
is written, signed, and sent to the worker in 1 minute intervals.

Figure 7. Workload verification
1. The sender signs the verification data, including the nonce value and the amount of data
transmitted per 1 minute, as proof indicating that the transmission data for the corresponding
nonce is being transmitted to the primary worker node. The sender also transmits it to the
verifier node.
2. The verifier node signs again, signifying that it has begun workload verification, and sends it
to the primary worker node. The primary worker node sends the verification data with its
signature to the data receivers.
3. If the primary worker node correctly transmits the sender’s data, the receiver adds its
signature to the verification data, including the amount of data received per 1 minute, and
sends it back to the verifier node.
4. Each verifier node adds its final confirmation signature to the final collected proof of work
data and sends it to the primary worker node.

5. If the proof of work verified by the verifier nodes is secured for ⅔ or more, the primary worker
node generates a workload verification transaction including the proof of work in the
Confirmed Payload.
The workload verification transaction includes the following data:
T ype : Value used to classify transaction types (job transaction, workload verification transaction)
App id : Unique Id value of the application for requested job
J ob id : Unique Id value of committed job
Data id : Unique Id value of source data
Action : Action that must be completed by a worker node
N once : A unique value at job tx id, starting at the first 0 and incrementing by 1
W orkload : Workload of the job (Net)
N et P rice : The specified Net price requested by the service developer when staking (VNT)
T imestamp : Time to request proof of work; the value to prevent more than two nonce values from
being present within one minute
P rimary W orker N ode : Hash value of primary worker node
S econdary W orker N ode : Hash value of secondary worker node
V erif ier N ode List : List of verifier nodes
C onf irmed P ayload :
Job request signed by a requester
A bundle of workload verification identified by the verifier node, each of which is the data that
the verifier last signed. At least ⅔ verifier nodes for the given nonce must receive the final
verified data to be compensated.
Each workload verification includes a job id, a nonce, and a signature signed by a sender, a
primary worker node, and a receiver in sequence with a private key.
There is the possibility that the primary worker node maliciously colludes with the sender and the
receiver to only generate the confirmed payload for a long time without actually transmitting the data
for the reward. To prevent this situation, the primary worker node is replaced with a standby
secondary worker node every 1 hour.
If the proof of work result of the verifier node is not included in the Confirmed Payload, 50% of the ⅓
verifier not included is replaced with a new verifier node via VRF. This means that the verifier nodes
must compete with each other and deliver the proof of work results to the primary worker node as
soon as possible.

3.8 Fault Detection and Recovery
While processing a job, participating nodes can check the status of each other through a persistent
P2P connection. Each node detects status change events when a particular node exits a network or a
faulty communication channel caused by an unstable network. When the status event reports a
disconnected or failed state, the status of that node is broadcast to the verifier. Each verifiers checks
the status of the faulty node and runs a voting process within its verifier group. When more than 50%
of verifiers determine that the node was faulty, the node is replaced with a new node that can process
its given workload.

3.8.1 Job tracker node
Because a job tracker can be faulty or can leave the network, the job requester submits the job to
more than 2 nodes. The first job tracker to compile the list of nodes required to process the requested
job processes the submitted job.
3.8.2 Worker node
When the primary worker node is determined to be faulty, the secondary worker establishes a data
exchange channel between the sender and receiver and prepares itself to replace the primary worker.
When the secondary worker is faulty while the primary node is operating correctly, a new secondary
worker is selected from the list of worker candidates.
3.8.3 Verifier node
All verifiers establish a persistent communication channel to determine a faulty verifier, and the
verifiers run a vote to decide its final status. When the node is determined to be faulty, a candidate
verifier immediately joins the verification process. Because there should be at least 5 verifiers within
the processing group to process a job, verifiers should keep a minimum number of verifiers to receive
the processing reward.

3.9 Performance Evaluation and Reputation System
All nodes in the network are evaluated against each other for computing power (CPU), network
bandwidth, connection stability, and network contribution.
3.9.1 Performance Evaluation
When a node participates in the network, it will be requested to perform a job, such as monitoring the
computing power and network bandwidth. Randomly requested for evaluation. CPU-intensive logic is
used to evaluate computing power, and file transmission results is used to evaluate network
bandwidth. Monitoring results and time stamps are signed off by each node and sent to the requested
nodes. Nodes that receive the data turn them into transactions and submit them to the network. The
state of each evaluated node is then updated to include their newly evaluated values. The state of
each node will represent the average of its performance results.
3.9.2 Classification of performance evaluation results
The performance evaluation result is divided into 10 different levels, based on the distribution of
performance results for all nodes. Because the overall performance levels of participating devices can
change over time, the performance medium used to calculate a node's level is recalculated every
86400 blocks. Developers and end users can refer to the performance distribution map of
participating devices to stake tokens for resource allocation.
3.9.3 Reputation System
Connection stability refers to the ratio of a node not being faulty and actively participating in
processing jobs, which includes not leaving the network or not having unstable network connections.
This is recorded through a state transition transaction through verifier votes. Network contribution
refers to the number of jobs processed by that node and recorded on the net scale with a workload
verification transaction.

3.10 Security
VANTA Network is a network of intelligent peers connected by P2P. All peers are directly or indirectly
connected to the network, which means that data transmitted over the network may be vulnerable. In
order to build a more robust and reliable network from a security perspective, a handshake message
for P2P connection is encrypted with the public key of the recipient. And Datagram Transport Layer
Security (DTLS) is used to enhance the security of P2P data transmission. In addition, as a protocol
for data / media transmission, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and Secure Real-time
Transport Protocol (SRTP) for a media stream are used as default. The protocol uses the Privacy
Enhanced RTP Conferencing (PERC) method, which is a double SRTP encryption that enables E2E
media data encryption when providing the video conferencing function.
3.10.1 Data Transfer
SCTP is used for messages and data transmission. In the case of 1: 1 data transmission, the original
data is encrypted with the public key of the receiver so that the intermediate transmitter cannot
decrypt the data. For 1: N data transmission, the group creator that creates the first group generates a
private key and a public key as group key. The two generated keys are encrypted with the public key of
the participants in the group. E​ach participant encrypts the data using the group public key to transmit
data and decrypts the received data with its own group private key​.
When a new participant is added, the existing participant encrypts the group key with the public key of
the new participant and transfers it. If the existing participant leaves the group, a new group key is
generated again and transferred using the same method. Lastly, the message is encrypted with a new
group key and transferred.
3.10.2 Media Transfer
In general, a video conference service provided by a centralized service provider transmits a video of a
user to a media server, and the media server mixes multiple videos into one and transmits it to other
participants. In this process, the media server is able to acquire media data of users in a reproducible
form, which means that there is a possibility of privacy problems at any time.
Media servers mainly use the MCU (multipoint control unit) and SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)
methods. The MCU method utilizes Media Mixing processing to make each participant’s media
stream into one media stream, while the SFU method transmits the media stream of each participant
to the other participants as a relay. In both methods, the original media data can be exposed during
the process of mixing and transmitting the media data.
The security level of end-to-end media encryption, which makes it essentially impossible to expose
media data, is required due to the nature of the VANTA Network that any peer can perform a media
mixing function as an intermediary. To achieve this security level, VANTA Network uses the PERC
scheme as the concept of SFU-based double encryption SRTP.
The SRTP packet transfer in the conventional SFU method decrypts the encrypted RTP payload in the
SRTP packet transmitted from the sender and acquires the data. After acquiring the data, the SSRC
(synchronization source) data included in the payload descriptor is modified and transmitted to add
the media source of another participant. In this process, the media data contained in the RTP payload

is exposed. SRTP ensures that P2P (sender and relay, relay and receiver) security is guaranteed from
third parties, but SFU, an intermediary that does not participate in the video conference, is not secure.
This method is called Hop By Hop Encryption, and the VANTA network uses the PERC scheme to
provide end-to-end encryption that guarantees all security between participants.

Figure 8. Hop by hop encryption

The PERC scheme encrypts the media metadata once more when generating the SRTP packet so that
the SFU cannot acquire the original media metadata. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128)
algorithm is used for E2E encryption. To encrypt the media metadata again, the participant needs E2E
encryption and decryption keys for his / her one-time use for the conference. They exchange the keys
of each other through the key distributor in order to send their own decryption key to other
participants. All participants encrypt their E2E decryption key with the public key of the other
participant’s wallet. Once the E2E decryption key exchange is complete, each participant will have his
/ her E2E key pair and all other participants’ E2E decryption Keys. The decryption key of the other
participant is used to decrypt the media metadata encrypted with the participant’s encryption key.
When the sender creates the SRTP packet, only the media metadata part of the RTP payload is
encrypted with his E2E encryption Key, and then encrypted by SRTP once again with HBH Encryption
and transmitted to SFU. SFU executes HBH decryption of the delivered SRTP packet using RTP header
and RTP payload and modifies the SSRC in the payload descriptor to add another participant’s media
source. Again, the SRTP Packet is sent to each receiver after SRTP executes HBH Encryption on the
data. The recipients execute HBH Decryption on the received SRTP packet and can acquire and
reproduce the original media metadata by decrypting the final media metadata with the E2E
decryption Key shared by the sender.

In this process, the media metadata part is encrypted with the E2E key, and no one, including SFU,
except the allowed conference participants can restore the original media metadata.

4. VANTA Blockchain & Consensus Algorithm

Figure 10. PoN-VRBFT consensus algorithm

4.1 The Need for a New Consensus Algorithm
Because VANTA is a blockchain designed for processing real-time networking tasks, a new
consensus algorithm is needed for effectively processing it. Previous consensus algorithms were
based on Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake and wasted computer power, and thus were unsuitable for
use with VANTA. Therefore, VANTA aims to use the computing power and network resources of
network nodes for real-time networking and merge proof for those tasks with block generation and
consensus algorithms to create a consensus algorithm optimized for VANTA.

4.2 PoN-VRBFT Consensus Algorithm
VANTA has created an algorithm called Proof of Networking (PoN) that allows each node to
contribute competitively to real-time data transmission, processing, and storage in the network. This
was combined with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and Verifiable Random Functions (VRF) to design
a unique consensus algorithm called PoN-VRBFT.
VANTA nodes have a higher probability of generating blocks based on the amount of real-time
networking jobs they have performed. However, nodes that have performed the most jobs are not
always selected as the block producer. Block proposers, block verifiers, and block confirmers are

selected on a random basis through a random function in order to prevent specific nodes from
continuously being selected. VRFs are used for the random function, because verification of whether
the selected nodes were truly selected randomly cannot be done through typical random functions.
The idea of combining BFT and VRF was first proposed by Professor Micali with Algorand, and the
idea was also partly borrowed in Ontology for its consensus algorithm. The VANTA Team aims to
combine BFT and VRFs to create a new consensus algorithm suitable for the VANTA Network, which
equally improves security, scalability and transaction speed of existing consensus algorithms
alongside a new networking proof mechanism, PoN.

4.3 Proof of Networking (PoN)
Proof of Networking is an algorithm that mandates each node that has contributed competitively for
live data communication, processing, and storage prove its workload and use that proof data when
participating in a consensus round. The workload of each node is verified by verifier nodes selected
through VRF and recorded using VANTA’s unique workload unit called Net and Net price to prove the
amount of workload and the actual value of it. This is what differentiates PoN from other consensus
algorithms.
The exact mechanism of VANTA processing those workloads on each node and how those tasks can
be proved on a decentralized network has been explained in detail within the previous section (section
3). First, the worker node that processed the requested job is verified on whether the job has been
properly processed from the verifier nodes. When workload verification is received from ⅔ of all
verifier nodes participating in job verification, the worker node generates a workload verification
transaction for its own workload including workload verifications. The worker node then immediately
propagates the transaction to the network and inserts it into its own transaction pool.
When the consensus round is initialized, all nodes with workload verification data determine whether
they will participate in this consensus round. In order to determine participation, each node executes a
VRF function by using a hash of the previous block header as a seed. Then, they only select their own
workload verification transactions from the obtained hash value and the transactions contained in the
current transaction pool. Lastly, they calculate the total work value and use it to execute the
consensus participation confirmation function. When a node has processed more jobs with higher
value, the node is more likely to be selected as a block proponent.

4.3.1 Transaction Type
There are three types of transactions within the VANTA Network. The first is a general transaction for
transferring VNT tokens. The second and third are a job transaction and a workload verification
transaction used in PoN for real-time networking job execution.
The workload verification transaction includes the job requester and target, the network and price of
the worker node, and the workload verification data from the verifier nodes. This transaction is
configured and propagated by the worker node. The Net price is the number of staked tokens required
to process a job per hour, set by service developers when they deploy their application. This Net price
determines the value of the job on the network, and when block generation rewards are paid, the final
reward ratio is determined based on the sum of all of these values.

4.4 BFT+VRF (VRBFT)
From VANTA’s PoN-VRBFT consensus algorithm, VRBFT refers to BFT and VRF. While existing
solutions like Algorand and Ontology merged Proof-of-Stake with BFT and VRF, VANTA adds PoN to
create a consensus mechanism specialized for real-time networking. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
combined with VRF is a proven consensus algorithm with many advantages. Unlike conventional
PBFT consensus algorithms, VRF that is an unpredictable and verifiable pseudo-random function can
be used to randomly select a small number of nodes participating in a consensus round, as explained
above. It also allows a network to reach consensus with only a few selected nodes. Conventional
PBFT algorithms, where nodes have to communicate with each other twice, have a communication
complexity of O(n^2). However, when combined with VRF, blocks can be generated much faster
because only a few nodes need to communicate to reach consensus each round.
The random seed for the VRF is determined from the seed of the previous consensus round, so that
no one can predict the block proposer, the block verifier, or the block confirmer, thereby preventing a
malicious attacker from predicting and attacking the target in advance. In addition, through the verifier
function (described with the above definition of VRFs) and the proof value of the evaluator, it
increases the reliability of the consensus process because the selected nodes can be easily verified
by other nodes on whether the selected nodes are actually the selected nodes in this consensus
round.

4.5 Block Proposal
If a node is selected as a block proposer by the VRBFT process, the node puts the transactions into a
block in its own transaction pool. The workload verification transactions that it has used to participate
in the consensus round are submitted as evidence that it has been selected as the block proposer.
The workload verification transactions are first included in the block since they must be verified by
other nodes. Next, workload verification transactions and general transactions of other nodes are
taken out of the transaction pool in chronological order and included in the block. Finally, the block is
signed and then broadcasted to the network.

4.8 Block Reward
All nodes that have performed a workload receive a block generation reward in proportion to their
total work value. When a workload verification transaction of that node is included with that particular
block, or if that node became the final block producer, the compensation received by each node is
calculated as follows.

4.9 Penalty
Worker nodes that participate in consensus within the VANTA Network are responsible for performing
real-time networking jobs as well as creating and confirming blocks. Thus, if a node does not perform
the data transfer and processing roles properly, or if a node does not act properly as a consensus
participant, its participation in the network will be limited as a penalty, and the node will be ineligible
to receive rewards.
The nodes selected as consensus nodes are worker nodes and will participate in the role of
proposing, verifying, and confirming the blocks to receive rewards for their own workload. Even if
workload verification transactions of nodes that are selected as verifier or confirmer nodes in the
current consensus round are not included in the candidate block, the nodes will verify or confirm the
block as soon as possible, so that the next block can contain its own workload verification
transaction. Eventually, the nodes that have their workload verification should participate in every
consensus round to be rewarded for their workload.

5.1 Token Issuance
The annual amount of newly issued VNT tokens is determined by a fixed rate of 2 percent, and the
variable rate is based on the number of tokens burnt in the previous year. Newly issued tokens are
used as incentives for nodes performing real-time networking workloads and participating in block
generation. Tokens burnt will go to the zero address, similar to Ethereum.

5.2 Staking Tokens for API Usage (application developers)
Companies that want to develop and operate services based on VANTA must stake VNTs in order to
transfer, process, and store data using the VANTA API. There will be an expected amount of workload
per month required for each service, and service providers should stake VNTs proportional to it. All of
the functions for real-time networking in VANTA are measured by VANTA’s work unit called a Net. A
service developer should stake VNTs in order to get Net corresponding to monthly resource usage for
their service.

s=w*p
s ​ : total stake required (VNT)
w ​ : workload per month (Net)
p ​ : Net price (VNT) set by developers
For example, if an application developer needs a 500,000-net total of real-time networking resources
per month for their application and the current average net price is 3 VNTs, the developer can set the
net price to 3 VNTs and stake a total of 1,500,000 VNTs (500,000 net * 3 VNTs). If the developer
wants the jobs submitted by its service to be processed faster or wants it to be processed by nodes
with higher performance, setting a higher Net price will prioritize processing for that job on the
network. When the application generates a job request and the work to be processed by the job is
worth 20 Net, 60 VNT (20 Net * 3 VNTs) is set as the price of the job and propagated across the
network. Then, the nodes that are willing to process the job for the price may competitively participate
and process real-time data transmitting, processing, storing, and other networking tasks. Twenty Net,
out of the total available workload request of 500,000 Net for the developer’s service, will be deducted
for the job from its available workload request, and this deducted workload will be filled to the total
available workload after 30 days.
If the price of Net specified by the developer is too low or the service users generate jobs that are
worth higher than the assigned workload, the jobs will not be processed by the nodes. In this case, the
developer m
​ ust unstake and stake VNTs for the new ​Net​ price again​ or stake additional VNTs in order
to allocate sufficient workload.
Therefore, as more apps are developed for VANTA, more developers will be staking VNTs. And as the
VANTA network processes more workloads, the amount of Net required will increase, and each
developer will have to stake more VNTs. The efficient market will constantly find an equilibrium
between cost of service, performance, and reward.

Finally, when unstaking VNT used to purchase workloads, there may be some tasks that are already
being executed and on hold. Therefore, when unstaking VNT is requested, VNT is returned to the
developer’s account after 24 hours.

5.3 Staking Tokens for API Usage (end users)
In cases when an application developer does not have sufficient funds to continue providing its
services, a sudden influx of users, or when required by the service’s business model, developers can
set staking rules for their end users. When a new user joins the service, or uses the service heavily, the
developer can allow the end user to stake the additional number of tokens required for its workload.
Also, the end user can set a monthly Net usage limit, which can enable more user-level custom
staking models. Thus, the developer can prevent the malicious use of the developer's Net for
unintended purposes. Because of these additional preventative measures, developers can choose to
stake all the required Net for all users when they have enough funds. In the case of startups or
individual developers, they can let the users stake the required VNT tokens to operate the service.

v = pd * wd + ∑ pi * wi

5.4 Staking tokens to join as nodes
Any device can participate in the VANTA network as contributors. They will be working on various
real-time networking jobs, verifying each other, generating blocks, and receiving rewards. P
​ articipating
nodes​ can be divided into job tracker nodes, worker nodes, or verifier nodes, depending on their roles
in the network.
Worker nodes that perform real-time networking jobs and participate in the consensus round are
required to stake an amount of VNTs in proportion to its workload.
Verifier nodes act as work verifiers for real-time network processing and can participate by staking
fewer VNTs than worker nodes. Therefore, in the VANTA network, smartphones and low-end PCs with
low performance or battery-related issues can easily contribute as verifier nodes. In addition, when
existing services migrate to VANTA’s network and APIs, or when new services are launched on the
network, the number of users participating in the network increases. These users’ devices can easily
contribute to the reliability of the network by participating as verifier nodes.

5.5 Burning Tokens as Fees for Unstaking
Developers must stake VNT tokens to run their services on VANTA. Depending on the developers and
their policies, participants/users may be required to stake VNT tokens as well. When staking and
unstaking tokens to purchase a workload, VANTA generates a 2% fee, and the entire fee generated is
immediately burned.
Staking and unstaking of VNTs may occur when the Net price required for job processing changes.
When a developer stakes VNTs, the developer sets the Net price, and the Net price may change
depending on the market situation. If the price set at staking time for the workload is too low at
execution time and the value of the job is too low, the priority for that workload may be lowered. This
may result in a delay in service operation, or nodes may not process that task at all. If the Net price is
too low compared to the price at the staking point, the developer may want to restake with a low Net
price.
Also, if service users generate a job worth higher than the total workload allocated by the developer,
the nodes in the network will not process the job if the workload per purchase is fully used. In this
case, the developer will have to stake additional VNTs to gain additional workload capacity.
For instance, when staking is required by participants to use a service, the number of new VNT tokens
staked will increase as the number of participants increases.
Eventually, as the ecosystem expands, staking and unstaking behavior will occur more frequently, and
the burning rate of the entire VNT token supply will also increase.

7. Use cases

Figure 16. Use cases

VANTA is a platform blockchain to create intelligent networks optimized for real-time communication.
For individuals, VANTA can be used to solve real-life problems. For developers, VANTA can be used to
create various services that will improve the solutions of those real-life problems. As more devices
become connected through the network, more services will be developed for the VANTA ecosystem.
The VANTA team is already collaborating with companies that will use VANTA to create diverse
business opportunities.
VANTA will allow individuals and corporations to develop real-time communications, games,
broadcasting, IoT-related services, and collaborate at low costs. Specifically, universities, hospitals,
companies, and public institutions can easily implement private networks in the form of an
on-premise private blockchain. It will be easier for services to achieve real-time networking with other
services if they also use VANTA’s intelligent network protocol, which will result in the expansion of
businesses. We will now look into more detail about how VANTA can be used in specific industries.

7.1 Communication
One of the key areas in which VANTA can be integrated is communication. Once corporations begin
utilizing the functions in developing their services related to communication, the possibility of
widespread usage in this sector will become significant. Customized forms of real-time messenger
services can be developed for corporations to use as a method of sending and receiving messages
and files, in addition to voice and video calling​. A
​ differentiating factor in VANTA is that these
functions will operate in real-time.​ ​VANTA API can be used to easily create communication services
that provide both direct and group chat with voice/video call services. For instances where privacy
and real-time communication are critical, such as social dating services, overseas travel reservation
services, as well as O2O services that require direct communication between buyers and sellers, these
functions can be quickly added.​ ​By bringing in the communication happening outside of these
services, not only will VANTA be competitive but will gain insight by collecting user data through
legitimate means without violating a user’s privacy. End users can use the decentralized
communication service safely.
Communication services like WhatsApp, Uber, and Airbnb are using centralized API services like
Twilio to incorporate communication capabilities into their services​. T
​ wilio had around 57,000
corporate customers in 2018, which was a 32% increase compared to 2017.​ Demand in this area is
steadily increasing - Twilio’s 2018 sales are growing to be $585 million USD.

7.2 Video streaming (Live & VOD)
Because VANTA is available for use by developers and strategic partners, anyone can develop a
P2P-based, decentralized video streaming service that can provide real-time networking between
participating devices. This means that it is possible to efficiently deliver high-quality, seamless video
streams to the world at low cost. Therefore, using VANTA can lead to more content production
because the cost of service development and operation is greatly reduced. Additionally, the costs
saved can be reinvested with the content creator or supplier. Live video streaming can be used for
online lectures, broadcasting, sports, and game relaying. VANTA will create the next generation video
streaming business that will allow Video on Demand (VoD) services, where various content such as
movies, entertainment, and music can be produced and supplied.

7.3 Internet of Things

Figure 17. Internet of Things
Because VANTA is a network in which each peer is connected organically, directly connects, and
processes data depending on the environment and performance of each other, it is well suited for
seamlessly connecting many IoT devices that are scattered everywhere and transferring data. In
addition, IoT devices such as smart refrigerators, smart TVs, and smart cars will participate in the
VANTA network as work nodes, which will greatly improve the processing performance of the VANTA
network.
Many devices can be developed based on VANTA, including processing of CCTV data, data from air
pollution or vehicle density measurement sensors, data from sensors of various devices in industry
which are distributed in each area, and IoT-related services that can automatically exchange data
required between devices.

7.4 Games
VANTA is also applicable to real-time, multiplayer-based games. Generally, in a multiplayer game in
which three or more players participate, a game data relay server is indispensable for delivering game
data to and between all the players. Developing a multiplayer-based game requires client and server
development. In addition, separate game servers need to be operated and managed to provide stable
game services. It is therefore necessary to apply the multi-server model considering the various server
failure situations that may occur during operation, which means that a lot of costs and development
manpower are required for game development.

Through the P2P-based real-time data transfer function provided by the VANTA Network, a multiplayer
game without the need of additional back-end infrastructure setup is possible. The developer may
effectively share and synchronize game data generated from each player to the entire devices that
play the game through the VANTA SDK.
The VANTA network, which includes a large number of peers, will enable more stable multiplayer
game services in various network situations.

8. Ecosystem & Business Development
The overall value of the blockchain industry and businesses is increasing. Even though the overall
market capitalization of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate greatly, global research groups, financial
advisors, and various media channels are forecasting additional growth in blockchain technology’s
business value
For example, Gartner forecasts that the total market value of blockchain-related businesses will grow
to more than $ 176 billion USD by 2025 and will reach more than $ 3.1 trillion USD by 2030. Also, many
believe that by 2030, blockchain technology will be implemented in several major government agency
systems. Personal information, including government records, credit history, educational background,
and medical information, can be easily stored and transferred through blockchain technology. Thus,
everyone can have access to useful information by moving away from the centralized social structure
seen with the status quo. Blockchain technology is also expected to reduce corruption.
Nobody can be sure about how blockchain technology will advance or blockchain market growth, but
it is important to note that blockchain technology will continue to evolve and will continue to grow in
size as well.
Efforts to overcome the current limitations of centralized networks will lead to the advancement and
growth of the blockchain technology industry. The VANTA platform that is aiming to decentralize
real-time networking can be further developed through the global interest on such technologies and
efforts in recognition for their demand. In addition, the VANTA team will continue to pursue
sustainable development and ecosystem expansion of the VANTA Platform.

8.1 VANTA DApp Ecosystem Expansion
VANTA is a blockchain platform that is aiming to expand its blockchain ecosystem through
collaborating with DApps to build on top of VANTA. By focusing on the specialties of real-time
networking and allowing them to converge between different DApps, the VANTA team will encourage
more ​individuals and corporations to participate ​in our ecosystem. In addition, through DApp
development competition events targeted at universities and startups, we will promote creative
real-time, networking-based DApps to enrich VANTA’s ecosystem. VANTA aims to innovate the DApp
ecosystem by making it easy to develop D
​ Apps that can be used in various fields, such as
communications, entertainment, education, Online to Offline, travel, and finance, as well as
enterprise-level DApps.

8.2 VANTA Consulting & Blockchain Customizing Strategy
Blockchains and decentralization networks are innovative technologies that are presenting a new
paradigm and leading us into the future, and they may gradually replace centralized models found
with the status quo. IT technology is rapidly evolving, and its speed is accelerating. However, the
speed of those technologies actually being applied to our daily lives has not been fast. For example,
IPv6, which is a more advanced technology than the existing and old IPv4 standard, is still taking a lot
of time for mainstream adoption. The VANTA Team plans to support the migration of existing
systems and applications to the VANTA Network by providing consulting services to allow
customizable solutions for enterprise customers in existing industries.
1. PSTN: It is possible to enable communications between a VANTA user and a user outside of
the VANTA network by supporting the interworking with the current communication network.
In addition, the current PSTN line operators can create a new business model by providing
PSTN to VANTA users at a low price through connection with VANTA.
2. SMS: VANTA users can send and receive SMS messages provided by the service provider.
3. VoIP: It supports interworking with IP-based devices such as IP phones, so it is possible to
communicate through the VANTA network by using the current system as is.
4. Replacement of communication equipment: By introducing a private VANTA blockchain, it
enables the replacement of current hardware / software / cloud-based communication
devices such as PBX, SBC, and media gateway.

investment in any security. This whitepaper does not constitute or form part of, and should not be
construed as, any offer for sale or subscription of, or any invitation to offer to buy or subscribe for, any
