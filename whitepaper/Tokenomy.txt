BACKGROUND

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

A BRIEF HISTORY OF TOKENOMY
TOKENOMY is your one-stop solution when it comes to purchasing TEN Tokens, as
well as issuing your own cryptographic tokens. Our goal is to become a global token
platform (“Tokenomy Platform”) with hundreds of tokens listed on our exchange,
alongside additional features that can help anyone, from small entrepreneurs,
merchants, and retailers to large enterprise businesses and developers, issue their own
tokens to conduct fair and reliable crowdfunding. It is intended that these individuals
and businesses will be able to raise the funds they need from trusted investors, and be
provided with a platform to tokenize various products like loyalty points. People can
easily trade loyalty points issued by a business for products and services they need,
not only from said business, but from other businesses which have their loyalty points
listed on the Tokenomy Platform as well. Tokens are intended to be interchangeable
with hundreds of merchants and service providers.
We provide 24/7 support to facilitate your business in generating your own tokens, from
handling all technical aspects, maintaining security, providing free publication and
marketing, to assisting you on the listing of your tokens on our exchange, and on other
exchanges. Collaborating with Bitcoin.co.id (the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in
Southeast Asia with more than 1 million users), we will help you list your tokens on their
trading platforms and get expose you to the investors you need. For people interested in
trading, major cryptocurrencies and new promising tokens will be tradable on the
exchange on the Tokenomy Platform.

WHAT IS THE TEN TOKEN?
The TEN Token is a new form of utility digital asset or token that is built on top of the
Tokenomy Platform, more popularly known as TOKENOMY. It has been created to
support a better, fairer and more reliant crowdfunding platform that can be used by
anyone around the world.

!9

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

With the TEN Token, small businesses can compete on a global scale and fundraise to
run their businesses through the issuance their own tokens on the Tokenomy Platform.
Anyone can become investors to support the projects in which they are interested.
Additionally, it is also intended that large companies, merchants, and startups can trade
their loyalty points alike on the Tokenomy Platform in the form of their own tokens.
It is intended that TEN Tokens are tradable assets, as well as a payment method to
make payments easier, faster, and frictionless in a new futuristic world and cashless
society.

VISION
At TOKENOMY, we plan to build a platform where anyone can help and offer small
merchants, entrepreneurs, or even an 18-year-old kid with big ideas, a helping hand.
We carefully select participants, analyse what they have, what they don’t, and look
ahead to their prospects in the future. As people with limited knowledge have had
difficulty distinguishing between companies that are truly valuable and worthy of
support from those which are not, we think it is necessary to build a platform that is
truly secure. The Tokenomy Platform was born from the desire to combat fraud, and
prevent scams and unreliable organisations from trading with and taking advantage of
legitimate companies.
Our goal is not just to become a global token platform for crowdfunding purposes, but
to become the biggest platform for tokenisation. With the Tokenomy Platform,
participants will be able to make investments and trade, business will be able to get
funding, and a variety of products and services can be tokenised and become
interchangeable across borders.

FORMER EXPERIENCE
The founders of TOKENOMY are not newcomers to the cryptocurrency world. Two of
our founders were the inventors of Bitcoin.co.id, formally known as PT Bit Coin
Indonesia, which is the biggest digital asset marketplace in Southeast Asia.
Bitcoin.co.id was first established in February 2014, and it has maintained steady and
ongoing growth since the beginning. Its monthly trading volume reached as high as
US$230 million in November 2017, with more than 1 million active users.
Just like Bitcoin.co.id, the Tokenomy Platform was built to create a crypto-ecosystem
that solely relys on blockchain technology, the secure and highly eﬀective peer-to-peer
distributed ledger system. With that in mind, we completely understand the challenges
of businesses that deal with cryptocurrency transactions. We believe that the world is
becoming more and more digitised, and that it is time to take a step forward.

ASIAN MARKET
We are choosing to target the Asian market based on the following considerations:
1. Asia is a market with huge and ongoing growth potential
Asia is the largest and most populous of earth's continents and its located in both
the northern and eastern hemispheres. Asia comprises a full 30% of the world's land
area with 60% of the world's current population. It also has the highest growth rate
today; its population almost quadrupled during the 20th century. The estimated
population for Asia in 2016 is 4.4 billion and it has already reached 4,504,428,373 by
2017.1 In Southeast Asia alone, the total population has multiplied climbing to
approximately 648,780,040.2 The median age in Asia is just 30.7 years, a young and
relatively open-minded demographic with regard to technology. Taken from
worldometers.info, the following table will provide additional insight into the sub
regions in Asia.3

2. According to the World Bank Group, 50% of the population is still underbanked
in Southeast Asia, China and India
Two billion people worldwide do not have a bank account or access to a financial
institution via a mobile phone, or other device. This is beginning to change. Between
2011 and 2014, 700 million adults became first time account holders, and the
unbanked population fell by 20%, down from 2.5 billion according to the World
Bank's Global Financial Inclusion database and based on information from more than
140 countries. 4 Even with such improvement, 2 billion adults across the globe remain
unbanked. South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific together account for more than
half the world’s unbanked adults. South Asia, home to about 625 million adults
without an account, has about 31 percent of the global total.5 The following map from
Center for Financial Inclusion shows how most Asian countries have little access to
open an account at a formal financial institution. The lighter the shade, the more
people they have that don’t have access to bank accounts.

3. Two countries in Asia are major and globally recognized financial hubs
Hong Kong and Singapore are competing for the title of Asia's most important
financial hub.6 Considered the gateway to Southeast Asia and seen as a wealth
management hub, Singapore was ranked the 3rd most competitive financial center
in the world. According to the latest iteration of the Global Financial Centers Index
(GFCI) that was published by the think tanks Z/Yen and China Development
Institute7, Singapore was also ranked 2nd in PriceWaterHouseCooper’s City of
Opportunity index and is ranked as the 6th largest wealth management center in the
world by Deliotte.8 Hong Kong is also a strong financial center, it has long served as
the gateway to mainland China and has the necessary expertise, information and
facilities to tap into the Chinese marketplace. This proximity and history has helped
make Hong Kong the largest trading partner of Mainland China.

4. Economic Growth in Asia
According to the International Monetary Fund’s latest regional assessment, the Asia
and Pacific region continues to deliver strong growth, even in the face of widespread
concerns about growing protectionism, a rapidly aging society, and slow productivity
growth.9 A quick look at Southeast Asia Region reveals that in 2016, its combined
‑

gross domestic product (“GDP”) (if considered as a single economy) placed it as the
6th largest in the world and the 3rd largest in Asia, at US$2.55 trillion, which is more
than 4 times the ASEAN GDP in 1999.10 The following table shows the percentage of
GDP Change in Asian countries:

CHALLENGES
!17

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

THE CHALLENGES OF UNDERGOING TOKEN PRE-SALES FOR TOKEN ISSUERS
We at TOKENOMY are trying to combat the challenges of undergoing a token sale so
that more people, even those with minimal technical skills, will be able to participate in a
token sale. Some of the most common issues people deal with when they are trying to
generate their own tokens and undertaking a token sale include:
•

Legality
Regulations, in most countries, are not yet clear regarding the sale of digital coins
and/or cryptographic tokens. Though the fact is still debatable, undertaking a token
sale can contain huge risks in the future. Legal support in this regard, especially from
the relevant government(s), is costly, tiring, and time-consuming. Large and
financially endowed entrepreneurs may be unable to pursue a variety of legal
options, but small companies are not likely to stand a chance.

•

Technology
Generating your own tokens for a token sale is a complex process and learning the
technology involved could be a barrier to entry. The process is simply but not
intuitive, and is not as easy as learning simple programmes. It is highly technical,
very new, and there are not many programmers out there that have the expertise to
take up such work; hence hiring skilled workers could be a challenge.

•

Security
Because of the potential vulnerabilities, hackers have been known to exploit and
attack token sale projects, especially those that are not securely guarded. Less
experienced programmers are the easiest targets, their risk is even higher if they do
not implement cold storage protocols.

•

Marketing
Most new entrepreneurs do not have strong business connections or wellestablished networks. Advertising and marketing may be a substantial drain of their
financial resources.

!18

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

•

Looking to get listed in exchanges
If you are getting positive reviews from news websites, being covered by the press
and financial or crypto-media, and/or have a large fan base, the path to listing on an
exchange is clear. For those who are just starting out, getting listed on
cryptocurrency exchanges is a challenge. If you’re just getting started, it may take
your best eﬀort just to remain in the competition and set up the minimum business
networks you’ll need to eventually be listed. The road to getting listed in an
exchange, particularly one with only a few customers, will be long and painful for a
startup or new group without solid connections.

•

Sustainability
In our opinion, if a token sale project has many investors, its tokens will likely be in
demand. If a token sale project has few investors but the support of a substantial
community, its tokens will likely survive for a few months. However, token sale
projects that have only 1-2 investors, and the support of a small community, its
tokens are not likely to be in demand or even known.

THE CHALLENGES OF UNDERGOING TOKEN PRE-SALES FOR INVESTORS
Designed for token issuers but flexible and accessible for all, the Tokenomy Platform
provides the best solution for investors looking for new tokens to invest. You might think
it is easy to participate in a token sale, but risky challenges lie ahead for naive investors.
Taken from an article called “Open Source: Token Best Practice”, written by Simon
Taylor on 20 October 2017, the following is a (non-exhaustive) list of challenges
investors often face during a token sale:
• Lack of Standardized Information
To invest, we need to know what kind of project we’re going to deal with and
accurate, concise, clear information is vital for price discovery as well to understand
the investment risk involved. The Tokenomy Platform will provide a new, easy-to-

!19

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

understand platform for a potential investor to learn everything he needs to know
about a particular token sale in which he is interested. Such information directly is
intended to be directly provided by token issuers.
•

Perception of Risk

In some cases, white papers can be misleading and may not contain details of the
risk involved. Investors are reliant on white papers to fully understand a token or
token sale project. Such papers however often reveal only the positive parts of the
project, and gloss over the negative aspects or risks involved. When a paper is
misleading, investors can easily be convinced to invest in things they do not truly
understand. Without a clear understanding of the offering, these investors may
choose to participate trivial factors, including but not limited to the token sale
project being well-marketed. As with any new technological development, there is a
significant risk of asset bubbles as investors overlook crucial details of a project in
the search for yield. Balancing this with appropriate data and transparency will be

!20

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

crucial going forward, TOKENOMY uses built-in proprietary methods to ensure all
information provided is accurate and no significant information is omitted. We
provide transparency for investors and are clear about the positive and negative
aspects of a token, making it easier for them to make fair decisions when deciding
to invest.
•

Potential Market Manipulation

Investors are often reliant on alternative sources of information – such as discussion
forums – which are open to potential market manipulation. TOKENOMY is intended
to address this by only publishing accurate, factual, and clear information.
•

Access to Secondary Markets

Secondary markets are another vital tool for price discovery. Some tokens are issued
with limited ‘lock-up’ periods where they cannot be exchanged on a secondary
market and others are not. This is confusing for investors and the transferability of
tokens needs to be addressed. In TOKENOMY, we provide direct platforms where
tokens can be traded directly to major cryptocurrencies (such as BTC, ETH, and
WAVES) that are familiar and easy enough for investors to deal with. Collaborating
with Bitcoin.co.id — the biggest cryptocurrency platform in Southeast Asia with 1
million users — this trading process can be done instantly and seamlessly, at the
preferred time of a tokenholder.

PRODUCT ACKNOWLEDGMENT
As a utility token, the TEN Token oﬀers several features that can be applied in various
sectors, such as:

1. Crowdfunding: Proposal and Tokenization
Anyone in the world can submit a proposal to explain more about their projects and has
a fair chance to earn a fundraising. With the TEN Token and the Tokenomy platform, this
can be done within minutes. Individuals, groups, merchants and companies that wish to
fundraise can invent their own tokens very easily with the help of TOKENOMY. In future,
it is intended that these tokens may be traded with other cryptocurrencies, and be
applied as a payment method—if there are merchants that are willing to accept them.
Alternatively, these tokens may be exchanged with products and services from the
issuer. There are many options; the actual approach depends on the wants of the
creator.
A proposal should include the details of the tokens that is intended to be generated
before they can be listed on the Tokenomy Platform (following issuance). Submitting a
proposal requires a specific amount of TEN Tokens. Proposals that are paid and sent to
the Tokenomy Platform will be carefully audited by our legal team and specialists in
specific areas before being published for public sale — provided that the proposal is
proven to be legitimate.
The TOKENOMY team will provide full support and facilities needed by the applicants
during the process of issuing their tokens. With TOKENOMY, applicants will not have to
worry about technical aspects on implementing tokens. Every process will be guided by
our team. Within a week of proposal approval, it is possible that your tokens could be
generated and traded in on the Tokenomy Platform.

!34

The support and facilities we provide for our applicants include:
•

Proposal Overview and Auditing Process
The TOKENOMY team collaborates with experienced and highly qualified legal
officers from Southeast Asia countries. Through our careful assessment and risk
management process, we analyse the prospects of the proposal you submit.

•

Generating Tokens
Creating your own tokens and going through a token sale can be a long, exhausting
process. Here at TOKENOMY, the process of generating tokens is intended to be
fast, easy, and error free. We handle all the technical aspects from the beginning until
the end. You will not have to generate your own wallet or worry about cold storage,
and the smart contract codes created for you are to the best of our knowledge safe
and secure. By using the Tokenomy Platform, you can automatically generate your
own tokens, and can simply choose whether you wish to use Ethereum or WAVES as
your underlying technology.

!35

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

•

Publication
What makes your token better than others? Why should people support your
project? Most importantly, why should investors spend their money to buy your
tokens? You will have to let us have the answers to these questions in detail if you
expect people to invest. With us, you will not have to create your own website.
The website creation process is easy for big companies, but for startups and
small businesses, money is needed for hiring web developers, paying site domain,
hosting, security, auditing and regular maintenance; the amount of funding
needed can easily drain your available resources. With TOKENOMY, we have will
have pre-set profile page catered to you to run token sales. This page can be
filled and edited by users to promote their tokens, and also shows the
TOKENOMY rating of the proposal you submitted. You will receive your own
profile page that is accessible with a subdomain from TOKENOMY. For example,
your site could be named and located at “mycoin.tokenomy.com” and your token
sale could be up and running in minutes. You can even attach your white paper for
public consumption — as you would be able to on your own, personal website.

•

Marketing
Every token sale project will be announced through email and mobile notifications to
all users on a daily or weekly basis depends on the individual subscriber preference.
All projects will be listed on our website and social media to ensure maximum
audience exposure.

•

Primary Market (Tokens sale)
Fundraisers will not have have to worry about searching for potential investors to
invest in your tokens. You will not even have to educate people on how to buy your
tokens! You might have heard how hard it is to buy a token; when processes are
overly complicated; new users can easily get confused. A more straightforward,
streamlined process allows investors to install an Ethereum Wallet and properly
make a transfer to smart contracts. Simply installing a wallet and making transfers
can allow most users to participate, but can also increase risk, particularly for those
who are not crypto savvy or who are inexperienced. With the help of TOKENOMY,
!36

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

investors will be able to easily purchase an issuer’s tokens with major
cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, ETH, WAVES, and TEN Tokens. To sum up the
process and services we provide, you can see the following flowchart.

!37

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

2. Loyalty Points & Mileage Plan
TEN Tokens are intended to be traded not only with digital assets but also loyalty points
of various companies. There are many cases where a company awards its customers
loyalty points when goods and services are purchased. However, loyalty points are
usually only redeemable within an issuer’s pre-set limits.
For example, Alice has a small handbag store that is popular enough to issue its own
loyalty points, complete with an exclusive membership card. In order to attract more
customers, she gives out a generous amount of loyalty points for people that become
regular shoppers at her store. These points can be redeemed and exchanged for various
bags and purses.
Bob, one of Alice’s loyal customers, has managed to earn a substantial number of
loyalty points. Bob wants to redeem his points, but he doesn’t need any more
merchandise from Alice’s store. He needs a new pair of shoes, but Alice doesn’t sell
!38

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

them. Bob is however unable to exchange the loyalty points issued by Alice’s store in
another store which has shoes as its merchandise, as the said loyalty points may only
be redeemed in Alice’s store.
At TOKENOMY, we envisage the introduction of a system in which loyalty points of
diﬀerent issuers may be interchangeable through loyalty points issuers’ participation in
the Tokenomy Platform as token issuers. The tokens they generated would represent the
loyalty points that issuers would issuer to their customers.
In the aforementioned example, instead of receiving loyalty points that can only be
redeemed in Alice’s store, Bob receives ALC tokens issued by Alice’s store. These ALC
tokens can be exchanged for other digital assets for investment and trading purposes,
or traded for other tokens that also represent loyalty points from other companies.
Hence, if Bob wishes to purchase a new pair of shoes from James’ shoe store (which
issues JMS tokens via the Tokenomy Platform and also listed thereto for trading as its
loyalty points programme), he can trade the ALC tokens received from Alice for JMS
tokens. The same holds true for the reverse situation: holders of JMS tokens will also be
able to trade JMS tokens for ALC tokens for the exchange of goods from Alice’s stores.
This can happen automatically, with just a simple few clicks!
The above is applicable to various schemes of various sectors, for example, airlines’
mileage plans, which are essential loyalty programs for customers who fly frequently
with a specific airline. If mileage points earned from such programmes were tradable as
tokens on the Tokenomy Platform, such mileage points could be traded for the mileage
points of another airline for consumption.

3. Customized Token
If you have a business idea and wish to issue your own customised tokens, we are able
do this by providing you with the facilities and support you need in order to do so. The
possibilities are limitless.
To cite an example: a budding musician is beginning to garner fame and a significant fan
base. The said musician intends to release an album, and wishes to do so on its own
without being contractually bound to a record label. In order to fundraise for the
preparation of the album, the musician may consider generating and issuing its own
tokens via the Tokenomy Platform to the public which will accord tokenholders certain
privileges, which could include access to the musician’s latest album, gifts of free tickets
to the musician’s live shows, or exclusive backstage passes. The musician will be able
to fundraise for an album, and simultaneously give back to fans (and tokenholders) for
their support.
This is your dream.
TOKENOMY turns it into reality.

4. Secondary Market (Trading Platform)
As you move through the Tokenomy process and your primary market stage is
completed, your project will be upgraded automatically to the secondary market stage.
Tokens are intended to be available for sale on the Tokenomy Platform. This exchange is
live and open for business 24/7, all year long. Users wish to collect specific tokens will
be able to purchase them with TEN Tokens. This will continue until the volume trading
for such tokens reaches a certain threshold; if the threshold is exceeded, new trading
platforms will be launched with new trading pairs consist of major cryptocurrencies, for
example: TOKEN - BTC and TOKEN - ETH.
TOKENOMY will cooperate with Bitcoin.co.id which already has more than 1 million
users in their exchange. We will do login sharing so that users of Bitcoin.co.id can
immediately become investors in TOKENOMY. With the large combined pool of
investors, it may not be diﬃcult to imagine and attain a successful token sale.

!43

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

To cite an example, Bob, who is an owner of a new electronic store called Sierra, wishes
fundraise to expand his business. He creates a token called the Sierra Token (SRA),
which oﬀers SRA-holders significant discounts when buying cellphones and computers
at his store. Bob submits a proposal to TOKENOMY for review, and pays the requisite
amount of TEN Tokens review fee.
Bob’s proposal is reviewed and approved in approximately a week. Bob will able to list
SRA on the Tokenomy Platform with its very own profile page that is accessible with the
subdomain of SRA.tokenomy.com, as well as the relevant material in any way he likes,
and get free marketing asssiatance with his projects.
SRA would also be available to be purchased with BTC, ETH, WAVES, and TEN Tokens.
It will be listed as SRA/TEN in our platform. If monthly trading volume reaches 1,000,000
TEN Tokens, SRA will also be listed to be paired with Bitcoin (SRA / BTC).
Assuming that demand for SRA and the corresponding SRA price increases, investors
that bought SRA in the early days when its price was relatively lower will have the
options to sell their SRA for a quick profit or hold onto it for later use. Together with
Bitcoin.co.id, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in Southeast Asia, TOKENOMY aims
to provide a platform on which users would be able to sell their tokens anytime they
want. Compared to traditional investment options wherein investors a significant waiting
period before they are able to cash out their investment for profit, the TOKENOMY
approach is easier, faster, and more eﬃcient for profit-taking. Buyers can also become
traders or market makers that actively trade for daily profit, taking advantage of SRA’s
price changes.
Bob receives the funds he requires, is able to build a bigger store, and to attract more
customers who wish they want to trade their SRA for special discounts when purchasing
electronic goods from Bob’s store.
The following illustration summarises the above example.

5. Friendly, Easy-to-Use Mobile Application
TOKENOMY is also intending to come up with a mobile application for both Android and
iOS users which will be available for on Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. The
mobile application will make it easier for a user to keep track of new tokens that are
being listed on TOKENOMY, and allow you to trade tokens online.
You will be required to login after you install the application on your device, using the
same login combination you use in TOKENOMY. The process is simple but highly
secure. Users have to option of setting up 6-digit pin number (or TouchID for iPhone
users) afterwards to speed up your login process. With a user-friendly interface, you can
trade anytime and anywhere you want only with a few quick taps and swipes.

What is an Initial Token Sale (ITS)?
An ITS is an event in which a new cryptocurrency project sells all or part of its
cryptographic tokens to early adopters and enthusiasts in exchange for funding. This

product or service. It is a quick way to bypass traditional funding routes to gain access
to funds in order to speed up development, which are much slower.

the most popular examples is by participating in a token sale. To make it as easy as
possible for all consumers, we at TOKENOMY, aim to offer our users a one-stop token
sale solution that facilitates the generation of customised tokens, and to provide new
opportunities to investors and traders to participate in the cryptocurrency market.

economic system that is more equitable.
With token sales, a wide range of individuals will have the opportunity to nurture their
businesses, get requisite funding from trusted investors, and receive payments in
cryptocurrency. We aim to help small entrepreneurs obtain funding through token sales

11
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Prospective purchasers of TEN Tokens should carefully consider and evaluate all risks
and uncertainties associated with the Issuer and its business and operations, the TEN
Tokens, the ITS, and the Tokenomy Platform, all information set out in this White Paper
and the ITS Terms prior to any purchase of the TEN Tokens. If any of such risks and
uncertainties develops into actual events, the business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects of the Issuer could be materially and adversely affected. In
such cases, you may lose all or part of the value of the TEN Tokens.
Please read the following risks and warnings before deciding to purchase TEN Tokens. It
should be noted the following list of risks and warnings is not exhaustive. Accordingly,
prospective purchasers should not place undue reliance on these statements.
1.

RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE ITS
There is no prior market for TEN Tokens and the ITS may not result in an
active or liquid market for the TEN Tokens
Prior to the ITS, there has been no public market for the TEN Tokens. In the event
that the TEN Tokens are traded on a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no
assurance that an active or liquid trading market for the TEN Tokens will develop

!76

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

or if developed, be sustained after the TEN Tokens have been made available for
trading on such cryptocurrency exchange. There is also no assurance that the
market price of the TEN Tokens will not decline below the purchase price of the
TEN Tokens (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price may not be indicative of
the market price of the TEN Tokens after they have been made available for
trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.
A TEN Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supranational or quasi-national organisation, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other
credit. The Issuer is not responsible for nor does it pursue the circulation and
trading of TEN Tokens on the market. Trading of TEN Tokens merely depends on
the consensus on its value between the relevant market participants, and no one
is obliged to purchase any TEN Token from any holder of the TEN Token,
including the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price
of TEN Tokens to any extent at any time. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot ensure
that there will be any demand or market for TEN Tokens, or that the Purchase
Price is indicative of the market price of TEN Tokens after they have been made
available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.
Future sales of the TEN Tokens could materially and adversely affect the
market price of TEN Tokens
Any future sale of the TEN Tokens (which were not available for sale in the ITS)
would increase the supply of TEN Tokens in the market and this may result in a
downward price pressure on the Token. The sale or distribution of a significant
number of TEN Tokens outside of the ITS, or the perception that such further sales
or issuance may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the TEN Tokens.
Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the TEN
Tokens

!77

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

Negative publicity involving the Issuer, the Tokenomy Platform, the TEN Tokens or
any of the key personnel of the Issuer may materially and adversely affect the
market perception or market price of the TEN Tokens, whether or not such
negative publicity is justified.
There is no assurance of any success of the Tokenomy Platform
The value of, and demand for, the TEN Tokens hinges heavily on the performance
of the Tokenomy Platform. There is no assurance that the Tokenomy Platform will
gain traction after its launch and achieve any commercial success.
The Tokenomy Platform has not been fully developed, finalised and integrated and
is subject to further changes, updates and adjustments prior to its launch. Such
changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected appeal
to users, and hence impact its success.
While the Issuer has made every effort to provide a realistic estimate, there is also
no assurance that the cryptocurrencies raised in the ITS will be sufficient for the
development and integration of the Tokenomy Platform. For the foregoing or any
other reason, the development and integration of the Tokenomy Platform may not
be completed and there is no assurance that it will be launched at all. As such,
distributed TEN Tokens may hold little worth or value, and this would impact its
trading price.
If and when the Tokenomy Platform is fully developed, there is no assurance it will
be widely adopted or utilised by its target users.
The trading price of the TEN Tokens may fluctuate following the ITS
The prices of cryptographic tokens in general tend to be relatively volatile, and can
fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The demand for, and
correspondingly the market price of, the TEN Tokens may fluctuate significantly

!78

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

and rapidly in response to, among others, the following factors, some of which are
beyond the control of the Issuer:
(a)

new technical innovations;

(b)

analysts’ speculations, recommendations, perceptions or estimates of the
TEN Token’s market price or the Issuer’s financial and business
performance;

(c)

changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with operations
similar to that of the Issuer that may be made available for sale and
purchase on the same cryptocurrency exchanges as the TEN Tokens;

(d)

announcements by the Issuer of significant events, for example
partnerships, sponsorships, new product developments;

(e)

fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies on
cryptocurrency exchanges;

(f)

additions or departures of key personnel of the Issuer;

(g)

success or failure of the Issuer’s management in implementing business
and growth strategies; and

(h)

changes in conditions affecting the blockchain or financial technology
industry, the general economic conditions or market sentiments, or other
events or factors.

The funds raised in the ITS are exposed to risks of theft
The Issuer will make every effort to ensure that the funds received from the ITS
will be securely held at such address as directed by the Issuer (“Receiving
Address”). Further, upon receipt of the funds, the Issuer will make every effort to
ensure that the funds received will be securely held through the implementation of
!79

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

security measures. Notwithstanding such security measures, there is no
assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks,
mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining
power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks,
distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the Receiving
Address, the Bitcoin Blockchain, the Ethereum Blockchain, or any other
blockchain, or otherwise. Such events may include, for example, flaws in
programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. In such
event, even if the ITS is completed, the Issuer may not be able to receive the
cryptocurrencies raised and the Issuer may not be able to utilise such funds for the
development of the Tokenomy Platform, and the launch of the Tokenomy Platform
might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, the issued TEN Tokens
may hold little worth or value, and this would impact its trading price. The TEN
Tokens are uninsured, unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure
them. In the event of any loss or loss of value, you may have no recourse.
2.

RISKS RELATING TO THE RECEIVING ADDRESS AND WALLETS
The Receiving Address may be compromised and the cryptocurrencies may
not be able to be disbursed
The Receiving Address is designed to be secure. However, in the event that the
Receiving Address is, for any reason compromised (including but not limited to
scenarios of the loss of keys to such Receiving Address), the funds held by the
Receiving Address may not be able to be retrieved and disbursed, and may be
permanently unrecoverable. In such event, even if the ITS is successful, the Issuer
will not be able to receive the funds raised and the Issuer will not be able to utilise

AFTERMATH
!80

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

such funds for the development of the Tokenomy Platform, and the implementation
of the Tokenomy Platform might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such,
distributed TEN Tokens may hold little worth or value, and this would impact its
trading price.
The loss or compromise of information relating to your wallet may affect
your access and possession of the TEN Tokens
Your access to the TEN Tokens in a cryptocurrency wallet (“Wallet”) depends on,
among other things, the safeguards to the information to such Wallet, including but
not limited to the user account information, address, private key, and password. In
the event that any of the foregoing is lost or compromised, your access to the
Wallet may be curtailed and thereby adversely affecting your access and
possession to the TEN Tokens, including such TEN Tokens being unrecoverable
and permanently lost.
The Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with
the TEN Tokens
The Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with the
TEN Tokens which may result in the delivery of TEN Tokens being unsuccessful or
affect your access to such TEN Tokens.
3.

RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER
The Tokenomy Platform is operated and maintained by the Issuer. Any events or
circumstances which adversely affect the Issuer may have a corresponding
adverse effect on the Tokenomy Platform if such events or circumstances affect
the Issuer’s ability to maintain the Tokenomy Platform. This would correspondingly
have an impact on the trading price of the TEN Tokens.

!81

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

The Issuer may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effectively
manage its operations as its business develops and evolves, which would
have a direct impact on its ability to maintain the Tokenomy Platform and
consequently the trading price of the TEN Tokens.
The financial technology and cryptocurrency industries and the markets in which
the Issuer competes have grown rapidly and continue to grow rapidly and evolve
in response to new technological advances, changing business models and other
factors. As a result of this constantly changing environment, the Issuer may face
operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes, and the sustainability of the
Issuer will depend on its ability to manage its operations, adapt to technological
advances and market trends and ensure that it hires qualified and competent
employees, and provide proper training for its personnel.
As its business evolves, the Issuer must also expand and adapt its operational
infrastructure. The Issuer’s business relies on its blockchain-based software
systems, cryptocurrency wallets or other related token storage mechanisms,
blockchain technology and smart contract technology, and to manage technical
support infrastructure for the Tokenomy Platform effectively, the Issuer will need to
continue to upgrade and improve its data systems and other operational systems,
procedures and controls. These upgrades and improvements will require a
dedication of resources, are likely to be complex and increasingly rely on hosted
computer services from third parties that the Issuer does not control. If the Issuer
is unable to adapt its systems and organisation in a timely, efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances, its business, financial
condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If the third parties
whom the Issuer relies on are subject to a security breach or otherwise suffer
disruptions that impact the services the Issuer utilises, the integrity and availability
of its internal information could be compromised, which may consequently cause
the loss of confidential or proprietary information, and economic loss.

!82

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

The loss of financial, labour or other resources, and any other adverse effect on
the Issuer’s business, financial condition and operations, would have a direct
adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to maintain the Tokenomy Platform. As the
Tokenomy Platform is the main product to which the TEN Tokens relate, this may
adversely impact the trading price of the TEN Tokens.
There may be weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs in the Tokenomy smart
contract
The Issuer will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the smart contracts
underlying the TEN Tokens are audited, tested and approved by technical experts.
However, as smart contract technology is still in its early stage of development and
its application of experimental nature carries significant operation, technological,
financial, regulatory and reputational risks, there are inherent risks that such smart
contracts could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs.
Purchasers of TEN Tokens should understand and accept that there are no
warranties that TEN Tokens are fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any
weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs which would cause loss in their worth or value.
In the event that any of the aforementioned risks materialises, the Issuer’s
business strategies, results of operations and prospects may also be adversely
affected.
The Issuer may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in its
network or services, hardware or software defects, security breaches or
other causes that could adversely affect the Issuer’s infrastructure network,
and/or the Tokenomy Platform
The Issuer is unable to anticipate when there would be occurrences of hacks,
cyber-attacks, mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend attacks,
majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), distributed denials of
service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in the Tokenomy Platform, the TEN
!83

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

Tokens, the Receiving Address, the Wallet or any technology (including but not
limited to smart contract technology) on which the Issuer, the Tokenomy Platform,
the TEN Tokens, the Receiving Address, and the Wallet relies or on the Bitcoin
Blockchain, the Ethereum Blockchain or any other blockchain. Such events may
include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation
or abuse thereof. The Issuer may not be able to detect such hacks, mining attacks
(including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks
and “selfish-mining” attacks), cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service errors
vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner, and may not have sufficient resources
to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in
rapid succession.
The Issuer’s network or services, which would include the Tokenomy Platform,
could be disrupted by numerous events, including natural disasters, equipment
breakdown, network connectivity downtime, power losses, or even intentional
disruptions of its services, such as disruptions caused by software viruses or
attacks by unauthorised users, some of which are beyond the Issuer’s control.
Although the Issuer has taken steps against malicious attacks on its appliances or
its infrastructure, which are critical for the maintenance of the Tokenomy Platform
and its other services, there can be no assurance that cyber-attacks, such as
distributed denials of service, will not be attempted in the future, and that any of
the Issuer’s enhanced security measures will be effective. The Issuer may be
prone to attacks on its infrastructure intended to steal information about its
technology, financial data or user information or take other actions that would be
damaging to the Issuer and users of the Tokenomy Platform. Any significant
breach of the Issuer’s security measures or other disruptions resulting in a
compromise of the usability, stability and security of the Issuer’s network or
services (including the Tokenomy Platform) may adversely affect the trading price
of the TEN Tokens.

We are dependent in part on the location and data centre facilities of third
parties
The Issuer’s infrastructure network is in part established through servers that
which it owns and houses at the location facilities of third parties, and servers that
it rents at data centre facilities of third parties. If the Issuer is unable to renew its
data facility lease on commercially reasonable terms or at all, the Issuer may be
required to transfer its servers to a new data centre facility, and may incur
significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with the relocation.
These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others,
natural disasters, arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication
failures. Additionally, the third party providers of such facilities may suffer a breach
of security as a result of third party action, employee error, malfeasance or
otherwise, and a third party may obtain unauthorised access to the data in such
servers. As techniques used to obtain unauthorised access to, or to sabotage
systems change frequently and generally are not recognised until launched
against a target, the Issuer and the providers of such facilities may be unable to
anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Any
such security breaches or damages which occur which impact upon the Issuer’s
infrastructure network and/or the Tokenomy Platform may adversely impact the
price of the TEN Tokens.
General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse
impact on the Issuer’s operating performance, results of operations and
cash flows
The Issuer has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic
and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time
to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the
information technology industry at large. Weakness in the economy could have a
negative effect on the Issuer’s business, operations and financial condition,

!85

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

including decreases in revenue and operating cash flows. Additionally, in a downcycle economic environment, the Issuer may experience the negative effects of
increased competitive pricing pressure and a slowdown in commerce and usage of
the Tokenomy Platform. Suppliers on which the Issuer relies for servers,
bandwidth, location and other services could also be negatively impacted by
economic conditions that, in turn, could have a negative impact on the Issuer’s
operations or expenses. There can be no assurance, therefore, that current
economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring
recession will not have a significant adverse impact on the Issuer’s business,
financial condition and results of operations and hence the Tokenomy Platform,
which would correspondingly impact the trading price of the TEN Tokens.
The Issuer or the TEN Tokens may be affected by newly implemented
regulations
Cryptocurrency trading is generally unregulated worldwide, but numerous
regulatory authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering
the implementation of regulatory regimes which govern cryptocurrency or
cryptocurrency markets. The Issuer or the TEN Tokens may be affected by newly
implemented regulations relating to cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency markets,
including having to take measures to comply with such regulations, or having to
deal with queries, notices, requests or enforcement actions by regulatory
authorities, which may come at a substantial cost and may also require substantial
modifications to the Tokenomy Platform. This may impact the appeal of the
Tokenomy Platform for users and result in decreased usage of the Tokenomy
Platform. Further, should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such
newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold, maintaining the
Tokenomy Platform may no longer be commercially viable and the Issuer may opt
to discontinue the Tokenomy Platform and/or the TEN Tokens. Further, it is difficult
to predict how or whether governments or regulatory authorities may implement

!86

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

any changes to laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its
applications, including the Tokenomy Platform and the TEN Tokens. The Issuer
may also have to cease operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate
in such jurisdiction, or make it commercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the
necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. In scenarios such
as the foregoing, the trading price of TEN Tokens will be adversely affected or TEN
Tokens may cease to be traded.
There may be risks relating to acts of God, natural disasters, wars, terrorist
attacks, riots, civil commotions widespread communicable diseases and
other force majeure events beyond the control of the Issuer
The ITS and the performance of the Issuer’s activities may be interrupted,
suspended or delayed due to acts of God, natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks,
riots, civil commotions, widespread communicable diseases and other force
majeure events beyond the control of the Issuer. Such events could also lead to
uncertainty in the economic outlook of global markets and there is no assurance
that such markets will not be affected, or that recovery from the global financial
crisis would continue. In such events, the Issuer’s business strategies, results of
operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. Further, if an
outbreak of such infectious or communicable diseases occurs in any of the
countries in which the Issuer, the developers, data providers or data consumers
have operations in the future, market sentiment could be adversely affected and
this may have a negative impact on the Tokenomy Platform and community.
There may be unanticipated risks arising from the TEN Tokens
Cryptographic tokens such as the TEN Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic
technology. In addition to the risks included hereto, there are other risks
associated with your purchase, holding and use of the TEN Tokens, including

!87

TOKENOMY - GLOBAL TOKEN PLATFORM

those that the Issuer cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as
unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed hereto.
