Executive Summary
AICHAIN is a public chain that is specially designed as a blockchain
infrastructure for AI applications. AICHAIN has the advantages of
blockchain technology, such as decentralization, open sourcing,
tamper-proof security and anonymity, to solve the current
challenges of AI such as data domination. However, different
from other blockchains that are strictly constrained by data size
and programming languages, AICHAIN uses technologies such as

N

plug-in visual machines, out-of-chain storage and API, to allow for
larger data sets and different programming languages. Moreover, as
the ability to attract applications, users and developers remains the
key challenge for all competing AI blockchain platforms, AICHAIN

A

has gained a strong competitive advantage by building strategic
partnerships with multiple AI applications teams among data
suppliers, application developers, platform resource providers and
consumers.

Our vision for AICHAIN is to create a platform that can facilitate
the communication, cooperation and data sharing among participants by enabling data transaction, protecting data security and
disrupting data concentration, therefore improving the efficiency
and productivity of the AI industry and allowing everybody, not just
the tech giants, to get the most out of the digitalization era.

Blockchain technology has the following advantages:

Decentralized

Decentralization is the fundamental characteristic of a blockchain. In a traditional
centralized network system, the destruction of a central node can paralyze the entire
system. However, for the blockchain network, due to the use of distributed ledger
and storage, there is no centralized hardware or institution, so rights and obligations
of any node are equal. Therefore, data blocks in the system will be maintained and
protected by all the notes in the system, and attacking a node cannot destroy the
entire network.

Open Source
Blockchain adapts an open source system, which promotes communication, participation, and development. Except for the private information of transaction parties,
blockchain publishes all of its data and codes, so that anyone can query blockchain

data and the development of related applications. The entire system is highly
transparent.

Tamper-proof
Once a piece of information has been verified and added to the blockchain,

N
I

the information on the chain is backed up in each of the nodes in the network
permanently. As a result, to tamper with the information, the only way is to attack
the entire system, requiring a computation power stronger than all the combined
computation power on the earth. Therefore, the data in the network is nearly

A

impossible to tamper with.

Anonymity

H
C

In the blockchain system, although all data logging and operation updates are made
public to the whole network node, the private information of the trader is handled
by hash encryption, which allows anonymous data exchange for the transaction.

I
A

Encryption is simply a method of conversion that converts the original information
through an algorithm. The recipient of the information can decipher it by a secret
key. The blockchain uses many established encryption algorithms to ensure the
system is reliable and secure.

2.2 The technical of AICHAIN
For low-level : AI consensus
AICHAIN uses the AI machine learning method to make statistical analysis of the historical block data to select the super nodes and adopt the common understanding mechanism
of POA+POW. The process of analysis and selection is as follows:

N
I

A

H
C

I
A

This process is entirely the result of the work of the POW of each mining account node
to select a qualified node to become a super node; and the super node itself uses the
mechanism of POA to ensure the speed of block creation at a high speed to improve the
speed of transaction confirmation.

1. everyone has the opportunity to participate in the mining and become a super node.
As long as the POW model makes a good account contribution to other nodes, the AI robot
will analyze and select the node into the super node queue.
2. when all the super nodes are all dried out and can’t work, all the other nodes still have
the opportunity to carry out POW mining, and in the next round, the AI robot is chosen to
be a new super node and continue to work.
3. AICHAIN has the opportunity to become a super node through nodes that can automatically adapt to the network environment and have more transactions. Achieve the purpose
of self adjustment and adaptation.
