Introduction
The cryptocurrency market today comprises a multi-billion-dollar industry. That being said,
it is yet to be fully accepted by the masses as an investment tool, compared to standard
fiat currencies like the dollar ($) or the euro (€). While holding a market share of
approximately 1.2% in current exchange currencies, that figure is expected to see rapid
growth in the upcoming years. We established NEXT.exchange because we believe in the
potential of cryptocurrency, and that through its application, corporations may find an easy
and efficient way of receiving finance for their projects. This will be achieved by utilizing
what is known as an ICO (Initial Coin Offering). Our vision at NEXT.exchange is to allow
companies to fund their activities as simply and securely as possible by utilizing digital
currencies for project development and service development. Right now, we are
designing and constantly upgrading a fresh new platform for cryptocurrency exchanges,
trades and conversions into foreign fiats.

Large capital acquisitions through ICOs, combined with the increasing public acceptance
of cryptocurrency as a medium of trade, will provide start-ups and investors alike with
opportunities for rapid project development and growth. However, the market potential
for cryptocurrencies is yet to be fully realized. We at NEXT.exchange, are currently
developing a unique cryptocurrency exchange platform which will provide traders with the
latest tools to get new coins with crypto or fiat at https://next.exchange.

NEXT.Exchange Embraces Blockchain Technology
Incorporated in the Netherlands, NEXT.exchange is a next-generation cryptocurrency
exchange committed to offering a fiat gateway and non-banking asset management
solutions outside of traditional financial systems and banking establishments. Unlike these
institutions, we place all assets straight into the Blockchain ledger.

History
Our team is composed of highly professional and motivated entrepreneurs and
developers with expertise in a plethora of different fields. Thanks to this and combined
experience in business development and management, this allowed us to obtain
invaluable knowledge regarding the ins and outs of developing a business from
conception to conclusion.
We are among the unsung heroes who took up the task of researching the new
technology known as the Blockchain, going way back as far as 2011 when only very few
believed in it. Furthermore, we have grown in technical maturity and insight as to
developing a business and providing financial service guidance and solutions, utilizing our
own in-house Blockchain technology. We wholeheartedly believe in Blockchain
technology. We are capable of providing a boost for well-rounded people who utilize this
technology in order to deliver business breakthroughs, while maintaining easy access to
shares and dividends from companies around the globe. Purchase and sell shares in just a
few clicks. Thanks to NEXT.exchange, security, professional expertise and quick, headachefree access to financials will become the new global standard. We strongly believe that
everyone everywhere should have access to professional corporate finance tools.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to become the next-generation cryptocurrency exchange, fully utilizing the
Blockchain technology, delivering propositions for new users of unparalleled value, and
offering strong returns for investors. Ultimately, we wish to drive the creation of a new
financial ecosystem grounded in the interactions between assets and Blockchain
technology.
Our mission is to foster and enhance the adoption of cryptocurrency as a medium of
exchange for global stock trading. We will achieve this by increasing awareness and
educating the general public on the safety and advantages of utilizing digital currencies
and Blockchain technology.
We at NEXT.exchange believe that the time has come for businesses around the world to
adopt Initial Coin Offering (ICO) practices and gain easy access to stock markets. Due to
all of the regulations and boundaries currently enveloping the financial industry, it has
become increasingly more difficult for fresh start-ups and even existing companies to
enter financial markets. We believe “Wall Street” does not have the necessary expertise
on the subject matter and cannot provide such individuals and organizations with the
necessary guidance to enter modernized financial markets. NEXT.exchange has the
required tools and expertise – in the form of easy access to rapid funding, professionally
tailored teams, and impeccable support services – to provide companies and start-ups
with the opportunity to experience positive business growth and development.
Our aim is to minimize the hassle and unnecessary limitations of bureaucracy and build an
easy-to-use, foolproof platform for the masses. We want to provide a solution for
businesses to easily access corporate financing solutions, and for the public to obtain in
start-ups and profit-based companies around the world without unnecessary headaches.
The platform we developed is a fully functional alternative to the cryptocurrency and
stockmarket exchange, which is currently being dominated by EuroNEXT and Wall Street.

Our Goals
•

To provide an exchange platform between fiat-, cryptocurrencies and (digital)
assets with a large, active and friendly community.

•

To provide our users with an efficient platform that can handle significant loads and
operate at optimal performance even during peak load times.

•

To provide new and prospective projects and their communities with a reliable
platform and multiple pairings.

“NEXT.exchange is constantly in pursuit of new technologies and to advance the financial
market experience for our clients. We adapt ourselves to future technological goals”.

What is NEXT.exchange capable of?
Currently, our platform enables users to sell and purchase digital assets, utilizing bank
transfers and cryptocurrencies. During the first year of our launch, we plan to make our
services available to clients located in the European Union, United States, and Russia. In
the second year of operations, clients based in Latin America, Asia, and Australia will be
able to utilize our platform. We then plan to bring our services to other developing
countries not mentioned before.

NEXT.exchange ensures the safety and security of client funds by utilizing cold storage
methodologies, backed by a trust and smart contracts, in which we have very strict rules
and guidelines pertaining to seller selection. Thereby, providing buyers with confidence
and trust in our services. During the first phase of our rollout NEXT.exchange will be
integrated with the Ethereum platform. We then plan to migrate our codebase to our own
Blockchain platform, which can handle large transaction volumes. We believe that our
organization can draw significant benefits from the many features that Blockchain
technology can offer. Our final objective is to create an exchange platform for businesses,
through which shareholders can receive dividends and trade their assets, with a fluid and
easy-to-use interface.

What are NEXT.exchange Innovations?
Combining traditional finance with the cryptocurrency world is a unique and challenging
process. At NEXT.exchange we are targeting experienced professionals as well as
newcomers in this field. To us, security is the most important aspect of business practice.
This is why we integrate similar smart technologies to provide our clients with the highest
guarantee of security available on the market. Currently, our unique features include:
•

Pool Trading – We are capable of obtaining high trading volumes and generating

substantial profits in today’s stock market due to our integration with other
corporate finance houses and major trading forces.
•

Community Trading – We are capable of providing users with a platform to which

they can upload their smart contracts in order to participate in an active smart
contract community for trades, business, services, and increased visibility.
•

Coin Suggestions – New and existing cryptocurrencies can be submitted for

consideration by our community users via our website. If we see a digital asset
getting a considerable amount of support from its community, we will carry out the
due diligence and make a decision to list this asset.
•

Social network for ICOs – All of the ICOs listed on our platform will have their own

profile, through which the community at NEXT.exchange can get in touch with the
team behind the ICO, as well as get direct updates and news from the ICO. Imagine
it like a Facebook profile for ICOs.
•

Crypto Mining – Users will be granted the option of investing funds in mining pools.

Mining pools work on a constant, passive earning model. Considering that the cash
power of mining pools will be more-or-less equal, returns on investments from the
mining of new coins will be split among investors.
•

Cold and secure storage of funds – We have nullified the threat of cyber-attacks

and hacking threats thanks to the utilization of cold storage methods. Clients will be
able to use the Trevor™ device in order to store money securely and safely, via
two-factor authentication and other security validation methods.

•

Services tailored to inexperienced users – Our system provides inexperienced

users the opportunity to copy and learn from the actions and decisions of more
experienced traders. New traders can benefit from the expertise and knowledge
base of experienced market practitioners. For traders who simply do not have any
spare time to devote to market and trading research, NEXT.exchange will provide
an Auto-Trade tool. This is a feature that automatically follows the actions of top
traders based on current and historical performance. Auto-Trade is the safest
automated trading method, and will be implemented in the NEXT.exchange
investment fund.
•

Investment Funds – NEXT.exchange will provide its users with fully managed

investment funds. Generally, pools of companies, ICOs or the top 30
cryptocurrencies.
•

Trader Advantages – Traders who operate on our platform will have the

opportunity of earning a percentage of their follower’s profits and obtain boosts to
gain certain advantages, such as lower processing and transaction fees.
•

Referral program – Our referral program is designed to benefit both invitation

senders and recipients. A bonus system will be implemented that will allow users
to receive rewards once they recruit new users to the platform. This ensures that
new users are introduced so that NEXT.exchange’s trading volume grows.
•

Fiat gateway – Only on NEXT.exchange we create instant swaps between crypto

and fiat. We started with USD and EUR and will add more local currencies as we
move along.
•

Payment Service Provider – We integrate Payment Service Providers to create a

bridge for services like PayPal, Stripe and Payoneer. As long they accept
cryptocurrency-related businesses, we have them covered.

Permits & Regulations
Conducting operations of a stock exchange is vastly different from any other business
practice, due to the fact that capital is not only required to fund growth and trade cycles,
but also for regulatory aspects and requirements. These regulations are in place to
ensure that financial institutions experience a minimal risk of financial distress during
economic hardships in which high pressure is evoked on an institution’s deposit base
(quantity of withdrawals outnumber deposits). Therefore, most of the capital that will be
raised will be put into a trust fund (foundation) that is supervised by the Dutch AFM
(Authority Financial Markets) in order to satisfy optimal capital adequacy requirement
ratios, which are legislated and required in order to obtain operating licenses in new
jurisdictions.

Regulatory requirements
Proper licensing is one of the key aspects of being a fully functional financial institution.
NEXT.exchange expects to acquire an investor license (beleggersvergunning) to enable
trading in traditional stocks. Also, NEXT.exchange is in the process of applying for an emoney license which covers the European Union. Today, a lot of banks are refusing clients
which are active in the cryptocurrency market. NEXT.exchange sees opportunities to
acquire an e-money license themselves to serve this market and create partnerships to
ensure its operation and to create a fair playing field for others.
The cryptocurrency market is decentralized and does not yet fall under any governmental
regulations. The United States Congress, however, has expressed plans to regulate
1

cryptocurrencies in the foreseeable future, while others are banning them.

We expect that the regulation of cryptocurrencies will be implemented, and therefore, we
want to be ready to face these obstacles and bind the market under the NEXT.exchange
platform by way of the following:

•

Providing licenses to cryptocurrency, credit unions and crowdfunding platforms.

•

Maintaining a deposit of over €100 million in a secure trust.

•

Opening IBAN/SEPA credit and debit accounts for our clients, without restrictions.

•

Provide banking services, like payment cards and terminals which work with
cryptocurrencies.

•

Investing and partnering with innovative cryptocurrency businesses.

•

Lobbying with (semi)-government institutes and corporates about the possibilities
that Blockchain technology can offer.

Services to be offered
NEXT-generation Cryptocurrency Exchange
The world needs a next-generation cryptocurrency exchange which is innovative, fast and
easy to use and understand. Today’s exchanges are mostly decentralized, answering to no
government or central authority and located in an area outside of any jurisprudence. All
while a huge community is trading their cryptocurrencies. Security is another important
issue - a second Mt. Gox incident could still happen, even nowadays. One hack on the
wrong exchange and the money is gone.
NEXT.exchange prevent this as much as possible to provide every trader their own wallet
and unique address. These would be under the trader’s sole control and synced with the
Blockchain. This hybrid approach is unique and offers our platform an intuitive interface
and reduces risk. It also presents lower transaction fees and measures to prevent
fraudulent activity by applying Know-Your-Costumer (KYC) policies.
The NEXT.exchange platform will be able to support the most popular cryptocurrencies,
including, but not limited to, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Ethereum (including ERC20), NEM,
Electra, Electroneum, Rupee and NEXT. These will all be fully paired with all other cryptoand fiat currencies.

Cryptocurrency crowdfunding
Since the founding of Kickstarter, the crowdfunding markets have developed into an
industry with over $2.5 billion+ of active assets. Compared to crowdfunding, the current
cryptocurrency market volume is even higher. Despite being relatively new, the ICO
market has already overpassed Kickstarter’s volume. This is rather impressive, considering
that the market is still in its early stages, with a ridiculously high ceiling for crowdfunding
and profit generation. We at NEXT.exchange believe that ICOs will replace IPOs entirely in
the near future, due to developing technologies and obsolete business practices. ICOs
will provide companies of all sizes with rapid financing solutions and liquidity at a such a
rate that IPOs will soon lose their appeal and competitive advantages.

Instant ICO Deployments
Currently, an Initial Coin Offering is a very time-consuming and strenuous process, which
may take months of hard work to fulfill. NEXT.exchange will provide users with fully
automated API web services in which ICO token sales can be launched almost
instantaneously. We will provide a ready-to-go programming code so that ICOs may be
launched the same day as a request is filed, accompanied by a target audience list and
automated marketing procedures implemented to attract investor attention to new
prospective ICOs. Considering that NEXT.exchange will provide all of the necessary
services, token supplies, smart contracts and legal documentation, we will require a small
fee of 5% for our services.

The NEXT token
Although we greatly value our shareholders, we want everyone to have the opportunity
to become involved in the early stages of our exciting, groundbreaking company, and have
the opportunity to generate a profit, taking the first steps in the direction towards
revolutionizing the digital asset market and corporate finance industry. Exchanges work
because people use them to buy and sell their digital assets. and the more assets our
exchange platform has, the more profits will be made, which means more income returns
back to our token holders.
We will provide interested parties with all pertinent information needed to decide on
whom to follow in the industry. This includes fully detailed profile outlines depicting profit
and loss over time, plus historic graphs analyzing business performances and trades.
Token holders will also have the benefit of being notified each time a successful trade is
placed and can monitor the overall profit ratios over time.
We provide to our token holders additional features like:
•

Access to a fiat gateway with over a dozen (local) currencies.

•

Up to 15 days earlier access to new listings.

•

Lower transactions fees on the platform.

•

Pool trading of fiat, cryptocurrencies and (digital) assets.

•

The ability to automatically follow another successful investor practices and trends.

•

Full range of professional analytic tools and insight (credit) information tools.

•

Token rewards for high-volume trading activities and bringing in new investors.

Token holders will have the opportunity to reap rewards for large volume trading and
referrals of new investors to our platform.

Profit Sharing for Token Holders
NEXT.exchange will share its profits with token holders. While NEXT.exchange services
need to have certain centralized elements for its launch, we strive towards
decentralization and the minimization of trust related issues.
All trades on NEXT.exchange will be publicly reported and visible on the “Token Holder”
section of our website. This is not only standard practice but a requirement for all
regulated exchanges – cryptocurrency and otherwise.
To verify the integrity of our trade data, users will be able to check the trades they made
in the published trade data section of our website. Furthermore, all completed trades
receive a sequential trade ID number, which ensures that there are no gaps in the
compiled data.
1

As stated previously, dividends will be paid out on a quarterly basis . Based on these
quarterly results, NEXT.exchange will load the ETH (Ethereum) amount of dividend
payouts onto a smart contract. The smart contract will contain a table of dividend
distributions. Think of it as a snapshot taken when dividends have been declared. Token
holders will then proceed to query the smart contract dividend distribution function to
move dividends from the wallet in which the tokens were stored at the time the
“snapshot” was taken. The smart contract will proceed to pay out dividends to the wallet
that made the request after validating all provided information. If the “snapshots” do not
match the dividend payout amounts at 100% validity, the smart contract will refuse the
payout request. This means that either all dividends will be paid out fairly and accurately
or no dividends will be released at all.
NEXT.exchange researchers will monitor real-time dividend payouts as micro transactions.

However, the Ethereum network’s capabilities do not currently extend to high-volume
transactions of such small size. Therefore, it is intended that this will become a readily
3

available option when the Ethereum network gains the capability to receive shares and
4

lighting network capabilities .

Dividends can be paid quarterly to token holders, starting three months after the public release of NEXT.exchange’s platform.

The NEXT blockchain
To make sure NEXT.exchange can handle forecasted traffic and trading volume, the
development of a unique blockchain has started with the following features:
•

Ability to process up to 100.000 transactions a second.

•

No transaction costs on the Blockchain.

to connect payment cards to our Blockchain or even third party services, like insurances,
energy contracts, big data or the Internet of Things. The NEXT blockchain hold assets
which are listed on the platform and is completely secure, infinitely scalable and
decentralized.

Conclusion
Digital assets and Blockchain technology will definitely change the world. We at
NEXT.exchange wants to be there when it happens. We hope to do this by offering an
innovative and secure platform where users around the world can safely and easily
exchange their assets.
Every day, cryptocurrencies are gaining more and more legitimacy. The number of
companies that are starting to accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment is
increasing on a daily basis. Reddit, WordPress, Baidu, and other online businesses like
pizza chains, grocery stores, gyms, entertainment centers, and even vending machines are
accepting cryptocurrencies in lieu of traditional fiat.

We are living in a period of a digital financial revolution
Bitcoin and Ethereum are pioneering the cryptocurrency era. However, the diverse
cryptocurrency scene falls short in convincing public masses of its legitimacy and safety.
NEXT.exchange have the ability and capability to guide the cryptocurrency stock exchange
into a new age. An age which gives both novices and experienced traders a peek into and
a piece of history in the future of corporate finance practices.
