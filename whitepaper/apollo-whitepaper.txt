ABSTRACT

Apollo is a new cryptocurrency built off the NXT platform. Apollo
has been commissioned to become the most advanced, feature rich
currency available. Its main goal is to provide users with an effective
all-in-one currency with which they can buy and sell with complete
assurance of privacy.
Apollo will be the first cryptocurrency to give users the ability to
buy, sell, send and receive invisibly, all while offering significantly
more features than its competition. This stealth is accomplished by
offering a private transaction option, IP masking, coin shuffling, unblockable nodes and an integrated decentralized exchange. These
features will take possibilities for cryptocurrency to new heights
while potentially eliminating the ability for governmental regulation.
We foresee rapid, mass adoption of Apollo as on top of offering
the fastest, most private transactions, Apollo will boast many
capabilities never before combined into one currency.
The crypto world is aching for a universal, all-in-one currency
delivering the most coveted features in a single platform. Apollo,
with its large community and team of world class professionals will
deliver this currency, redefining the industry and raising the bar for
what a top cryptocurrency should be.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past nine years, the world has seen many different
cryptocurrencies. The creation of Bitcoin, in January 2009, was a timely
intervention during a period when investors around the world had lost
faith in centralized financial systems. The deep-seated corruption
that was unmasked by the 2008 credit crunch, was a warning that
we can no longer trust anyone but ourselves with our finances. The
continued problem of security, regarding our identities and privacy, has
become a hot issue. The last ten years has shown that not even leading
democracies can be trusted with our financial liberty.

APOLLO OFFERS ABSOLUTE
FREEDOM AND TOTAL CONTROL
IN AN ALTERNATIVE
DECENTRALIZED FRAMEWORK
Harvard Business Review quoted, “To protect the blockchain vision
from political pressure and regulatory interference, blockchain
networks rely on a decentralized infrastructure that can’t be
controlled by any one person or group.” This freedom inspired
blockchain is the core vision of Apollo. Unfortunately, as we will lay
out in this document, current cryptocurrencies although mostly
decentralized, have many flaws that allow for an outside entity to
easily control and regulate. Apollo offers a solution indefinitely free
from political pressure.

THE PRESENT CRYPTOCURRENCY
LANDSCAPE
The goal of Apollo is to replace the great number of niche currencies
with one platform combining the best features currently available.
An overview of the leaders of the market shows how Apollo will quickly
take the lead in terms of superior offerings.

TOP GENERAL
CRYPTOCURRENCIES
BITCOIN

Bitcoin is the product that gave birth to blockchain technology.
The creator Satoshi Nakamoto could only foresee a certain number
of problems that this currency could solve. By 2018, Bitcoin has long
departed from its maker’s goal of being the perfect alternative
means of exchanging value, to what is now a highly inefficient
currency. Bitcoin transactions face the problem of being extremely
slow, so much so that a transaction can now take days to confirm,
making it unrealistic to be used by businesses. Bitcoin transactions
4

have also become too expensive, as users making small payments
often have to pay transaction fees which can be as much or
even more than the monetary amount they are sending. Many
cryptocurrencies compare themselves publicly with bitcoin, as
it is an easy rival to beat in terms of functionality and features.
Instead, we choose to compare Apollo with only the most advanced
cryptocurrencies available.

ETHEREUM
Although Ethereum has made tremendous strides since its inception in
2014 (becoming the second largest blockchain based currency), it too
comes with innate problems which threaten its ultimate sustainability
as a currency. Ethereum is the most used platform for ICO, which now
leverages on its infrastructure to offer all kinds of inefficient products.
Currently Ethereum’s blockchain is not only bloated but suffers from
extreme privacy issues, as anyone can access intimate details of
your account and transactions, including your IP address (physical
location). Furthermore, having experienced major glitches with its
smart contract system and transactions, such as the hacked DAO
that resulted in the loss of $75 million usd, it is easy to see how it could
be replaced with a more advanced solution.

RIPPLE
Ripple is the third largest cryptocurrency by market share, having an
advantage over the previous two when it comes to speed and rate
of transactions. However, Ripple is essentially a centralized entity,
owned by a U.S. based company, which is doing its best to serve
the present banking industries that cryptocurrency was created
to replace. These close ties with the banking industry prevent
Ripple from being considered the alternative that will provide its
users the escape from the current corrupt systems. It gives no
regards to privacy and was created to comply with strict monetary
regulations, the same as any bank. It has also been proven that the
company behind ripple owns more than 60% of the total amount
available and the founder personally owns 17%, leaving only a small
percentage traded by the public.

5

TOP PRIVACY
CRYPTOCURRENCIES
DASH

Dash is the most widely used and most valuable privacy-focused
cryptocurrency. Dash has been among a few cryptocurrencies which
offers users some form of privacy when sending transactions. But,
for Dash, this privacy comes with severe limitations and no absolute
freedoms. There are limits to the amount one can send or receive with
its Darksend feature, which is essentially a simple form of coin mixing.
Even then, before a transaction can achieve a reasonable level
of privacy, it requires several sessions of Darksend. Your IP address
(physical location) is also vulnerable making it an all-around poor
choice for a privacy currency.

MONERO
Monero was created with the goal of providing users with a
completely cloaked transaction. However, outside of a simple private
transaction Monero relies on a bloated blockchain that offers little
else in extra features. It does not have the ability to send public
transactions, which is critical for mass adoption, and it leaves your
IP address exposed. Therefore, failing in its viability as a long-term
privacy currency.

VERGE
Verge advertises itself as the alternative that will provide total privacy
for its users. Verge is essentially a clone of Dogecoin (initially started
as a joke cryptocurrency branding the face of a cartoon dog), which
started off with the name Dogecoin dark. This coupled with the fact
that it has very few additional features, a small, previously unreliable
team and a dated blockchain limits its prospects as a top contender.
Verge is a currency that certainly serves a great niche but offers too
little to go further than that.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The main problem with cryptocurrencies on the market is that they
are built to work within a niche, focused on a few features to offer
something slightly different or improved to users. In almost every case
these currencies are built using bulky blockchains that cause slower
transactions as more users are on the network. These are simply not
sustainable for the long term. Even current top currencies offer very
limited possibilities. They may have desirable features but limited
decentrality and no private transaction option, opening them up to be
highly regulated, or vulnerable to an attack on the user’s privacy
Currently governmental regulation, such as the ones imposed in China
and Venezuela, are the single biggest threat facing cryptocurrency. Any
cryptocurrency which has privacy loopholes, with which governments
can leverage, will always be under imminent threat.
Current currencies which offer privacy do so in a very limited capacity,
utilizing bloated blockchains and very few additional features. Certainly,
none that could ever contend with or replace top non-private currencies.
Nearly all top non-private and private currencies allow the IP address
of a user to be easily tracked, making a user’s physical whereabouts
transparent. There are no currencies on the market which offer an IP
masked, decentralized exchange, giving users the ability to buy and sell
a currency using private or public transactions directly from their wallet.
Additionally, there is no currency that has added every useful feature
from top currencies on a sustainable blockchain and combined those
with the best privacy technology. If there was such a currency available,
it would have replaced every other coin on the market.

APOLLO SOLUTION

Utilizing a world class team, the Apollo Foundation is offering the allin-one currency capable of replacing every other on the market.
SOLUTION:

Olympus Protocol

Hermes Blockchain

Current Features

Our All-in-One
Secure Wallets

OLYMPUS PROTOCOL
IP MASKING
IP masking utilizing advanced technology, including tor, will soon be
integrated into the Apollo wallet allowing for seamless, untraceable
use of the wallet and all its features.

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS
Perhaps one of the most important features in Apollo is the ability to
choose between private transactions and public transactions. This
allows any user the ability to send unlimited private transactions that
will not trace back to their wallet. Public transactions are also possible
allowing for mass adoption.

INTEGRATED DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE
The decentralized exchange integrated into Apollo will allow anyone
to buy, sell and trade with absolute secrecy, because the exchange
is 100% decentralized and not run by any entity, no identification
documents are ever needed and there are no fees. Your IP will also
be masked, and you can send private transactions directly from the
exchange.

9

COIN SHUFFLING
Coin shuffling is an additional privacy feature allowing your Apollo, as
well as other currencies held in the account, to be randomly shuffled
between user accounts. This allows an account holder to anonymize
their funds nearly instantly.

HERMES BLOCKCHAIN
SUSTAINABLE BLOCKCHAIN
The Hermes Blockchain will make Apollo an incredibly secure, lean
cryptocurrency with indefinite stability.

LIGHTNING FAST TRANSACTIONS
Hermes will take a transaction speed that averages 10 to 30 seconds
and make this same blockchain facilitate transactions as fast as 2 to
3 seconds. Utilizing our newest blockchain technology will make Apollo
one of the fastest cryptocurrencies on Earth. This will help to establish
its dominance as it opens up huge potential in microtransactions,
decentralized banking, financial services and more.

CURRENT FEATURES
MONETARY SYSTEM
The monetary system within Apollo allows users to instantly create
currencies or tokens that can be traded privately on Apollo’s
decentralized exchange as well as freely on external exchanges. These
currencies can easily be backed by Apollo giving them an instant,
tangible value.
Possible use: Crowd-funding, ICO, Finance, Charity, Voter IDs, Escrows,
Coupons, Currency, etc.

ASSET SYSTEM
Using the Apollo asset system, a user can issue tokens representing
anything from public and private equity to real world commodities.
Unlike other markets and cryptocurrencies, users will be able to trade
these assets with 100% privacy.
Possible use: Shares, Bonds, Private Equity, Public Equity, Commodities,
Derivatives, etc.

11

ENCRYPTED MESSAGING
Encrypted messaging on the Apollo blockchain will allow any user
to send and receive 100% private, untraceable messages and data
files from one account to another. Utilizing the Olympus protocol, the
user’s IP address and the transaction carrying the message will be
invisible.
Possible uses: Untraceable Communication, Untraceable File Transfer, etc.

BLOCKCHAIN FILE STORAGE
The Apollo data cloud allows uploading to the blockchain for storage,
retrieval and publishing of information. This gives a user the ability to
upload a file to the blockchain, therefore receiving an irrefutable time
stamp for that data. This time stamp could be helpful in establishing
an absolute date for legal documents such as contracts and
intellectual ownership.
Possible uses: Voting, Permits, Evidence, Court Records, Transparency,
Death/Birth Certificates, Contracts, Wills, Trusts, Escrows, Maps, GPS
Data, Signatures, Medical Records, Arbitration, Delivery Records,
Certifications, etc.

ALIAS SYSTEM
This system in Apollo can be used to create a unique alias that acts as
a representation for a specific set of text. This will encrypt the chosen
text into the alias. This text could be your account number, a website,
email address, etc.
A specific alias can be claimed only once (like a domain name),
therefore it can be sold privately or publicly and transferred to any
other account. The most basic use is sending funds to an account
number, instead of typing out the entire account number you would
simply write in the alias.

VOTING SYSTEM
The Apollo voting system allows users to create public or private
polls. Polls can be used to direct and manage funds from an account,
elect officials or simply to gauge public opinion. This opens up near
endless possibilities for collecting absolute, verified responses from
designated sources.
12

PHASED TRANSACTION
Phased transactions are transactions set up to occur after a certain
condition is met. This could be after another transaction is sent or
received, after a passage of time or after a certain block number is hit.

MULTI-SIGNATURE ACCOUNTS
Apollo supports multi-signature accounts allowing more than one user
to control an account.

DECENTRALIZED MARKETPLACE
The Apollo decentralized marketplace allows users to buy, sell and trade
physical and digital goods using the Apollo currency. Users can list
goods to be sold locally or even worldwide. Trading will be decentralized
and untraceable allowing the free trade of any item. Future updates
will include a review and reputation system aiding sellers in building a
positive reputation based on experiences.

ADVANCED ACCOUNT CONTROL
Accounts can be created in a way that allows group control. Utilizing
the Apollo voting system, a group can be granted the ability (via initial
ownership or ownership of a specified token or asset) to vote on the
transactions that are spent on the account.
Possible uses: Private Investment Fund, Private Insurance Fund, Charity
Fund, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO)

AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
The Apollo authentication system allows users to authenticate an
account using the blockchain to prove that they are the overseer of an
account.

LEASING
The account leasing option allows the user to lease the forging
power of their account to another user. This allows for the creation of
forging pools, increasing the chances of generating a block, as well as
generating an income from transaction fees.

THE VISION

Utilizing a community of world-class developers, managers, marketers
and researchers, the Apollo community, backed by the Apollo
Foundation, has set out to accomplish the goal of making Apollo the
most technologically advanced, feature-rich currency on the market.
The Apollo Foundation understands the demands of a top tier
cryptocurrency and they believe they can create a coin that will
integrate everything necessary to replace the current currency
options. As they develop and improve Apollo, the Apollo team
will strive to develop features which have not previously used in
cryptocurrency.
The primary goal of the Apollo foundation is to create the first all-inone cryptocurrency, innovating and incorporating every ability that
could be beneficial in a digital currency, all in a single decentralized
platform. The first major update, Olympus Protocol, puts mass
adoption-proof privacy at Apollo’s core. This is because the Apollo
Foundation knows the ability for a user to buy, sell, trade and send in
absolute secrecy is vital in an industry that could be moments away
from intense regulation.
The Apollo team is here because they believe the only person or entity
that should be in control of your funds is you.

15

WHAT IS APOLLO?

Apollo is an all-in-one currency offering its users endless possibilities
that go beyond making secure payments for goods and services.
Apollo is a universal currency that can be tailored to use in almost
every sector of life and business. From the creation of token shares
for corporations, to the founding and management of highly
secured decentralized organizations. The full potential of blockchain
technology will be pushed to its limits within Apollo.

COIN DISTRIBUTION EVENT
Unlike an ICO, Apollo is not simply an ERC20 token that was printed
instantly. Apollo is its own cryptocurrency with many usable features
and many new features being developed. This event was not set
up with the goal of raising money for a project that had not been
started. The only goal of the coin distribution event was to distribute
Apollo into as many hands as possible, as quickly as possible.

INITIAL AIRDROP
At Apollo’s creation, 10% of the total supply was allocated to holders
of NXT. Anyone holding NXT at block height 1661331 are entitled to a
portion of this 10%. To claim, simply login to the Apollo wallet with
your NXT credentials.

16

APOLLO COIN FACTS
Apollo is available on cryptocurrency exchanges World-Wide
The Apollo project has been self-funded from the beginning, with
funds coming from founding members or close contacts of the
project. A low-key, public coin distribution was completed with the
sole purpose of distributing Apollo.
