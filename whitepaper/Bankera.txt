EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The potential impact of technological development in finance is one of the hottest
topics today. Many start-ups are trying to revolutionise financial services. However, they
mostly focus on a niche and cannot take advantage of economies of scale, which is
one of the main advantages enjoyed by traditional banks that may not be as
technologically advanced. Bankera plans to achieve the scale to offer traditional and
emerging banking products in a technology driven Blockchain era environment,
eventually becoming the one-stop shop for all banking requirements.
Bankera is already achieving significant progress as a FinTech company, and
plans to have significant infrastructure in place prior to the initial coin offering (ICO).
Already, Bankera has the necessary regulatory and IT arrangements to offer individual
international bank account numbers (IBAN) which can accept and make payments in
the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). Bankera is in position to offer competitive
foreign currency exchange rates, quick and cost effective international bank wires as
well as having the “Bankera Payment Card” linked to cardholder’s payment account.
Bankera is building a digital bank to last, therefore, the focus will be on the scale,
elimination of counterparties and offering core banking services such as savings and
loans accounts. To achieve these goals, Bankera will apply for additional banking
licenses in key jurisdictions to be able to operate in a spectrum of different fiat
currencies and facilitate cross-border transactions without the need for counterparties.
Bankera also plans to be a member of key financial networks, such as achieving issuer
and acquirer status with major payment card schemes as well as becoming a participant
in payment networks such as SEPA in EU, Faster Payments in the United Kingdom and
ETF in Canada.
In addition to traditional banking products, Bankera will be providing innovative
solutions for both individual customers and businesses alike, in a low-cost banking
environment. For example:
•

For businesses, Bankera will improve cash flow by extending finance for
payment processing against future expected payments, based on historical
cash flows and expected payments.

•

For individuals, Bankera will address the age-old problem of client’s savings
not keeping up with inflation by creating an investment product linked to a
basket of goods that automatically adjusts with inflation.
2

To achieve these objectives, Bankera as a company is to be set up and an initial
coin offering (ICO) will be conducted. The offering will be a virtual currency tokens
known as a “Bankers” (BNK). Funds raised by the Bankera will be given as grant
towards the development of Bankera as a project. An endowment will be made by
operator of Bankera as a product towards Bankera as a company as part of its
obligation toward the grant. Endowment payment shall be based on 20 per cent of the
transaction net revenue earned by Bankera and SpectroCoin and paid to BNK token
holders on a weekly basis. It is up to the discretion of the Bankera to then make
payments to the BNK token holders as part of the reward for their contribution towards
Bankera.

1. INTRODUCTION
We are living in times of digital transformation. The impact of this transformation
is clearly seen in how we share information and communicate. There are attempts to
digitize many aspects of our lives, especially in the world of finance and banking. Most
notably, the advent of Blockchain technology has enabled us to digitize money via
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. There are many attempts on foot to apply Blockchain
technology to revolutionise other areas of finance. However, most researchers focus
on transforming only one financial service or product (e.g. remittances or lending). This
trend has emerged because new participants have been nimbler in adopting emerging
technologies compared to incumbents who are hampered by legacy systems.
However, this competitive advantage that new entrants enjoy is likely to be a shortlived one as existing banks will use their considerable resources to build the same
services to remain competitive or acquire emerging FinTech’s.
The vision of Bankera is different; we are focused on building a bank for the
blockchain era, which eventually will become a one-stop store for all financial services,
in the same way, traditional bricks and mortar banks are now.
We believe that digital means distributed, hence Bankera as a company will issue
digital tokens on the distributed blockchain as an initial coin offering (ICO) to allow
supporters to contribute to the development of a purely digital bank. The aim of the
ICO is not to test a speculative idea, but to provide the capital to enable Bankera as a
product to expand its existing services to compete with existing banks as an equal
across all areas of operation including payments, lending, currency exchange, and
investments. We encourage supporters to try Bankera’s services before participating
in the ICO.

2. WHAT IS BANKERA?
Bankera is a bank that will be built for the blockchain era using technology to
reduce the number of counterparties, thus lowering the cost of banking for the end
consumer.
We have seen counterparty reduction emerge in e-commerce, where goods are
now often purchased straight from manufacturers. In financial services, the trend up
until now has seen financial technology companies building their businesses by
piggybacking off existing infrastructure to create better solutions for individual
products. For example, remittance companies have emerged simply because they
could process bank wires faster in various countries. However, such technologies have
created numerous counterparties. By being a core participant in financial markets,
Bankera can provide many services without the need for such counterparties.

3. SPECTROCOIN’S ROLE
Bankera’s founding team already owns and operates a successful cryptocurrency
exchange, e-wallet, debit card provider and payment processor. This product is
operated under the brand name SpectroCoin (https://spectrocoin.com/).
From day one SpectroCoin was built with the intention of providing access for
customers to a range of cryptocurrencies. However, to remain competitive,
SpectroCoin was required to produce a number of products that are seen in traditional
banking, such as debit cards, payment processing, international bank account
numbers, foreign exchange and so forth. As such, SpectroCoin has already developed
core infrastructure comparable to traditional banks. A natural extension of SpectroCoin
is to leverage existing technology to build Bankera, a revolutionary bank for the
blockchain era.
The introduction of Bankera will create an operational fork. SpectroCoin will
remain a leader in providing wallet and exchange services for cryptocurrencies and
Bankera will be a new product focused on efficient payment and banking solutions.

5

The success of SpectroCoin has provided proof of concept for Bankera. What has
already been developed will serve as a minimum viable product for Bankera to begin
operations.
The contribution of SpectroCoin to Bankera will be not only IT and regulatory
infrastructure, but also an introduction of Bankera services to 400,000+ existing clients
of SpectroCoin and share of a SpectroCoin’s talent pool of 50+ blockchain specialists.
Most importantly, SpectroCoin will be entitling Bankera token holders 20% from its net
transaction revenue from the first week after start of pre-ICO.

3.1. KEY FACTS ABOUT SPECTROCOIN
Clients: 400,000 and 1400+ new registrations everyday;
Cards issued: 63,000+;
Average daily volume: 580,000 EUR;
Team members: 50+

4. OUR VISION
4.1. EFFICIENCY FIRST
The financial services industry is moving towards becoming a near perfect market
due to constantly lowering barriers to entry and homogeneity of services offered (e.g.
loans do not have different taste or design only price and terms). To compete in such a
market, not only must operations be conducted as efficiently as possible, but it is
important to identify and pass through the most optimal solutions (i.e. the best trade-off
between time and money) to the clients. As a result, Bankera will be passing inter-bank
exchange rates to our customers involved in foreign currency exchange, available by
using Bankera’s payment card, making international transfers or exchanging currency
between their accounts.

4.2. STATUS OF MONEY
Bankera has identified three core trends regarding money in today’s environment.
First, cash is still the dominant form of money especially in developing economies, and
that will not change within the next decade. Second, electronic and digital money is
increasing in popularity. Third, in the nearby future technology might enable the
development and demand for new types of monies.
4.2.1. CASH IS THE KING
Bankera recognises that cash is still the predominate form of payment and
Bankera will be active in the cash market. One issue is that Bankera will not have
physical branches like traditional bricks and mortar banks. As such, Bankera has a
three-pronged attack to remain competitive in cash.
Partnerships with existing providers for cash deposits and withdrawals.
Bankera will partner with retail providers who currently distribute cash deposit and
withdrawal services.
Network of agents. In developing countries where infrastructure to handle
deposits and withdrawals is not established (such as South America), Bankera will offer
relevant retailers (such as newsagents or gas stations) the ability to be agents for
Bankera to handle deposits and withdrawals. Each of these agents will have an account
with Bankera to facilitate this.
7

Payment cards. As Bankera will be issuing payment cards, they could be used as
an option for withdrawals at most ATMs available globally when cash is needed.
4.2.2. ELECTRONIC AND DIGITAL MONEY
Bankera will offer money wallets in 22 fiat currencies initially, covering all the
major currencies such as USD, EUR and GBP.
In addition, Bankera will also support emerging digital currencies such as Bitcoin,
Ethereum, DASH, NEM and others ensuring that Bankera will be at the forefront of the
emerging cryptocurrency ecosystem.
Central banks (e.g. Bank of England, Sweden Central Bank and European Central
Bank) are discussing implementing new forms of digital money. As these currencies
emerge, Bankera will be a gateway between these currencies and end-users to provide
access to these emerging currencies.
4.2.3. NEW TYPES OF MONEY
Being at the frontier of innovation, Bankera will aim to solve old problems using
new technology and products. One such problem is that consumers, in general, do not
invest their money adequately to keep up with inflation. As a solution, Bankera will
pioneer issuing electronic money denominated in “baskets” as proposed by Nobel
prize winning economist Robert J. Shiller. While his idea allows customers to send a
traditional fiat currency equivalent to the worth of a particular consumption basket in
the receiving currency, we will extend the idea to offer electronic money denominated
as a proxy for consumption “basket”, to capture inflation and allow customers to keep
their funds constantly employed.
This idea is inspired by N. Kiyotaki and J. Moore who published an article titled
“Evil is the root of all money” in 2002, which stated that money could be substituted for
some liquid security. Hence, Bankera will offer low-cost exchange trade funds (ETF) for
payments and eventually allow the construction of individual portfolio/basket based on
customers preferences.
The idea behind electronic money backed by ETFs is this: a rational person would
like to have all their funds invested to be able to maximize potential return. Also having
more capital available for investments should benefit society as a whole as it is likely to
increase economic growth. Hence, assuming zero transaction costs and no volatility,
8

the rational person would keep all his funds always invested and will sell a small fraction
of their portfolio every time they need to pay for something (consumption). On the other
hand, when a person will receive funds, they will immediately invest these funds.
Assuming that the payer and receiver are investing in the same asset, we propose that
selling and buying of an asset are unnecessary steps, so a transaction of such asset (in
our proposed case ETF) would be the most rational solution.

4.3. PAYMENT PROCESSING
Bankera identifies two key issues faced by merchants accepting payments online:
fraud/chargeback risk and capital immobilisation due to rolling reserves or long
settlement times.
Bankera will help its business clients to solve these issues, firstly by providing
proprietary know-your-client (KYC) and fraud screening solutions as well as offering
incoming payments financing (as an alternative for invoice financing).
4.3.1. KNOW YOUR CLIENT
Bankera believes that a payment processor is in a much stronger position to
facilitate KYC and fraud detection procedures compared to the receiver, due to the
amount of data collected. Hence, Bankera will develop an extension for its KYC and
fraud screening technologies to forward relevant information to the receiver which will
be a proactive and preventative approach to fraud prevention improving compliance.
As a result, this solution should reduce the chargeback ratio, in doing so lowering the
overall cost of payment processing for our clients.
4.3.2. INCOMING PAYMENTS FINANCING
One of the key challenges for fast growing businesses accepting non-cash
payments is capital immobilisation. Typically, when a business processes a credit card
transaction 90 per cent is received within seven days and 10 per cent six months after
the transaction. This process is known as a rolling reserve, which is a risk management
strategy to protect the merchant and its banks from potential loss due to chargebacks,
however, it creates cash flow issues for businesses using the service.
Bankera will create short-term finance products to bridge this cash flow gap for
businesses. As a payment processor, Bankera will have an advantage over banks
9

because Bankera will collect live information about expected incoming payments. This
will facilitate Bankera offering credit for businesses secured against expected future
cash flows.
For example, a company may accept cash payments via Bankera’s gateway and
it could take three weeks for transactions to settle, however, Bankera could
automatically settle this transaction if it was confident that the funds will ultimately be
received. This immediate settlement can be done for a fee or interest payment and the
process can be used to reduce or eliminate rolling reserve requirements and other
obstacles businesses face. Such a solution cannot be offered by most payment
processors due to limited liquidity.

5. BUILDING A BANK
There are three core elements to ensure success when building a bank: capital,
technology and compliance. Bankera’s management team has a proven track record in
developing optimal synergies between these core elements. Prior to the ICO, Bankera
has already developed crucial parts of these three elements and already has a
minimum viable product.
The successful implementation of all three product groups will set the foundations
for the success of the bank. This philosophy is illustrated in the diagram below:

10

5.1. CAPITAL
Operating a bank is different from many other businesses because capital is not
only required to fund growth and trade cycles but also for regulatory requirements. In
the financial service sector, this regulation is in place to ensure banks have minimal risk
of financial distress during economic downturns when there is pressure on the deposit
base (more withdrawals than deposits). Therefore, most of the capital raised will be put
towards satisfying the capital adequacy requirement ratios that are legislated and
obtaining banking licenses in new jurisdictions.
For example, if the ICO was to raise 100M EUR, which on the surface looks like a
substantial amount, because of capital adequacy requirements Bankera could only lend
out 500M EUR, which is considerably lower than an average local bank would have in
lending capacity. It would correspond to 2,000 loans for an average loan amount of
250,000 EUR.

5.2. REGULATION
Licensing is one of the key assets of financial institutions. Currently, Bankera’s
management team has obtained a payment institution (PI) license. The team is close to
obtaining an electronic money institution (EMI) license before the ICO. Therefore,
Bankera will have a solid foundation in place to provide the planned services except
accepting deposits and offering investment products, which will come later.
The key milestone to be achieved after the ICO is to upgrade the electronic
money license to a banking license in the EU, which would be the necessary licensing
requirements to fulfil Bankera’s initial vision as set out in this document.
Also, Bankera will be obtaining memberships in various key financial networks
such as card schemes and several remittances channels.

5.3. TECHNOLOGY
Traditional banks often describe themselves as “technology companies”.
However, Bankera has a significant advantage with core technology built for the
blockchain era. Traditional banks have legacy products such as SWIFT messaging,
SEPA payments or payment cards at the heart of their technology, which makes these
technologies inflexible. In contrast, such products are simply bolt on the item for
11

Bankera and can be disposed of without interrupting core technology. This will make
sure that Bankera can remain nimble as modern technologies emerge and old
technologies become redundant.
Most of the technology required for successful operations for Bankera is already
developed and will be ready for testing as a minimum viable product prior to the ICO.
The core elements of Bankera’s current technology include modules for SWIFT
messaging, SEPA payments, payment cards integration, bank’s ledger, Bitcoin,
Ethereum, DASH, NEM modules, fraud analytics and more.
However, to maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly developing technological
market, Bankera will constantly be improving existing infrastructure and developing
cutting edge solutions for the upcoming blockchain era.
The graph below shows the technological solutions already available for Bankera
and the planned additions.

12

6. SERVICES TO BE OFFERED
Bankera is aiming to become a fully-fledged digital bank and will offer three core
lines of services:

6.1. PAYMENTS
Bankera’s payment solution will include traditional products such as globally
accepted IBAN, debit cards and payment processing, but will also extend to solutions
for remittances services as a correspondent bank for other financial market participants
to name but a few solutions.
To achieve this, Bankera will not only become a regulated European bank, but
also will seek to become authorised issuer and acquirer of payment cards and obtain
banking licenses in key jurisdictions to avoid dependency on the correspondent bank
services, which are extremely fragile nowadays as identified by the World Bank when
they concluded that correspondent banking relationships (CBRs) are declining1 due to
several factors including AML risk or reduction of risk. Having multiple licenses will
allow Bankera to offer instant cross-border transactions as well as having access to a
low currency exchange rates due to direct access to financial markets in multiple
jurisdictions because of having these licenses.
Bankera’s card, which will be available before the ICO, will give an option to spend
funds stored at Bankera’s wallet practically anywhere where payment cards are
accepted.
On top of that, all services will be accessed through an easy to use intuitive user
interface in more than 20 languages with live 24/7 support.
6.1.1. CRYPTOCURRENCIES
Bankera by default will support most of the cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin,
Dash, Ethereum (including ERC20 tokens), NEM for all its payment related features. This
not only means that Bankera customers will be able to store and exchange these

1

13

currencies, but they will also be able to keep their balance in accounts linked to
payment cards, which will allow users to spend these currencies like traditional money.
Bankera will also offer a payment processing solution for all these currencies for
merchants (currently available at SpectroCoin).
6.1.2. NEW TYPES OF MONEY
We see new types of money emerging backed by economic indicators such as
gross domestic product or exchange traded funds. Bankera is in an excellent position
to adopt or create such currencies as they emerge. This is especially the case once
Bankera launches investment products which will have synergies with payment
processing solutions which will allow Bankera to enable these new types of money.

6.2. LOANS AND SAVINGS
The ability to take deposits and issue loans is at the core of any banking business,
however, nowadays it is difficult to enter the banking industry due to compliance
requirements, especially around capital requirements. If Bankera is successful in
obtaining the relevant banking licenses, its operations will still be limited by the size of
the capital base. Therefore, it is important that Bankera enter the market with sufficient
capital to enjoy economies of scale to be able to compete with existing banks.
The calculation of capital adequacy ratios requires knowledge about the structure
of tier 1 and tier 2 capital as well as the portfolio of bank assets, to be able to calculate
the capital size as well as the value of risk-weighted assets. To illustrate the limitations
imposed by the minimum requirement of the total capital ratio of 8% as proposed by
Basel III requirements and the 4th European Capital Requirement Directive (CRD4)
regulations, we can assume that Bankera only has capital in the form of common equity.
Hence, the total allowed value risk-weighted assets (most of the loans have a weight
of 100%) can be calculated as:

!"# %"&'( )* +,-. /(,0ℎ2(3 "--(2- =

2)2"& 5"6,2"&
2)2"& 5"6,2"&
=
7,8,7'7 2)2"& 5"6,2"& +"2,)
0.08

14

However, 8% is the minimum capital requirement and the target capital
requirement is around 20%, which is higher than the average total capital ratio of 17%2
of all banks directly supervised by European Central Bank. As a result, assuming total
capital of 100M EUR, the max value of risk weighted assets (or loans with a weight of
100% issued) is:

!"# %"&'( )* +,-. /(,0ℎ2(3 "--(2- =

100! =>?
= 500! =>?
20%

A value of 500M EUR assets is equivalent to 2,000 loans averaging 250,000 EUR,
which is still small scale compared to existing banks, but a good starting point.
Bankera will leverage its technology to offer interest rates even on current
account balances.

6.3. INVESTMENTS
In the future, Bankera will start offering various investment solutions for individual
clients as well as businesses. Initially, low-cost exchange traded funds will be offered
for customers; later the offer will expand by adding trading, advisory, brokerage,
custody, wealth management and other services. Most of the services, such as advisory
or wealth management solutions, will be developed in house based on using the most
advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.
For corporates, Bankera initially will offer treasury services, which will expand to
cover most investment banking services required by corporate clients including deal
financing.

7. FINANCIALS
Bankera’s revenue can be assigned to each core group of its products: payments,
loans and deposits, and investment.

2

https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/banking/statistics/html/index.en.html

15

The payments revenue reflects the revenue from payment processing, card
issuance, and foreign exchange. The payments margin for retail customers will be only
0.01 EUR on top of costs faced by Bankera. The payments margin for business
customers will be only 0.25% (and decreasing to 0.1% after five years). The average
monthly margin per card is expected to be 0.5 EUR which would mainly include
interchange fees (fees paid by the card acquirer to the issuer, in this case, Bankera) as
well as maintenance, issuance and other fees. The average lending margin (the
difference between interest rate paid to depositors and interest rate paid by lenders
after accounting for unpaid loans and other direct costs) will be 0.5%, decreasing to
0.1% within five years. The average margin on investment products will be 0.25%,
decreasing to 0.1% within eight years with the fee mainly being for portfolio
management. As a result, Bankera expects 11M EUR revenue in its first year with stable
growth to 500M EUR within ten years.

8. INITIAL COIN OFFERING (ICO)
During the initial coin offering (ICO), Bankera as a company will issue virtual
currency tokens called Bankers (BNK) on the blockchain operated by a smart contract.

17

8.1. WHY ICO?
There are many arguments why we have chosen to do initial coin offering instead
of alternatives ways to raise money. First, an initial coin offer not only allows us to
onboard participants from different regions but also to incentivise them to promote
Bankera’s products via affiliate commission. Second, tokens provide liquidity since they
can be traded on various exchanges after the ICO. Participants can liquidate their
position like holding shares in a publicly listed company. Finally, the tokens’ smart
contract enables easy distribution of weekly affiliate commission, which would be hard
to process without usage of blockchain technology.

8.2. TOKEN
Token holders will be able to use Bankers (BNK) to pay for services and products
of Bankera at a discounted rate. Also, they will be allocated a commission of 20% of
net transaction fees paid by Bankera and SpectroCoin customers on a weekly basis.
Net transaction revenue represents the difference between transaction fees paid
by customers less direct costs associated with the transaction. For example, if
Bankera’s client’s exchange 100M EUR to foreign currencies in a week with an average
fee of 0.25% and Bankera faces an average fee of 0.1% the average net transaction
revenue will be 0.15%, hence token holders will be allocated 30,000 EUR as a
commission from foreign currency exchange net fees during that week.
Allocated commissions will be distributed via smart contract to holders of Banker
(BNK) tokens.

8.3. PRE-ICO
During pre-ICO only 10% of ICO tokens will be issued to finalize the initial version
of Bankera before the full ICO. The pre-ICO will be used to determine the hard cap for
ICO smart contract.
The price of BNK tokens will be 0.01 EUR per token.

18

8.4. ICO
The price of BNK tokens will depend on the number of tokens issued during preICO:
BNK issued during pre-ICO
0-499,999,999
500,000,000-999,999,999
1,000,000,000-1,499,999,999
1,500,000,000-1,999,999,999
2,000,000,000-2,499,999,999
2,500,000,000

EUR per BNK rate
0.012
0.013
0.014
0.015
0.016
0.017

The hard cap (how many tokens will be issued) will be determined by dividing a
number of tokens issued during pre-ICO by 0.1:

CD?EFDG =

H'7I(+ )* 6+(JFK 2).(80.1

There are also going to be a soft-caps during ICO, so that the price of each token
after each chunk of 1,000,000,000 BNK will increase by 0.001 EUR.
In case not all 30% of ICO tokens will be sold, the remainder will be distributed
pro-rata to pre-ICO and ICO token holders i.e. it will mean that 40% of all token supply
will shared among participants of pre-ICO and ICO.
The rest of the 30% tokens will be distributed during a SCO (secondary coin
offering) in the future, but never at a lower price than 0.1 EUR per BNK price.
The 25% of tokens will be attributed to the team as a motivation as well as for
bounty program for outsiders. The team part of tokens will be allocated over time.
5% will be attributed to advisors, who will advise us for several years until a fully
functional bank will be operating.
Hence, the total HARDCAP for pre-ICO and ICO is 10,000,000,000 BNK
(2,500,000,000 + 7,500,000,000) worth 177M EUR (25M EUR + 152M EUR) and at least
750M EUR for the SCO.

19

8.5. TOKENS ALLOCATION
The tokens will be allocated among participants of the pre-ICO, the full ICO as
well as management and advisors to Bankera.
Pre-ICO participants will be allocated 10% of all tokens issued.
ICO participants will be allocated 30% of all tokens issued.
SCO (secondary coin offering) participants will be allocated 30% of all tokens.
Management team and employees will be allocated 25% of all tokens over time
as a motivational tool to align the interest with the value of tokens. A part of these
tokens will be used as bounties during pre-ICO, ICO and SCO.
Advisors will receive 5% of all tokens for their insights and contacts to help
Bankera succeed.

If the HARDCAP will not be reached during ICO, the remaining tokens will be
distributed to pre-ICO and ICO participants pro-rata.

8.6. REVENUE SHARE
The value of each token will depend on the net transaction revenue commission
share paid to token’s holder each week. The process of net transaction revenue share
is explained below.
20

First 20% of net transaction revenues will be sent to the smart contract every
week:

Second, the smart contract will distribute funds to holders of Bankera’s tokens
pro-rata (to save fuel costs, token holders will have to claim their referral commission
from the smart contract):

This means, that if a holder has 1% of all outstanding Bankera’s tokens, he will
receive 1% of all net transaction revenue share.

8.7. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS
Participants of pre-ICO and ICO contributing more than 1,000 EUR will be eligible
to receive a Bankera’s card and IBAN account for free (initially at SpectroCoin).
However, some restrictions might apply depending on the country of residence of the
participant, as currently, Bankera’s products are not available globally.
21

9. TIMELINE
Upon a successful ICO, Bankera’s operator will establish banking licenses within
the European Union and become an issuing bank for payment cards. Down the track,
Bankera’s operator will obtain licenses in other key jurisdictions, such as the United
Kingdom, Japan, Singapore and others.
In terms of revenue streams, Bankera will initially focus on core banking activities
such as lending and payment processing, following the establishment of an EU banking
license. The next product option that Bankera will introduce will be low-cost investment
options for clients via ETFs. Eventually, the bank will offer a full range of investment
services including trading, custody and investment banking services for its clients.
Bankera will also offer robo-advisory based wealth management services for its clients.
The preliminary timeline is: pre-ICO by the end of August, the launch of the
minimum viable product with working IBAN and payment cards support by midOctober, a start of ICO preparations by late September, the end of ICO by the end of
February. Bankera will offer advanced payment processing solution by summer 2018.
Applying for a banking license by autumn 2018. Getting banking license in EU by late
2019. Starting deposit and lending business by mid-2019 (initially from Bankera’s
capital).
