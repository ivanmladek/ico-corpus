The Primary Sector. Current and Future
scenario.

In the near 2050, more than 9700 million
of humans will populate the Earth. It is
estimated that the demand for food will
increase by 70% for that year and that at
least 80 billion dollars of annual
investment will be necessary to respond
to said demand.

That means that all the production
processes have to be not only much
more efficient, but also the rest of the
points of the distribution chain must be
tuned as the most precise clock in the
world.

Nothing can be wasted and therefore we
have to take advantage of every last
gram of food produced. What most
makes us think is that today, we do not
know if we will be able to produce such
amount of food.

Surely we can only respond to that
demand if we adopt more technological
and efficient means of production. We
must also change the relationship
between the producer and the consumer
avoiding that (according to UN estimates)
50% of the value of the product remains
in the distribution network and not in the
hands of the producer.

According to estimates, food demand
will increase by 70% by 2050, and at
least $ 80 billion annually in
investments will be needed to meet
this demand, most of which is
expected to come from the private
sector.

The AgrolifeCoin Market.
Government policies often prove to be ineffective and
may, in fact, create impediments to offer financial
The direct market of AgrolifeCoin are all people and
company that wish to invest in products with a great
potential for growth, in particular those that are related to
the primary sector from any of its aspects.

The AgrolifeCoin system grows thanks to the efforts of
multiple stakeholders in our cryptocurrency and in our
project. So far it has been funded by a group of cofounders and the AgrolifeCoin team.
It aims to be the alternative to financial institutions in
developing countries to improve credit capacities in the
agricultural sector.
It should not ignore the fact that the primary sector environment is generated an important
parallel economic activity, which has to do with other sectors such as transport, technical,
economic and legal advice, biotechnology or creation of means of production.
If the agricultural sector is of great importance in developed countries, in those that are still
developing, this importance is even greater. In these environments, agriculture is the true
axis that supports the subsistence of the population (in 2005 it occupied between 18 and
22% of the active population and today almost 40%), reduces poverty, creates jobs and
resources energetics to self-supply the activity.
The majority of farmers in these countries also lack consolidated financial systems and that
can able to support large agricultural extension projects. The most important source of
funding comes from corporate initiatives and is often limited and ineffective.
All this makes them perfect scenarios to apply the project and its AgrolifeCoin currency.
Currently, intense work sessions are being held with groups in countries in Europe, Africa
and Latin America to promote the project.

Agriculture, a leader in job creation.
The primary sector is the one that has
better resisted the crisis, with an
increase of employed from the levels of
2008. But, in addition, agriculture,
livestock and fisheries have the most
favorable balance of the Active
100000
Population Survey.

The Agrolifecoin Mission.
AgrolifeCoin is a Cryptocurrency with a
huge mission: To turn global
agriculture into the most profitable
investment in history.
AgrolifeCoin comes to innovative
ecosystem of criptomonedas focused
and based on the primary sector, mainly
agriculture.
AgrolifeCoin will invest in this type of
companies as part of its mission to
catalyze the economic growth of the
activity. Its commitment is to increase the
amount of capital
available for
development and improvements in this
global sector.
The need to invest in agriculture is not
only due to the growth of the world's
population, but also to the change of the
food preferences of the middle class in
emerging markets towards foods of
higher quality and value.

AgrolifeCoin is an alternative form of
payment to the current media in the
value chain of the products generated
by this economic activity.

It will bring producers and consumers,
giving support to online markets in which
the use of this cryptocurrency will
facilitate a more just relationship
between both.
There is a clear imbalance between the
portfolio of loans from the banking
sector to agriculture and its contribution
to GDP.
This limits investment in agriculture by
farmers and agricultural enterprises.
It also shows that the loan barrier is not
due to a lack of liquidity in the banking
sector, but rather a lack of willingness to
extend loans to agriculture.
AgrolifeCoin seeks to mitigate the effects
of this imbalance.

The Agrolifecoin Mission.
AgrolifeCoin wants to take to any corner of the world the possibility that people
can access a platform of products and services in a practical and efficient way.
AgrolifeCoin mission is to help all people worldwide to use a fast, economic and
safe payment system.
It will help in the development of the villages, providing great benefits to
producers and consumers of agricultural products. It will reduce significantly the
commissions that are paid for the purchase of said products.
It will provide the sector with all the benefits related to its support technology:
Blockchain. It will promote the use of this technology in the traceability from the
producer to the consumer of these products, also allowing their payment in a
reliable way for both.
The key objective is to create a global, transparent, efficient and safe ecosystem
that allows agricultural and food companies to significantly reduce expenses
related to production, sales and logistics of the food we consume today.

It will establish a more just and direct relationship between producers and
consumers, offering everyone access to a wider and more varied range of
products.

The objective is to make AgrolifeCoin be used as an alternative means of
payment for international commercial transactions.
AgrolifeCoin has come to stay. Our mission is to be the first cryptocurrency for the
purchase of Agricultural Products and Tools.
We strive to offer value to investors while providing opportunities for growth and
enrichment to our users and our business partners, always striving for honesty,
justice and integrity.

Scope of Application.
AgrolifeCoin provides several approaches for its use and application:

Capital and financial asset.
It can be used as a saving and investment instrument.
Digital platform.
It is the asset that supports the economic activity of the AgrolifeCoin social
network; on the other hand, the network itself contributes to the rise in the
value of the currency.
Exchange medium.
It will be redeemable for FIAT money or other cryptocurrencies through
digital exchange houses.
Customized payment system.
It can be used for the purchase of goods and services worldwide.
Marketing Solutions.
It will significantly improve the channels and marketing processes of the
products, reducing the intermediaries in the value chain, increasing profits
in a very significant way.

A farmer has different tools: hoes, harvesters, tractors.
AgrolifeCoin Itis also a tool to facilitate and make
more profitable your work.

Characteristics of AgrolifeCoin
The most outstanding characteristics of AgrolifeCoin are:
Descentralized: It is not under the control of any public or private entity,
understand these as Companies or States. The legislations are local but the
scope of the currency is worldwide hence the impossibility of being controlled.
In the case of some cryptocurrencies it is the network itself through mining that
is in charge of generating new currencies according to demand, whereas in the
case of AgrolifeCoin the currencies are pre-mined, and this has a clear
deflationist effect.
Private: AgrolifeCoin allows you to conduct transactions without the
knowledge or approval of trusted third parties.
Direct: No intermediaries. Transactions are made directly from person to
person, this operation and the practical absence of intermediation make
transactions instantaneous and with minimal cost (almost nonexistent)
Anonymous: The AgrolifeCoin Ecosystem is totally anonymous. It is not
necessary to reveal your identity when doing business and this is one of the
main characteristics of our currency.
Safe: The money belongs to you 100%. It can not be intervened by anyone and
the accounts can not be frozen or seized.
Economic: The cost per transaction with AgrolifeCoin is lower than that of any
bank worldwide.
Fast: Fast: The fact that the coin is pre-mined makes that transactions with
AgrolifeCoin system are almost instantaneous.

Characteristics of AgrolifeCoin
Multiplatform wallets: We have web and download wallets compatible with
Mac OSX, Windows and Linux operating systems.
Present in the Exchanges: Initially we quote at the ALCUREX exchange house
and soon we will do it in the most important, where everyone can buy and sell
our currency.
Present at the central market: We are in the Coin Market Cap from September
3, 2016.
Supported by mobile applications: We have a simple but effective mobile
application available for Android and soon for IOS.

Security
The transactions are guaranteed by the underlying technology: the Blockchain.
When the transaction is made to a recipient, we have absolute certainty that this
will be the case and not another one who receives our payment. On this point
we must say that different systems of trust have been tested that guarantee the
agreement between the parties, in case of having to correct some transaction
error in the transactions.
AgrolifeCoin is not subject to the intermediation of third parties, it is based on
point-to-point transactions between the one who transfers the money and the
one who receives it.
Use a string of classic blockchain in which the
transactions are public but SHA256
encryption is used to secure them.
It is impossible to falsify or duplicate the use
of advanced cryptography techniques that
prevent such a fact.
The network on which it is supported and the wallets have important security
measures, such as verifications in two phases or encryption by key pairs. All this
guarantees that AgrolifeCoin coins are used legitimately.

The download wallets and the Web have been audited by computer security
companies to ensure a high level of security against hacker attacks or malicious
uses.

Security is one of our main concerns when designing and deploying any
of our solutions. Our prestige as a company goes in it.

Privacy
The technology of AgrolifeCoin allows
you to send transactions completely
anonymously.
In currencies based on the SHA256
Algorithm, you can know which coins
are spent and which are not, this is
known as UTXO.
Through the AgrolifeCoin wallet there
is an optimal level of anonymity,
making
the
work
of
tracking
transactions complex.
In the current banking model, the level of privacy granted to its users is limited,
since access to the information of the parties involved will always be audited by a
trusted third party.
The need to keep track of transactions in
our systems is not incompatible with the
need to preserve the anonymity of the
parties involved. This is the privacy model
promoted by Blockchain: the transactions
are audited without being able to identify
the people who carry them out.

AgrolifeCoin does not keep any data on its servers that
allows it to identify the people who carry out the
transactions. It does not keep any personal data on which
explicit consent has not been given for its use as required by
the LOPD.

Wallets
AgrolifeCoin wallets are available in the following operating systems and repositories:

What is a wallet?
A purse or wallet is a software to store, save, receive and send your cryptocurrencies in
an encrypted and therefore secure way.
The wallets can be compatible with a single cryptocurrency, such as official portfolios,
or on the other hand, multi-crypto portfolios, commonly created by third parties. The
portfolio also acts as a ledger for your transactions.

How does a wallet work?
We started by contradicting a bit the purse definition, since cryptocurrencies or tokens
are stored in your private key and not in your wallet. The private key is a 100% sure
code that you can only know, and a public key, a public code that is responsible for
indicating the amount of cryptocurrencies or tokens that your private key or wallet has.
The security of the portfolios is developed on a public / private key pair.
The ownership of your private key gives you full control over your cryptocurrencies
associated with their corresponding public keys, so it is extremely important that only
you know your private keys. We suggest using portfolios in the cloud for people with
less experience, such as the one that AgrolifeCoin provides.
IMPORTANT: It is convenient to download the wallets from the official pages and
distrust those that promise profits not reflected in the "White Papers" of the projects
that endorse them. Never share your password and even less your private key. Store
them in a safe place.

Thecnology of AgrolifeCoin.
Digital wallets
Types Wallets.
AgrolifeCoin wallets are divided into three categories:
1. Hot: A hot wallet is an online wallet permanently connected to the internet. Wallets in
the cloud are based on web applications within a domain. They do not require you to
download the software or the wallet to your computer. The data is stored on a server in
the cloud. AgrolifeCoin has recently completed its development:

2. Cold: They are discharge wallets. Are
installed on personal computers and do
not need to be permanently connected
to the network. AgrolifeCoin has cold
coin walletss for practically all operating
systems on the market. A special case of
cold wallet is the one that AgrolifeCoin
has developed for mobile devices with
the Android operating system. we are
currently developing one for IOS
devices.
3. Paper: It is basically a QR code and
the private key of your wallet. They are
the surest way to store the coins since in
some way it is as if we printed our
money. A paper wallet is composed of a
public key that we can share and the
private key that we must have only under
our control. We will share the public one
to receive money and the private one to
send it.

AgrolifeCoin and the Blockchain Ecosystem
The literal translation is "chain of blocks".
They can be one or several
interconnected or not. Broadly speaking,
it is a large database ordered distributed
among several participants, called nodes,
which contains all the operations carried
out by each of them.
This solution acquires value in
transactions that require security and
transparency without the need of
ntermediaries.
Simplifying, we could say that Blockchain
is a cryptographically distributed and
secure network for storing information.

AgrolifeCoin is a peer-to-peer Internet
currency that allows instant payments,
almost at zero cost for anyone in the world.
AgrolifeCoin is an open source, the global
payment network that is totally
decentralized from the central institutions.
Mathematical algorithms secure the
network and allow people to control their
own finances.

AgrolifeCoin and the Blockchain Ecosystem
In the system, two types of participants
are distinguished:
Those
who
send
or
receive
transactions: People who have
AgrolifeCoin and use it to buy and
pay for something.
Processing
and
validation
of
generated transactions: Computer
equipments are responsible for
resolving and validating operations.
There is a network of computers
designed to guarantee the integrity
of the data of each transaction. Once
the data has been validated,
transactions are included in a block of
the chain.
All the processing done by the
computers to validate the transactions
implies an important use of energy.
This cost is paid by those who transact
and has the name of fee. In the case
of
AgrolifeCoin
this
fee
is
insignificant. It is important to note
that what is paid is not related to the
amount sent. That is, if we send 100
USD or 100,000 USD with a fee of 5
USD, the chances of both being
validated and included in a block as
fast as possible are equal.

Although these fees are lower than
what one pays to move money through
the banking system, we must pay them
every time we want to make a
transaction with AgrolifeCoin. It should
be noted that the currency is premined and this makes these fees very
low.

AgrolifeCoin uses the Blockchain to create
an electronic money system peer-to-peer.
Allows the sending of payments between
both parties directly, without the need for
banks or financial institutions.

Benefits of AgrolifeCoin.
Without Bank account: Without the need
of bank accounts you can make your
transactions to pay for the products you

Low cost per transfer: Your transfers will
have a cost per transaction much
cheaper than any banking agency

Payments from mobile devices: You can use your mobile to make payments in a
comfortable and safe way.
Fast transaction: The blockchain system makes operations much faster and safer.

Opportunity: With AgrolifeCoin you can participate in bonuses, affiliate program,
staking, generating in this way active and passive income to the users of the
currency.
Multiplatform wallet: for mobile and desktop.

The social network will make alliances with companies that generate safe and

reliable payment tools through our cryptocurrency.
Recieve and Send AgrolifeCoin with QR code.
All Affiliates will have their payment gateway, e-commerce, wallets and cashiers for
Currency Exchange.

Why invest in AgrolifeCoin?
AgrolifeCoin is the first digital system that has its own social network and integrated
payment platform, which will incorporate smart projects in its Blockchain.
By having the backing of legally constituted companies, our cryptocurrency will
generate confidence in future investors, hoping that they see in it an intelligent
investment.
AgrolifeCoin will allow to pay products, goods and services through electronic
commerce or make donations to solidarity projects instantly and privately.

AgrolifeCoin will be an essential element in new projects that will be born with the
support of the currency and the team that supports it. These projects in themselves
may have more scope than the currency itself.
AgrolifeCoin is a cryptocurrency, which can be sent anywhere in the world
anonymously and safely and can be exchanged for any other currency.
AgrolifeCoin is developed with its own Blockchain, it is not an ICO, it is a
cryptocurrency since its creation on September 1, 2016.
Since bitcoin appeared in 2009 it became a great business opportunity. Those who
did not take advantage of it have seen great benefits escape, however the
opportunity is presented again by the hand of AgrolifeCoin.
It is an investment backed by a serious and solid project, with great growth
potential, which offers a clear business opportunity in the medium and long term.
AgrolifeCoin protects against the loss of value of FIAT money and the monetary
policies that tend to devalue these currencies to improve, for example, the export
capacity.

Why invest in AgrolifeCoin?
Experience shows us that investors in
digital currencies have benefited
immensely from the increase in prices
over time. Therefore, investing in
cryptographic
assets
offers
the
opportunity to increase your financial
assets over time.

There are crucial factors to consider when investing and we want you to know that
AgrolifeCoin meets them.

Acceptability. It is very important when investing in a cryptographic asset, knowing
where you can change the currency or where you can use it to purchase goods,
services or products. AgrolifeCoin fulfills this premise.
Portability. A digital currency must be portable. They should be able to be easily
carried from one place to another without much challenge. With AgrolifeCoin,
thanks to their wallets download, you can transport your coins in a pendrive, always
having them safe.
Security. It must also be safe. This is a characteristic of all legal currencies. From the US
dollar to the pound sterling, safety is a common quality. So, a good digital currency
must also be secure and AgrolifeCoin has all the necessary cryptographic systems to
make it completely secure.

All users earn credits for their daily activities, which can then be exchanged for AgrolifeCoin
cryptocurrencies.
Thus the social network becomes an additional source of revenue for users within it.
AgrolifeCoin has thought of all the users so that they can earn money even for free, for
example by publishing agricultural books and selling them or simply as a member that
promotes the social network.
The more people who are part of the Social Network, the more possibilities of profit there will
be for everyone.
