INTRODUCTION
Blockchain is a distributed database, which uses digital book technology that stores transaction
records and shares them on a distributed computer network. Using encryption, each network
participant can log in and manage the ledger securely. No central authority is needed in this

system. The blockchain maintains a list of records (blocks) that continues to grow, each
containing a timestamp and a link to the previous one.
Titan Coin introduces a completely new blockchain technology that uses Hybrid POW &
dynamic POS SHA 256+ Groestl (Dual Algorithm) for its backbone of the transactions & a POS
(proof of stake) system that pays 2.5 percent per year.
Titan Coin is an experimental currency that allows immediate payment to anyone, anywhere in
the world, using the zero-coin library. Titan Coin uses a hybrid POW / POS to get started, then
goes on to complete the proof of stake (pos sha256d algorithm) with a low energy consumption
and rewards long-term users and blocks pos hash holders, your weight of the mines does not
block the percentages.
TITAN COIN is a new generation of cryptocurrency that uses the latest blockchain technology
that focuses on secure and fast transactions. TTN is using the SHA256D algorithm of the main
bitcoin source and are upgrading to safer and faster transactions.
We are happy to present interested parties with the opportunity to participate in Titan's potential
growth. Once users have increased, the demand for Titan Coin will be very high.
Titan is a self-sustainable blockchain platform for creating and running new economic
applications. Our community uses the Titan platform as a payment service, proof of data
integrity and support structure for projects ranging from cloud computing to applications. As
more and more users bring their talents and passion to the platform, Titan's potential to promote
innovation is growing exponentially.
ALGORITHM

WHAT IS SHA-256?
SHA-256 is a member of the SHA-2 cryptographic hash functions designed by the NSA. SHA
stands for Secure Hash Algorithm. Cryptographic hash functions are mathematical operations
performed on numerical data; By comparing the calculated hash (the result of the algorithm
execution) with a known and expected hash value, a person can determine the integrity of the
data. A one-way hash can be generated from any data, but the data cannot be generated by the
hash.
SHA-256 (secure hash algorithm, FIPS 182-2) is a cryptographic hash function with digest
length of 256 bits. It is a keyless hash function; that is, an MDC (Manipulation Detection Code).
A message is processed by blocks of 512 = 16 × 32 bits, each block requiring 64 rounds.
Functions and constants
The algorithm uses the functions:

and the 64 binary words Ki given by the 32 first bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of
the first 64 prime numbers:

BASIC OPERATIONS
• Boolean operations AND, XOR and OR, denoted by ^,

and _, respectively.

• Bitwise complement, denoted by ¯.
• Integer addition modulo 232, denoted by A + B.
Each of them operates on 32-bit words. For the last operation, binary words are interpreted as
integers written in base 2.

• RotR(A, n) denotes the circular right shift of n bits of the binary word A.
• ShR(A, n) denotes the right shift of n bits of the binary word A.
• AkB denotes the concatenation of the binary words A and B.

SECURITY
Titan Coin, which inherits all the security benefits of bitcoin, uses peer-to-peer technology to
operate without centralized authority. Verification of transactions and the issuance of foreign
currency are collectively carried out by the network, by consent. All records are completely
decentralized and non-responsive and cannot be edited.
revoked or suspended by any authority. Although blockchains are design-safe, it's possible that
51 percent of attacks occur when an entity controls more than half of the network's hash power.
But with PoW and PoS in tandem, the Titan Coin blockchain has a high degree of security.

among others. Most crucially, the coin will be easily convertible into multiple currencies which
will make it adoptability easier.
