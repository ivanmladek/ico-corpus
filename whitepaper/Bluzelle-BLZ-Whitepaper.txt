1. INTRODUCTION
Our vision is to make the internet a safer and more secure place for the data of people
and businesses.

1.1. The Problem
Blockchain technologies are propelling the next genera_on of the Internet. Protocols like
Ethereum are a plaTorm for launching decentralized applica_ons (dApps) that will change the way
products and services are consumed. These dApps will exchange massive amounts of data that
need to be stored and managed. The problem is blockchains like Ethereum are not designed for
data storage and management; doing so would take up too much space and take too much _me.

1.2. The Solution – Bluzelle
Just like decentralized services like Filecoin and Storj are needed for ﬁle storage & management;
there is a need for data storage & management. Bluzelle is a decentralized, on-demand, scalable
database service for dApps. Bluzelle ﬁlls a need and is complementary to the other components
to make the decentralized Internet complete. Without these decentralized components, the
decentralized Internet would not be able to run eﬃciently and scale to massive use.

Working with enterprise customers revealed one cri_cal challenge for widespread adop_on of
blockchain applica_ons: the management of large amounts of data. This discovery led to the
forma2on of the Bluzelle decentralized database service.

3. THE CURRENT STATE OF DATABASE SERVICES
It’s es_mated that in 5 years there will be over 20 Billion connected devices that require the
genera_on, management, storage, and retrieval of enormous amounts of data.

“Business leaders demand next-generation applications and new insights to drive more
intelligent engagement and better decisions. To get there, enterprise architects need to design
an agile technical architecture that can scale automatically with capabilities, such as databases,
that are always available to support new initiatives. It takes enormous time, effort, and
coordination to provision new databases today because of a lack of resources to meet the
administration challenges of rolling out complex clustered systems.” Forrester Research, 2017
Market Overview Database As A Service

To address this problem, emerged the Cloud Database and Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)
market. According to Markets and Markets, this industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 67.30% to
$14.05 billion by 2019. There are four primary drivers of demand for DBaaS:
•

Consumer personalization apps - financial, dating, social media products

•

Internet-of-things (IoT) applications - everything is being connected

•

Mobile apps - amount of data consumed is growing exponentially

•

Line-of-business (LoB) collaboration - business units share more info

With all these applica_ons producing more and more data, past and present database
management services are under-equipped to meet the needs of businesses. There are problems
centered around performance, reliability and scalability. These can lead to problems of data
breaches resul_ng in massive amounts of data thet.

4. BLUZELLE FEATURES
Bluzelle is a decentralized database service for dApp developers. To ensure developers get the
highest throughout in performance, reliability and scalability, Bluzelle implements swarming
technologies. A swarm is a large group of nodes (computers) that work together to store and
manage data. Nodes in these swarms can go down and new nodes can come up with minimal
impact on the network. Overall Bluzelle is a meta-swarm comprised of mul_ple swarms.

4.1. Performance
Bluzelle’s unique and proprietary swarming techniques were designed for the highest
performance. Bluzelle can reduce latency by retrieving data from the nearest nodes on the leaf
swarm, and/or increase speed manyfold by retrieving data in parallel from the fastest nodes on
the leaf swarm. This is like torrents and seeds. When data is requested, it is done in parallel
where chunks (shards) are requested from all the diﬀerent swarms that contain those shards, and
these are all retrieved in parallel, resul_ng in desirable performance metrics.

4.2. Reliability
Using the concept of fog or swarm compu_ng, Bluzelle follows a model where every unit of data
is 100% replicated in a single leaf swarm amongst a swarm of swarms. So while the data is only in
one swarm, that swarm’s nodes are aplenty and are geographically dispersed, immune to localized
outages caused by either natural or human-related events.

4.3. Scalability
Scalability is possible both horizontally or ver_cally. Bluzelle manages the various strategies and
considera_ons around the use case of having to increase scale. Horizontal scaling is a
cornerstone of the Bluzelle architecture, where every swarm is another “unit” of horizontal
scaling at the metaswarm level. Within every leaf swarm, every node acts as yet another agent of
horizontal scaling, at the leaf swarm level.

11

The following table outlines addi_onal features of Bluzelle.

FEATURE

DESCRIPTION

Highest privacy

Bluzelle employs cryptography and sharding techniques to provide a
privacy guarantee.

High reliability

Bluzelle redundantly stores tiny pieces of data on nodes across the
globe, eliminating any single point of failure.

Enterprise scalability

Bluzelle algorithms store data in a unique, distributed and intelligent
manner that will provide enterprise-level scalability.

Data immutability

Bluzelle leverages blockchain technology so that once data is stored to
such a network, it is impossible to change that data.

High performance speeds

Bluzelle dynamically adjusts the number and location of nodes sharding
the consumer’s data to meet performance metrics.

No intruders

Bluzelle’s use of consensus is the only method by which updates to the
network can be accepted as the “truth”.

Low cost

Bluzelle operates few data centers and has little capital costs. Vast
majority of computer resources are provided by participant producers.

12

5. HOW DOES BLUZELLE WORK?
Bluzelle takes blockchain principles and sharding & par22oning concepts to create an AirBnB
like marketplace for data storage and management. This is a crypto-economic network of
powerful producers and consumers.

5.1. Consumer
The consumer is the one who “consumes” the Bluzelle database services. These are the
developers we target. Consumers are spending Bluzelle tokens so they can store and retrieve
data. Addi_onally a user could get a credit of tokens if a producer failed to meet certain service
levels.

5.2. Producer
The producer is the one who provides resources to the network in return for earning Bluzelle
tokens (BLZ). Bluzelle producers will be required to put up a propor_onal stake of Bluzelle tokens,
in order to provide a guarantee on the service levels Bluzelle will provide. Bluzelle will encourage
compe__on by producers to provide higher quality services, where those with higher service
levels can charge more but also have to put up a higher stake.
Every par_cipa_ng consumer and producer of Bluzelle are ini_ally required to independently
create their own Ethereum account and take responsibility for securing and protec_ng their
private key. The private key is used to secure access to their ETH and Bluzelle tokens and encrypt
their data before it gets sent out over the Bluzelle network.

13

6. DAPP USES CASES FOR BLUZELLE
6.1. Predictions Markets
Decentralized predic_ons markets on Ethereum require the management and storage of massive
amounts of data to work. These include: (1) the ques_ons being asked, (2) the diﬀerent possible
outcomes, (3) the predic_ons being made, and (4) the sourced informa_on for the actual events.
A decentralized database can grow and scale as per the products needs. Having fast and reliable
access to data is important for the success of the predic2ons market to garner new customers
and par2cipa2on. Historical data stored on Bluzelle will add a new category of predic_ons that
can reduce human specula_on by using past events to make be6er predic_ons.

6.2. Currency Exchange Protocols
A key part of a currency exchange protocol is the presence of relayers, who enable makers and
takers to connect via oﬀ-chain order books. The underlying order-books must be fast, eﬃcient,
reliable, and easy to supply, by the relayers. A pain point is relayers are responsible to store these
order-books each in their own way. By using a decentralized database like Bluzelle, currency
exchange protocols can provide relayers with a standard, consistent, ubiquitous, database that
would be available with no eﬀort. This reduc_on in fric_on maximizes the service level and
quality as the network would now s_ll be powered by relayers.

6.3. Data Streaming Networks
Data streaming networks match up consumers of data points with producers of data points. For
example a car uses real-_me traﬃc data from the data streaming network. The car collects real_me data while it moves. It is both paying for data it "buys" and "earning" from data it "sells" to
the network. The data points need to be both readable and writable with high performance,
availability, scalability, and reliability. Bluzelle is ideal to provide the precise infrastructure needed
so that a data streaming network can store its data to meet these requirements.

14

7. MARKETING STRATEGY
7.1. Target Market
Bluzelle has three groups that it targets to become a mainstream product like Oracle Systems.
Bluzelle will start the ﬁrst with the ﬁrst group and then expand outwards.

Late Majority - enterprise sodware architects. The large enterprises who see how dApps
and other developers use Bluzelle and then have the valida_on to also move their data
storage needs to us.

15

7.2. Regional Focus
With it’s oﬃces in both Singapore and Vancouver, Bluzelle is in a unique posi_on to grow in two
of the biggest regions for dApps and the blockchain: US/Canada and Asia Paciﬁc.
From China to Korea to Japan to Southeast Asia, this region is home to a fast growing startup
blockchain community. These startups require eﬃcient and low-cost services. Many parts of
Southeast Asia are rapidly developing as major ci_es and high-growth economies. They are
leapfrogging legacy client-server architecture systems to innova_ve adap_ve and scalable
solu_ons built for the future.

“Asia Pacific is anticipated to aggressively adopt cloud database and DBaaS solutions in the near future.
This is basically due to the increasing focus by small, medium, and large scale enterprises for the
purpose of improving efficiency and productivity via investment in technology.” - TMR Research Cloud
Database and Database as a Service (DBaaS) Market, 2017-2025

Bluzelle has an R&D center in Vancouver, Canada. Being in Western Canada/US gives Bluzelle a
strategic posi_on to oﬀer it’s product to the growing blockchain and overall developer businesses
in Sea6le, Portland, San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Bluzelle’s founders, advisors, investors have
a history of working in Silicon Valley and have strong connec_ons to build support in the worlds
biggest technology center.
These regions are just to start. Bluzelle is a global product that meets the needs of developers
everywhere.

7.3. The Bluzelle Developer Community
The ﬁrst release of Bluzelle is planned for April 2018 and we have started building our developer
community. Servicing sotware developers has less fric_on as they can be engaged online and are
passionate about technologies that help them make be6er products quickly and easily. Early on,
we will get feedback on the product and build the ecosystem enabling both the producers and
consumers of Bluzelle.

16

We will have an online community site, go to hackathons, host meetup events, and much more.
As a tech company, Bluzelle’s employees have an organic network of peers, friends and
acquaintances who are the target market. As men_oned in the prior sec_on, Bluzelle will be
doing various developer reach outs to many of the biggest ci_es in Asia and US/Canada.

8. BLUZELLE’S ECOSYSTEM
The opportunity to get Bluzelle into the hands of consumers is tremendous. A key is to build a
healthy ecosystem where Bluzelle is integrated to many technologies; making it easy for
customers to ﬁnd Bluzelle.

8.1. Developer Marketplaces
Bluzelle aims to partner with leading sotware development ecosystems and establishing channel
partnerships that share revenue. Notable examples would include Heroku, AWS Elas_c
Beanstalk, Redhat OpenShit, Google App Engine, and Microsot Azure. With such integra_ons,
developers can quickly use Bluzelle’s decentralized database, just as eﬀortlessly as they can use
tradi_onal cloud database oﬀerings - simply point and click.

8.2. Developer Environments
Development environments such as Android Studio, Apple XCode, Microsot Xamarin and Visual
Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ, Unity3D, PhoneGap, and Ionic are targeted for plugins and integra_ons so
that dApp developers of both desktop and mobile apps can easily integrate Bluzelle whenever
they have database needs for their games, enterprise applica_ons, etc.

8.3. Blockchains
Blockchains play a large role in the Bluzelle ecosystem. Smart contract classes and instances are
planned to be deployed directly not just to Ethereum but other open blockchain protocols like
Hyperledger to enable dApp smart contracts to use Bluzelle for storage needs.

8.4. Operating Systems and Browser Tools
Opera_ng-system and browser tools further enhance the developer’s ability to access data,
whether it is from a GUI applica_on running on their desktop or a browser plugin that enables
them to quickly store and retrieve table data.

18

9. THE BLUZELLE TOKEN
Bluzelle is powered by two tokens:
•

Ethereum ERC-20 external token: BLZ
This externally-tradable token bridges the Bluzelle na_ve token (BNT) with Ethereum’s
own na_ve ETH token.

•

Bluzelle Network Token: BNT
An internal token to Bluzelle alone that enables the Bluzelle crypto-economy, where
consumers pay and producers earn.

The need for an internal token is because ERC-20 tokens are too slow and expensive for real_me database accoun_ng. The BLZ ERC-20 external token exists to represent on exchanges for
customers to easily obtain to use the Bluzelle service. The BNT internal na_ve token exists to
enable high-speed, zero-cost, and real-_me database accoun_ng. The BLZ and BNT tokens can
be interchanged via the Bluzelle token gateway. For the public sale, people will be purchasing
BLZ tokens.
When a new par_cipant to the network wishes to use its services as a consumer, they will need
to acquire BNT tokens. The standard method of doing so is as follows:
1. Buy BLZ tokens on a crypto-exchange using ETH, BTC or other forms the exchange
allows.
2. Send BLZ tokens to the Bluzelle Token Gateway’s smart contract via Ethereum. The
gateway will issue new BNT tokens to the user’s Bluzelle network wallet.
3. The user now has BNT tokens, and is free to par_cipate in the network as a consumer.

19

When a producer wishes to “withdraw” their BNT tokens, they use the following steps:
1. Send the BNT tokens to the special Bluzelle gateway.
2. The gateway converts the BNT tokens at a 1:1 ra_o to BLZ tokens, and sends these BLZ
tokens to the producer’s registered Ethereum wallet.
3. The producer now has the BLZ tokens, and is free to transact with them on the Ethereum
network.

10. REVENUE MODEL
The BLZ <=> BNT gateway proposes a micro-transac_on fee for every conversion going through
the gateway in either direc_on. The fee is charged in BLZ tokens and is sent to a special
Ethereum wallet owned by Bluzelle.

The model is setup so the en_re ecosystem remains

completely decentralized while s_ll providing a revenue for Bluzelle to improve and innovate the
network and its associated services.
Following are two typical scenarios:
•

A user needs BNT tokens to use the service.
1. The user sends 100 BLZ to the BLZ smart contract.
2. 0.1 BLZ is subtracted from the total of 100 BLZ and is sent to the Bluzelle
Ethereum wallet as a non-refundable fee.
3. The remaining 99.9 BLZ is converted to BNT and credited to the user’s BNT
Bluzelle na_ve wallet.

•

A user wishes to convert BNT to BLZ.
1. The user sends BNT tokens to the BNT gateway.
2. The BNT tokens are converted at a BLZ 1:1 rate, resul_ng in a conversion amount
of 100 BLZ. 0.1 BLZ are subtracted from the total of 100 BLZ and is sent to the
Bluzelle Ethereum wallet as a non-refundable fee.
3. The remaining 99.9 BLZ is released out of custody by the Ethereum smart
contract and sent to the correct par_cipant’ s Ethereum wallet.

Absolute prices are calculated dynamically and are not 100% determinis_c. Maximums are baked
into Bluzelle, where the network adjusts the number of swarms and distribu_on of nodes as
prices start to approach the maximums, ge|ng increasingly aggressive with network adjustments
as the maximums draw nearer, un_l expected average prices start to trend again.

21

11. TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW
This sec=on provides an overview of Bluzelle’s technology architecture. For a more in-depth reading
with more details refer to the Technology Paper.

11.1. Database 101 - CRUD API
CRUD stands for “create, read, update, and delete” for the four basic func_ons pertaining to
databases and permanent storage. CRUD covers the func_onality of rela_onal databases, where
each of create, read, update, and delete can be mapped to corresponding SQL and HTTP
methods.
A password of the user’s own choosing is also required, and it is up to the user to protect this
password and keep it available for later. All the data stored in key value pairs are encrypted, with
the password being used as the ini_aliza_on vector in AES 256 symmetric key encryp_on. This
password is only ever used locally and never travels on the network in any way, shape, or form.

11.2. Sharding
Shard stands for “System for Highly Available Replicated Data”. Large databases oten are hard to
work with due to the size and memory constraints they come with. By par__oning the database
along logical lines, the database becomes much easier to work with.
A logical shard is the smallest unit in Bluzelle and contains individual units of data that all share
the same par__on key. A par__on key is a unique iden_ﬁer that allows the shard to be accessed
for the retrieval of informa_on. In Bluzelle, par__on keys allow the dApp to store and retrieve
data from the correctly iden_ﬁed leaf swarm eﬃciently. In Bluzelle, groups of logical shards are
stored on leaf swarms, and it is the amalgama_on of these leaf swarms that makes up the
en_rety of the Bluzelle database.

22

11.3. Jump Consistent Hashing
Jump consistent hashing (JCH) was ﬁrst described in a white paper by John Lamping and Eric
Veach at Google. It is an elegant algorithm that only takes about 5 lines of code in a language like
C++. JCH does not have a state machine, and therefore requires no storage. It is an algorithm
without lookups in memory and is therefore much faster.
Bluzelle uses JCH to map from the key (in key value pairs in a NoSQL table) to the id of the
swarm that the key is replicated in. Once that id is found, Bluzelle uses Kademlia hashing to ﬁnd
the means to reach that swarm even if that speciﬁc swarm is not running.

11.4. Kademlia Hashing
Kademlia is an advanced form of a typical peer-to-peer distributed hash table which has been
structured in a way to make par_cular use of the special symmetric and geometric proper_es of
the bitwise XOR func_on. Bluzelle uses Kademlia hashing to eﬃciently enable nodes to know
about every other swarm on the network. Using Kademlia’s own form of “ﬁnger tables”, each
node in the network only needs to know informa_on about how to reach O(log(n)) other leaf
swarms, where n is the total number of leaf swarms on the network. This means that irrespec_ve
of how large the network ever becomes, every node can reach every other leaf swarm within
O(log(n)) tries, by only storing O(log(n)) data. As a result, Bluzelle is able to handle exponen_al
growth.

11.5. Partial Replication
Par_al replica_on means that not every node in the network has a copy of the data -- only the
nodes within the leaf swarm delegated to that data replicate it. This is one of the key diﬀerences
between Bluzelle and a tradi_onal “blockchain”. Blockchains are inherently slow and do not scale
well, as every set of transac_ons or blocks is 100% replicated everywhere, pu|ng severe ver_cal
scaling limita_ons on the network. Bluzelle by design only stores the data amongst a strategic
subset of the nodes, sta_s_cally providing an guarantee that the data is always available and s_ll
achieving the beneﬁts of boundless horizontal scaling. Par_al replica_on exists because only ONE

23

swarm amongst all the swarms in the network replicates a given piece of data. An interes_ng
incumbent technology that can be compared to this is the content delivery network (CDN).

11.6. Load Balancing
A beneﬁt of having a logical shard stored on mul_ple physical nodes is speed - by having the
same data accessible through diﬀerent hardware resources at various geographical loca_ons, the
system may load-balance queries to retrieve data from nearby nodes that are least taxed at any
given moment in _me. This permits Bluzelle to dynamically perform queries and retrieve data in
the most eﬃcient way possible, maximizing use of the shared resources spanning across mul_ple
nodes.

11.7. Redundancy
As replicated data is stored across diﬀerent nodes with unique infrastructure, there is a severely
reduced causa_on between single-node failure and loss of the shard. This method of mirroring
serves to secure the availability of data in an eﬃcient manner by ensuring any single point of
failure is inconsequen_al.

11.8. Consensus
Bluzelle deals with consensus diﬀerently from blockchains, doing away with any concept of a
network-wide universal state. There is no need for a single state for the whole network, so
Bluzelle applies the consensus model on a swarming level, ensuring that leaf swarms of nodes
storing data shards are each reaching localized consensus, using our customized forms of
consensus and proof algorithms .
A swarm with consensus appears to clients interac_ng with that swarm (or other swarms
interac_ng with the swarm) as a single, atomic, indivisible unit that stores a set of data reliably.
Any node in that leaf swarm can accurately service requests pertaining to that data.

24

11.9. Karma
Every producer on Bluzelle is en_tled to run one or more nodes on the network as farming
nodes. Each such producer will use their Ethereum address as the “key” that iden_ﬁes them. This
iden_ﬁer is unique to that farmer and is _ed 1:1 with their Ethereum address. The producer also
has a “Karma Index”, which is a score that dictates how well-behaved the producer is. The karmic
index can go up and down depending on the producer’s ac_vi_es and decisions, inten_onal or
not, autonomous or not, and spans all the nodes the producer operates. If one such node
misbehaves, the karmic index typically drops and this applies to all the producer’s nodes.
Furthermore, the farmer is required to put up a stake (in BNT tokens) that is propor_onal to the
number of nodes and inversely propor_onal to the karmic index.

11.10. Sybil Attacks
Some blockchain networks, like Bitcoin, allow anyone to add their node to the network. That
brings the concern that a malicious organiza_on could poten_ally add so many nodes that they
dispropor_onately control the network and leading to hijacking the network. This is referred to as
a Sybil a6ack. Bitcoin and Ethereum obviate Sybil a6acks by making them prohibi_vely expensive
via proof of work. I
Bluzelle employs several methods to prevent Sybil a6acks so that when a bad actor is caught,
they can be blacklisted, and economically penalized leading to complete removal from the
network. These an_-Sybil a6ack methods are:
• Producers are required to put up a BNT stake to par_cipate in the network. This stake serves as
a requirement for par_cipa_on and as a strong economic deterrent from bad behaviour.
• The Kademlia distributed hash table is used as it relies on message redundancy and the XOR
distance func_on. Neighbours are selected and messages are redundantly sent to mul_ple
neighbors of the intended node for an_-Sybil veriﬁca_on purposes. Nodes that mislead the
swarm loca_on eﬀort will be systema_cally tracked down and caught.

25

• A request to a swarm for CRUD func_onality is done with redundancy, where mul_ple nodes in
the same swarm all perform the request. Given the node->swarm membership rules for
Bluzelle, it is sta_s_cally unlikely that mul_ple such nodes chosen to perform a given
transac_on are colluding bad actors that deliver bad yet consistent data.
• Swarm membership is determined by the network and cannot be chosen by nodes. This means
that a would-be Sybil a6acker who a6empts to join the network with n nodes or masquerading
with the iden_ty of n nodes will not be able to gain a cri_cal mass of memberships into any
single swarm.
• Nodes can be posed a challenge request to par_cipate in a proof of storage test. This test is
performed in coopera_on with the consumer on either a random network-ini_ated basis or by
the consumer directly and forces the targeted node to prove they have the correct data.

11.11. Byzantine General’s Fault
One way to protect against Byzan_ne Faults is to have a default understanding of what to do if
there is no informa_on. In Bluzelle, if misleading or corrupted or inconsistent informa_on is
detected, the default is to do nothing. Thanks to the aforemen_oned redundancy in CRUD
requests made to a swarm, inconsistency is caught, whether inten_onal or not. In any case,
Bluzelle nodes are instructed to ignore the transac_on and do nothing. Only authen_cated
transac_ons with proper creden_als and checksums are accepted and transacted upon. By this
way, Bluzelle is Byzan_ne Fault Tolerant by design.

RISK DISCLOSURES
Please carefully read and evaluate the risks that Bluzelle PlaTorm describes below.
The realisa2on of any one or more of the risks described in this White Paper, or other risks
whether unforeseen or unforeseeable, could signiﬁcantly reduce or eliminate the u2lity or value
of BLZ and a par2cipant (each, a “Par2cipant”) in the proposed sale of BLZ (the “Token Sale”)
could lose their en2re amount paid for BLZ. Bluzelle Plaporm does not represent that this
White Paper discloses all risks and other signiﬁcant aspects of the Token Sale, including risks
which may be personal to proposed Par2cipants and thus unknown to Bluzelle Plaporm.
Proposed Par2cipants who do not fully understand or are not comfortable with any of the risks
described in this White Paper should consult their legal, commercial, ﬁnancial, tax, or other
professional advisers; otherwise, they should not par2cipate in the Token Sale.
To the maximum extent permiqed by all applicable laws and regula2ons, Bluzelle Plaporm and
its aﬃliates and its and their founders, directors, oﬃcers, employees, advisers, agents, and
representa2ves (the “Bluzelle Related Par2es”) shall not be liable for any direct or indirect loss of
revenue, income, proﬁts, business, business opportunity, an2cipated saving, data, reputa2on, or
goodwill; or any indirect, special, incidental, reliance, consequen2al, puni2ve, or other losses or
damages of any kind, in tort, contract, strict liability, or otherwise, arising out of or in connec2on
with any loss or damage of a Par2cipant (or a proposed Par2cipant) rela2ng to the risks
associated with the Token Sale or in connec2on with erroneous or insuﬃcient consulta2on with
or advice received from any adviser, even if Bluzelle Plaporm and the Bluzelle Related Par2es
have been advised of the possibility of such losses or damages.
References to ‘Bluzelle PlaTorm’ in the risk factors discussed in this sec_on include, where the
context permits or requires, any Bluzelle Related Party involved in the opera_on of Bluzelle or the
conduct of the Token Sale. References to “discre_on” mean “sole and absolute discre_on”, unless
otherwise qualiﬁed.

32

Company Risks
Company Failure. As a consequence of the realisa_on of one or more of the other risks in this
White Paper or of risks not described in this White Paper, Bluzelle PlaTorm’s business could fail
and Bluzelle PlaTorm could be wound up or dissolved. If Bluzelle PlaTorm’s business fails and
Bluzelle or the sotware plaTorm on which it operates (the “Applica2on”) is not transferred to
and operated by another company, Bluzelle would terminate and any BLZ would have no u_lity or
value. Bluzelle PlaTorm does not commit that it can or will transfer the Applica_on or Bluzelle to
another company if its business fails. If Bluzelle PlaTorm does transfer the Applica_on or Bluzelle
to another company, Bluzelle PlaTorm does not commit that the other company will operate
Bluzelle to a Par_cipant’s sa_sfac_on or at all, or will con_nue to accept BLZ for use in Bluzelle.
Management Failures. Bluzelle PlaTorm’s management may fail to manage its personnel,
ﬁnances, facili_es, informa_on, technology, and other resources to eﬀec_vely develop, operate,
maintain, support, improve, market, and sell the Applica_on and Bluzelle, or to manage the
growth of Bluzelle or its business, or to adapt the Applica_on or its business to changes in
technology or the markets in which it operates, or to iden_fy and eﬀec_vely respond to the risks
described in this White Paper or otherwise, the realisa_on of any or all of which could adversely
aﬀect Bluzelle.
No Governance Rights. BLZ confer no governance or similar rights with respect to Bluzelle
PlaTorm, the Applica_on, or Bluzelle. Bluzelle PlaTorm will, at its discre_on, make all decisions
concerning its business, the Applica_on, and Bluzelle, including decisions to fork or discon_nue
Bluzelle; to change any pricing, parameter, or feature of Bluzelle; to subcontract or outsource the
development, maintenance, support, and opera_on of the Applica_on; to sell the Applica_on; and
to sell, merge, or liquidate Bluzelle PlaTorm or all or a material part of Bluzelle PlaTorm’s assets,
any of which decisions may not be consistent with a Par_cipant’s expecta_ons or interests.
Business Model Risks. Bluzelle PlaTorm designed Bluzelle (including the Applica_on and BLZ)
according to a speciﬁc business model. In par_cular, the adop_on and success of Bluzelle
depends on several factors, including:
• Bluzelle PlaTorm’s ability to hire top engineers to develop the Applica_on and Bluzelle;
• the number of users providing resources to support the func_ons of Bluzelle;

33

• the availability of BLZ to Bluzelle users ater the Token Sale; and
• the number of users perceiving BLZ to be valuable and thus willing to use Bluzelle as
either providers of resources or consumers of Bluzelle.
If the business model of Bluzelle is ﬂawed, or if the assump_ons underlying that business model
are incorrect, Bluzelle may underperform or fail. Bluzelle PlaTorm may at its discre_on elect to
change the business model of Bluzelle in response to compe__on or market requirements, to
address perceived ﬂaws, to op_mise the model, or otherwise. Any such changes to the business
model of Bluzelle may fail to achieve their purpose and could adversely aﬀect Bluzelle.
Insuﬃcient Funding. Bluzelle PlaTorm will depend on the proceeds of the Token Sale to fund its
opera_ons un_l such _me, if ever, that Bluzelle PlaTorm earns suﬃcient revenue from Bluzelle or
other ac_vi_es. The proceeds of the Token Sale are cryptocurrencies that may increase or
decrease in value. Bluzelle PlaTorm may, at its discre_on, engage in hedging or similar ac_vi_es
to manage the risk of cryptocurrency ﬂuctua_ons, but those ac_vi_es may not be suﬃcient, may
fail, or may worsen the consequences of those ﬂuctua_ons. In addi_on, the cryptocurrencies held
by Bluzelle PlaTorm may not be conver_ble to ﬁat currencies or other cryptocurrencies at rates
Bluzelle PlaTorm considers favourable or at all. The cryptocurrencies held by Bluzelle PlaTorm
are also subject to loss or thet despite security precau_ons taken by Bluzelle PlaTorm. If for any
reason Bluzelle PlaTorm’s funds are not suﬃcient to sustain its opera_ons, Bluzelle PlaTorm may
have to reduce or suspend its opera_ons, which would adversely aﬀect Bluzelle PlaTorm’s ability
to develop and operate PlaTorm at the intended level or at all.
Unan2cipated Risks. Bluzelle will be launched and will evolve in technology, business, economic,
and legal environments that are uncertain and subject to rapid, unpredictable, and poten_ally
contradictory evolu_on. The future risks associated with those environments, their respec_ve
evolu_ons, and the interac_ons among them are unknown and unknowable but they could
threaten the viability or existence of Bluzelle.

34

Product Risks
Delay. Bluzelle PlaTorm may not develop and deploy the Applica_on according to its intended
schedule. Delays in deploying the Applica_on may adversely aﬀect the acceptance of Bluzelle in
the market and ul_mately the viability of Bluzelle.
Inability to Use BLZ. Holders of BLZ will not be able to use them with Bluzelle un_l Bluzelle
PlaTorm makes it them available (“Launch”). Launch may be delayed, or may not occur at all. Even
ater Launch, the availability of certain services will be limited.
Failure to Develop and Support the Service. As a consequence of the realisa_on of one or more
of the other risks in this White Paper or of risks not described in this White Paper, or because of
business or technical decisions taken by Bluzelle PlaTorm in good faith, Bluzelle PlaTorm may fail
to launch Bluzelle with a full set of intended features and func_ons or at all, may discon_nue
certain features and func_ons of Bluzelle, may not improve or add to the features and func_ons
of Bluzelle over _me, may not adequately support Bluzelle, and may not ﬁx bugs in Bluzelle in a
_mely way or at all. Bluzelle (including BLZ) may therefore not have the u_lity described in this
White Paper or expected by a Par_cipant.
Service Issues. Bluzelle may be degraded, interrupted, or fail because of hardware, sotware, or
network defects, security breaches, hacking, viruses or other malicious code, natural disasters,
conges_on in underlying networks, and other causes. Bluzelle PlaTorm may be unable to restore
Bluzelle to normal opera_on in a _mely way or at all.
Service Updates. Bluzelle PlaTorm may not update Bluzelle in a _mely way or at all to ﬁx bugs,
address incompa_bili_es arising because of changes in underlying technologies and services,
respond to user feedback, or react to compe__ve threats. Any such delays or failures could
adversely aﬀect Bluzelle.
Failure to Meet Expecta2ons. The ini_al and future versions of Bluzelle may not meet a
Par_cipant’s expecta_ons regarding features, func_ons, performance, availability, quality,
security, scale, price, or other a6ributes that are important to a Par_cipant.

35

Reliance on Third Par2es and Third Party Systems. Bluzelle PlaTorm relies on third par_es and
third party systems it does not control to operate the Applica_on and Bluzelle and to provide
services on which Bluzelle depends. Those third par_es and third party systems may be unable
or unwilling to act as Bluzelle PlaTorm needs and expects, may themselves act maliciously, or
may be adversely aﬀected by other par_es ac_ng inten_onally, uninten_onally, or maliciously or
by other events outside their control. The failure of those third par_es or third party systems to
perform according to Bluzelle PlaTorm’s needs and expecta_ons could adversely aﬀect Bluzelle.
Privacy Risks. Bluzelle will rely in part on Ethereum and other public, decentralised plaTorms.
Anyone with Internet access can inspect all transac_ons and other informa_on stored in those
plaTorms that is not encrypted. A Par_cipant’s transac_ons involving BLZ, and other informa_on
about a Par_cipant or that belongs to a Par_cipant that may be processed by or stored in those
plaTorms in connec_on with a Par_cipant’s use of Bluzelle, may be inspected by the public.
Certain informa_on may, even if encrypted, be associated with a Par_cipant by combining it with
other public or non-public informa_on.

Technology Risks
Core Technology Risks. Bluzelle is built with core technologies that are in some cases immature
and unproven, including the Ethereum blockchain plaTorm and various open source sotware
applica_ons and libraries. If those core technologies do not perform according to Bluzelle
PlaTorm’s needs or expecta_ons, have bugs or security vulnerabili_es that are not or cannot be
ﬁxed, become unstable, degraded, or unavailable, are changed or forked in a way that is
incompa_ble with Bluzelle, or are not further developed or supported, Bluzelle PlaTorm may be
required to change the speciﬁca_ons of Bluzelle and to reduce or eliminate features and
func_ons that are important to Par_cipants, or to discon_nue Bluzelle.
Integra2on Risks. Bluzelle will be integrated using some essen_al third party services. If the
integra_ons with those services fail, or those services are unreliable or do not perform as
expected, those features within Bluzelle, or Bluzelle generally, may be adversely aﬀected or
delayed.

36

Smart Contract Risks. Certain key features of Bluzelle will be implemented in smart contracts on
the Applica_on and on the Ethereum blockchain plaTorm. The nature of smart contracts makes
them diﬃcult to change to ﬁx bugs, improve performance, or add features and func_ons. Bluzelle
PlaTorm may therefore not correct defects in Bluzelle or improve Bluzelle to meet market needs
or respond to compe__on fast enough or at all, which could adversely aﬀect the u_lity or viability
of Bluzelle.
Hacking. All sotware systems, including the Applica_on and the Ethereum blockchain plaTorm,
have security vulnerabili_es. Malicious actors may (a) disrupt, corrupt, or interfere with the
Applica_on, Bluzelle, or the Ethereum blockchain plaTorm, (b) defraud Bluzelle PlaTorm or other
stakeholders in Bluzelle, including Par_cipants or BLZ holders, and (c) steal BLZ or other valuable
data stored in the Applica_on, Bluzelle, or the Ethereum blockchain plaTorm, some of which may
belong to or involve Par_cipants or BLZ holders.
Mining Aqacks. Certain features of Bluzelle depend on the Ethereum blockchain plaTorm.
Ethereum is a decentralised service comprising a global peer-to-peer network of many
independent node operators. Coordina_on or collusion among node operators could subject
Bluzelle and its stakeholders, including Par_cipants or BLZ holders, to a variety of a6acks that
could compromise the integrity of Bluzelle, cause loss, thet, or corrup_on of BLZ and other
valuable data stored in Bluzelle, including Par_cipants or BLZ holders, or increase the cost of
using the plaTorm to levels that make opera_on of Bluzelle uneconomic and unsustainable.
Security Risks. The security and integrity of essen_al components of Bluzelle depend on
cryptography. Known and currently unknown weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms used in
Bluzelle and its underlying core technologies, and advances in techniques or compu_ng power to
circumvent those algorithms, may compromise the security and integrity of Bluzelle, cause the
loss, thet, or corrup_on of BLZ and other valuable data stored in Bluzelle, including Par_cipants
or BLZ holders, and require the suspension or discon_nua_on of Bluzelle. The existence or future
development of stronger cryptographic algorithms to replace compromised algorithms, and the
feasibility of implemen_ng those stronger algorithms in Bluzelle and its underlying core
technologies, is uncertain.

37

Prohibi2vely High Transac2on Costs.

All transac_ons on the Ethereum blockchain plaTorm,

including the transfer of BLZ, have a cost in Ether (“Gas”). As at the date of this White Paper, Gas
prices for basic transac_ons on the Ethereum blockchain plaTorm are nominal. However, Gas
prices may increase and make the trading of BLZ on the Ethereum blockchain plaTorm
commercially unfeasible.
Ethereum May be Superseded. In Bluzelle PlaTorm’s view, the Ethereum blockchain plaTorm is
the op_mum blockchain plaTorm from which to issue BLZ. However, the Ethereum blockchain
plaTorm may be superseded by compe_ng blockchain plaTorms that improve on the Ethereum
technology. It is not known whether the Ethereum blockchain plaTorm will remain the
predominant plaTorm for token issuances. If Ethereum is superseded, BLZ could be adversely
aﬀected as usage and adop_on declines.

Regulatory Risks
Regulatory Status. The regulatory status of the Applica_on, Bluzelle, BLZ, and the Token Sale is
unclear or unse6led in many jurisdic_ons. Regulators in many jurisdic_ons have announced their
inten_on to consider the adop_on of regula_ons to cover cryptographic tokens and the markets
for them. It is not known if, when, or to what degree diﬀerent jurisdic_ons will interpret exis_ng
laws and regula_ons or adopt new laws and regula_ons that could adversely aﬀect the
Applica_on, Bluzelle, BLZ, and the Token Sale, or whether those laws or regula_ons would be
applied retroac_vely. Adverse laws or regula_ons and/or the ﬁnancial and other costs of
regula_on could cause Bluzelle PlaTorm to modify or discon_nue certain features or func_ons of
Bluzelle, or cause Bluzelle PlaTorm to discon_nue the Applica_on or Bluzelle in certain
jurisdic_ons or en_rely, or make dealing in BLZ regulated or illegal in certain jurisdic_ons.
Excluded Jurisdic2ons. The Token Sale will only be open to Par_cipants of jurisdic_ons where the
Token Sale (or similar cryptographic token oﬀerings) is not prohibited or otherwise restricted. It is
a Par_cipant’s sole responsibility to determine if they are prohibited or restricted from
par_cipa_ng in the Token Sale, or if such par_cipa_on cons_tutes a breach of the laws or
regula_ons of their jurisdic_on, whether by virtue of their ci_zenship, residency, or other
associa_on with a jurisdic_on which prohibits or otherwise restricts the conduct of the Token

38

Sale (or similar cryptographic token oﬀerings). Viola_on of those prohibi_ons or restric_ons may
result in criminal and/or administra_ve penal_es being imposed on the breaching Par_cipants.
Compliance Risks. Complying with laws and regula_ons that apply to Bluzelle PlaTorm, the
Applica_on and/or Bluzelle may be costly and may divert a signiﬁcant por_on of Bluzelle
PlaTorm’s a6en_on and resources. If Bluzelle PlaTorm must have a licence or other government
registra_on or approval to operate the Applica_on or Bluzelle in a jurisdic_on, there is no
guarantee that Bluzelle PlaTorm will qualify for or be granted the necessary licence, registra_on,
or approval. The lack of the necessary licence, registra_on or approval would restrict or prevent
Bluzelle PlaTorm from opera_ng Bluzelle in that jurisdic_on. If Bluzelle PlaTorm fails to comply
with applicable laws or regula_ons, Bluzelle PlaTorm could be subject to signiﬁcant legal liability
and ﬁnancial and reputa_onal losses which may adversely aﬀect the Applica_on, Bluzelle, and/or
BLZ.
Tax. The tax status of the Applica_on, Bluzelle, BLZ, and the Token Sale is unclear or unse6led in
many jurisdic_ons. Adverse interpreta_on of exis_ng tax laws and regula_ons or adop_on of new
adverse tax laws and regula_ons could result in unan_cipated and poten_ally retroac_ve tax
liability for Bluzelle PlaTorm and other stakeholders in Bluzelle, including Par_cipants and BLZ
holders. Those adverse tax consequences could cause Bluzelle PlaTorm to modify or discon_nue
certain features or func_ons of Bluzelle or increase prices for Bluzelle, or cause Bluzelle PlaTorm
to make the Applica_on or Bluzelle unavailable in certain jurisdic_ons, or make dealing in BLZ
subject to tax in certain jurisdic_ons.

Market Risks
Lack of Market Penetra2on. Bluzelle may not a6ract users and/or third par_es providing services
to Bluzelle at the intended level or at a level suﬃcient to become or remain useful or viable. Any
such lack of use or interest could nega_vely aﬀect the development of Bluzelle and/or the u_lity
or value of Bluzelle and/or BLZ.
Compe22on. Other organisa_ons may develop (a) services that compete with Bluzelle, and may
do so with some or all of the open source sotware underlying Bluzelle or (b) cryptographic
tokens that can be used in blockchain plaTorm-based database services similar to Bluzelle. Those

39

compe_ng services and cryptographic tokens may adversely aﬀect the adop_on and use of
Bluzelle and/or the adop_on, u_lity, and/or value of BLZ, and ul_mately the viability and
con_nued existence of Bluzelle and/or BLZ. It is unknown whether or to what extent, if any,
those compe_ng services and cryptographic tokens may be interoperable with Bluzelle or may
accept BLZ.
Secondary Markets for BLZ. As at the date of this White Paper, there is no public market for BLZ.
Virtual currency exchanges and other secondary markets for BLZ may never exist. Even if BLZ are
listed or traded on a secondary market, there is no assurance that an ac_ve or liquid trading
market for BLZ will develop or, if developed, will be sustained. Unless Bluzelle PlaTorm publicly
states otherwise, Bluzelle PlaTorm has no ﬁnancial or other rela_onship with, and does not
endorse, any such exchange or secondary market that elects to transact in BLZ. Exchanges and
secondary markets may be new, under-capitalised, illiquid, vola_le, operated by persons with
minimal or no relevant experience, and subject to minimal or no regulatory oversight, making use
of them suscep_ble to a variety of market, ﬁnancial, fraud, and other risks that could result in
Par_cipants’ or BLZ holders’ loss of BLZ or other losses.
Price Vola2lity. The price of BLZ in the Token Sale may not be indica_ve of the price of BLZ on
public markets. BLZ have no intrinsic value at the _me they are created. The price of BLZ on
public markets may be extremely vola_le, may decline below the price a Par_cipant will pay for
BLZ, or may diminish to zero in response to various factors, some of which are outside Bluzelle
PlaTorm’s control, including, among others, the following:
(a)

the vola_lity of the prices of cryptographic tokens generally and in response to events

that have li6le or nothing to do with Bluzelle PlaTorm;
(b)

general economic condi_ons and macroeconomic changes;

(c)

changes and innova_ons in blockchain technology, the industry sectors in which Bluzelle

PlaTorm operates, and other technologies and markets;

40

(d)

Bluzelle PlaTorm’s announcements pertaining to strategic direc_on, key personnel,

ﬁnancial and opera_onal results, partnerships, signiﬁcant transac_ons, new products, and other
events;
(e)

ac_vi_es and announcements of Bluzelle PlaTorm’s compe_tors; and

(f)

third-party reports, recommenda_ons, and statements regarding BLZ, the Applica_on,

Bluzelle, or Bluzelle PlaTorm.
Risk of Dilu2on. Bluzelle PlaTorm will create and distribute BLZ other than via the Token Sale, as
described in pages 31 and 32 of this White Paper. In many cases those other BLZ will be
distributed for less considera_on per BLZ than a Par_cipant will pay for BLZ in the Token Sale.
The distribu_on of those other BLZ will increase the overall supply of BLZ in the market, and may
aﬀect as well as result in downward pressure on the market price of BLZ. In addi_on, Bluzelle
PlaTorm reserves the right to create and distribute new BLZ in one or more other token sales.
Market Percep2on. The market price of BLZ could be adversely aﬀected by nega_ve publicity,
social media commentary, rumours, and other informa_on, whether or not true, about Bluzelle
PlaTorm, the Applica_on, Bluzelle, BLZ, the technology on which Bluzelle is based (including
Ethereum), and/or the legal or regulatory environment in which the Applica_on or Bluzelle
operates.
General Economic and Market Risks. Adverse changes in general global and regional economic
and market condi_ons may adversely aﬀect Bluzelle PlaTorm, the suppliers and third par_es on
which Bluzelle PlaTorm depends, and users and prospec_ve users of Bluzelle, all of which may
adversely aﬀect the availability, reliability, performance, adop_on, and the success of Bluzelle.

Participant Risks
Private Key Risks. Each Par_cipant, not Bluzelle PlaTorm, is responsible for securing the private
key that controls their BLZ. If a Par_cipant does not know their private key, they will permanently
lose their BLZ. If their private key is lost or stolen, they could permanently lose their BLZ. If they
store their private key with a third party wallet or vault service, they will permanently lose their

41

BLZ if they forget and are unable to recover their creden_als to access the third party service, or
if the third party service malfunc_ons, is corrupted or compromised, makes their creden_als or
private key available to others, ceases opera_ons, is hacked, or otherwise cannot make their
private key available to them or loses control of their private key.
Token Sale Process Risks. The process for par_cipa_ng in the Token Sale will be described in the
terms and condi_ons applicable to the Token Sale (“Token Sale Terms”) which Bluzelle PlaTorm
will make available separately from this White Paper. If a Par_cipant does not carefully follow
that process, they may not be able to par_cipate in the Token Sale or purchase BLZ, they may
permanently lose the funds which they intend to submit as payment for BLZ, or they may
permanently lose BLZ which they have purchased. The digital wallet to which payment for BLZ
will be made (“Payment Address”), like all sotware systems, has security vulnerabili_es. Malicious
actors may a6empt to steal funds from the Payment Address, including by hacking it. Funds in
the Payment Address are also subject to loss or thet by other means. Each Par_cipant accepts all
risk of loss or thet of their payments from the Payment Address.
Incompa2ble Wallet. The technical requirements for receiving BLZ will be described in the Token
Sale Terms. If a Par_cipant uses a wallet or other technology that does not conform to those
technical requirements, or if they use a third party service whose wallet or other technology does
not conform to those technical requirements, their BLZ may be permanently lost.
Uninsured Losses. BLZ are not insured by Bluzelle PlaTorm or by any public agency, and there is
no ins_tu_on supervising and controlling the economy for cryptographic tokens. If a Par_cipant’s
or BLZ holder’s BLZ are lost or stolen, they will have no recourse unless they insure them at their
expense. Bluzelle PlaTorm cannot issue new or subs_tute BLZ to replace lost or stolen BLZ.
