The new economy
of app development
Build apps or autonomous workﬂows
with reusable, shareable integrations
connecting any service, app, blockchain
or decentralized network.

Our vision
The MESG Foundation was built to promote and support blockchain technology by improving
its accessibility and use in the real world. We aim to become the ﬁrst universal infrastructure
to bridge legacy companies moving into a trustless landscape.

MESG SDK

MESG Marketplace

MESG Token

A suite of tools that help optimize
development hours by eﬀortlessly
connecting services with other
devices and apps.

A decentralized marketplace of
modular app components for
developers looking to save time
while building apps.

Buy and sell access to application
components in the new economy
of app development.

Control the ﬂow of data and level
of security between your whole
stack of technologies.

Developers can also earn royalties
in the Marketplace when their
components are reused by others.

The MESG Token will soon expand
to power and secure an entire
network of decentralized app
executions.

Revenue Model
MESG oﬀers a suite of support
services for enterprise clients,
including architecture advisory,
engineering support and
custom-built solutions.
MESG Tokens sold by the
Foundation can be exchanged for
the use of application components.
Soon, all users will need to stake
tokens to run/host apps and to
earn tokens on the network.
Staking tokens removes them from
circulation, resulting in increased
scarcity.
