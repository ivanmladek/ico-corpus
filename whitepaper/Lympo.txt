ABSTRACT
The usage of mobile health (mHealth) apps and wearables is ever-growing. More than 52% of
smart phone users gather health-related information on their phone. In 2016 alone, mHealth
app store downloads totalled 3.2 billion. Health-related data is a
precious asset for both individuals and stakeholders in the data-driven sports, health and
wellness industry.
However, the users generating this data cannot aggregate, share and monetize it.
Moreover, because it lacks the means to interconnect existing data, the industry cannot unlock
its full potential for the benefit of all market players. The rise of mHealth applications has not
yet delivered on the promise of digital technology empowering individuals and resulting in
better health care and a more connected sports and
wellness market.
The Lympo ecosystem resolves this problem. Powered by user-generated and
user-controlled fitness and wellness data, Lympo will allow the exchange of value through the
introduction LYM utility tokens. Lympo’s goal is an ecosystem where data is used efficiently by
all industry stakeholders and everyone is rewarded fairly. It
consists of three pillars: the Lympo fitness wallet, a marketplace and the Lympo crowdfunding
platform.
The Lympo digital fitness wallet and user reward mechanism is at the core of the Lympo
ecosystem. The wallet functions as an entry to the ecosystem and allows users to be rewarded
in LYM tokens for their healthy lifestyle achievements.
These tokens can be used to purchase goods and services in a marketplace starting from an
existing Lympo platform uniting more than 500 fitness professionals and later expanding to a
broad network of sports, wellness and health goods and services
providers. Finally, LYM tokens will be used on the Lympo crowdfunding platform to invest in
innovative data driven companies in the industry which will contribute to the growth of this
new ecosystem.

CHALLENGES OF THE MOBILE HEALTH DATA
INDUSTRY
The digital health market is exploding both in number of new companies and with the expected
market size of $233.3 billion by 2020. Much of growth is predicted to come from the mobile
health (mHealth) market. In 2016 alone, the estimated total number of mHealth apps increased
57%2. In that same year, the number mHealth app store downloads totalled 3.2 billion, with 52%
of smartphone users gathering health-related information on their phone3. Most newer phones
have inbuilt health-related data gathering capacities predicating this number to soar in the
upcoming years.
What data are we gathering? Over the years, the fastest-growing mHealth sector was the
fitness and wellness domain with a projected compound annual growth (CAGR) of 48.1%4 . 65%
of all mHealth apps in the U.S. connect to wellness services, among which fitness has a strong
leadership position with 36% of the total apps. Top categories also include weight loss, exercise,
women’s health, sleep and meditation.

At the same time, since 2005 the sports & wellness market has almost doubled from 46 to over
90 billion US dollars. All key market players in this industry: from personal trainers, gyms, sports
apparel and healthy food producers to health insurers and companies aiming to incentivize a
healthy lifestyle among their employees, could benefit from cross-platform fitness and wellness
data exchange. Nevertheless, the data which users track every day remains confined by a single

provider or a small network of partners at best, and said user has very limited ways to share it.
Notwithstanding, the growing market and the extensive use of mHealth apps have not yet
deliver on the promise of digital technology that empowers individuals and results in better
health care and a more connected sports and wellness market. The crucial shortages: 1. We are
not the owners of the quantified self; 2. mHealth apps do not integrate with each other. 3. Due
to restricted data flow, sports and wellness market lacks connectivity.

MAJOR INDUSTRY SHORTAGES
OWNERSHIP
In 2011, the World Economic Forum announced personal data to be a new asset class. Among
all data classes, health related data is one of the most valued and expensive assets. However, it
turns out that our personal data is not our personal asset.
The quantified self is a term denoting “self-knowledge through self-tracking”. While it might
have been a voluntary movement back in 20075, nowadays we are all voluntarily or
involuntarily part of this movement if we use a smartphone with health data tracking, any
mHealth app or a fitness wearable. The problem is that while we are busy quantifying ourselves,
the companies whose products we are using are busy collecting our data and generating
profits from it. And this is a big concern for users.
A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that “many health apps may
be sharing patients’ health data without their knowledge”6. Another study on reducing
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with the help of mHealth apps and wearables concludes that:

Mobile health technology has shown the potential to optimize the management of CVD
and other chronic diseases by empowering patients through better health self-monitoring
and education. However, several challenges are present when patient’s data are utilized and
monitored in the healthcare setting. A common issue is the privacy and security of health
information7.

Furthermore, CVDs are the number one cause of death globally: more people die annually from
CVDs than from any other cause. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 17.7
million people died from CVDs in 2015, representing 31% of all global deaths. At the same time,
WHO stresses that “most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural
risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use
of alcohol”8.
Thus, incentivizing healthy behaviour is one of the crucial challenges for health innovations. At
Lympo, we believe that part of the answer is allowing users to own the data they generate.
Lympo presents a health/fitness app data aggregator that does not share users’ data, but
enables them to monetize it instead.

TO SUM UP:
We are not the owners of one of the most valuable assets we have, our health-related data,
although we constantly gather this data voluntarily or involuntarily.

INTEGRATION
An additional problem with the mHealth sector is that the market is very segmented. Most apps
focus on one specific area, while each of the providers gather only very specific information,
thus lacking an overall picture. While various aggregators that allow integration exist, users are
reluctant to connect their apps and wearables to them because there is no real advantage for a
user to have this data in one place: aggregators rarely answer the question “What’s next?”.
Usually integration only means that a user is transferring more data to one app provider with
no reward mechanism for its user. Thus, the interaction stays mostly limited to occasional data
sharing on social media.
In addition to this, numerous research accounts show that privacy is the number one concern
for mHealth users. Most companies offering possibilities to integrate data are big players like
Apple, Google or Microsoft that regardless own a lot of users’ data and do not inspire the trust
that is needed to store sensitive health information in one place. The 2017 report by Human
Data Commons reveals that big corporations with extensive capacities to integrate data are
weakest in terms of providing direct human contact for consumers9.
These challenges make it difficult for a user to have all generated data in one place. While such
a data set would be very valuable for getting feedback from a sports or mindfulness coach,
physical therapist and even a general practitioner, it remains scattered among a variety of apps
and devices.

TO SUM UP:
Market segmentation and lack of incentive for mHealth apps’ integration prevents users from
having an overall picture of all their activities or further reaping key benefits of the data they
generate.

FREE DATA FLOW
In the world of data economy, users produce valuable data with literally every step they make.
However, because it remains stored with a single provider, every ecosystem player is
participating in the race to come up with a better mechanism to lock a user within one
platform. For this reason, market players become discouraged to offer integration and data
sharing mechanisms.
The second factor contributing to this situation are data protection laws that, for good reasons,
prevent companies from freely sharing users’ personal data not only with other businesses, but
also within the company itself if its operations are across, for example, EU-U.S. borders.
Allowing private ownership of sports and health data opens the doors to user-controlled data
sharing whereby the information flow can be managed by the individual.
The sports and wellness market includes a wide variety of players who cover various aspects of
user behaviour like choosing a fitness trainer, an exercise regime, a gym, healthy diet and
supplements, sports clothes and shoes. Healthy lifestyle enthusiasts owning the data collected
from a variety of sources could make the best use of it by connecting multiple industry
products and services that enable all key players to profit from this free flow of data.

TO SUM UP:
Due to the lack of a mechanism allowing users to effectively share their sports and health
data, the sports and wellness industry cannot offer user-centred products and services for
all aspects of a healthy lifestyle.

THE HEALTH INDUSTRY AND THE
BLOCKCHAIN
HOW CAN BLOCKCHAIN ADDRESS THE BIGGEST
FITNESS/WELLNESS DATA MANAGEMENT
PROBLEMS?
It is widely agreed that blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt the health sector by
making user-generated data the core of the healthcare ecosystem. It can achieve this by
increasing the security and interoperability of health data. In this paper, we focus on mHealth or
more specifically on the fitness/wellness sector powered by mHealth apps and wearables.
However, it is important to grasp the whole picture to realise Lympo’s full potential in the future.
Blockchain is a distributed system which records and stores transaction records, in a fashion
making it impossible to change the content of the transaction in a digital ledger. Each
transaction block is stored in the ledger and chronologically linked to another block after the
transaction records are verified by a distributed peer-to-peer network. End-to-end encryption
makes an interaction like storing, exchanging and viewing information possible without
established trust between the parties. Avoiding one central authority, blockchain relies on an
anonymous network of participants preventing privacy and confidentiality breaches.
Blockchain-based smart contracts represent contracts that can be fully executed when
contract conditions are met. This system unbundles the need for any kind of exchange with an
intermediary checking contract conditions. Until now, intermediaries played a crucial role in
exchange of value situations, thus earning from their role. Smart contracts enable end users to
enter a trusted relationship without any other authority.
The sensitive nature of health-related data and the need to be able to delete this personal data
in order to fulfil data protection regulations in some parts of the world (most notably the
European Union) does not allow for storing this data itself on blockchain. In this case,
blockchain technology is viewed as a secure and effective payment tool allowing
micro-payments and a permission storing mechanism.
Registering permissions to access patient-generated data on blockchain, users are empowered
to control who can access their data, and under which conditions. This capability enables
individuals to be the owners of their precious data asset. This data set can be compiled from
information originating from a variety of data sources; ranging from electronic medical records
provided by hospitals, clinics and doctors, to fitness/wellness data generated by mHealth apps
and wearables. It can also be complimented by disease and treatment monitoring applications
and custom information added by a user individually.

8

In addition, further data users will be able to demonstrate that the data owner gave her
permission for the use of this data. With data protection regulations tightening around the
world, this feature will enable third parties to give solid proof on data provenance on the
blockchain.

BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATIONS IN THE HEALTH
INDUSTRY
Healthcare might be a latecomer in the booming growth of enterprise blockchain apps, but it is
getting more and more prominence as a promising technology to solve major issues in the
sector of health data management even on a governmental scale.

LYMPO: ECOSYSTEM POWERED BY
USER-GENERATED DATA
INTRO: HOW IT WORKS?
Lympo aims to create an ecosystem powered by user-generated and user-controlled fitness
and wellness data allowing the exchange of value through the introduction of LYM utility
tokens. Lympo’s goal is a marketplace where data itself is used efficiently by ecosystem members and everyone is rewarded fairly. A mHealth app/wearable user is at the centre of this
ecosystem including all key players in the sports and wellness industry:

The Lympo ecosystem starts from the existing platform which enables users to find the best
personal trainer with 500+ fitness professionals operational in Lithuania, www.lympo.lt, and
expanding to California, U.S. and Melbourne, Australia.
The ecosystem is composed of three main parts: 1. The Lympo digital fitness wallet and user
reward mechanisms; 2. Lympo marketplace; 3. Lympo crowdfunding and investment platform.

I PART: THE LYMPO WALLET AND USER REWARDS
MECHANISM
The Lympo digital fitness wallet and user reward mechanism is at the core of the Lympo
ecosystem. Lympo fitness wallet functions as an entry to the ecosystem and allows a user to
create their profile, fill in their health data and connect it to their favourite sports and health
tracking apps. The individual data submitted via Lympo fitness wallet will be accessible to its
user and can be viewed or shared by storing a permission on blockchain.
The rewards issued by market players interested in having direct access to Lympo digital fitness
wallet users can be of two different types:
A reward for achieving a healthy lifestyle goal, i.e. running 5 kilometres or following a precise
diet and submitting app records to Lympo profile.
A reward for checking into a particular location for a specified amount of time, i.e. joining a
gym class or attending a karate competition.
The Lympo health wallet will be rolled out in multiple steps. In order to bring the product to the
market as soon as possible, Lympo tokens will be first used as utility tokens on the existing

12

Lympo platform to buy online and offline training sessions with the best fitness trainers,
including training or any sports coach sessions, consultations by a physical therapist or a
dietician. Lympo users will be able to utilise the Lympo fitness wallet to get reward tokens for
achieved training goals. As more partners join, Lympo tokens will be used to access a wide
range of healthy lifestyle products and services like sports clothes and shoes, healthy food and
gyms with a possibility to reward achieved health goals with the help of smart contracts.
Trainers will be able to be more competitive, proposing packages where their services are
offered together with a built-in reward program. Also, any other ecosystem player can either
attach the reward system to the product sold or purchase a certain number of tokens and
organise challenges and tasks for Lympo users in exchange for their data.
Use case I: Lympo users receive a notification that a challenge to run 5 km this week is being
organised by a big athletic shoe producer. No matter which app they use, they can complete
this task and get token rewards with the Lympo platform.

1. Athletic shoe producer publishes a 5km running challenge
2. User decides to participate
3. The agreement is registered
4. User completes the challenge and submits the app tracking data
5. LYM token rewarded

13

Use case II: a new boxing club in the city notifies users in this city that a certain number of
tokens will be distributed to those attending their first boxing class for beginners. Users
check-in to a club location at the specific time using their Lympo account and get LYM reward
tokens.
A further service offered by the Lympo platform is a time-stamped permission issued by users
to utilise their personal data. This is key to ensure the highest data protection regulation
standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union.

II PART: LYMPO MARKETPLACE: MONETIZING
DATA
The next step in the Lympo ecosystem is to enable users to spend tokens to receive further
healthy lifestyle goods and services and make in-platform purchases. The marketplace, starting
with the existing platform to find the best personal trainer, offers a variety of ways to do so:
Getting premium features in the Lympo platform. E.g.:
A personal trainer can buy enhanced profile options and more exposure for their listing.
A user can purchase more options for their health and sports data storage on the Lympo
platform, like reminders and health advice based on the data submitted.
Everyone owning tokens will receive discounts and products offered by our partners: sports
and wellness businesses, healthy food and supplement providers, etc.
Businesses use tokens to pay for listing their products and services on the platform.
Lympo foresees its existing platform to be the market entry tool for the user-generated data
powered healthy lifestyle ecosystem which will further expand with more partners accepting
LYM tokens. A part of LYM tokens are allocated to incentivize community growth and to add
new businesses to the Lympo network. The ultimate Lympo goal is that its token holders can
access a wide range of products and services with the initial platform being only one part of
the much wider network.
At this later stage, the user-generated data marketplace will open for businesses such as health
insurances, research institutions, and big data companies within and outside of the sports and
wellness industry that are interested in accessing the data of Lympo digital wallet users. The
users will be enabled to decide whom they trust their data to, to know what exactly they are
sharing and to earn tokens by doing so.

III PART: LYMPO CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM
The third arm of the Lympo ecosystem is a crowdfunding and investment platform allowing
LYM token holders to invest in the most promising fitness/wellness/health start-ups which are

14

reviewed and rated by Lympo ecosystem members who know what the industry needs best.
LYM token holders will be able to receive company shares for the tokens contributed.
The unique value proposition of this crowdfunding platform is 1. Public reviews and ratings by
sports and wellness market players; 2. Access to data of a big user base enabled by LYM
tokens.
The crowdfunding platform will allow for businesses and service providers active in the
Lympo ecosystem to review and rate new companies seeking investment for a certain token
reward offered by a start-up listed. This will help investors to better evaluate the potential of
the new venture and for start-ups to find potential partners and customers operating within
the same industry.
Many new companies are following the usual data economy business cycle: build a product,
attract a large user base, then start analysing and monetising data. But with the help of
invested LYM tokens, start-ups on the Lympo crowdfunding platform will be able to start
working with a big data base immediately purchasing fitness and health data directly from
our users or proposing new challenges for reward tokens if the existing data set lacks some
particular qualities.
This way, new innovative fitness/wellness/health companies will have a much lower market
entry cost and can successfully launch their products and maximise returns for investors.

LYMPO BLOCKCHAIN FOR SPORTS FOUNDATION
A part of the tokens reserved for the ecosystem empowerment will be allocated to Lympo
Blockchain for Sports Foundation. The aim of this foundation is to support various sports
events and initiatives around the world with the goal to promote Lympo fitness wallet and to
encourage a healthy lifestyle.
The foundation board, composed of famous athletes, Lympo partners and leaders in sports
communities from various countries, will oversee the foundation activities. Lympo token holders
of at least 1,000,000 LYM (the amount will be adjusted in two years based on community vote)
will be able to vote on funding proposals. The composition of the board and foundation
governing principles will be announced before the Lympo token sale in the first quarter of 2018.

LYMPO: USER REWARD SOLUTION
DESCRIPTION
While Lympo includes three major parts, a user reward mechanism, a marketplace and a crowdfunding platform, rewards for a healthy lifestyle are at the core of the product and will be
discussed in detail. We have also included a provisional model of the data sharing environment
with description of components, permissions and actors.
The fitness/health data sharing ecosystem is based on three major components:
Lympo Platform: core components developed by the Lympo team and partners
Blockchain: Lympo tokens, smart contracts and crypto wallets
User community: Users, who will live healthy lifestyles and will interact with different actors
in the ecosystem to find trainers, partners, make agreements, share data and get rewarded.
The Lympo tokens are a key element which facilitate all interaction in the system in relation to
the community and a healthy lifestyle. The tokens are used to incentivize people to be active
participants, make connections and improve their health. The tokens are distributed on the
Ethereum cryptocurrency blockchain. This, of course, imposes certain standard rules for the
community.

COMPONENT

DESCRIPTION

Lympo Core

Main business logic will be implemented in this component. The component will
contain all relevant rules and algorithms processing activities in the ecosystem. It will
do data validation and will interact with blockchain to process contracts and issue
some transactions, when needed.

Lympo API

A collection of various programming functions and interfaces to make Lympo
ecosystem accessible for the software development companies. The API will give
sufficient flexibility, while respecting all security rules implemented in Lympo Core.
Lympo will encourage third parties to create additional services in the ecosystem,
which will be beneficial for system users and investors.

Main Data store

The database where all system data will be stored. It will include user accounts,
system data and detailed information about the smart contracts. The fitness data
recorded by Lympo users will also be stored in this data storage. The elaborated
security measures will be taken to protect the data, and it will only interact with
Lympo Core system, which will make sure that only authorized persons and
processes can access relevant data.

Lympo User Interface

Web portal and mobile applications developed by the Lympo team. The user
interface will be the main entry point for the users to create and manage their Lympo
accounts, propose different training programs and reward options, pay for the
services, create smart contracts and monitor the balance of the Lympo tokens in
their accounts.

Data Access Engine

A separate component in the Lympo Core, developed exclusively to add extra
security checks for the data shared with the third parties. External developers will
get access to the system via Lympo API, however the private data is a big concern
and requires additional handling. Permissions to access the data can be given by the
data owner only, and this component will perform validation of these permissions. In
addition, the data access engine will audit every external call to the API, therefore
every user will be able to see who has accessed their data. Moreover, the component
will do automatic monitoring of system behaviour, to analyse data usage patterns
and alert system administrators on malicious behaviour.

19

BLOCKCHAIN: SMART CONTRACTS
The Lympo ecosystem will use Lympo Token as a main facilitator of the user contracts and
interactions. The unique user community and collection of the fitness/wellness data gives a
wide range of opportunities for smart contracts and data exchange. The Lympo team takes
user privacy very seriously, therefore all source code for the smart contracts related to the data
exchange, will be fully verified by the Lympo developers. In addition, Lympo core will stay as
authorizing entity for the agreements and rewards. Already at this early stage several examples
of the smart contracts will be implemented:

SMART CONTRACT: USER REWARD PROGRAM
User reward programs, will be made between the Lympo ecosystem participants, such as
trainers/physicians/gyms/sports inventory providers and Lympo digital fitness wallet users. Let
us look at a case of a fitness trainer and her client. In order to encourage users to live a healthy
lifestyle, the fitness trainer will propose a contract on the Lympo platform, giving specific goals
for the end user to achieve. The contract itself will be made using standard user interface. The
components of such contract are the following:
Account of the person/company which is creating a contract
Account of the end user who will receive the rewards, after reaching the goals
The amount of Lympo tokens, which will be transferred as a reward
The detailed description of activities and goals, which needs to be met. This information will
be hashed into one string, to limit the size of parameters sent to the smart contract.
The creator of the smart contract will use all the parameters from above and will sign the call to
blockchain with his/her password. The smart contract will lock the reward tokens for a given
number of days. After the user reaches training goals specified in the contract, the Lympo Core
validates this information, and invokes the call to a smart contract, confirming transfer of the
Lympo tokens to the user. If the goals are not met during the agreed time, the tokens will be
transferred back to the Lympo platform or the creator of the smart contract depending on the
conditions for the specific token reward program.

TRAINING PACKAGE USING A REWARD PROGRAM SMART
CONTRACT
The Lympo system will give options for the trainers/physicians to propose training packages,
which automatically would include a reward program. The trainers will be free to choose how
they advertise their services in the system, but to be competitive, the pricing might contain an
option for the user to get back a specific percentage of payment. The implementation of the
smart contract is very similar to previously defined model. However, in this case the workflow
will have a few additional steps:

20

Trainer in the Lympo system creates a package to offer a customer. The package contains:
Trainer services (detailed description)
Price for a whole package
The percentage which will be given as reward after goals are achieved
Conditions to get the reward (similar as specified in the smart contract above)
Trainer sends this information to the smart contract (signing with his/her blockchain
account). Some parts will be set directly (like the price, percentage, etc.). Other details will
be hashed into one string and stored in the smart contract as a proof.
When a user finds a package which he/she wants to purchase, the Lympo system will
additionally verify that the information signed by the trainer in the smart contract is correct.
The user then makes a transaction to the smart contract using Lympo tokens. A part of the
tokens is immediately transferred to the trainer's account, but a specified percentage of
them are automatically locked by the smart contract.
Unlocking is similar to the contract defined sabove: after the user reaches training goals specified in the contract, Lympo Core validates this information and invokes the call to a smart
contract, confirming transfer of the Lympo tokens back to the user. If the goals are not met
during the agreed time, the tokens will be transferred to the trainer.

SMART CONTRACT – CUSTOM REWARD PROGRAM FOR
CHECK-INS
Various companies will be able to attract users by creating specific locations where users can
receive LYM tokens just for showing up and staying during a specific time. The smart contract
will be signed by these companies, and the main goal of it will be to have a specific number of
tokens locked for the distribution to the end users. The components of this smart contract
would be the following:
Account of the person/company which is creating a reward program
The amount of Lympo tokens, which will be shared by all participating users as a reward
The detailed information on the conditions and rules for sharing the tokens. This information
will be hashed into one string, to limit the size of parameters sent to the smart contract.
Unlocking is similar to the contract defined sabove: after the user reaches training goals
specified in the contract, Lympo Core validates this information and invokes the call to a smart
contract, confirming transfer of the Lympo tokens back to the user. If the goals are not met
during the agreed time, the tokens will be transferred to the trainer.
All conditions related to the reward program will be detailed in the Lympo portal. Participants
will use their mobile devices to track their location and will provide this information to the
system. Lympo will offer a possibility to issue a security or a QR code to be placed at the
location as an additional fraud protection mechanism. After the specified time, the Lympo core

21

will use the information received from users, will calculate the rewards and will send the
information to the smart contract per which accounts shall receive tokens.

SMART CONTRACT: DATA ACCESS
The smart contract will be created by the data proxy companies in order to reward users, when
the fitness data is fetched. The data proxy companies, could create interfaces for various data
processing companies, who need such data. This data access contract will be created firstly in
the Lympo portal. The user will sign a contract with the data proxy company to share the
information. The components for the smart contract are similar to the previously detailed
reward program:
Account of the person/company which is creating a contract
Account of the end user who will receive the rewards, after authorizing the access
The amount of Lympo tokens, which will be transferred as a reward
The detailed description of the agreement: which data will be used, who will get access to it,
etc. This information will be hashed into one string, to limit the size of parameters sent to the
smart contract.
The creator of the smart contract will use all the parameters above and will sign the call to
blockchain with his/her password. The smart contract will lock the reward tokens. After the
user inside the Lympo platform gives the authorization to access the data, Lympo core will
check if all conditions detailed in the agreement are met. If everything is correct, Lympo core
will invoke the call to a smart contract, confirming transfer of the Lympo tokens to the user. The
data proxy company will be able to access the user data by using Lympo API and Data Access
Engine component.

SYSTEM ACTORS
The ecosystem is built around an active and dynamic community. These people care about their
health or are providing services in the fitness/wellness domain. The community also includes
research and insurance companies who can use the data collected by system users and can
develop better products, analyse trends and encourage the healthy lifestyle.
Every system participant will need to have an account in the Ethereum blockchain and account
in Lympo platform. The Ethereum account’s public key will be linked to the Lympo account in
order to collect Lympo tokens, participate in reward programs or other smart contracts. The
private key will remain in full control by the user and will not be visible to the Lympo platform.
The main actors analysed in the ecosystem:

22

USERS: DATA OWNERS
Users who want to improve their physical condition, and are rewarded for their lifestyle. These
users will create most of the data inside the system, and will be able to monetize their activities.
They will be in full control of their data inside the system, and on request will be able to authorize access to the Data Proxy Companies.

TRAINERS/PHYSICIANS/SPORTS INVENTORY MAKERS/GYMS
A big focus of the Lympo portal is to create connections among trainers and the end users. The
trainers, physicians, sports clubs or even companies who specialize in sports inventory, will find
users who want to be healthy. The ecosystem will provide features for the trainers to create
reward programs, and to reward participants using Lympo tokens. Sports club promotions, new
equipment, innovative devices… everything will find their place in the system.

DATA PROXY COMPANIES
To offer more features to the system, the Lympo team will open API to software development
companies, which can create additional solutions where fitness/wellness data will be used. The
Data Proxy Companies will not necessary use the data themselves, but will serve as data
providers for additional actors: Data Processing Companies. The Data Proxy Companies will
have direct contracts with the end users, and will be required to provide full transparency
where user data is used.

DATA PROCESSING COMPANIES
Companies which can use the data for different needs. The data can be used by research
centres to analyse habits of society and to propose new ideas or programs for health
improvement. Notwithstanding, by having access to user’s data insurance companies could
provide better service and suggest tailored insurance plans with more convenient pricing
models. Data Processing Companies can use the Lympo API and have smart contracts with end
users. However, it’s more likely that professional software houses (Data Proxy Companies) will
propose simplified interfaces to access the data.

SECURITY MEASURES
The Lympo team is aware that security is a key necessity for its users sharing their healthy
lifestyle data. Even though this type of data is much less sensitive than medical records and
thus HIPAA, for example, does not cover fitness and wellness sectors including mobile apps and
wearables. Lympo is committed to ensure the highest-level security measures mirroring the
latest developments in cybersecurity best practices.

23

To ensure the confidentiality of the data, or prevent data from unauthorized disclosure, all the
data in the database will be encrypted with modern encryption algorithm. All communication
(service to service, service to the client) will be protected by TLS. Access to the database is
strictly limited to very few to no people, access credentials are managed by a password
manager and rotated in a timely manner, and the access list will be audited in a timely manner
as well.
To ensure data integrity, the Lympo team will establish a procedure to perform periodic checks
of data and system functionality to identify integrity issues (e.g., corrupted data, failing hardware, software errors, etc.).
To ensure the availability of data, the database will be backed up periodically, and the backup
will be verified to be restorable. The Lympo team will also establish a Business Continuity Plan
(BCP) and Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) to ensure the highest possible availability of Lympo
services.
The Lympo team will adopt technology with high-security robustness, such as using a HIPAA
compliant cloud host from cloud service providers such as AWS. In addition, security would be
built-in early into our software development lifecycle, making sure our technology architecture
follows security best practices, we audit our system via security experts to find potential issues.
Additionally, our team is trained with security awareness in mind.
Furthermore, a private bug-bounty programme for white-hat hackers will be set up to receive
support from top white-hat security researchers globally.
