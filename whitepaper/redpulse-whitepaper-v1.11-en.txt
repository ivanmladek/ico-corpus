Abstract
In today’s information age, there is no shortage of market data and financial research.
Yet, due to historically entrenched market dynamics, the economics of financial research
production and distribution are dominated by only a few gatekeepers. This prevents
independent analysts from having a voice, while research consumers are forced to accept
whatever coverage is already available. What market participants truly need is context –
providing relevance in addition to scale. Red Pulse intends to employ RPX as a mechanism
to fairly and directly incentivize research producers for their works, while providing research
consumers with a mechanism to guide research coverage and provide fair compensation.

Motivation

China’s economy is already the 2nd largest in the world in terms of nominal GDP [1] [2], and
1st in terms of purchasing power parity [3] (PPP) [4]. However, as a market for investment and
industry participation, it remains incredibly difficult to understand. This disconnect presents a
huge opportunity to platforms and services that can bridge this informational gap.
The problem is made all the more challenging to solve by several critical circumstances.

1.1

Research Content Ecosystem is Broken

The research content ecosystem as it exists today is broken. The economics of the research
business has become dominated by a few key players in content production (sell-side research
[5]) and content distribution (major financial terminals [6]). Smaller and independent research
producers lose, as do all financial institutions, both large and small, that are forced into the
“all-you-can-eat” pricing model.

1.2

Information Accuracy and Transparency

While sources of information on China’s financial markets and industries abound, information
accuracy and transparency are ongoing problems. A common theme is for China market pundits
and reputable news sources to report on a market rumor in the morning, only to have it be
denied in the afternoon. It’s difficult to know who and what to trust, amongst all the noise.

1.3

Information Overload

As China has leapfrogged ahead into becoming one of the most mobile- and Internet-connected
societies in the world [7] [8], market information has now not only become ubiquitous, but well in
excess of what an average analyst can humanly process. This information overload phenomenon
[9], while not unique to China, has made the job of analysts all the more difficult.

v1.11

1.4

Solution: Sharing Economy for Research

Red Pulse solves these issues by creating a groundbreaking research content platform that
simplifies incentives and directly compensates research producers for their valuable insights, while
ensuring research consumers can access the research that is most relevant to them. Independent
analysts and market commentators can now contribute their ideas and insights on an ad-hoc
basis, and be compensated accordingly. RPX is the underlying mechanism used to facilitate this
ecosystem, and provides RPX holders with direct participation in the rise of China’s economy.

What Red Pulse Does

Red Pulse is a market intelligence platform covering China’s economy and capital markets. By
creating a global community around a common interest, incentivizing participants to produce
truly relevant research, and providing technology-enabled analysis tools, Red Pulse seeks to solve
the problem that all of us face today: Information Overload.

3

Scaling the Research Process

Figure 1: Research Process
We are building a new content production, distribution, and consumption platform focused
initially on China’s capital markets, an oft-mentioned, but little-understood market that is set
v1.11

3

to become the most influential market in the world [10]. We recognize that incumbent platforms
are well-entrenched in the financial system, and we do not seek to directly challenge this. Red
Pulse offers an alternative, complementary research platform that seeks to address unmet needs,
of which there are many, when concerning China markets.

3.1

Contribution from Independent Research Analysts

Independent and fresh research will be voluntarily contributed by industry experts, active
investors, and market watchers, often filling the market coverage gaps that are left by more
traditional sources, such as sell-side equity research firms. By helping grow an independent
financial community focused on China through high-quality analysis, contributors will receive
payment for their work, in the form of RPX, that enables the incentivization system that drives
the platform.
To combat the problem of information accuracy and transparency, research contributors will be
designated with a system-generated Credibility Score, which is calculated based on the accuracy
and quality of past research as determined by readers and the Red Pulse editorial staff, and
general popularity of the contributor’s works.

3.2

Hypothesis & Insight Creation

Our solution to the problem of information overload then rests on two principles. First, research
consumers have the opportunity to create research “prompts,” indicating their interest in new
or relatively thinly-covered topics, by paying an adjustable amount of RPX. The greater the
contributions, the higher the indicated demand. Consumers may also trigger special rights such
as exclusivity for adjustable periods of time, by paying above a minimum threshold, if they are
the originator of the prompt.
Second, Red Pulse employs machine learning technology to highlight new market events that
may be of significance to both research consumers and producers, while making topical recommendations to both agents, based on past individual user behavior. This helps to prioritize
certain topics on an individual user-level basis that have a higher likelihood of relevance. This
v1.11

4

Cloud Event data feed will be offered to both research producers and consumers as a starting
point for potential coverage and analysis.

4.1

Why Blockchain?
Reducing Frictional Costs

Traditional methods of transferring capital incur relatively high transactional costs (often ranging
from 1% to 10% along with flat fees regardless of transaction size) due to banks and other
financial intermediaries having to address counterparty risk and settlement and clearing costs.
Using RPX significantly reduces these costs, especially if the platform engages in a large amount
of relatively small payments.

4.2

Creating a System of Record

The blockchain ledger is a publicly-verifiable record that can be used to confirm that content
producers on our system have been fairly compensated for their works. Research consumers will
also have confidence that payments have gone towards research content that they selected, with
a dependable system-of-record always available as an accounting of their usage.

4.3

Solving the “Cold Start” Problem

Finally, employing RPX as the underlying mechanism for our open research platform solves the
“cold start” problem: convincing enough independent analysts and commentators to contribute to
the platform, while convincing enough research consumers (e.g. finance professionals and financial
institutions) to use the platform. In both cases, one party is unwilling to participate if there is
not enough activity and usage by the other party. To solve this, RPX is used to immediately
incentivize and reward research contributors, thereby seeding the platform with enough valuable
content that would attract a critical mass of research consumers. With more consumers, the
platform gains in popularity, thereby increasing the exposure to research producers, and their
corresponding rewards.
v1.11

5.1

Why Our Own RPX?
Building a Community

Establishing RPX allows us to create a common language and value system that we can build a
community around. Ultimately, this becomes a rallying point, and will attract new participants,
both research content producers and consumers to the Red Pulse platform.
Our platform also introduces the concept of research prompts, which allow research consumers to
request new research content on specific areas, similar to a Request for Proposal (RFP) process.

5.2

Payment Scaling Issues

Major digital assets, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, have issues with scaling, as each payment,
no matter how small, incurs a transaction fee. As our content platform thrives on the concept
of micropayments in exchange for small chunks of research content, these fees can quickly
add up. RPX allows both content producers and consumers to keep a running “tab”, and
setting thresholds for automatic or manual asset exchanges, thereby minimizing the frequency of
transactions and reducing aggregate fees.

5.3

Managing the Monetary Supply

Finally, by establishing RPX as our own underlying software protocol driving the content
ecosystem, Red Pulse as a company can manage the supply, which is needed to ensure the
fairness of the payments system and research content price setting that is commensurate with
real world compensation for similar work produced by professional research analysts.

RPX Purpose

6.1

Research Producers

RPX is used to incentivize and compensate research producers for producing relevant and valuable
research on China’s financial markets. Better analysis results in greater popularity in terms of
net upvotes, which is then rewarded with more RPX. As a repeated game, research producers’
Credibility Score will also factor into the amount of RPX earned for a piece of research content.
Responding to research prompts will also allow the research producer to earn at a minimum, a
preset amount of RPX put up for bid by an interested research consumer. This is in addition
to any additional RPX earned by net upvotes, as determined by the system. Or, the research
consumer may opt to “lock-up” selected article responses to the prompt for adjustable periods of
time, with longer periods requiring higher amounts of RPX.
As our platform is both in English and Chinese, translators can also receive a portion of the
RPX payout, as a reward for work done. The accuracy of the translation will also be determined
by a net upvote & downvote voting system.

6.2

Research Consumers

RPX is used to drive our ecosystem, and relies primarily upon research consumers to determine
relative amounts for each article. RPX can also be acquired by content consumers that wish
to further increase the baseline RPX reward attached to research “prompts” that are initially
funded by the Red Pulse platform. Doing so will prioritize certain research “prompts” to be
more lucrative for content producers.
Holding RPX will give consumers additional benefits:
• Greater voting power, which can be used to upvote research articles. Upvotes will also
have a multiplying effect on RPX earned by content producers.
• Users that have been verified to be from financial institutions will have greater voting
power, at a planned 10-to-1 ratio versus standard users.
v1.11

7

• Early access to content from research producers with higher Credibility Scores
• Users initiating research prompts with RPX will give those users exclusive access temporarily

6.3

Other Stakeholders

Red Pulse platform: RPX becomes the common language and rallying concept for the Red
Pulse community, while also facilitating the transaction mechanism that makes our new content
ecosystem possible.
Red Pulse company: RPX is a price control mechanism that is used by the company to ensure
fair compensation for research and analysis. The company also earns commission that is levied
on each RPX transaction.

7
7.1

RPX Mechanism
RPX Supply

RPX will have a supply with nominal value USD 15,000,000. This represents 40% of the total
RPX created.

7.2

Inflation

The supply of RPX will increase over time at a rate of 10% per year. Half of this is provided
proportionally to current holders of RPX on the Red Pulse platform as an anti-inflationary
measure, while the other half is used to provide payment to content producers on the platform.
RPX held “off the platform” in wallets, exchanges, and other locations, will not receive the
anti-inflationary measure to help offset the effects of the annual inflation. The inflation rate will
be gradually adjusted downwards, if there is deemed to be enough additional RPX circulation to
provide reasonable rewards for new research content.

v1.11

8

7.3

RPX Used as Payments

Payment for content production: Content producers will be compensated on a per-article basis
in RPX. The specific amount of RPX will be determined by credibility score, prompt rewards,
and article popularity (description of calculation methods in Challenges section).
Payment for translation and other tasks: Platform participants may also act as content translators,
from either English to Chinese or Chinese to English, in the cases where the original author has
only posted their content in one language. Translations will also be rated and ranked if there
is more than one version, with RPX distributed to the top ranked translation. Other platform
tasks may be defined in the future, for which there will also be RPX compensation.
RPX refunds: In certain cases, RPX may be refunded to platform participants. For example,
if a prompt has gone unanswered after 2 weeks time, any RPX that was paid by a research
consumer(s) will then be refunded to the payer(s). Other cases may arise that will necessitate a
refund, but typically will follow a minimum period of 2 weeks before this takes place.

Current Platform: Market Fit

Red Pulse already has an operational research content platform at www.red-pulse.com and an
iOS mobile app (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/red-pulse/id492320787), focusing on China’s
markets and economy from an event-driven perspective. We capture major macroeconomic,
regulatory, corporate action, and M&A and cross-border events that we deem to have the
potential for significant impact to specific companies, industries, or the economy at large. To
date, the platform is built only for our internal employees to generate and publish content to
our clients. Our intent is to transform this into an open research platform, with RPX as its
underlying transaction mechanism.

8.1

Data Sources

The company employs a combination of traditional research techniques and advanced technology
such as machine learning and Chinese natural language processing (NLP) to facilitate the
v1.11

9

collection, classification, and analysis of major China market events and trends. Our data sources
include but are not limited to:
• Regulatory announcements
• Government policies
• Corporate disclosures
• Press releases
• News articles
• Social media

Figure 2: Red Pulse web platform
China’s markets continue to reform and liberalize through a top-down approach driven by the
government and its policies. Keeping track of policies and understanding the potential effect on
industries is critical to anticipate the direction of the market and investment environment. We
follow major government and regulatory bodies, providing analysis on relevant policies that may
have an impact on sectors and companies.

8.2

Institutional Investors vs Retail Investors

In contrast to more established financial markets such as the US and Europe, where institutional
investors make up more than 90% of participants by trading activity [11], China’s stock market
v1.11

10

Figure 3: Red Pulse iOS app
activity is dominated by individual investors, representing an estimated 80% of all trading activity
[12]. Although investors are very quickly becoming adept at developing their own investment
strategies and views, most investors are newcomers to the market and have only a few years of
experience, given how nascent [13] China’s capital markets are, and the relative short period of
time that individual investors have been given access.
Furthermore, individual investors often do not have access to or choose not to employ the services
of a professionally-trained wealth manager. As a consequence, a large proportion of stock buying
and selling decisions by retail investors are heavily swayed by news, events, and rumors, rather
than basing investment decisions on economic fundamentals [14] [15]. Our expertise in tracking
events across the markets allows us to select the important and relevant information, while
discarding rumors or false reports.

8.3

Platform Coverage

The Red Pulse platform currently covers market events spanning several key sectors, including
banking, brokerages, insurance, asset management, real estate, internet, telecom, semiconductors,
consumer goods, travel & hospitality, food & beverage, aerospace & aviation, and energy.

v1.11

11

Subscribers can access our research through our client web portal, iOS mobile app for iPhone
and iPad, or daily summary email newsletter.

8.4

Platform Features

Our main product consists of a daily real-time feed of major market events in the above sectors.
The feed consists of short-format notes that are differentiated from traditional equity research,
in that we are purely event-driven.
• Concise two paragraph format consisting of synopsis and contextual analysis
• Sourcing primarily from Chinese language sources, ensuring timeliness
• Focus on confirmed or reasonably vetted facts, rather than market rumors
These event notes are published in both English and Chinese, with cited sources, along with
tags based on Industry, Sub-industry, Topic, Event type, Company, Region, and Others, with a
custom China-market focused taxonomy of over 4,000 tags. This allows for precise search and
querying of our entire 6 years of archived market event notes, via a SOLR implementation of a
faceted search engine on our client web portal, as well as custom push notifications by tag on
our mobile app.

8.5

Current Clients

Our clients include major investment banks, asset managers, central banks, sovereign wealth
funds, exchanges, and other institutional investors, validating our platform and value proposition
of providing timely and relevant market intelligence on China. The key challenge is continuing to
expand our research coverage based on demand from our clients, while maintaining the quality
of the analysis and minimizing operating costs.

8.6

Sharing Economy for Research

To solve this challenge, we will create a direct-incentivization ecosystem facilitated by RPX, thus
creating a global community of contributors, free of the physical confines of office spaces and
v1.11

12

employment contracts, while minimizing operational risks and costs for the company. With this
open platform, the format of research notes will also be liberalized yet standardized, starting
with several templates:
• Market event research note employed by current platform
• Company-specific research article
• Industry / sector-specific research article
• Macroeconomic research article

8.7

Users of the New Platform

At the same time, Red Pulse can maintain quality by providing editorial oversight of the platform
structure, administering a fair and transparent incentivization system, and vetting and approving
select research producers as expert-level contributors. RPX helps align the interests of research
consumers and producers, by directly addressing the increasing demand for China market insights,
and thus benefitting from the rise of China’s economy.
Users of the platform are generally research producers, research consumers, or both simultaneously.
Other tasks such as editing and Chinese-English translation work will also earn RPX according
to a system-defined algorithm.

8.8

New Platform Expansion

Developing and implementing RPX and the open research content ecosystem requires significant
capital investment. We aim to seed the initial interest and usage of the platform itself in the
early stages. Users of our platform and RPX are very likely to be the same demographic of
people that are interested, or already active, in China’s capital markets.

v1.11

9

New Platform Challenges

Building a new content distribution and ecosystem with research produced at scale by independent
users, and monetized based on quality, relevance, and usage, faces major, yet not insurmountable
challenges.

9.1

Subjective Content

By nature, analysis and opinions voiced in research content is subjective, and what is considered
to be relevant changes depending on the preferences of the reader. To better organize high-quality
research, the platform will organize the articles by category and then popularity. Popularity
rank is calculated using a combination of metrics:
• Author Credibility Score
• Editorial staff reviews
• Page count
• Average reader time spent on article
• Comment activity
Red Pulse’s machine learning algorithms, along with its advanced search and customization
features, will also help readers find more relevant and interesting research based on past user
behavior.

9.2

Rankings Manipulation

Popularity rankings can be subject to manipulation from fraudulent clicks or views. To lessen the
impact of page views on popularity ranking, we will use several methods to emphasize legitimate
activity driving rankings:
• Research article views: the easiest to track, but will also need to account for accidental
misclicks or articles that are viewed for only a few seconds.
v1.11

14

– Combatting fraudulent views may arise from malicious users creating multiple accounts
to increase views. This will be combatted by tracking IPs and devices, and banning
IPs or entire IP ranges in extreme cases.
• View growth over time will be factored in: measure the velocity of page views. Articles
with large views in a short period of time will be ranked higher due to the “viral velocity”
of such articles.
• Views over time: measured as a percentage of daily, weekly, or monthly article views as a
percentage of total views.
• Length of time spent on an article: article views must reach a minimum viewing time,
which will depend on the length of the article. Too brief, and we may miss counting the
score towards the article. However, this metric can still be gamed by clicking on the article
and leaving it open, although the impact is limited by how many malicious users engage in
this per article, which will be minimized by IP and device tracking.
• Article activity: will also measure clicks by the user (highlighting, mouse clicks) or scroll
activity, how many times article is shared, and number of comments.
• Editorial review: Staff can give additional points on the quality of the analysis. Initial
submissions must meet a minimum standard in order to be published. However, to further
reward outstanding analysis, in-house staff can reward more points.
Gaming and manipulation of popularity metrics can never be 100% eliminated, but the combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics above can help improve the effectiveness of the
ranking algorithm.

9.3

Credibility Score Calculation

A Credibility Score for each author is calculated by the platform, and demonstrates to readers
which contributors are more established and whose research can be more reliable. Several metrics
will determine the score, which is out of a total 100 points:
• Popularity of articles: a greater number of popular articles will increase Credibility Score.
v1.11

15

• Article view count over time: growing view count over time, while also taking account
number of total articles written, will increase Credibility Score.
• Quality of past articles: editorial staff will look through past articles to determine accuracy
of forecasts, predictions.
• Upvotes paid using RPX.

9.4

Plagiarism

Red Pulse has a strict policy forbidding any degree of plagiarizing on our platform. Users
found to be in violation of this may have their account revoked and IP banned from our system.
Remaining balances may or may not be paid out, depending on the severity of the case.
That being said, research content (themes, ideas, or partial / entire articles) could be copied,
plagiarized, or otherwise misappropriated from other existing articles on the platform, or from
external content sources such as news websites or blogs. Regarding similar content on the
platform, Red Pulse will monitor articles that have been found to be semantically similar using
Chinese NLP and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
Another form of plagiarism is when authors intentionally re-post their own content, or a similar
enough derivative content more than once. The same natural language processing engine will be
used to identify such activity, in order to ensure users are not attempting to get paid more than
once for the same content while spamming the platform. This is particularly critical for research
prompts that have exclusivity time lock-ups, which would become problematic, should authors
repost the same analysis to multiple prompts.
Regarding plagiarism of external content, the Red Pulse editorial staff will review the articles if
enough users have flagged it as a potentially violating our anti-plagiarism policy. Furthermore,
as our system becomes more sophisticated and is able to scrape external content websites for
archival purposes, we will use this to identify any newly posted articles that may have been
plagiarized in part or whole.

v1.11

9.5.1

Existing Platforms
Blockchain-based Content Platforms

There are existing blockchain-based content platforms that have pioneered the use case of
incentivization mechanisms for content creation and distribution. Steemit.com [16], based on
STEEM, has developed a novel way to incentivize social media content creation, similar to
Reddit.com. Although there are several key differences, we have borrowed several concepts from
the STEEM / Steemit.com platform including:
• Net upvote & downvote system based on 1 vote per RPX rather than 1 vote per user
• A squared (n2 ) proportional reward distribution function that weighs the rewards more
towards the top-voted research content, but still allows everyone to earn something
• Scheduled increase in RPX circulation to supply rewards for new and existing research
content
• Pre-determined anti-inflationary mechanism for existing RPX holders that are willing to
commit to a holding period, also provided by scheduled increase in RPX circulation

9.5.2

Traditional Financial Research Platforms

Expanding beyond the content distribution systems from above, we also consider traditional
financial research platforms. We do not seek to directly compete against established platforms,
such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, FactSet, S&P Capital IQ, but to complement research
on those platforms. As opposed to traditional sell-side equity research reports found on those
platforms, our content comes from independent investors, researchers, and market participants.
The intent is to provide coverage of currently thinly-covered industries, sectors, companies, and
topics, as dictated by the research consumer community.

9.5.3

Web-based User Generated Content Platforms

Other sites, such as Seeking Alpha and similarly China-focused Xueqiu.com, have user generated
content. However, we differ from these sites in several distinct ways:
v1.11

17

• Seeking Alpha: Red Pulse specializes in China’s financial and capital markets, whereas
Seeking Alpha’s content and readership is primarily aimed towards US-based stock markets.
Top authors are compensated on a per-article basis, presumably from the site’s advertising
revenue.
• Xueqiu.com: all content is written in Chinese, creating a barrier for non-Chinese reading
audiences. Authors may be tipped by readers for good content, but this is not guaranteed
and is not a consistent form of compensation.

9.6

Disclosures and Conflicts of Interest

Authors are subject to Red Pulse’s information disclosure standards. Personal positions in stocks
or any conflicts of interest must be disclosed by authors and agreed to in writing.

9.7

Ethical Standards

Red Pulse employees are required to follow the highest ethical standards. Employees are forbidden
from front-running any yet to be published research and forbidden from abusing their position
at Red Pulse (knowledge, access, authority) for personal gain. An internal compliance team will
be established, with separate reporting line to the board of directors, to ensure adherence to
these standards.

10

RPX Risks

RPX is not intended to be an investment vehicle. RPX is the underlying mechanism that drives
the Red Pulse open research platform, and supporting RPX is a vote of confidence in the success
of our platform. That being said, there are several risks that all users should be aware of.

10.1

Project Risk

As with any project, the development and execution of our platform carries with it the risk of
delay and even failure. The core team has a strong track record of development and business
v1.11

18

management experience, but this is not a guarantee of success. The team will endeavor to hit
the milestones outlined in the project roadmap, and will be as transparent as possible regarding
our progress and any challenges met.

10.2

Cryptocurrency Risk

By nature, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, with highly fluctuating prices. Do not purchase
more RPX tokens than you are willing to lose. Take time to understand our project and vision.
Our goal is to find like-minded participants who have a high likelihood of being active contributors
and followers in our open research platform.

10.3

Regulatory Risk

The regulatory environment concerning blockchain and cryptocurrencies is still in its nascent
stages of development. We will do our best to comply with all legal and regulatory policies that
develop, but cannot foresee how regulations may impact our project and platform development.
The People’s Bank of China (PBoC), China’s central bank as well as financial regulator, has been
actively engaged in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2014. PBoC also launched its
own fintech committee in May 2017 to study the impact of cryptocurrency on monetary policies,
financial stability, settlement and clearing, among others [17].
In July 2017, a consortium of six Chinese blockchain institutes jointly released a document
titled “Guiyang Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Consensus” in Guiyang city [18]. The document
outlines a plan to self-regulate initial coin offerings in China and prevent the outbreak of systemic
financial risks. The proposal includes a pre-approval system for ICO applicants, clear investor
requirements, and marketing and publicity rules.
A recent ruling by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indicated that
companies that undertake an ICO may need to register with the SEC if the token is considered
a financial security [19].
Most recently, PBoC released a statement [20] regarding ICOs, which include banning raising

v1.11

19

funds through ICOs, strengthening supervision of related ICO platforms, and stressing the public
to be aware of the risks surrounding ICOs.
Red Pulse has taken steps to ensure compliance with regulations and intends to comply with
these directives, as appropriate and within our capabilities.
The RPX sale will be conducted in Hong Kong and by RP Technologies (Hong Kong) Limited
(#2255299). Citizens of the US, Mainland China, or Singapore, are not allowed to participate.
A legal opinion on whether RPX is a security is being undertaken by a well-known Hong Kong
law firm. Advisory on KYC, AML, tax, and accounting issues are being undertaken by a Big
Four accounting firm in Hong Kong.
