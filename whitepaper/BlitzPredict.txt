What is
BlitzPredict?
BlitzPredict is a global platform under development applying fintech solutions to provide
function and liquidity to users of blockchain
prediction markets and sportsbooks. BlitzPredict
aims to bring the power of blockchain technology
to the mass consumer via streamlined products.
BlitzPredict’s aggregator will ensure that users will
always get the best odds available in the market
at any given time. BlitzPredict’s liquidity reserve
will ensure that users can get paid immediately at
the conclusion of an event. BlitzPredict’s smart
contract tools will allow our users to interact
seamlessly and effectively throughout the market.
.
Value Propositions:
• Constantly aggregate data from prediction
markets and sportsbooks to always provide our
users with the best odds available in the market
for a given event.
• Where and when legal, provide liquidity to users
of multiple prediction markets and sportsbooks.
With BlitzPay, our method to provide instant
payouts upon completion of an event, users
won’t have to wait for sportsbooks to transfer
winnings or reporters to verify results on blockchain prediction markets.
• Where and when legal, provide smart contracts to
allow our users to automatically execute wagers
placed with sportsbooks and prediction markets
when certain criteria are met (e.g. Bet 1 ETH
when New England Patriots are trading at 60% or
below).
• Incentivize expert contributors to work within our
community on advanced predictive models.
• Build products accessible to the 99% of consumers who aren’t currently using blockchain-powered products.

Problem
Traditional sportsbooks are centralized authorities. Users must deposit money, while earning
no interest and tying up funds for long periods
of time. Although wagers get graded nearly
instantly (so users can keep betting), cashouts
can take days or even weeks to process. In
addition, if the sportsbook collapses and
defaults, there is no recourse for users to
reclaim their money.
Blockchain prediction markets solve the issue
of trust, but liquidity remains a major issue.
Prediction markets like Gnosis and Augur may
take up to a week to grade wagers and resolve
contracts. Money tied up in a contract can't be
deployed, hurting users' bankroll growth.
Setting up accounts at multiple sportsbooks to
find the best lines is a smart practice. However,
the process of scanning various sportsbooks to
find the best line is time-consuming. This
process, combined with the liquidity issues
discussed above, leads bettors to spend time
doing monotonous, inefficient work, with a
fraction of their working capital available.
Sports analytics is fragmented. Sportsbooks,
betting syndicates, sports teams, and other
entities wall off their internal analytics departments and don’t share information with each
other. Different analytics groups compete
independently toward the same goal, instead
of cooperating. In addition to the below market
rate salaries that sports analytics jobs generally
offer, there is no community where experts and
enthusiasts can participate and be rewarded for
their contributions.
Sports betting “experts” aren’t held accountable for their predictions. Experts can lie about
their track records and claim they bet at
numbers that never existed. Being a successful
sports betting tout is more an exercise in
marketing than in accurately predicting the
results of events.

BlitzPredict White Paper

In addition to issues with sportsbooks and
prediction markets, there are security and
design challenges in the blockchain space in
general. Potential users are intimidated by the
onboarding flow and the challenges of keeping
their information safe and secure.

Solution
BlitzPredict is an aggregator of sportsbooks
and prediction markets. By constantly refreshing the odds like a stock market ticker, we
ensure our users will always get the best odds
available for a given bet. BlitzPredict streamlines the process to make prediction markets as
simple to navigate as traditional sportsbooks.
BlitzPredict will provide a suite of smart
contract tools for our users to better interact
with sportsbooks and prediction markets. Users
will be able to set up smart contracts to
execute when specified criteria are met. The
goal is to bring the power of an advanced
betting syndicate’s tools to our users.

Our aggregator and
liquidity reserve will
ensure our users
always get the best
odds and receive
guaranteed instant
payouts

We are implementing the Bancor Protocol to
further provide liquidity and low rates for our
users. Users will be able to instantly exchange
tokens without needing to use an exchange or
find a buyer. Our aggregator and liquidity
reserve will ensure our users always get the
best odds and receive guaranteed instant
payouts - no more waiting days or even weeks
for withdrawals to hit.
We will incentivize sports analytics experts to
contribute to our platform and work with them
to create powerful predictive models. Models
will be tested publicly and predictions must be
made using actual odds available in the market
at that time. Experts must stake XBP to support
their picks and models. Over time, the most
successful models will receive the most support
from the community.
We will develop secure, streamlined implementations of blockchain protocols to onboard
casual users to partner operations. Our goal is
to bring users with no previous blockchain
experience to the low-vig, high-volume options
in the space, and to deliver a beautiful,
easy-to-use experience.

BlitzPredict will also establish a reserve to
provide liquidity for bettors and traders. Where
and when legal, users will be able to use
BlitzPredict tokens (XBP) to immediately collect
on successful wagers made with a sportsbook
or a prediction market. BlitzPay (instant,
guaranteed cash outs) can be activated by
wagering with XBP or using XBP to convert a
completed wager to a BlitzPay ticket. Users can
earn rewards by staking XBP to support the
BlitzPay Reserve.

Aggregator
PREDICTION
MARKETS

SPORTS
BOOKS

The BlitzPredict Aggregator will constantly pull
updated lines from sportsbooks and prediction
markets, delivering them to our users in a
streamlined format. Instead of displaying “New
England -7 -110 / Buffalo +7 +110,” users might
see “New England -6.5 -110 / Buffalo +7.5
-110” where the odds for this game are coming
from two different sources.
Users will have the option of viewing prediction
market contracts through either American or
Decimal odds. E.g. New England is trading at
67% on Gnosis, users viewing American odds
would see New England -205 (accounting for
the vig). In a scenario where the best odds for
New England at a traditional sportsbook are
-220, users using the Aggregator would see the
-205 option and be able to place their bet at
Gnosis.
The Aggregator will be extremely customizable
but the main premise is to ensure our users
always get the best line available for an event.
Users will be able to store their information in
order to quickly engage with any sportsbook in
the Aggregator, whether they have an account
there or not. Users can bet through smart
contracts, make traditional deposits, or use
BlitzPay to ensure immediate payment.

Liquidity
Where and when legal, XBP can be used to
wager at partner sportsbooks and platforms.
Any wagers made using XBP will have BlitzPay
automatically activated - no waiting for payouts
upon completion of the event. Users betting in
other currencies (USD, BTC, ETH, etc.) will be
able to use XBP to activate BlitzPay after an
event is completed.
BlitzPredict’s reserves will be publicly audited
and verifiable by independent third parties.
BlitzPay can only be activated when there is
enough in the BlitzPredict reserves to cover the
wager. Anytime BlitzPay is activated, tokens are
removed from the reserve so tokens can’t be
double-spent.

build a track record of prompt payments. If a
vendor reaches its cap of the maximum BlitzPay
reserve active at once, then BlitzPay will not be
available with that vendor until the debt is paid
down.
We will encourage partners to adopt smart
contract betting solutions – where both the
vendor and the user enter into a smart contract
agreement that resolves immediately upon
completion of the event. In addition, we will
encourage open, auditable finances so we can
increase the portion of the BlitzPay reserve
available for that vendor.

BlitzPredict will be buying and selling XBP to
maintain our reserve. When a user activates
BlitzPay, we will pay him immediately from our
reserve. Then, when a BlitzPay contract gets
paid by the vendor (sportsbook or prediction
market), we will purchase tokens to replenish
the reserve. In addition to our reserve, BlitzPredict users will be able to earn rewards by
staking XBP to support the liquidity pool.
BlitzPredict will implement a Bancor Token
Relay to provide added liquidity for our users,
allowing them to instantly purchase or liquidate
XBP in exchange for any other token in the
Bancor Network. Prices are calculated by the
smart token so buys and sells will use the same
current price.
Sportsbooks can take weeks to pay out wagers
and even default completely on their obligations. Users can activate BlitzPay to ensure that
they receive their winnings immediately upon
completion of the event. We will track payment
times from all partner operations and our
formula for pricing BlitzPay will change
depending on the expected wait time and
chance of default at a partner operation.
Vendors that prove customer deposits are kept
in segregated accounts will have access to
larger BlitzPay reserves, along with those that

BlitzPredict White Paper

More advanced users can benefit from applying the Kelly Criterion. As the Kelly Criterion
proves, there are many times where paying a
slight vig for immediate liquidity results in
faster bankroll growth. Given discrepancies in
the marketplace, it’s common for the best odds
for each wager in a series of wagers to be
found at different sportsbooks or prediction
markets. Therefore, it’s important that a user
always has full access to all sportsbooks and
prediction markets.
Tying up money with one entity or in an unresolved contract can cause the user to miss out
on future +EV wagers, resulting in suboptimal
bankroll growth. In addition to added liquidity,
BlitzPredict users will be able to incorporate
proper Kelly betting strategy into their wagering strategy with our suite of advanced betting
tools.

Smart
Contracts
Smart contracts can power some of the best
use cases for blockchain prediction markets
and sportsbooks. Users can set up smart
contracts to automatically execute a wager
when certain criteria are met, bet alongside the
expert of their choice, escrow with sportsbooks
for immediate payouts, and store information
for immediate transactions in the marketplace.
XBP will be used to activate smart contracts.
Wagers made in XBP will automatically have
smart contract functionality enabled.
Case 1: We partner with a sportsbook to allow
for users to wager through a smart contract
with the sportsbook. Both the user and the
vendor escrow funds in a smart contract, and
the winner receives all funds immediately at the
completion of the event.
Case 2: A user signs up for a package of picks
from an expert. The user then enters some XBP
into a smart contract escrow and links to a
wallet or another payment option for the
wagers. Any time the expert recommends a
bet, the user’s smart contract automatically
executes the same bet for the user at a sportsbook or prediction market, using the linked
payment information (Users specify the amount
they want to wager per bet e.g. “1 unit = $10 or
.2 ETH”). If the expert wins over the course of
the package, he receives the user’s XBP based
on how many units were won. If he loses, the
user is returned all his XBP.
Case 3: : A user sets up a smart contract to bet
if a line reaches a certain number. E.g. the
current best line on the Patriots is -7 -110. The
user sets up a smart contract with the function
of “bet $550 on Patriots -6.5 -110 or better.”
The smart contract then executes if the line hits
6.5 at any sportsbook or prediction market.

up being deployed at several different vendors
due to volume restrictions. Users can also sign
up for live betting packages, including recommended hedging opportunities. Users can also
set up smart contracts to automatically bet
whenever a certain model recommends a bet
at a certain ROI or better. The BlitzPredict
Model Aggregator can be utilized in this
fashion as well.
Users can store their personal information to
easily sign up for various sportsbooks and store
their payment information (fiat or crypto wallet)
to easily deposit and/or exercise smart
contracts when their terms are met.

Anytime the expert
recommends a bet,
the user’s smart
contract automatically executes the
same bet for the
user at a sportsbook or prediction
market, using the

In the event of large wagers or smart contract

Analytics
Community
Sports analytics is fragmented. Analytics are
walled off – various sportsbooks, betting syndicates, sports teams, and other entities have their
own analytics teams and don’t share information
with each other. This fragmentation results in an
inefficiency where various tribes are independently working to solve the same problem.
E.g. Sports Betting Syndicate A and Sports
Information Site B are all trying to build an NFL
model in-house, with no outside collaboration.
Sports analytics is popular, but there is no
community where enthusiasts can participate
and be rewarded for their contributions. Also,
sports betting “experts” aren’t held accountable
for their predictions. Experts can lie about their
results or claim they made a bet at numbers that
were never available to the public.
To deliver quality sports analytics to consumers,
we are building a platform that will incentivize
sports analytics experts and enthusiasts to share
their models and picks, and contribute to
community projects. Users must spend XBP to
access an expert’s information. In turn, experts
will earn XBP for providing access to their
information. Over time, the market will reward
quality predictions and avoid inferior information.

BlitzPredict White Paper

We will provide a community for both sports
analytics enthusiasts as well as users who are
interested in accessing the information. Experts
who contribute to the platform will be rewarded based on how popular their predictions and
models are. All predictions will be
time-stamped and must be made using actual
odds available in the market - no forging
records.
Experts must stake a certain amount of XBP to
list their picks or submit a model. This will help
increase the quality of contributors and help to
prevent abuse like automating 10,000 expert
profiles, relying on variance to produce a few
profiles with outsized returns. Therefore, it is
imperative that experts have “skin in the
game” alongside the users they are providing
information to.
There is strong consumer demand for quality
sports analytics, but, due to the myriad walls
built up in this space, along with the general
lack of accountability (it’s easy to lie about one’s
record), it’s difficult, if not impossible, for
consumers to access quality information.
We will pair our tech team with the sports
analytics community, using machine learning to
analyze the data produced to develop powerful
consensus models along with our own proprietary models. The resulting analytics will be
delivered to consumers via streamlined products.

Tournaments
BlitzPredict will use a portion of the company’s
XBP holdings to sponsor tournaments where
users can earn free XBP. Some tournaments will
only be available to users who agree to lock up
a certain amount of XBP over a specified
timeframe.
We will also sponsor tournaments, where
experts can share their models over a certain
duration (e.g. an NFL season) and be rewarded
for accurate results. Community members
wishing to encourage development of models
in certain disciplines can also choose to sponsor tournaments by escrowing XBP to be
awarded to the most accurate predictions over
that timeframe.

Example 1: BlitzPredict offers a contest for
Week 15 of the NFL season, only open to users
with holdings of at least 500,000 XBP for at
least the previous 30 days, awarding 3,000,000
XBP to the users with the most accurate
predictions against the spread. The most
accurate predictor receives 1,000,000 XBP, the
second most accurate predictor receives
500,000 XBP, and so on.

Example 2: BlitzPredict creates a contest,
awarding 1,000,000 XBP to the 5 most accurate
models over an NFL season. The tournament
will be run in our demo environment and each
participant will be given 10,000 play chips to
wager with. Each week, the models will test the
outputs of their models against the BlitzPredict
Aggregator. Experts can use Kelly or other
betting strategies and at the end of the season,
the prize pool will be awarded to the winners.
Example 3: A user wants to access a powerful
NHL model and wants to incentivize experts to
work together to create one. The user agrees
to escrow 500,000 XBP in a smart contract, and
reward 100% to the winner as a bounty for the
best model. This top-heavy payout structure
could incentivize multiple NHL experts to
combine their models and work together
toward receiving the reward. Also, users with a
shared interest in a model’s development can
pool resources to run a tournament with a
larger payout to attract a higher caliber of
expert.

Syndicates
Users will be able to back syndicates on the
BlitzPredict platform. A syndicate will be
comprised of an expert or group of experts.
Similar to a hedge fund or a venture fund,
experts with proven track records will be able
to solicit contributions from token holders
looking to profit from investing in winning
sports bettors. Experts will be able to set
parameters including min and max fund size,
betting strategy, and distribution strategy.
All expert predictions will be recorded on the
blockchain and publicly verifiable so potential
investors will be able to verify the track record
of the expert they are considering investing
with. There is precedent in the United States
for such funds: sports betting hedge funds can
legally exist in Nevada, solicit investors from all
over the world, legally place bets at Nevada
sportsbooks, and share the profits with their
investors.

BlitzPredict
Token

The XBP Tokens will be used to access certain
features of, and to reward contributors to, the
online platform once it is developed and in
operation. They do not represent an equity or
other interest in the business of BlitzPredict.
BlitzPredict does not intend to create a
secondary market for trading XBP Tokens and
they should not be considered as an
investment.

BlitzPredict will create 1,000,000,000
BlitzPredict Tokens (XBP) - ERC20 tokens.
BlitzPredict will never create more tokens.
300,000,000 XBP will be offered for sale to the
public. Unsold tokens will be burned.

The XBP Tokens are not backed by any
physical or other assets.

Token
Economy
Tokens will be used to implement various
functions of the platform. In addition, tokens
can be staked to support various functions of
the platform.
When a user or expert makes a bet at a partner
site in XBP, BlitzPay will be automatically
activated and the user will receive his winnings
immediately upon conclusion of the event. If
the user or expert bets in fiat currency (or BTC,
ETH, etc.) they will have the option to activate
BlitzPay after an event by spending XBP.

Smart Contracts can be activated using XBP.
Users can use XBP to activate smart contracts
to: automatically execute a wager when certain
criteria are met, enter a smart contract with
sportsbooks for immediate payouts upon
completion of an event, or automatically bet an
expert’s recommended wagers.
Users can use XBP to purchase information
from experts, and to automatically execute
contracts alongside an expert’s predictions.

BlitzPredict White Paper

Experts must stake XBP in order to submit their
picks or models. Experts can earn XBP from
users who are interested in accessing their
information.
BlitzPredict will develop its own models and
offer a consensus of the best-performing
models on its platform. Users can access these
models with XBP and BlitzPredict will share the
proceeds with contributing experts.
Users must stake XBP to enter certain tournaments. Users can support the BlitzPay Reserve
by staking XBP to enhance liquidity. Experts
must stake XBP to track and share the records
of their models or picks.
Revenues will be allocated to the operation of
BlitzPredict’s business, strategic partnerships,
community projects and tournaments, and the
liquidity reserve.

When a user or
expert makes a bet
at a partner site in
XBP, BlitzPay will
be automatically
activated and the
user will receive

Timeline
These are our primary milestones but the order in
which we accomplish them will depend on market
forces, partnerships, the regulatory environment, and
feedback from our community. We will update the
community with progress towards these milestones
and solicit community involvement in aligning our
goals with the market as it evolves. In addition to
traditional sports, we will look to expand into
eSports, crypto markets, politics, and other markets
that our users support and the blockchain prediction
markets serve.

Quarter 1, 2018
Launch live production platform operating on the public
blockchain. Will include the smart contracts surrounding
the flow of information from experts to users. Begin
strategic hiring for future development.

Quarter 2, 2018
Launch a sportsbook and prediction markets aggregator.
Release a beta platform featuring the liquidity pool and
smart contracts surrounding automated betting behavior.

Quarter 3 & 4, 2018
Activate liquidity pool and implement smart contracts
surrounding automated betting behavior in legal
jurisdictions where we have regulatory guidance.

Quarter 1, 2019
Implement machine learning database to analyze the data
that passes through our platform. Begin community
modeling projects with our network of contributors.

Quarter 2, 2019 & Beyond
Continue to scale our tech and operations teams and
expand partnerships with prediction markets and
sportsbooks.

BlitzPredict White Paper

Legality
Given that blockchain and sports betting laws
can vary wildly between countries, it is imperative to follow the laws in each jurisdiction
BlitzPredict operates in. Certain functions of
the platform, like interacting with sportsbooks
and betting with smart contracts, may not be
available in all jurisdictions, such as the United
States.
There is a lot of momentum for legalized sports
betting and there are several reasons why the
United States federal ban (PASPA) might be
overturned soon: NFL ratings are down,
subscribers are fleeing ESPN, advertisers want
engaged viewers during live events (no fast-forwarding), Government may see it as a ‘win’ of
additional revenue, the majority of citizens
already support legalized sports betting, the
past and present NBA commissioners, and
owners such as Mark Cuban publicly support it,
and several states (CA, DE, MD, MI, NJ, NY, PA,
WV) are pushing bills to legalize sports betting
and/or repeal PASPA. Most importantly, the
Supreme Court has agreed to hear NJ’s
challenge to PASPA.
Operating in the light will be an advantage for
the network effect of our platform. Experts can
contribute without fear of the U.S. government
shutting down the project. BlitzPredict will be
positioned to access a large pool of sports
bettors and analytics enthusiasts when sports
betting is legalized in the U.S. BlitzPredict will
obey all US laws and SEC guidelines, along
with all laws in each jurisdiction we operate in.

Geoff Freeman,
President & CEO of the American
Gaming Association

p. 15

Competition
There aren’t currently any direct competitors
but there are several indirect competitors and
we anticipate additional groups coming into
this space as well. One of the competitors in
blockchain prediction markets will likely be
arbitrage syndicates – groups that look to buy
up contracts at a 1-2% discount to provide
liquidity to customers that don’t want to wait to
receive their funds in the traditional payout
timeframe. The notion of arbitrage is foreign to
most bettors, and we plan to offer a simpler
mechanism for our users to achieve liquidity.
There is no shortage of touts and affiliate sites
in the sports betting space. There is no real
accountability - touts can misstate their records
and some affiliate sites manipulate data to
create inaccurate records. In a fractured market
rife with misleading statements by “experts,”
BlitzPredict plans to bring accountability to
sports betting with time-stamped predictions
against real market odds. Requiring experts to
stake BPZ in order to submit their picks or
models should help guard against fraud and
abuse.
Most traditional affiliate sites, like Covers and
Sports Insights, tend to have web-based, early
generation platforms. They currently have
communities of contributors but no way for
them to get rewarded. Aggregators like
OddsChecker have a regional focus and do not
include blockchain platforms. Ultimately, our
success will be determined by the strength of
our platform and personnel, network, predictive models, and the diversity of the markets
that we address.
It’s important to note that prediction markets
like Gnosis and Augur, as well as sportsbooks
and other betting vendors, are not competitors. Our goal is to drive business to these
platforms and open them up to users who may
not otherwise use them. As these companies
succeed, so will BlitzPredict. We plan to
collaborate with these companies with the
common goal of bringing blockchain technology to the masses.

Risk Factors

develop and manage an online aggregator
with smart contract functionality.

There are several risks associated with the
advance purchase of the XBP Tokens, including
the following:

The development of the Platform will be
adversely affected if members of its
software development team do not continue
to participate in its development.

The XBP Tokens will have no value if the
Platform is not completed.
Purchasers of the XBP Tokens in the pre-sale
will receive the XBP Tokens upon completion of
the anticipated public sale. The XBP Tokens will
only provide the right to use the Platform once
it is completed. If the Platform is not completed or if, when completed, the Platform does
not operate as planned, the XBP Tokens will
have no value and the holders of the XBP
Tokens will receive no refund. The XBP Tokens
are not backed by any physical or other assets.
The proceeds received from the XBP Tokens
will be used by BlitzPredict to pay salaries and
fund the development of the Platform and all
other BlitzPredict expenses and will not be held
in escrow.
Sportsbooks and prediction markets may
block access to their platforms.
The success of the Platform will depend upon
BlitzPredict’s ability to access the sportsbooks
and prediction markets necessary to provide
the information to users of the Platform. There
is no assurance that the BlitzPredict Platform
will have access to those platforms.
BlitzPredict and its management have no
history of operating an online aggregator
and their experience may be inadequate or
unsuitable to manage the Aggregator.

The development of the Platform depends on
the continued participation of BlitzPredict’s
software development team. The withdrawal of
one or more members of that team could
adversely affect the development of the
Platform.
BlitzPredict will need funds to develop the
Platform in addition to the proceeds expected from the private pre-sale of the XBP
Tokens and there is no assurance that
BlitzPredict will be able to sell additional
Tokens for that purpose.
BlitzPredict will need funds to develop the
Platform in addition to the proceeds it expects
to receive in its initial private pre-sale. While
BlitzPredict expects to raise those funds from a
public pre-sale and a public sale in January
2018, there is no assurance that it will be able
to successfully raise those funds.
Token sales have come under malicious
attack from hackers and other parties
resulting in the theft of Tokens.
Token sales have come under malicious attack
resulting in the theft of tokens and substantial
losses to platforms and the purchasers of
tokens.

BlitzPredict and its management have no
history of past performance in managing an
online aggregator like outlined in this white
paper. While BlitzPredict has successfully
developed and deployed its DFS mobile
application, that is no indication of its ability to
