Building a Programmable Business Society

1. Ultrain Vision
1.1 Core Vision of Ultrain
The advent of the information revolution is driving businesses to expand borders and
streamline processes. We are witnessing the unfolding of a brand new business society, where
all things are increasingly visible, interconnected and exchanged, we call this a “programmable
business society.” In this society, the commercial logic of trillions of business transactions that
take place daily will migrate from traditional to smart business contracts, which are
automatically executed and realized through the control and delegation of resources in the
Internet of Things (IoT) by blockchain. Decision-making during the automatic execution
process will increasingly be driven by decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) that operates on
the blockchain. This will take over most of the computational and decision-making tasks,
enabling highly efficient and reliable automated processing.

This business approach will be widely used across various fields, such as public utilities,
transportation, manufacturing, medical care, agriculture and finance, to significantly reduce the
cost of business operations. The greatest advantages are zero trust costs, automation and
intelligence.
In this business ecosystem, the organization structure will be more flexible, agile, autonomous
and self-disciplined. People come together, motivated by a common goal; the organizational
goals and incentive mechanism are open, transparent, consensus-driven and automatic,
participants voluntarily and autonomously contribute abilities and resources to promote the
realization of goals, hence lowering corporate governance and operating costs.

5 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

Furthermore, the business rules and logic driving inter-company transactions can become more
dynamic and smarter with the use of artificial intelligence; the development of blockchain
technology will result in a fairer and more reasonable distribution of commercial interests in a
transparent manner. The use of smart contracts will significantly lower the need for trust capital,
allowing transactions to be completed with zero trust costs.
This business ecosystem comprises several business elements. Overall, it consists of three
parts:
• The technology layer, consisting of integrated infrastructure services based on public
blockchain, AI, and IoT.
• The horizontal services layer, aggregating organizations which provide various
decentralized business services, including banks, insurance, loans, etc.
• The vertical application layer, containing numerous decentralized application services
that serve many users and can be implemented in multiple industries, including
scientific research and development, manufacturing (such as machinery and textile),
logistics, retail, finance, culture and entertainment (education, literature, intellectual
property and gaming), pharmaceutical biochemistry, food, real estate, agriculture,
animal husbandry, fishing, services (catering and travel), etc.
The progress of this business society is achieved through technological advancement, with
blockchain, AI as well as IoT technologies as its backbone. While blockchain has the capacity
to transform the production relationship, AI will impact productivity, while IoT will reform the
means of production. Through the integrated application of blockchain, AI and IoT
technologies, this business ecosystem enjoys several advantages over the traditional business
environment: lower operating costs, higher operating efficiency and more transparent
distribution of commercial benefits. This can greatly enhance social production efficiency,
generate more value for the real economy and create a better society.
The vision of Ultrain is to advance the realization of a programmable business society.

1.2 Features of IT Infrastructure in a Programmable Society
Just as the industrial society depends on the infrastructure of water, electricity and coal, the
information society relies on the infrastructure of Information Technology. The foundation of
the programmable business society is a synthesis of blockchain, AI and IoT technologies.
Blockchain technology is key to this, given its role in building the trust and value delivery
network. At the layer above, AI needs to run on the blockchain to provide fair and efficient
smart decision-making services. For the layer below, the blockchain serves as the basic
infrastructure for value delivery, integrating and connecting IoT equipment and networks to
provide services to external parties.
In general, the blockchain infrastructure should have the following features:

1.2.1

Public Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network

At the heart of the programmable business society lies the programmable business consensus.
The key to the programmable business consensus is to shift the basis of trust from conventional
contracts to technology, with the latter ensuring the consensus agreement cannot be tampered
with, forged or destroyed, and is transparent and verifiable for all.
From the perspective of IT infrastructure, the entire network needs to be a public, open
peer-to-peer (P2P) network with no master-slave distinction and no special nodes. At the same
time, this needs to be a low-concentration network to ensure plurality of participants, which
will, to a large degree, ensure that no individual or small group of nodes can seize control of the
network, and also prevent attacks from people with malicious intent.

1.2.2

Support for Large-Scale Business Applications
7 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

Such a blockchain infrastructure holds the promise to support large-scale business applications,
achieving high performance and quality at a low cost; however, existing public blockchain
technologies have not been able to realise this. There are two main issues:
1. Low system trading performance: Let’s take Bitcoin as an example. The network
supports about 7 transactions/second, and verifying a transaction takes one hour. In contrast,
Alipay, a mainstream payment transaction system, accomplished a peak of 265,000
transactions/second on Double 11’ of 2017 (i.e. 11/11/2017). The latter is almost 40,000
times more efficient and clearly demonstrates that the current system is unable support
large-scale business applications yet.
2. Low smart contract performance: Existing smart contracts have the following problems:
a. Limitation on the number of lines of code in each smart contract;
b. Limitation on the execution time of smart contracts. Generally, the current smart
contracts need to be completed within a single consensus, which greatly limits the
complexity of these contracts;
c. Execution sequence of smart contracts. Existing smart contracts can only be executed
in a serial manner, while sophisticated business logic requires the parallel execution of
smart contracts.
The new public blockchain urgently needs to address the performance problem so that
blockchain can become a genuine IT infrastructure that supports large-scale business
applications.

1.2.3

Value Computation Enables the Real Economy

Currently, in order to maintain the security of the existing POW-based public blockchain
system, a large amount of its computing and electric power is used for hash value calculation.
This highly resource-intensive and low value-for-money approach is unsustainable. The new
public blockchain infrastructure requires lesser computation to support the operation of the
public blockchain system, which in turn, frees up substantial computing power, to be
re-organized and re-deployed for purposeful computation, empowering the real economy to
create social value.
As an IT infrastructure, it supports the realization of decentralized business logic, which is
crucial to the programmable business society.
1.2.4

User-Friendly Smart Contracts

In the programmable business society, a large number of conventional business contracts and
agreements will exist on the chain in the form of smart contracts. Therefore, the development of
smart contracts should be as easy as preparing PowerPoint and Excel documents; anyone
should be able to easily read, write and review smart contracts after some basic training.
However, the existing smart contract syntax is too complex. We need a new smart contract
language that is similar to the format of the human language, thereby making these contracts
more user-friendly and keeping learning costs for ordinary users low, ultimately allowing more
8 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

people to use smart contracts to serve different business scenarios and purposes.

1.2.5

AI Support

The programmable business society is a complex and comprehensive business ecosystem that
is driven by technology and built on the foundation of democratic autonomy. This ecosystem
faces numerous economic factors that need to be dynamically adjusted constantly to ensure
efficient performance of the economy. Traditional economic systems respond to such demands
differently: the planned economy adopts national macroeconomic means to regulate economic
parameters, while the market economy relies on the ‘invisible hand’ where efficiency is low.
For the programmable business society, there exists a more effective way to adjust relevant
economic variables dynamically through AI and increase the chances of system optimization.
To ensure that this regulation is fair, just, reasonable, tamper-proof and traceable, the AI matrix
group solution based on mathematic calculation that lavage on AI technology cannot be
provided by one or a few centralized service providers. The training and operation of the AI
matrix group should be completely based on the data on the chain, and the matrix group needs
to run completely on the chain. A super AI body can ultimately be created through an
autonomous learning process that harnesses knowledge gleaned from historical data and human
experience.
1.2.6

IoT Device Support

Another core feature of the programmable business society is the widespread use of IoT devices.
Transactions will take place on smart devices on a large scale, where value exchange and
transfer occur automatically on the basis of a machine consensus e.g., distributed energy.
Traditional IoT technologies, usually accompanied by redundant nodes and hybrid clouds, are
unable to implement effective value transfer under ultra-large-scale nodes. While
technologies such as the latest IoTA, which developed its new platform using mathematical
concept known as the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) or hashgraph are better for securing data
transmission between smart devices, value exchange between the devices cannot be guaranteed,
as there is no deterministic mathematical proof demonstrating that these technologies can solve
the double-spending problem. The value exchange must be implemented using the blockchain
technology.
For the IoT system, blockchain technology is equivalent to the operating system of a device.
Blockchain technology can integrate hundreds of millions of IoT devices into a common
software framework. Through smart contracts, data transmission and value transfer between
intelligent devices can be realized safely, reliably and efficiently. Simultaneously, the
computing power of individual devices can be effectively aggregated to form a large computing
pool to provide external services.

2. Core Functions of Ultrain
With Ultrain as the foundation, we are committed to providing a computing service called
trusted computing. Compared to traditional cloud computing, this is a brand-new computing
service model based on a blockchain architecture. Components such as CPU computing, GPU
computing GPU is optimized for taking huge batches and performing the same operation over
and over quickly, while CPU is idea for to handle few software threads at a time, memory
computing, hard disk resources, bandwidth resources and others, can all be included in the
scope and framework of this model. All these will take on the characteristics of blockchain
computing i.e. difficult to tamper with, cannot be destroyed, and are transparent and traceable
to
all.

This service is a blue ocean for businesses that need to establish business models with low trust
costs. Ultrain offers these unique features that facilitate trusted computing:
2.1 High-Performance Computing
With breakthrough innovations in cryptography, Ultrain established a new consensus
mechanism we call a random trust consensus framework. This new consensus mechanism can
increase performance 1000-fold in a fully decentralized network, utilizing only 1% computing
power of a traditional POW system, and still achieve the same level of security performance as
POW.
This consensus has the following features:
Feature 1: Completely decentralized architecture. A completely decentralized architecture
ensures the security of the public chain system. The network itself is a complete P2P network
without any special nodes.
Feature 2: Ultra-large-scale network cluster. Networking of more than 1 million nodes is
10 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

supported, and the entire network supports horizontal expansion while maintaining linear
growth in performance.
Feature 3: Multi-terminal support. In addition to nodes with a large computing power, various
smart devices including mobile phones are able to connect to our network, providing the
corresponding computing power for the entire network.
Feature 4: High-performance execution. For every blockchain system, the overall performance
is evaluated based on two premises: transaction performance and the confirmation time. The
new framework offers two consensuses that are specifically applied to the main and side chains
embedded in Ultrain1, ultimately enhancing the system’s transaction performance and enabling
efficient confirmation time.
Feature 5: Decentralization scalability design. We have fully considered the decentralization
issue2 in the entire architecture design with the intent to avoid the concentration of machines in
the mine pool. We envision a mining infrastructure to be more like an ordinary computer, which
can be placed in homes across the globe. This device could be used as a computer, but when not
in use, it becomes a node on the network and can perform mining functions to the benefit of the
owner. This is the design goal that Ultrain targets to achieve.
2.2 Trusted Computing Creates Value
A key idea in Ultrain is to liberate more computing power to create social value for the real
economy while ensuring the security of the blockchain. Through innovations in Ultrain
cryptography, only 1% of the network’s computing power is required to implement mintage
when a consensus is formed every round, and the remaining 99% of the computing power can
be used in trusted computing to manage services, such as CPU computing, GPU computing,
memory computing, hard disk resources, bandwidth resources and so on, for external parties.
1

Ultrain is composed of the main chain and side chains. The main chain is intended for guaranteeing the

security of the entire system and for secondary confirmation of the calculation result of the side chains.
Therefore, the main chain requires high transaction per second (TPS) performance, whereas the
confirmation time can be longer. A side chain is the running environment of a specific DApp and each
DApp can choose to form its own side chain. Since the side chains are the business system of real
services, they require a short and quick confirmation time but not high TPS performance. To meet this
requirement, the random trusted consensus framework offers two consensuses, one of which is applied
on the main chain, and the other is applied on the side chains. The performance of the main chain reaches
up to 20,000 TPS, and the confirmation time is 15 seconds. The TPS of the side chains ranges from 3000
to 5000, and the confirmation time is 1 second.
2

The centralization issue is actually a very serious problem faced by Bitcoin, Ethereum and others at

present. Because Bitcoin mining rigs deployed in a centralized manner for mining can generate excess
returns, there are only over 8000 external egress IP addresses available in the entire Bitcoin network (as
of November 2017), which is diametrically opposed to the original intention of a completely
decentralized network design.
11 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

The primary user of these computing capabilities is intended to be third party DApp developers.
By paying UGAS (which is a cryptographic token for service billing on Ultrain), such third
party DApp developers can enjoy services of equivalent performance and quality as cloud
computing, at only 25%–50% of the price.

2.3 Flexible and Sophisticated Multi-Token System
The prosperity of the public blockchain system depends on the prosperity of the DApps running
on it, and an important factor for the prosperity of DApps is whether the token economic system
of each DApp is reasonable and healthy. The selection and design of the token economic system
needs to match and adapt to the DApp business model, with the former designed to promote and
stimulate rapid development of the latter. However, token issuance of existing public
blockchains is too rigid. For example, an Ethereum smart contract pre-determines the total
token amount and once the contract is established, all of these would have been issued. This
will have a material impact on the regulation of the future business economic ecosystem of
DApps.
In order to solve this problem and better support the token economic system design of DApps,
Ultrain adopts the dual-layer token architecture system of Ultrain empowered project
token and UGAS.
Ultrain empowered project token is the generic name of the tokens issued by DApps running
on Ultrain, similar to ERC20 of Ethereum. Each Ultrain-based DApp can issue its own token
and set its own token monetary system according to characteristics of its business model, such
as inflationary, deflationary or mildly inflationary. Based on variations in the monetary system,
each DApp can choose different consensus mechanisms, including POW/POS/DPOS/POA/
RPOS, or establish its own consensus mechanism. On the basis of different consensus
mechanisms, an exclusive mining rig for the corresponding token can be produced in support of
the token issuance.
UGAS is a token that is used to purchase the necessary computing power for running smart
contracts on Ultrain. All smart contracts deployed on the main chain and side chains of Ultrain
12 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

can run only with UGAS. Similar to the “Gas” of Ethereum, UGAS is a charging and settlement
tool for Ultrain.

13 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

2.4 Consensus Building Mechanism for Mutual Confirmation
Central to the blockchain technology is the idea of decentralization. Decentralization means
that in a community of complete equality with no central authority, a group of people reaches a
consensus through negotiation to accomplish a goal agreed by everyone. In the blockchain,
there is technical consensus and business consensus.
2.4.1

Technical Consensus

In traditional network architecture, network development is controlled by the team that owns
the technology. However, due to the decentralized nature of blockchains, the blockchain
network is co-created by many parties, typically the miners that provide the host computers and
the R&D team that provides the blockchain software. If the parties cannot agree on the
development direction, it could result in the fragmenting of the network into multiple small
ones. This has already happened in both Bitcoin and Ethereum.
In the early stages of blockchain development, many in the community held on to the idea that
blockchains should not be tampered with. However, incidents in recent years such as Bitcoin’s
hard fork episode and the Ethereum DAO hacking incident, have cast a shadow over the
practicality of immutability. The focus is not on whether modifications should be allowed; the
key is whether modifications, when the situation calls for them, are guided by a central
decision-maker or by the network community.
To protect technical consensus integrity, we built into Ultrain’s network governance a special
feature that supports democratic voting.
2.4.2

Business Consensus

In a decentralized community, it is a complex and difficult task for members to set a goal and
accomplish it together. In reality, conflicts will occur during the process because no one can
independently propose a perfect solution to all problems. At the same time, waiting for
everyone to make a decision will be time-consuming. We refer to this as the non-deterministic
consensus issue.
In order to resolve this, we try to develop a participant-driven consensus building mechanism
on the basis of “mutual assurity”.
This concept is best illustrated during the Cold War where the United States and the Soviet
Union refrained from attacking each other, as it was assumed that the defending party has the
ability to respond accordingly, resulting in the certainty of destruction of both parties.
This “mutual assured destruction” doctrine guaranteed the balance and peace between the
14 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

United States and the Soviet Union. Ultrain hopes to build an effective participant-led
systematic mechanism so that all participants can contribute to building a better future together
without requiring a full consensus. We call this a “mutually assured consensus building
mechanism.”
Specifically, a participatory consensus building mechanism needs to guide participants to
consider, and make choices based on three core principles under the guidance of a coordinator:
basic principles, appropriate processes and the correct approach or tools. During this
decision-making process, all related designs or decisions independently made by the
participants are accessible to all, and can be revised and reused by others. This allows the
community to embrace more possibilities than the traditional decision-making process, at the
same time encouraging collaboration and co-creation, even if no complete consensus has been
reached.
With the assurance of blockchain technology, Ultrain hopes to popularize such values and
mechanisms within our community, so that the community can work and make decisions
efficiently.
2.4.3

Network Governance Based on Democratic Voting

In order to effectively implement technical consensus and business consensus at the technology
level, we have designed a network governance mechanism based on democratic voting. We
believe that people with more resources in the economic system are more concerned about the
health of the system and deserve to have a greater say.
Ultrain provides a common negotiation table for everyone in the community by means of a
reasonable and effective democratic voting method, allowing everyone to vote for a solution
that we ultimately need to choose. Such a solution will be automatically deployed and updated
on the network in the form of smart contracts.
These network governance solutions include multi-level design and integration of common
business goals, dynamic optimization of economic system parameters, dynamic optimization of
blockchain network parameters, restart mechanism during hacking attacks, penalty mechanism
against malicious behaviors, etc. The different governance solutions are determined by
democratic voting each time. The number of votes each person holds is assigned according to
the number of UGAS that he/she holds, and the voting results are coordinated and
automatically executed by the governance AI of Ultrain. In this way, we avoid autocracy, as
well as give full consideration to the opinions of all parties.
This hybrid advanced governance system adopted by Ultrain combines the power of the
community with AI and adaptive machines to make decisions. The system has operational
privileges unique to the virtual management system and can execute the submitted solution.
At the same time, when facing escalating cyber-attacks, the system has the ability to
continuously upgrade and evolve using AI and machine learning algorithms.
15 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

In terms of democratic voting, Ultrain has introduced a reward and penalty system that
operates through a credit evaluation scheme for each account. The initial credit value of each
account is conditional upon the initial number of UGAS in the account; thereafter, the credit
value is increased (if the vote is consistent with the voting result) or decreased (if the vote is
inconsistent with the voting result). This also encourages community participants to make
considered and responsible choices.

16 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

2.5 User-Friendly Smart Contracts
The biggest issue with existing smart contracts is that the learning curve is too steep and
learning to write them is a challenge. Smart contracts are typically based on the C++ language,
which is converted into a smart contract language through the removal of some key words. We
believe in the future programmable business society, the preparation of smart contracts will be a
technique similar to preparing PowerPoint or Excel files. Ordinary people should be able to
master the skill of writing smart contracts after some basic training. Ultrain hopes to use a
quasi-natural language approach to allow more people to master the writing of smart contracts
and apply it to their own business activities.
Based on this idea, Ultrain has designed a new programming syntax for smart contracts based
on the design of the JavaScript language, including providing standard code library support;
providing a series of standardized smart contract templates using the template technology; and
implementing smart contract formalization and colloquial programming practices using the
machine learning technology, thereby simplifying the learning process for the layman.

as ubot) has the following features:
•

Trustworthy AI: The AI model running on Ultrain utilizes data on the chain that is
obtained through the machine learning training platform on the chain, and operates in
the same machine learning training platform. Hence, the AI model has the
characteristics of immutability, non-destructibility and complete transparency, and can
be tested by all network users. This effectively results in a trustworthy AI model.

•

Socialized data contribution: With the development of machine learning, it has
become a consensus in the industry that more data is superior to better algorithms.
However, high-quality data is often in the hands of Internet giants. Small- and
medium-sized AI startups often have a difficult time obtaining a massive amount of
such data, which directly limits the further development and application of AI. By
using the token incentive mechanism of the blockchain, we can encourage the public to
contribute high-quality data over the blockchain platform for economic returns. As
such, a data contribution platform can be formed effectively for collecting and
accumulating a large amount of high-quality data to solve the data shortage issue AI
companies face, thereby laying the data foundation for creating efficient and reliable
AI services.

•

Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning refers to an unsupervised online
learning technology that evolved from theories including animal learning, stochastic
approximation and optimal control. During reinforcement learning, the ubot perceives
status information in the environment and searches for strategies to select the best
action. This causes a change of state and a delayed return value. The ubot updates the
evaluation function, completes a learning process, proceeds to the next round of
learning and training, and repeats the loop iterations until performance optimization is
achieved. The machine learning platform on Ultrain implements continuous evolution
and constant optimization of AI deployed on Ultrain by using the reinforcement
learning technology combined with more and more high-quality data obtained through
socialized data contribution, and it eventually achieves optimal performance by joint
effort of the entire network, gaining a unique competitive edge in numerous centralized
AI services.

In the first phase of the AI direction, Ultrain aims to build an AI service platform that is
economically driven, socially-involved and controllable.

Phase 2: Artificial Superintelligence Based on Deep Belief Network

2.7 Blockchain-based Value IoT
In the IoT field, one of Ultrain’s chief objectives is to achieve operational trustworthiness and
reliability of a single IoT device and between IoT devices as well as reliable payment
18 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

transactions between different IoT devices, by means of blockchain technology. Meanwhile, it
intends to implement firmware-level compatibility and unified external programming
interfaces of IoT devices by introducing the blockchain-level operating system.
The traditional module and clouding computing model will be difficult to sustain when
massive IoT devices are interconnected and interoperable. However, using edge computing to
implement self-organization and self-governance of nodes from the perspective of a single
computing node will be a feasible computing model. Therefore, there is a need to form a
unified abstract programming model beyond the IoT firmware.
An IoT node is usually a very small computing unit. Due to its power consumption
requirements, it is usually a computing unit with limited resources. Its memory and storage
space are both very small. It is difficult for such a node to participate in the consensus process.
The computing power required by the control node of an IoT device will come from edge
computing units, possibly gateways or routers. The specific application can be deployed in the
form of a smart contract on the chain, and the local network can be managed by using the
control unit to implement business interaction.

3. On-Chain Components of Ultrain
To provide comprehensive support and services to DApp developers and allow DApp
developers to develop applications more easily and conveniently, Ultrain, on the one hand,
offers comprehensive developer tools and development environment support; on the other hand,
it provides rich business components and functional components, including identity
authentication, credit system, oracle machine and zero-knowledge proof, on the chain, allowing
DApp developers to quickly build their own business applications. Most of the on-chain
components of Ultrain are developed by Ultrain’s technical partners. When using these
components to provide services, DApps will directly pay service fees in the form of UGAS, and
these fees will be paid to on-chain component developers.
Ultrain welcomes more technical partners to build more functional components on the chain to
optimize the DApp development system of Ultrain.

3.1 Identity Authentication Component
In vertical scenarios similar to healthcare and finance, when a user uses a DApp, the user
identity needs to be authenticated to allow the user to use the corresponding functions. The data
sources required for this identity authentication need to be provided by authorities. This
function is a universal requirement, which is rendered by Ultrain as a general functional
20 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

component.
Ultrain integrates a variety of universal and dedicated identity authentication components
according to laws and regulations of different countries to provide identity authentication
components of different levels, which have the following features:
•

•

•

Multiple identity authentication data sources
Data sources for Ultrain identity authentication are provided by different identity
authentication service providers. The authentication data has a series of distributed
trust sources, and different authentication methods are selected in different scenarios.
The identity information of all entities exists only in the provider of the specific
identity trust source. It will not be retained in Ultrain so as to ensure compliance and
privacy in all types of business.
Multi-level identity authentication
Different levels of authentication, such as mobile phone number verification, ID
information verification and real person authentication, can be selected to
authenticate the identity of a person in Ultrain based on the different requirements of
the application scenario.
Dedicated identity trust sources
According to business scenarios or laws and regulations, an entity in Ultrain can use
different identity trust sources, such as the eID of specific field or region, CA,
government, institution, school, company, community, individual, etc., to meet
different trust authentication requirements.

3.2 Credit System Component
In business transactions and activities, the credit system is the foundation of business
transactions and is a basic component of many DApps involved in business activities. Ultrain
has retained all historical records and information of account transaction activities. Authorized
by the user, the credit system service provider can rely on various types of consumption and
behavior data of the user on Ultrain, and, in combination with the financial information on
Ultrain, can comprehensively process and assess all data by using technologies such as cloud
computing and machine learning as well as model algorithms including logistic regression,
decision tree and random forest. Then it can objectively present the comprehensive score of the
individual credit status from five perspectives, including user credit history, behavioral
preferences, performance capability, identity characteristics and personal relationships, and
establish a unified credit system model for Ultrain accounts and for DApps. Accordingly, the
cost for establishing a credit system for each DApp is lowered.
3.3 Online and Offline ID Mapping Component
This component belongs to the smart lock field and relates to a smart anti-counterfeiting device
based on the smart contract and an anti-counterfeiting traceability method based on the
blockchain technology.
21 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

The goods can be easily replaced or counterfeited during the circulation process. It is difficult to
provide an entire set of systematic solutions to solve the anti-counterfeiting traceability
problem by using the traditional methods. The traditional password lock can guarantee that it
will not be unlocked illegally, but it has no decentralized trusted network such as the blockchain,
and it cannot implement large-scale commercial key storage and distribution. The customer still
cannot verify the real source of the goods because it is not traceable. The customer can neither
verify whether the obtained key is authentic nor confirm whether the password lock itself is
authentic. Criminals can fake a password lock as long as the lock can be unlocked using any
keys. The online and offline ID mapping component designed by Ultrain solves the product
traceability and anti-counterfeiting problem by using the two core technologies of cryptography
technology and smart contract technology.
• The cryptography technology guarantees the security of devices.
• The blockchain technology prevents commodities and owner identity information
from being tampered with and ensures continuous traceability of each related
operation.
• Smart contracts on the blockchain ensure the trustworthy circulation of smart
anti-counterfeiting devices and control information.
3.4 Oracle Prediction Market Component
The prediction market refers to a platform where people make predictions on future events with
clear results. People can predict promising results and receive rewards for the predicted results.
The incentive allocation depends on the final result of the event in which the parties
participated, and it follows a simple yet powerful rule: that is, those predicted accurately are
rewarded and those predicted wrongly are penalized. In order to win as much as possible,
people will make predictions as accurate as possible by using various methods, such as
information collection and mathematical modeling. According to the statistical law of large
numbers, the prediction accuracy is greatly affected by the number of participants. With a
sufficient number of participants, the prediction accuracy rate will be significantly improved.
An online prediction market that allows a sufficient number of people to participate quickly and
easily has great social value and significance. However, a centralized prediction market can
hardly gain trust from participants.
With the development of the blockchain technology, the public blockchain has become an
impartial and decentralized trust intermediary. Its features, including information transparency
and tamper-resistance, have made the blockchain a perfect running platform for the prediction
market. The natural impartiality of the blockchain makes the trust cost of running the prediction
market almost zero, and the realization of smart contracts further empowers the blockchain
with computing power that allows programmable dynamic calculation. Based on the huge
application potential of the prediction market, Ultrain cooperates with service providers to
provide the prediction market service component on the chain for direct use by DApps in need.

22 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

3.5 Zero-Knowledge Proof Component
The data on the blockchain is transparent and viewable to all people because of the
characteristics of the blockchain itself. In some fields in which data privacy needs to be
protected, such as finance and healthcare, this characteristic of the blockchain is obviously not
applicable. For example, patients clearly do not want their private healthcare data on the chain
to be viewed by all. This requires that the on-chain data should be easily accessible and
available when needed and that data privacy should be guaranteed. In this case, the
zero-knowledge proof technology is required.
The zero-knowledge proof originates from the minimum disclosure proof. Assume that P is the
entity that holds certain information and hopes to prove the fact that he holds the information,
and V is the entity that proves this fact. If a protocol proves to V that P does have certain
information, but V cannot deduce what the information is, we say that P has implemented the
minimum disclosure proof. In addition, if V knows no other knowledge except that P can prove
a certain fact, we say that P has implemented the zero-knowledge proof, and the corresponding
protocol is called the zero-knowledge protocol.
At this stage, the zero-knowledge proof technology is immature, and it mainly has the
following problems:
A. Complex use logic: Each proof logic requires a complex setup process during creation and
cannot be flexibly configured and used.
B. Large number of calculations and low performance: Zero-knowledge proof involves a large
number of mathematical calculations in the process of generation and verification. The
calculation load is very large, the run time is long, and the performance is low.
Ultrain provides an on-chain component based on zero-knowledge proof for scenarios that
require good data privacy protection. The zero-knowledge proof component of Ultrain has the
following features:
• Programmable: The zero-knowledge proof module can be customized based on the
business logic of users and can be flexibly configured.
• No setup process is required for any asset and any proof logic.
• Highly efficient: By software optimization and chip customization, Ultrain dramatically
improves the computing speed of zero-knowledge proofing on both the client side and
blockchain node server side.

4. Ultrain Economic Ecology
4.1 Introduction of Token System of the Ultrain Economic Ecology
UGAS is a tool for service billing and settlement in Ultrain with an upper limit of 1 billion
tokens. Further details, including economical parameters, will be disclosed after further
testing and adjustment is done on the public chain, when it goes online.
4.1.1
•
•

•

UGAS generated by mining: The generated UGAS is evenly distributed among all nodes that
participate in the current round of consensus.
UGAS generated by selling computing power: Assuming that the unit price of computing
power is 1 UGAS, in the first year, each node (mining rig) of which the computing power is
used obtains 1 UGAS for each unit of used computing power and obtains 0.3 UGAS for each
unit of unused computing power. Each year, the number of UGAS obtained for each unit of
used computing power is reduced to 80% of the previous year.
20% of the generated UGAS is retained by the Foundation for the maintenance and operation
of the Ultrain ecology. The smart contract will allocate 5% of UGAS to the development
team; 5% to the Hub leaders (See section 6.1 for the role of Hub leaders); and 10% to the
active users on DApp. In the event that there are issues relating to unfair allocation between
the Hub leaders and the DApp users, the community shall be polled to resolve such issues.

4.1.2

•

•

Generation of UGAS

Use of UGAS

Purchasing computing power using UGAS: A DApp running on Ultrain needs to purchase the
computing power for running its code using UGAS when its smart contract is running. Cost =
Amount x Price. Amount indicates the amount of UGAS to be consumed for this running,
and Price indicates the price of UGAS. Ultrain monitors the market price of UGAS by using
the Oracle machine mechanism and dynamically adjusts the price, ensuring that the operating
costs of DApps are maintained at a relatively stable level for a period of time.
Purchasing third-party services using UGAS: DApps running on Ultrain can purchase, using
UGAS, third-party services deployed on Ultrain, such as the authentication service, credit
service, and zero-knowledge proof service.
Obtaining tokens: All nodes (mining rigs) participating in mintage and computing must stake
a certain amount of UGAS to participate in the economic system of Ultrain.

4.2 Description of the Ultrain Economic Ecology
We opine that the value growth of the blockchain’s economic system is derived from the
process of value creation for the real economy, so that the economic system has solid support
and can maintain a positive, healthy and sustainable development. At the same time, such an
economy is sustainable only if all participants in the economic ecosystem can benefit in the
ecosystem.

In the entire Ultrain economic ecology, roles of participants include the miner, Ultrain
development and operation team, DApp developer, DApp user and tokenholders.
•
Miner: Miners earn UGAS by providing computing power resources of machines. There
are two types of mining in Ultrain. One is to provide computing power for mintage on the
main chain, and the randomly selected miner node will generate UGAS as an economic
incentive. The other is to sell the computing power of its own machine as the computing
power of trusted computing, and the machine randomly selected each round as the
machine that sells the computing power will get UGAS as an economic incentive. The
probability of random selection is based on the number of UGAS staked by the node,
machine credits and machine performance. A machine with a higher overall score has a
higher probability of being selected, but it is also ensured that a machine with a high
overall score will not always be selected, so that fairness is ensured.
•
Ultrain development and operation team: 5% of the UGAS output every year will be
allocated to the Foundation for maintaining and operating the platform, which will be
further distributed by the Foundation to the Ultrain development and operation team. This
guarantees that the Ultrain development and operation team has a stable and sustainable

income for maintaining and operating the platform.
Ultrain community: 5% of the UGAS output will be allocated to the Hub leader of the
most active community based on smart contract, amount allocated to different leaders
depends on the result of a poll held by the community.
Third-party service component developer: Third-party teams can develop third-party
service components that serve different purposes on Ultrain for DApps to invoke at
runtime. DApps need to pay UGAS as fees for use of the third-party services.
DApp developer: DApp developers develop their own DApps on Ultrain. To run the smart
contract part of DApps, they need to pay UGAS to Ultrain as the service fee before they
can use the corresponding computing power of Ultrain. DApp developers need to purchase
the corresponding UGAS from the digital currency exchange. UGAS is priced based on
the market pricing; 10% of the annual output will be allocated to the most active Dapp
developer, and amount allocated to different Dapp developers depends on the result of a
poll held by the community.
DApp user: Users of DApps pay for DApp developers for their use of the DApps. DApp
developers in turn pay UGAS to Ultrain as the service fee for use of the computing power
of Ultrain.

5.4 Usage of UGAS
UGAS is the foundation of the Ultrain economic system. Its main usage is as follows:
⚫ All nodes participating in mintage and computing must stake UGAS. During selection of a
mintage node or a computing power output node, a greater number of UGAS held
indicates a higher probability of being selected, however the law of diminishing marginal
utility applies.
⚫ UGAS needs to be paid as fees for use of the computing power of Ultrain.
⚫ UGAS needs to be paid as fees for use of the third-party service components on Ultrain.

6.2 Collaborating with Traditional Communities, Enhancing the Influence
The idea of decentralization did not come into being just because the blockchain emerged. With
the development of human society, the society will further evolve towards the protection of
individual rights, towards the respect of individual privacy, the protection of personal property
and the respect of individual rights and interests, and towards civil society. A civil society
promotes such elements as equality, autonomy, democracy and people-centeredness. It
advocates that a group of people who uphold the same values and ideas strive for the same goal
by means of autonomy and self-determination. This goal can be as large as establishing
autonomy consensus principles for a community, or as small as achieving a specific
implementation objective.
A famous example is the Christmas bird observation program in the United States.
The National Audubon Society (named in honor of John James Audubon 1785–1851, a famous
ornithologist, explorer and wildlife artist) is a non-profit non-governmental environmental
organization incorporated in 1905. All members participate in conservation activities by
donation or as volunteers. This community is committed to protecting birds and the
environment in which they live using science, advocacy, education and field protection in the
Americas, today and tomorrow. The community now has 23 international, national and state
projects, 41 natural research centers and nearly 500 local chapters. It has designated more than
2500 key bird protection areas and is working voluntarily for the common goal of protecting the
environment and birds.
The Christmas Bird Count (CBC) activities are conducted around Christmas every year. The
CBC data is completely open. Anybody can participate in CBC activities after paying US$5
(free for people under the age of 18), and can get a copy of The Birds of America. During the
event, at least 10 birdwatchers gather as an observation team, and all teams are distributed in
nearly 2,500 observation areas. Each team is responsible for an area with a radius of 24
30 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

kilometers, observing and recording the types and numbers of birds in the area. According to
official reports, in the 116th (2015–2016) CBC, 76,669 birdwatchers across the Americas
voluntarily participated in the event in 2,505 observation areas, and observed and recorded
2,607 species of a total of 58,878,071 birds.
“No other organization does the work Audubon does. It’s very well rounded and well run.”
—Julia A., member of Audubon.
A non-profit, non-government environmental organization has gathered volunteers with the
same hobby and goal to complete a task that even the government may not be able to
accomplish even if it consumes a lot of manpower, material resources, and financial resources.
Each bird-loving volunteer makes his/her own contribution in different ways. They are of
different ages, different races, and have different occupations. They stand up and speak in
public for birds, donate money online, feed the birds in the garden, go outdoors regularly to
observe and record birds, and participate in the annual CBC event. They even promote
legislation to protect birds and the environment. Bit by bit, they have accomplished the
accumulation that cannot be accomplished by any government department, forming an
invisible huge network, a network to protect birds and the environment in which they live. This
is the enormous power of spontaneously striving for the same hobby, same goal, and same
dream.
There are a variety of non-profit communities around the world that are similar to the National
Audubon Society, among which many non-governmental organization (NGO) communities
that pursue democratic autonomy or sharing communities with the core idea of knowledge
sharing have demands for decentralization. Ultrain hopes to unite these communities and
people and provide unique value for these communities through its own features such as the
decentralization design and polling mechanism. Meanwhile, the unique user-friendly smart
contracts of Ultrain can also benefit the community users with poor IT skills. On the other hand,
these community users with democratic ideals will also become a solid user group in the Ultrain
ecosystem.

7. Application Scenarios
7.1 Gaming Platform Chain
Based on the Ultrain architecture, a gaming platform side chain can be designed and game coins
can be issued. Game developers can develop games on this platform chain, and game operators
can operate games on the Ultrain platform. The interested parties on the platform include game
developers and operators, game players, Ultrain gaming platform, investors, downstream live
streaming platforms, event operators, etc.
The Ultrain game coins, issued by game developer under Ultrain’s help, are used as the
currency in circulation of the gaming platform side chain. All transactions are automatically
settled in the form of blockchain smart contracts. This guarantees the payments to all relevant
parties and reduces transaction costs. Each interested party of the platform can use the game
coins for cross-game transactions, and can exchange game coins for UGAS for transactions on
the main chain and other side chains.
• The gaming platform is the core portal that gathers game player traffic. It provides the
development environment and operation platform for game developers and operators and
offers a variety of game options for game players. The gaming platform pays Ultrain fiat
currency to Ultrain in exchange for Ultrain services, including but not limited to the
following: solving the data storage problem using the blockchain technology; solving the
data replication and desensitization problems using proprietary technologies; solving data
privacy issues using the blockchain zero-knowledge proof technology; and a series of data
services such as data access, data standardization, data association, etc.
• Investors can invest in gaming platforms and game coins.
• Game developers and operators can obtain game coins by selling games and game props.
Meanwhile, they can sell game copyrights, data and other information to live streaming
platforms, event operators and data analysts.
• Game players use game coins to purchase games, game durations and in-game pay props.
Similar to the existing Steam gaming platform, game players can purchase game currency
by using Ultrain fiat currency and can obtain game currency by means of in-game prop
sales or in-game prizes. They can also gain game currency by signing a contract with a
downstream third party in the ecosystem, such as a live streaming platform.
• Game live streaming platforms, event operators and data analysts can pay platforms or
game players with game coins in exchange for copyrights and data, which are then cashed
out through live streaming tipping, event advertisements and other means.
7.2 Healthcare Data Chain
Ultrain is now working with a number of healthcare big data service companies to promote the
construction of the healthcare data side chain. The healthcare data chain is mainly intended for
solving problems including lack of circulation and transparency of healthcare data in the
32 / 63

institution, the patient will receive a certain number of corresponding healthcare tokens.
The patients can use these healthcare tokens to purchase corresponding healthcare
services.
Healthcare service providers can provide basic physical data monitoring, nutrition advice,
chronic disease detection and other services to earn income. They can also take advantage
of the features of the blockchain technology to greatly reduce their IT costs, including data
storage costs, security costs, privacy protection costs, etc. Meanwhile, they can resolve the
healthcare data circulation and reuse issues through data exchanges, and can join the
alliance built up by the platform to provide one-stop healthcare solutions for patients
together with other service providers.
Healthcare data consumers, including insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies
and healthcare value-added service providers, can pay healthcare tokens to the platform in
exchange for authentic and valid data. By utilizing the continuously updating massive and
accurate healthcare data, insurance companies can effectively improve their actuarial
capabilities; pharmaceutical companies can solve the problem of lack of coherent data in
clinical trials of new drugs; and healthcare value-added service providers can offer patients
with tailored value-added healthcare services by accessing cross-domain data.
The big health data platform pays UGAS to the Ultrain platform in exchange for Ultrain
services, including but not limited to the following: solving the data storage problem using
the blockchain technology; solving the data replication and desensitization problems using
proprietary technologies; solving data privacy issues using the blockchain zero-knowledge
proof technology; and a series of data services such as data access, data standardization,
data association, etc.
The healthcare tokens are used for payment and settlement on the network. At the same
time, all transactions are automatically settled in the form of blockchain smart contracts,
34 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

which can protect the payments to all relevant parties, reduce transaction costs and create a
dynamic market.

7.3 Fan Economy Chain
China’s fan economy is now in an era of stratification and diversification. The value of niche
content (animation, music, movies, etc.) is gradually being appreciated and accepted by the
public. However, the agent system and multi-layer distribution system in the traditional cultural
and economic fields are confronted with many difficulties, including value centralization,
intermediary exploitation, proliferation of false information and single way of realization,
which seriously affect the normal ecological development.
There is little spontaneous communication between the traditional media and communities, and
traffic is dominated by mainstream and vertical media and communities. The lack of
communication between channels and monopolization of traffic has seriously affected the flow
of value of products in the cultural and economic fields (artists, IP, etc.), and most of the
product revenue is harvested by intermediaries and intermediary agencies. The
“decentralization” concept of the blockchain technology and the opened up fan behavior
data can completely subvert the current situation and patterns of the entire industry.
A fan economy chain can be developed based on Ultrain, comprising the information
registration system for public figures such as singers, and key opinion leaders (KOLs,
copyright registration and authorization system, data storage system, and information inquiry
and payment components. This side chain can issue fan tokens, issued by developers, as a
circulation tool for the economic system.
• Fans can pay fan tokens to purchase authentic video and audio files or exchange for
opportunities to interact with public figures. Performance companies can send
performance invitations to artists through this platform without intermediary companies
and agencies, saving costs.
• Copyright owners can select copyright purchase requests from all over the world on the
platform and collect deposits and follow-up revenues using smart contracts.
• The third parties are data users, such as performance companies, film companies or brands.
They can pay fan tokens in exchange for popularity data of various public figures and
copyrights as well as fan portraits, and choose suitable artists and IPs for various
performances, films and commercial endorsements.
• All copyright owners and public figures (or their studios) can upload information and
make “listed transactions” on the platform for free.
7.4 Sharing Economy Chain
A sharing economy side chain can be built up based on the existing architecture of Ultrain. One
of the characteristics of the sharing economy is disintermediation. The traditional sharing
economy has extended from the removal of intermediaries to the removal of small
35 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

intermediaries during the development process. Although the costs of intermediaries during the
transaction process have been reduced, the situation is still far from the ideal state of the sharing
economy. It is merely a realization of platform business for sale of the “right to use”.
The underlying architecture of the sharing economy built by Ultrain using the blockchain truly
enables direct peer-to-peer transactions between asset owners and asset users, realizing the
reconstruction of the business logic of the sharing economy.
The Ultrain platform can reconstruct the online ride-hailing platforms, short-term rental
platforms and other sharing economy models in the current market. Users can directly search
all house and vehicle sources on the Ultrain blockchain and filter out and display those that
meet their requirements. At the same time, all the transaction records on the chain will be stored
in a distributed manner to replace customer ratings. A favorable comment will effectively
improve the reputation of the house or vehicle source suppliers and shape their irrevocable
blockchain identities. With the resource sharing of IoT devices, bicycles, power banks,
homestay services, and the like can also join the sharing economy of Ultrain. Besides sharing,
you can also conduct data transactions. For example, you can make real-time data transactions
with data demanders by providing your vehicle data, real-time vehicle operation data, and the
like.
7.5 Logistics Chain
The Ultrain blockchain ecosystem can meet the four major demands of the express service
industry:
• Maintain ownership in high-value markets.
• Effectively record the asset transaction process and record the shared data by using the
blockchain ledgers.
• Provide high-quality data for any compliance audit requirements based on the
tamper-resistance feature of transactional data.
• Allow all participants in the industry to record and share data by using the blockchain
distributed ledgers in the data sharing scenario.
In response to the above four demands, the Ultrain ecological chain can support the following
four service scenarios:
• Express value insurance: In the value insurance scenario, when courier companies
transport goods, as the asset transactions are transparent, insurance companies can
effectively provide value insurance on goods. Merchants offer goods for sale, buyers
purchase the value insurance services, and the government conducts industry regulation.
Commodity value insurance is a contractual concept. When a customer signs for a parcel
properly, a claim settlement of the account is automatically triggered. The contract ends
normally and the premium is automatically liquidated. If a parcel has a problem or is
missing, the insurance claim process is triggered.
• Charity activities: For example, the “One Cent” Campaign takes one cent from the fees of
each charity parcel and donates it to the account of a charity organization. In this scenario,
courier companies still undertake the transportation of goods, charity organizations carry
out charity activities, and poverty alleviation merchants provide poverty alleviation
36 / 63

Building a Programmable Business Society

products for sale. The tamper-resistance and transparency features of transactional data
ensure the reliability of charity.
• Industry blacklist sharing: The security and reliability of couriers are a major concern.
Currently, offline blacklists are available inside the industry. By using the blockchain
technology, Ultrain allows each company to record the blacklist of practitioners on the
blockchain. The data cannot be modified but can be queried by other companies. It allows
you to trace information such as which company a person on the blacklist worked for and
what the misconduct was.
• Express security regulation: Courier companies are usually equipped with security
inspection machines, and the government also wants to know if there are any
transportation security risks in each logistics company. The distributed ledgers of Ultrain
allows each courier company to record useful information of security incidents on the
blockchain when such incidents occur, so that regulatory authorities can monitor the
information in real time but cannot tamper with it.
The courier industry is trying the “federalism” system through the blockchain. “Federalism”
refers to a composite organization consisting of two or more organizational entities, and
members of the organization follow the conformity contract in the system. “Federalism” is
different from the traditional franchising model. The biggest difference between franchising
and “federalism” lies in the generativity basis. Franchising is about cooperation and co-creation
by bringing in external participants; it features exogenous weak links and longitudinal linear
control. The intervention of the blockchain transforms the franchising model into federalism,
which encourages all partners to enhance their links and cooperation by means of features
including effective data sharing, tamper-resistant data and distributed ledgers.
7.6 Sports Chain
Ultrain is working with partners to build a vertical blockchain side chain in the sports industry.
By integrating with the side chain, smart wearable hardware devices can effectively monitor the
exercise status, daily heart rate, sleep, blood pressure, blood oxygen and other data of users.
Meanwhile, DApp developers can assign exercise tasks to users, and users can complete the
exercise tasks and burn corresponding calories to get mining opportunities, so as to obtain the
encrypted equity assets. This encourages users to love sports and reap the benefits of both
wealth and health. The incentive method can guide users to keep away from sub-health status
by exercise, and it supports various exercise forms and allows users to simultaneously record
multi-dimensional exercise data such as walking, running, cycling, mountain climbing and ice
skating.
