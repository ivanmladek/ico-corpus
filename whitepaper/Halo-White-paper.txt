Introduction
Peer-to-Peer cryptocurrency usage is increasing at an exponential rate. Halo Platform
aims to be a keystone of the crypto ecosystem by creating a robust, fully encompassing
platform that fuses the finest parts of the cryptocurrency world together. This in turn
will make everyday life for the beginner, amateur, or veteran crypto user easier in many
ways.
The team has a vision of expanding the nature of cryptocurrency with a constantly
evolving platform that grows with the needs of the users. This serves the people, and
derives its value from the respective success of each user on it’s platform.
Each individual in the Halo Platform represents a new link in the ecosystem, creating
strength and value within a safe platform and utility. The side effect of helping them
with their own growth and promoting their own self-interest, is that it in turns creates
additional value to and growth from using the Halo Platform.
The deployment and maintenance of Halo Platform will be orchestrated by top-tier
cloud consultants who are leaders in their field, empowering everyone with solid crypto
management capabilities. The security and cloud-based load balancing will also bring a
new, refreshing aspect to traders and investors looking for uninterrupted market
access.
The Halo Marketplace and Business Tools features add a smart and empowering
dimension to the crypto ecosystem. The Halo Token Hub additionally will allow users to
create their own tokens in a safe, secure, and consensus-driven environment for quality
assurance.
The Halo Platform will be served by its own low-latency blockchain which will utilize a
Zero-Transaction-Fee protocol so that when a user sends 1 HALO, the other party gets 1
HALO, period. These advantages, coupled with highly unrestrictive smart contract
deployment limits mean that our blockchain can provide for a seamless experience
between platform features and creates almost endless opportunities for new ones.

The Halo Masternode System
The Halo Masternode system comprises of a four tier system. This system distributes
transactions and allocates data processing in a structured design.
Front Running Invulnerable
Front running goes back to the days of using paper to trade stocks. People would have
large orders and run their trades in front of the large order. This would create major
opportunity for the ‘front runner’. Some tokens and coins are vulnerable to this same
sort of issue with users putting their transactions in front of larger transactions. The
Halo Platform is immune to this issue.
All transactions in the Halo Platform are processed by the Masternode system. The
Masternodes have no access to change headers, and all transactions are handled FIFO
(First In First Out). When a Variable Demand Transaction Block is produced, each tier of
Masternode independently validates that no headers, transactions, or timestamps have
been altered, creating an internal peer consensus. Once a transaction is submitted then
all other new transactions will be submitted after the fact, sono one individual or system
can push a transaction to the front of the queue - only close out the current transactions
for confirmation to the blockchain.
Masternode Tiers
The Halo Platform masternodes are tiered processing hubs for transactions across the
platform. Halo Currency is minted at a rate of 30,400 Halo every four minutes and
distributed across the masternodes within an 8 to 24 hour window from the previous
distribution.
In addition to these distributions, masternodes also receive a portion of service fees
generated across the platform at a rate commensurate with each tier.
Below is a graphic that outlines the masternode system tiers.

The Halo Platform team also manages an “Archnode” which has a reward of 800 Halo
every 4 minutes and service fee reward of 42.5%. Currency generated from the
Archnode is reinvested back into Halo Platform to further ongoing development and
offset operating costs.

Halo Dashboard Smart Features
No Transaction Fees
Gone are the days where you have to make sure you have enough currency to pay the
gas to send someone a transaction. If you send someone 1 HALO then they will receive
1 HALO. This is possible because our masternode system will be always available to
handle transactions and provide consensus. The smart contracts will have public and
private variations that control gas usage. Public contracts will use gas, and private will
not. These are discussed in detail in the DAPPSTORE and SDK sections of this paper.
Safe, Instant, and Anonymous Sending Fees
These three sending features will incur a small fee as they are not your typical method
of sending funds.
Safe
This sending feature will validate the address being sent to, to make sure it is
valid and able to accept funds. If it is, the contract will send the funds. If it isn’t,
the funds are safely returned back to the sending address.
Anonymous
This sending feature will mask the sending address to protect where the funds
came from.
Instant
This sending feature will instantly create a new block to be validated and sent up
the tier list of masternodes. Using this for quick payments faster than normal
blockchain transactions.
Halo Token Hub
Some exchanges offer the ability to create tokens, but when not regulated in the proper
fashion, new tokens can be confusing to the users and bad for the ecosystem. Our goal
for Token Hub is to be the new standard in ICO creation. With support for ICO launches

Page 9/26

​ ttps://www.haloplatform.tech/​ ©
​ 2019 Halo Platform - ​ G
​ o To Table of Contents

from resources, to escrow funding, to community consensus for quality and launch
process. We will be including this and more!
Our community-governance and oversight model gives new tokens a more solid vetting
process from the Halo community, in addition to the support in creating the token. This
gives the community more peace of mind about new ICOs and projects evolving.
Halo Business Tools
Send or receive payments in crypto instantly! We will also allow users to create
Checkout buttons for their storefront or for embedding on their own website or blog.
Users can accept payments for services and products, or tips and donations. Being their
own boss is a dream for many not only in the crypto ecosystem, and we aim to make it
easy. Accept payments, create products, invoice, and more! All done effortlessly with
our platform.
The new Halo debit card will provide users with an additional solid layer of functionality
with the option to utilize their funds in the cryptosphere or right at the gas station,
online, at the restaurant and more. This creates a solid, closed loop decentralized
transaction system independent of traditional banking slag.

Halo Marketplace:
The Halo Marketplace is a perfect compliment to the Business Tools section creating
an independent and secure place to do business intelligently. Halo will be the complete
crypto portal for this new multi-billion dollar industry, being utilized by newcomers and
veterans alike. This props up the crypto ecosystem and creates strong revenue to
bolster the Halo Platform’s growth for decades.
Spend Halo and other tokens for services, electronics, clothing, collectibles, jewelry and
more. Users can be both the customer and the merchant with the Halo Marketplace.
Halo Dashboard:
The Halo Dashboard is meant to give users instant access to nearly every feature they
might want with the flexibility they need. At the same time it allows users access to their
profile settings, security, API keys, account verification and more. With each user comes
a particular setup that works best for them, and we want the modular dashboard to be
easily reconfigurable to the user’s needs. Users can track every transaction made for
each wallet they’ve integrated, all in one place. One of our goals was to make things
easier for both veterans and newcomers alike, condensing the expansive universe of
crypto into one smart, decentralized control exchange (DCE) hub.
Halo Portfolio:
Real traders want zero trading lag when making serious moves in the market. Users can
track gains like a pro and can get SMS alerts instantly. Users can check their ROI from
holding monthly and yearly, track off-chain assets, and view their portfolio position in
BTC and other base currencies as well. Halo is the last crypto tool anyone will need.
The HALO portfolio section will also allow users to quickly ascertain current positions
and holdings with our secure integrations, with the flexibility to track alerts and gains
fast.
With the use of an external API key, you can bring in price quotes and functionality from
exchanges you have already used or want to use, including Halo’s own exchanges!

​ o To Table of Contents

Wallet Integrations:
Halo offers multiple wallet integrations so users don’t have to access five different
interfaces to get the info they need done fast. The Halo Wallet is meant to be the user’s
one-stop multi-wallet control hub. Users Import and control only the wallets and
accounts they desire. They can be utilized for creating smart contracts, voting on
consensus on Halo evolution, new features, and more. Our goal is to create a flexible
environment for all the tokens users want to track, with a secure and strong backend
backed by Cloud Hosting and top architects engineers in the field securing user data.
Halo Community:
Giving users the ability to use the Halo Platform friends and groups features to stay in
touch with and organize solid groups for discussion and signals is our goal. The more
power we put in the user’s hands, and the easier we make the interface, the more people
around the world will utilize the Halo DCE platform and increase its growth.
Halo Business Services:
We want to make a solid merchant processing platform as a key component of the Halo
cryptocurrency ecosystem. We want to empower our users to be their best in the
cryptosphere. Users will be in charge of their own pricing schedules with lower fees
than other digital storefronts. We will offer an array of tools to work with their crypto
store products, consulting, or other business services. These tools will be easy to
manage, easy to invoice, and easy to track with reporting and more.
Halo Financial Tracking:
No one has integrated a solid financial tracking and business tracking technology for
crypto users to date. More and more people are flooding into the cryptosphere daily.
Giving them an opportunity to provide services and consulting, track earnings, create
invoices, and estimates easily will be a great advantage for everyone. This is the future
of currency, and we want to be a part of the crypto user’s new business idea in every
way possible, every day.
Halo Smart Backups:
The importance of backing up not only private keys but also the spreadsheets, images,
conversations, screenshots, charts and the like was not lost on us. Making the backup
experience for multiple data formats easy is as strong advantage and utility for our
Page 12/26

​ o To Table of Contents

users. Keeping their data safe and secure is important to us and to a successful,
long-lasting platform.
Halo Pro Tools:
Pro Tools are items crypto users have all been asking for, for a long time. Finally we are
solving the problem by putting the tools they’ve been wanting and more all in one easy
place to use. When it comes down to having everything, we thought some tools would
be essential to the crypto ecosystem that both newcomers and veteran traders alike
could appreciate equally. We want users to be able to draw and share all the charts they
want, create spreadsheets, share them easily, and help with the evolution of tool sets on
Halo through feedback and consensus.
Halo Digital Currency:
The Halo coin is designed to be an efficient store of value for the system as it is both
tradeable on our platform and others, and it is generated by users on the platform in the
form of fees. Our masternode setup will be whale-resistant with smart, multi-tiered
architecture to incentivize top masternode experts to get onboard with Halo.
The HALO Coin is not an Ethereum token, it is a full coin with it’s own network.

Using Halo Digital Currency & Other Crypto
While we will be listed on exchanges and allow you to use the HALO currency within our
platform, we have some added benefits for Halo Platform members.
The Halo Platform Debit Card
Use our branded debit card internationally. We will be handling the crypto to fiat
conversion, and providing you a way to spend your crypto at the grocery store even if
they don’t specifically accept crypto. To help facilitate this process we have financial
sector team members with experience dealing with debit and credit cards.
ACH & SWIFT
Along with the debit card platform, we are offering the ability to transfer crypto into fiat
through ACH and SWIFT. Using standards and experience from the financial sector

Page 13/26

team members, ACH and SWIFT will be accepted at their respective countries and
institutions that support them.
Buying and Selling Crypto
Using the two methods above and the exchanges on our platform, you can buy and sell
cryptos which are not just Halo Prime. If you’d like to use BTC or ETH on your debit card
or ACH then feel free to do so. We will provide the tools and information necessary for
you to make it happen.

Halo Chat
Using the​ H
​ alo Chat module, Halo Platform will be including end to end, peer to peer,
encrypted chat messaging. Real-time quantum resistant encryption will protect
messages sent to and from users.
What is​ ​Halo Chat? It is an end to end encrypted messaging system that sends
messages using the decentralized Halo Platform Network. Using both on-chain
validation and off-chain speed it will be completely peer to peer, fast, and secure.
Halo Chat uses multiple layers of encryption to secure your messages and data. That’s
right it can also be used to send other types of data such as files.
Exchange
Halo Chat will integrate directly with the Halo DCE Platform to allow you to
communicate and interact with it directly from your chat. While it is directly integrated
to Halo DCE you can use an API key to integrate with other exchanges and add more
functionality to your chat room.
Video Chat
A direct peer to peer video communication network using the Halo Network. Host group
conferences and direct communications through the secure video chat.
Anti-Spam
Gone are the days of MEW spamming in slack. We are actively building in rules for
untrusted users messaging. We will build systems to collect and intercept spam
Page 14/26

​ ttps://www.haloplatform.tech/​ ©
​ 2019 Halo Platform - ​ G

messages before they go out to users. Giving the community admins the option to
ultimately delete/ban/pass through the messages as needed.

Halo Exchanges
Too often we hear the issues users have with extreme platform usage, such as losing
funds on shorts during platform outages, etc. Halo has been carefully architected with
the help of top cloud engineers, for a carefully load-balanced trading and platform
experience that you can count on when it matters the most. Being a singular one-stop
crypto control hub for users wouldn’t make sense without an Exchange - a place where
users can purchase and sell coins and tokens safely, securely, and most importantly,
easily. No matter what level of experience they have in the crypto scene.
Formed from an initial idea in early 2017 to add a relatively basic exchange as a feature
of the platform, the concept has blossomed into an ambitious project to incorporate not
just a more advanced trading interface, but what we believe to be one the most
advanced modern trading platforms, built for traders - by traders. A tall order in today’s
thriving and security-conscious landscape.
The exchange feature is split into two different projects, with two different use cases. In
short, the Centralized Exchange (HaloX) requires a common intermediary for
deposits/withdrawals, but allows for ultra low latency off-chain order execution, margin
trading and fiat pairings; whereas the Decentralized Exchange (HaloDEX) requires no
middle party or trust component, but orders settle on chain and execution usually takes
slightly longer.
Both projects have been created with the below 4 common goals in mind:
1. Ease of use:
One of the most important aspects of a trading platform is developing a robust and
intuitive user experience. Halo Platform exchanges will make use of tooltips, context
sensitive help systems and best design practices that will ensure our users have the
best possible trading experiences available to them.
2. Scalability:
Page 15/26
For latest version visit​ h
​ ttps://www.haloplatform.tech/​ ©
​ 2019 Halo Platform - ​ G
​ o To Table of Contents

Our technology stacks run on Public cloud provider hardware. We use cloud
technologies to easily deploy, integrate, scale and self heal failed services.
3. Security:
Security is our number one priority, so we’ve gone over and above the call of duty with
our security policy and given users a multitude of ways to secure their accounts. On the
back end, we have architected a complex cold-hot wallet storage/access mechanism to
secure funds whilst allowing for reasonable withdrawal times. And of course,
government grade encryption wherever needed.
4. Functionality:
Both exchanges have been designed with the trader in mind, which are bursting with
features that will allow you to trade to your peak ability.
Find on the following pages a high level overview of the features for both exchanges.

Allocation
The ICO generated 1,000,000 HALO Coins. Coins during ICO were sold at $10 / HALO
Coin.
In December 2018, the Halo network was forked and the coin was split at an 800:1 ratio.
Existing wallet balances, coin minting, and masternode allocations were updated to
reflect this change.
Over the next 20 years we will continue to release a supply of Halo Prime Coins into the
network. The release schedule looks like so:
● Approximately 8,000,000,000 coins in supply after 2 years.
● Approximately 16,000,000,000 coins in supply after 5 years.
● Approximately 32,000,000,000 coins in supply after 20 years.

Platform Technology
Some of the programming technology we will utilize to create the Halo DCE Platform:
Halo Wallet:​ The Halo Wallet will be built using Javascript and more specifically Vue.js.
Halo Coin:​ The Halo Coin will be constructed in the Go programming language.
Hosting:​ Halo will be load-balanced properly on cloud servers by core team engineers.
SSL Protection: ​We have designed an auto SSL generation and renewal system to
protect masternodes hosted by us, protect our exchange, and future proof with short
renewal periods to rotate SSLs frequently.

Generating Revenue / Growth
The Halo Platform will generate revenue via usage in multiple ways:
Platform Fees:​ Certain transactions done on Halo will generate fees.
Marketplace Sales:​ Flat percentage rate for merchants selling on the Halo Marketplace.
Masternode Distribution:​ Intelligent smartnode system for strong distributed
networking.
Note:​ The Halo token does not utilize proof-of-work and is therefore ​not mineable​.

The Halo DAPPSTORE
We will be building out additional tools and features for DAPPs on the Halo Platform.
Many of these will give DAPPs the ability to talk to other DAPPs, add additional
communication protocols, and increase security with encryption standards.
Included in the Halo Platform will be a DAPPSTORE of curated apps that meet our
stringent security and usability guidelines and requirements.
DAPPSTORE Users
Users will be able to trust DAPPs that are listed in the DAPPSTORE. Our users will also
be able to find and access DAPPs quickly and effortlessly.
DAPPSTORE Developers
Developers will have access to new tools and options, and increased exposure. Using
our standards developers can offer their DAPPs for free, for a flat price, or even for
monthly subscriptions.
DAPPSTORE Audited Contracts
Along with publishing DAPPs through the DAPPSTORE, developers will be able to have
their contracts audited, vetted, and published by the Halo Platform Dev team. While this
will incur a cost to the developer submitting a contract, the result will be a contract that
its state changes cost 0 (ZERO) gas. For more on this see the Halo SDK area.

The Halo SDK
The Halo Platform will be a diverse array of complete applications for users to control
their entire cryptosphere. To help support the diversity of applications, we are providing
both API’s and SDK’s to developers to extend the wallet, core applications, and provide
new applications to solve new problems in the future.
Included with the SDK will be a complete set of tools in addition to the API. The tools
are as follows:
Page 21/26
For latest version visit​ h
​ ttps://www.haloplatform.tech/​ ©
​ 2019 Halo Platform - ​ G
​ o To Table of Contents

Contract IDE
A complete development environment to test contracts on a private blockchain, test
network, or a client side VM.
Example Applications
If you need a quick jump start to developing on the Halo Platform, we will provide some
quick start applications that have everything setup and ready to go to start
development. We will include quick starts for Angular, React, Vue, and even Meteor.
Tooling
All of our core modules will be built on Vue, and we want to provide developers with a
stress-free way to interact with the Halo Platform. We will be providing typing files,
service dependency injection, and more. Expect a vast array of tools for developers.
JS API
We will provide a new layer of interaction with our wallet using a javascript API that can
be consumed by DAPPs. This API will allow you to interact with currently installed core
modules, modify theming and shortcuts for the wallet, modify theming for core modules
installed, and much more!
Test RPC Network
We know that loved feature for development in the community is the Test RPC option. It
allows you to do blazing fast testing without connecting to an actual private or test
blockchain. We want to help you take your app a step further and provide you with the
tools to do instant testing without waiting for blocks to be minted. The Test RPC will
take care of all those needs for you.
Browser Plugin
We are also developing a browser plugin to allow your DAPPs to be used outside of the
Halo Wallet. Users will be able to interact with your DAPPs using the main net, test net,
local private nets, local test rpc, or even through an embedded VM running inside the
plugin when needed.

Halo Domains
Get easy to remember domains mapped to your DAPPs so that your users can find your
site and index it easier within the Halo Platform DAPP network. This will be used in
conjunction with our new protocols for serving static files.
Gasless Contracts
The point of having transactions and state changes to a contract cost gas is to prevent
contracts from entering into continuous loops and causing malicious problems. This
helps keep contracts within the bounds of the network and prevent scaling and timing
problems. To keep these same checks in place we are still going to require gas on
public contracts. Just like contracts today, anyone can publish a public contract.
However we are going to offer a unique feature to developers and token creators. If you
wish to submit your token code to a security audit, and it passes, then your token can be
published by the Halo Platform developer team as a private contract. Private contracts
can only be published by the Halo Platform developer team, and incur 0 (ZERO) gas
costs when changing contract states or sending transactions.

The Universe Expansion
We are building new features on top of the Swarm protocol built by the ethereum
network. We are calling it the Universe, and the project is the Universe Expansion.
Outlined below are the features we are adding into Swarm for standardization and
tooling.
NoSQL JSON Datastore
Giving you standardized API and tooling to use a NoSQL database stored in Swarm on
your application. DAPPs will have direct access to storage and management through
the halo.js API.
Asset Control
A familiar situation as with the current Swarm, the asset control API will allow you to
store files and information within the Swarm network. This will be particularly good for
PDF’s, images, and other items that aren’t related to serving a web page but needed for
general storage purposes.
Static Site Server
Using the distributed decentralized network to store your website and serve it to others
is a major goal of the Halo Platform. As long as your website assets are static files (Ex:
HTML / CSS / JS / JPG / PNG / etc…) then they can be served from the network. We are
taking some key notes from other distributed and decentralized website hosting
projects. The ability to deploy your website and update it will be given through the SDK
tooling.
