03 Architecture

Off-chain Hub
The design of the Liquidity Network and Exchange is
centered around the notion of universal hubs. As such,

Liquidity Network
Smart Contract

a user that is joining a hub, can transact his funds with
any other member of the hub, instantly, off-chain and
therefore at significantly lower costs than regular onchain transactions.
The hub architecture is novel because funds are no
longer locked between only two users, but accessible
to thousands of other users on the same hub. At the
same time, the funds are secured by the blockchain,
other users can’t steal other user’s allocated funds.
Lightning technology is not appropriate to build a hub,
because the hub would need to open an excessive
amount of payment channels. More details can be
found on our Stanford BPASE Talk.

Architecture advantages
03 Architecture

The Liquidity Ecosystem is currently implemented for
Ethereum and enables millions of users and payment
processors to exchange crypto.

Consumer

Because the Liquidity Network is built upon the Ethereum blockchain, it benefits from the existing development and research community.
With its novel design, the Liquidity Network architecture solves several pressing pain points of existing
payment channel designs:
No rigid locked funds
Simple design and routing
Free and instant channel establishment
Non-custodial off-chain swaps

Network of Hubs

Interconnected Hubs
Multiple Liquidity Network payment hubs can be interconnected. Similar to traditional payment channels,
two users of different payment hubs are eligible to

perform off-chain payments across different interconnected payment hubs.

Why the Liquidity Network is not Centralized
03 Architecture

How to define (de-)centralization:
(1) Who owns the funds?

Hub 1

(2) How redundant is a system?
(3) Can a central entity censor?
Regarding Liquidity we have the following properties:
1. A user owns at any time its funds (with the private
key). Not the hub operator, or any other entity can “steal“
the users funds. A hub is not a bank nor a custodian.
2. Liquidity is designed such that many hubs can be
interconnected in a network of hubs to provide redundancy, similar to a network of Lightning peers.
3. A hub can choose to not forward payments. If that
were to happen, the user can simply remove his funds
from the hub’s smart contract, which the hub operator
cannot prevent. The user would then join another hub.

off-chain payment
The Liquidity Network is designed to become a
redundant and decentralized network of hubs.

Hub 2

REVIVE
03 Architecture

Rebalancing payment channels securely off-chain, applies to the hubs.
With REVIVE, we present the first solution that allows
an arbitrary set of users in a payment channel network
to securely rebalance their channels, according to the
preferences of the channel owners. Except in the case
of disputes (similar to conventional payment chan-

Hub 1

nels), our solution does not require onchain transactions and therefore increases the scalability of existing
blockchains. In our security analysis, we show that an

honest participant cannot lose any of its funds while
rebalancing.
REVIVE is integral part of the Liquidity Network and allows different hubs to rebalance their respective balances.

Get in touch under

The current market offers airdrop solutions, which we believe are not in the spirit of decentralization
and open blockchains. Airdrop powered by Liquidity Network solves the following problems.
1. Airdrop through a custodian (not good, a wallet provider holds the user’s private keys, like a bank).
2. Airdrop by sending the private keys to the users (not good, the airdrop provider is still custodian).
3. Making millions of on-chain transactions, expensive, slow, spamming the blockchain, not scalable

We currently count more than 10 excellent Liquids covering development, legal, marketing, public relations and business development.
The design of the Liquidity Network became possible due to
more than 5 years full time blockchain experience by the team
members. We have academic expertise in computer science,
security, mathematics, formal methods, augmented by professional experience at world leading companies such as Intel and
Facebook.
The team understood, that in order to continue to revolutionize
how society trades and interacts with blockchain technology,
scalability needs to be considered as a core business.
