Founded in 2014 at Harvard University, Nucleus Vision is an end-to-end technology solution that captures
and provides previously unaccessed data to retailers and other ‘brick and mortar’ businesses through
blockchain and real time sensor technology. Our proprietary IoT sensor technology doesn’t depend on any
RFID, WiFi, Bluetooth, or even facial recognition technologies to identify any customer within it’s vicinity.
By building a secure blockchain based information network for IDs captured, Nucleus Vision aims to protect
consumers privacy, while mining intelligence using neural models, and integrating its nCash tokens, to
create the largest global loyalty rewards network.
