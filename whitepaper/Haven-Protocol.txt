1 | Introduction
Bitcoin paved the way for electronic peer to peer currency. It was the first digital
currency to successfully implement a distributed ledger of transactions based on
cryptographic proof over trust. Use of digital currency has since grown at an
exponential rate with users valuing privacy, anonymity, ease of use and low fees
to transfer currency anywhere in the world in a fraction of the time of traditional
methods.
Bitcoin however, due to the rapid scale and unforeseen issues, has suffered
drawbacks in many of these areas that users of the currency value. Fees became
too expensive, transaction times too long and flaws were found in the anonymity
of the protocol.
To its aid, came a wealth of altcoins that intended on fixing some of these issues.
New coins could move faster and without need to deal with legacy decisions.
Most notable of these new currencies was Monero.
A truly anonymous protocol.

2 | Haven Protocol
Haven is an untraceable cryptocurrency with a mix of standard market pricing
and stable fiat value storage. This is without an unsustainable peg or asset
backing. It achieves this with a dual coin blockchain. Users can mint and burn
Haven [XHV] for the equivalent USD value worth of Haven Dollars [XUSD].
Haven Protocol’s cryptographically unknown supply is used to facilitate the
fluctuations in the total supply when users burn Haven [XHV] to create the stable
value Haven Dollars [XUSD], while allowing Haven [XHV] to be exposed to the
natural price movements of the market.
Haven is a fork of Monero, therefore inheriting the stealth and anonymity that it’s
famous for. Haven also has the benefit of starting the blockchain from scratch
with RingCT for extra privacy. Further, Haven’s Offshore Storage means privacy
conscious individuals can keep their money in an untraceable currency without
being subject to market fluctuations.
With Haven, Offshore Storage allows fiat currency storage without having to
convert out of Haven.
Colloquially, this is akin to having a Swiss bank account in your back pocket.

2.1 | Offshore Storage
What is Offshore Storage?
Offshore Storage is Haven Protocol’s core concept that powers the minting and
burning of Haven [XHV] for Haven Dollars [XUSD] and vice versa. In short,
sending Haven [XHV] to Offshore Storage (burning), mints the equivalent USD
value worth of the burnt Haven [XHV] in Haven Dollars [XUSD]. This balance
never leaves the Haven blockchain and as such remains completely untraceable
and un-linkable to the user.
Digital currency is a useful way to keep your money out of the traditional
banking system - only if you can store it without a constantly fluctuating price
and the threat of losing significant value. With Offshore Storage, you get the
privacy of cutting edge digital currency with a guarantee on the fiat value.
This makes Offshore Storage ideal for storing large amounts of money that you
do not want exposed to digital currency volatility out of the traditional system.
How?
Haven uses a system called ‘mint and burn’ to maintain fiat value relationship. In
practice this works as follows:
Bob decides he wants to put 200 of his Haven [XHV] into Offshore Storage.
When you put [XHV] into Offshore Storage, you are burning [XHV] coins into
[XUSD] coins, which represents ‘$USD worth of Haven’. Offshore Storage
determines the current market value of that Haven (in [XUSD]) based on a
weighted average of volume across supported exchanges. This is done using a
price oracle.

If the current value of Haven is $1 USD, Offshore Storage will record a value of
$200 USD worth of Haven at Bob’s request. The 200 Haven that was sent is then
burned into [XUSD] and the total money supply decreases. If the price of Haven
then moves to $2 USD and Bob decides to access his Offshore Storage, he will
be returned 100 Haven (100 * $2 = $200 USD as per original value). If the
opposite occurs and the price of Haven halves to $0.50 then 400 coins will be
minted and sent to Bob (400 * $0.50 = $200 USD as per original value).
At first, minting new coins may make you think the value of the coin would
decrease as the total money supply has increased. In practice, this operates a
little different.
The ‘mint and burn’ method draws on the quantity theory of money, described in
monetary economics in order to avoid inflation and changes in currency
valuation based on the movements in the total supply.
The theory states that:

MV = PT
M = Money supply
P = Average price level

V = Velocity of money
T = Volume of transactions

An increase in the money supply should, with a constant velocity and volume of
transactions (assumptions of the economic model), cause an increase in the price
level (inflation). The problem with this is that the money supply of Haven will
always be unknown. Although there are 18.4 million coins (before tail emission)
that will be mined, the ‘mint and burn’ lets the money supply fluctuate freely.
Velocity of money is also cryptographically unfeasible to determine as the Haven
blockchain does not reveal the amount of Haven transferred, nor the wallet
addresses they are transferred to.

For this reason, the currency is unable to be valued based on total supply.
The cryptographic mechanisms that allow this information to remain hidden are
what makes Haven a true spectre to the traditional system. For an in-depth
breakdown of ring signatures, ring confidential transactions and stealth
addresses that power this un-traceability and un-linkability it is suggested to read
the papers from the Monero Research Lab (linked at the bottom of this paper)
from which the Haven Protocol inherits.
Offshore Storage will be implemented once the network reaches a mature stage
with enough exchange support to allow redundancy and accuracy of prices. The
current focus is on growth, stability, privacy and usability for everyday
transactions with an easy to use mobile wallet app that
anyone can use without prior knowledge of crypto.

2.2 | Use Cases
There are two main problems the Haven Protocol can solve that current
cryptocurrencies are not addressing:
• Point of sales/payment gateway systems where goods can be bought
with Haven and stores can immediately lock the USD/fiat value in to
protect from price fluctuations. This has the added benefit of keeping the
stores’ business and income completely hidden on the blockchain as
neither their wallet address or amounts are revealed.
• Storing large amount of money outside of the traditional banking
system. Privacy focused cryptos are perfect for this but without a reliable
way to maintain value through fluctuations the process of holding could
be costly. Sending Haven offshore quite literally, creates cryptographically
untraceable US Dollars.
