Abstract
Keyword: Blockchain, Big data, Decentralized
Today, we are living our digital lives creating massive amount of data from
everything we do. Big data is the new oil, yet the ones who contribute the most of it
are unaware of that treasure. Most service providers collect users’ data with no
intention to disclose the reason and the intrinsic economic value, meanwhile, users
trade their data unconsciously in exchange for a free app or service.
What if users could control their data and be rewarded accurately for the value it
creates?
The solution is a decentralized, transparent data exchange economy, based on
blockchain technology.
We will now introduce Measurable Data Token (MDT), a crypto token for a
decentralized data exchange ecosystem. MDT connects data providers, users, and
data buyers, and denominates the data’s value when exchanged. MDT enables a
more efficient, transparent and honest market for data trading.
The first component of this ecosystem is Open Messenger, a messenger solution
based on the email protocol. Open Messenger connects users with a smooth
communication experience. It will be the first service to adopt the MDT ecosystem
and utilize it as a payment system to reward all parties involved.
Our vision is a Decentralized Data Value Exchange Economy for everyone in the
digital world.

2 Introduction
It’s no longer a secret that technology companies are collecting and mining user
data. Users download an app which seems to be a free, but unknowingly they
compromise their data as a trade-off. It’s an unspoken rule in the industry that,
“Every company is a data company”. Companies strive to mine more data from
services and users to profit from the inherent value of information.
Some of them try to hide this intention by posting ambiguous Terms of Services on
their websites that most users will give up reading. Even more egregiously, some
services that generate revenue from users’ data aren’t even offered for free.
2.1 An Inefficient Market
Services and products store and collect user data for different reasons. The main
purposes for collecting user data include: Advertising, Product Enhancement, and
Business Insights.
Take Google as an example. When you first sign up for a Google account, Google
attempts to collect your name, email address, password, date of birth, gender,
telephone and address (Google Privacy 2017). These information help Google know
more about their users, thus enabling the company to push more relevant content or
advertising to users. When you use a Google account, it collects the emails you send
and receive from Gmail, the contacts and calendar events you add, the photos and
videos you upload, the Docs, Sheets, and Slides you author, all in pursuit of
enhancing the product experience and generating profits. As a huge entity with a
wide variety of services, Google does not typically share its information to a third
party simply to marginally increase profits, since users’ data for its own sake is very
helpful for the company.
Location based service Foursquare is another example of tech companies collecting
data. They store and analyze users’ data for Business Insights. Since the main
feature of this service is to allow users to share their location as a social media post,
Foursquare frequently stores user's’ location data. In early 2016, the company
released an in-house big data product called Foursquare Location Intelligence on the
basis of all the user location data they have collected. Soon thereafter, they released
a report predicting that, according to the data they have, sales of the famous
American food chain Chipotle (a publicly-listed company) would drop 30% in Q1.
Even though Foursquare collects location data which seems to be quite personal, it’s
not actually Personally Identifiable Information (PII). They know fewer users stepped
into a restaurant one month compared to the previous month, but they do not know

the identity of those people, because this information is irrelevant in a big data
product. Although it’s inevitable that companies will eventually mine sensitive data
for profits, the current reality is that most tech companies and products do not trade
users’ PII data.
While internet users knowingly allow their data to be collected, they are typically
unaware of the uses for that data, which leads to insecurity and suspicion. This
suspicion about the services they use online has led some to block Cookies tracking
and ads online to protect themselves.
From 2015 to 2016, the number of users using ad-blockers on either desktop or
mobile surged to a new high (PageFair 2017 Adblocking Report). Even prestigious
companies like Google are facing concerns about exploiting user data. In June 2017,
Google decided to discontinue the practice of scanning users’ emails for advertising
purposes.
Is anonymous data collecting really detrimental to users? If the market is one-sided
and users’ data is unfairly exploited by data collectors, then the answer is decidedly
“Yes”. When users can participate in the process and receive incentives for sharing
their data, then the process becomes fairer and even beneficial for users.

2.2 Traditional Data Trading
A traditional data trading model mostly consists of three parties: Data Provider, Data
Buyer, and Users. In the current model, only the economic incentives of Providers

and Buyers are aligned, but in the new model we propose, incentives of all three will
be aligned.

Data Provider
Data provider is the medium where data is generated. It can be an app, a website, or
any service that acquires and retains users. Use cases for the collected data include:
-

Tracking users behaviour for product enhancement
Precise advertising where revenue is shared with advertisers
Selling anonymous user data to third party buyers

Data Buyer
The buying entity can be a merchant, advertiser, investor, big data institute, or other
company that requires the data to predict trends or make decisions. As an example,
a consulting company without direct access to first-hand user data could purchase
data from a third party provider. Since it is difficult to verify the actual source of the
data, mostly buyers do not have guarantees from any party that the data they got is
real, clean or even legal.
User
End users who willingly or unwillingly share their data with all other parties. In the
current model, their data sharing activities have no economic gain.

3 A Decentralized Data Exchange Economy
3.1 A new ecosystem for data exchange
The era of trading data without user consent is over. The new ecosystem is
decentralized, impartial, and mutually beneficial. To change this unfair and inefficient
trading model, we need a new platform and unit of data exchange.
The first step towards fulfilling this vision is to introduce Measurable Data Token
(MDT), a new token for data exchange.
Measurable Data Token (MDT) connects users, data providers, and data buyers and
denominates the value of data. It compensates users for sharing anonymous data
points while providing data buyers and providers with a more efficient trading model.
The MDT is a blockchain-based distributed computing platform with smart contracts
securely stored in the Ethereum blockchain. It denominates the value of data in this
new economy.

In this new ecosystem, sharing one’s data is no longer a superfluous behavior; users
are incentivized with MDT for the actual data points exchanged. By offering more
transparent knowledge of each data exchange for all parties, users will also be more
motivated to join this initiative.
On the other hand, buyers are also provided with a more efficient exchange model
where all transactions are strictly enforced with cryptographically secure smart
contracts. In traditional closed data exchanges, buyers used to be at risk of buying
invalid or fake data without any ways to verify. In this new open model, buyers also

participate in the validation process of each transaction which ensures they will
receive a more trustworthy and risk-free deal.
3.2 Token Technology
Measurable Data Token (MDT) is a token based on Ethereum, and is the most
important element in this new data exchange ecosystem. Smart contracts, which are
applications stored in the Ethereum blockchain, are constructed by data providers,
data buyers and the MDT platform. Using cryptographically secure token contracts
helps enforce performance of the contracts. To precisely elaborate the technology of
the MDT ecosystem, the definitions for all the entities are listed below:
Measurable Data SDK
An open-source and free SDK(Software Development Kit): offered by MDT ecosystem for
any data providers or developers to use. The SDK includes a wallet address of which users
can take advantage to manage their reward income from the MDT ecosystem.

Data Provider​:
The entity that is capable of collecting user data, and utilizing the MDT ecosystem to
perform data exchange and user rewarding.
User​:
End users who opt into MDT ecosystem and share their anonymous unidentifiable
data will receive reward income from the MDT ecosystem .
Data Buyer​:
The entity that purchases the right of use of the data points during the exchange. It
could mean accessing a database, or purchasing a big data report offered by a data
provider. Buying data in the MDT ecosystem currently does not entail purchasing
data ownership.
Measurable Data Point​:
Each data point invoked in the transaction, with verified economic value in the MDT
ecosystem.
Measurable Platform​:
A decentralized data exchange platform where all transactions are based on smart
contract technology. Initially the Measurable Platform will be administered by the
MDT foundation and will charge calculation fees from each transaction, however,
over time, it will be purely based on the smart contract technology.

Example Use-cases:
Open Messenger is an email messenger app that helps users manage their email as
simply as messaging on mobile. As a data provider, it collects and analyzes users’
anonymous email receipt data, and transforms it into valuable business insights,
which updates daily right after the purchases happen.
Gaming company J is a data buyer, who constantly look for competitors’ sales trends
for decision making. They discover that Open Messenger has published a new data
dashboard product called “Sales Trends for Game P and Game C in 2016” that they
are interested in purchasing.
After Company J clicks the Purchase button on Open Messenger’s website, this
request notifies both the Open Messenger and the Measurable Platform.
Thereafter, Measurable Platform constructs a Smart Contract which includes:
-

Public User Key, which means all the invoked data points and the respective
public user key
User reward percentage: ​u %
Data Dimensions: iTunes email receipts, quantity...
Transaction Price：​Va​ MDT
Transaction Condition: Accepts deal within ​y ​hours

Data Buyer sends ​Va​ MDT to the contract address and then gets the preview access
to the product requested. According to the conditions in the smart contract,
Company J needs to decide if they accept the deal within ​y​ hours. Within ​y​ hours, J
believes that the data is valid and the deal is accepted. After the acceptance, the
Smart Contract executes, and simultaneously J gets the full access to the product.
-

Measurable Platform gets calculation fee: ​Vm = Va * x%
User reward total is ​Vu = (Va-Vm) * u%, ​each user’s reward varies depending
on their contributing points amount
Open Messenger as a Data Provider gets the remainder ​Vo = Va - Vm - Vu

If J does not accept the deal in this case, and believes that the data is invalid or
problematic, the transaction will automatically go through arbitration on the
Measurable Platform. If the arbitration result is deal accepted, the Smart Contract
executes. If the result is deal failed, Company J still needs to pay ​x% ​calculation fee
to the Measurable Platform, and the balance returns to the J Company.

It is very likely that for any early adopter, the number of data points being invoked is
not large enough to get considerable rewards.For some users, it may take longer
time to reach the amount other users only take several days to achieve. After all, the
data points every user creates are different.
To solve the potential issue of micropayment and delay in transaction confirmation
times (for example, when the rewarded MDT is too small that it fails to cover the cost
of Ethereum transaction), MDT will first introduces a reward deposit pool where it
stores users’ micro-rewards until the quantity reaches an appropriate threshold to be
sent to the user.
Users will be notified in their wallet about the number of contributed data points and
the amount of reward earned. Only once the rewarded MDT reaches a validated
amount will the wallet be activated to use. Users can transparently check reward
income and data points in real time to monitor their status in the MDT ecosystem.
For example, User F downloads the Open Messenger app and opts in to join the
MDT data exchange ecosystem. In the first week, his email receipt data is invoked
so his wallet displays the current rewarded MDT amount and the data points he has
shared so far. The number is below the threshold to activate his wallet, but three
months later, the number reaches the verified amount and User F is able to
withdraw, make purchases, and transfer his MDT.
We have witnessed many progress in the areas of efficient payments, scalability and
more improvements from projects like the Casper Research, the Raiden Network,
Tendermint / Cosmos , Graphene, and Decentralized cloud computing Dfinity
(Ethereum Blog 2017). To enable a more scalable, cost effective system, MDT looks
forward to working with the blockchain community on testing and improving these
new technologies in production.

4 More Use Cases
4.1 MDT Integration in Open Messenger
Messenger apps have become the preferred means for communicating for simplicity,
but the market is fragmented. All the messengers, such as WhatsApp, Facebook
Messenger, Skype have proprietary, closed platforms. To use them, you have to be
on the same platforms as all of your friends.
According to the latest report from Tencent Penguin Intelligence, Wechat now has
889m active users as of 2016. The number of daily active users who spend over 4
hours per day has doubled since last year. In April 2016, Facebook Messenger also
boasted 120m monthly active users.
On these huge platforms, users manage their social lives, bank accounts,
transportation, entertainment and many other services. To make their users stay and
invest more time and money, platforms like Wechat and Facebook spare no efforts
to develop as many features as they can. Meanwhile, these huge platforms are
closed networks where users can only interact and communicate with others in the
network, and use services and features exclusively on the same platforms. Users are
increasingly living their digital lives in different closed bubbles controlled by different
giant tech companies.
Email is one open and universally used communication protocol. Open Messenger is
a messenger app built on top of the open protocol of email, which makes it a natural
fit for adopting a decentralized solution.
Being an open communication platform is not enough, in the future, Open
Messenger is going to be a blockchain-based, open messaging platform to support
the new currency MDT, and help establish the new MDT economy.
As the second important element of the MDT ecosystem, Open Messenger is
launching soon on the iOS and Android app markets first.
The Open Messenger team are veterans of messaging apps. They have successfully
developed two popular messenger apps, MailTime and Talkbox Voice Messenger
app.
MailTime is built on top of an open protocol to enable it to become as pervasive as
email or text messaging, with maximum market potential. Debuted at the
TechCrunch startup battlefield SF, backed by Zhen Fund, Gary Rieschel (Qiming,
Softbank), Crystal Stream (VP of Engineering of Baidu), Y Combinator, Mark Pincus

(Founder of Zynga) and Magic Stone, MailTime was awarded one of the App Store’s
Best of 2015 and has reached over 3 million downloads. MailTime app was also
awarded the Best Lifestyle app at the “Best Mobile App Awards 2016”, and the
winner of “4YFN” innovation award at the WMC 2017.
Another former project of the team, Talkbox, was the first voice messenger app, with
13 million users. This functionality of “Push a button to Talk” was eventually adopted
by major tech companies and is now a feature in most messaging services.
However, because Talkbox was a closed network, it ended up at war with other
closed networks, fracturing the voice messenger world into several incompatible
ecosystems.
From Talkbox, MailTime to Open Messenger, the vision of building an open platform
for anyone to use has never changed. As the very first application to integrate with
the MDT currency, Open messenger will sit at the center of this new digital economy,
driving demand and fundamental value for the MDT ecosystem.
The early version of Open Messenger supports following features:
-

Managing unlimited email accounts within one app
Email experience as easy as text-messaging
Earn MDT token from the data exchange economy
Earn and spend MDT from using the Open Messenger
Store and manage crypto-assets with the built in MDT wallet

4.2 MDT User Growth Pool
To drive the MDT ecosystem growth, an MDT User Growth Pool is reserved to
reward early adopters and users with MDT.
In the early stage, users will also get rewards from being active on the platform. For
instance, a user being active for 30 consecutive days will be awarded with certain
amount of MDT.
The currency earned from this User Growth Pool can only be used within the MDT
ecosystem for value added services.
If the awarded MDT from the pool is not spent within 180 days by the awardee, it will
be returned to the pool for future new users.
Open Messenger will keep developing crypto-currency related features to encourage
users to join this new economy. As listed in Chapter 4.3 to 4.6, features like enabling
users to utilize their signature as an advertising banner are good ways to earn MDT
currency. Users can also send “VIP Mail” to spend their earned MDT.
More feature like these are in the pipeline, with the aim of engaging users in the new
ecosystem with the least expense. The goal is also to allow users to earn MDT
currency by providing value to the ecosystem and the community through data
exchange, commerce and service creation.

4.3 Advertising with Your Email Signature
Email signature represents a special piece of your online identity. It’s attached to
every email you send, which gets viewed every time someone opens your email.
Open Messenger allows users to utilize their signature as an advertising placement.
Would you rather read an advertisement popping up from the website, or something
attached to your friend’s email signature? In most cases, your friend seems more
trustworthy than a strange website.
Users are allowed to decide whether they want to opt-in to the Signature Advertising
Campaign or not. If they choose to opt-in, they need to select the specific categories
of ads that they are willing to include in their signatures. For instance, they can
choose to include only “fashion” related ads or exclude all “e-commerce” ads.
Advertisers will pay for per activation for all the participating users. Open Messenger
Platform will also charge a %fee to maintain this feature.
Users of Open Messenger, however, will not see the email signature since Open
Messenger hides user’s signature to make the communication experience as easy
as text-messaging. Only those who are not using the app will see the ads.

Example use-cases:
● User B is a freelance writer who needs to email different editors and clients on
a daily basis. He joins the Signature Advertising Campaign and opts-in to the
“Books” and “Movies” categories for advertisement. Soon under his personal
signature, each email he sends comes with a advertisement banner. Since
the category he selects is quite related to his expertise, the conversion rate of
his advertisement is quite high, thus earning B a considerable amount of
revenue every month.

4.4 MDT Wallet
For any cryptocurrency economy, a wallet
plays a crucial part. The MDT wallet will first
be built in the Open Messenger app. In the
future, it will be an independent open source
project that can be used by other
developers.

MDT is implemented on the Ethereum
blockchain as an ERC20 token, which is a
common standard for issuing digital assets.
MDT ecosystem is designed to benefit all
digital users who embrace an open,
decentralized and beneficial platform. To
reduce the barriers of cryptocurrency
technology for most consumers, MDT wallet
aims to keep it as simple as possible.
We are also open to a more user-friendly
onboarding tutorial for any crypto-currency
beginners. In the future, the MDT wallet will enable users to send, receive or transfer
payment without understanding the raw technology behind. (Cointelegraph 2017)
Example use-cases:
● User C is not a user of Open Messenger, but he uses another Service W
which also adopts the MDT data exchange ecosystem. C gets rewards from
the ecosystem and uses a MDT wallet to manage his MDT reward income.

4.5 VIP Mail
The VIP mail is an innovative function of
Open Massager that facilitates efficient
communication between mainstream
consumers and celebrities. It allows users
to connect with influential celebrities or
professionals who were usually difficult to
reach while protecting receivers from
spams by charging the sender.
Even though email is an open protocol
that connects anyone who has an email
address, users need to know the email
address first.
In the past few years, it has been noticed
that there is a growing need for
mainstream consumers to communicate
with celebrities or professionals directly
and personally. Several products has
developed such features.
For example, Zaihang is a platform which enables celebrity users to post paid
content, for example, a “60-second record answering a specific question”.
(Fenda 2017)
Another SilToken Distribution Event n Valley based startup 21.co offers a service
where strangers can pay bitcoin to send emails to celebrities that are also using
21.co.
One obvious downside of those products is that the closed platform requires both
sides to be on the same platform. Though emailing is a perfect solution for this issue,
it has its own disadvantage since celebrities or professionals would be flooded by
spams if they share their email address in public.
Open Messenger is introducing a new VIP mail service which is for anyone who
does not want to disclose his or her own email address. Through the Open
Messenger platform, user gets a masked email address which is directed to his or
her own email address. Users can set a price for his VIP email address, for example,
“5 MDT”, and then edits his own VIP profile. The VIP user can be a celebrity, a
professional, or anyone who wants to keep his inbox from spamming.

After creating this profile, users can share this masked email address publicly, on
their business card, personal website, or social network page as a contact email.
Every VIP profile is also searchable on the Open Messenger Platform, where a VIP
email bot will help introduce users to each other. For instance, if a user is looking to
speak with a professional lawyer, he can ask the bot for recommendations, and the
bot will reply with the best choices on the platform.
When a sender sends an email to a VIP email address, he will get an automatic reply
from the platform detailing how much it will cost to send this VIP email. After the
payment, this email will be sent and the sender will also be notified when it’s opened
by the VIP.

Example use-cases：
● Professor A does national lecture tours every year, and he always leaves his
VIP mail address at the end of the presentations for the audience to contact
him. He is very busy doing research and teaching so he wants to make sure
that those who contact him are serious about their correspondence.
● B is planning on a divorce with her husband, and she finds a suitable attorney
through Open Messenger’s chat bot. From the profile, she finds out that
Lawyer C is a famous divorce attorney in the city where she lives and his
response rate is as high as 85%. B sends the payment, successfully sends
her request to C and gets a quick response.

5 MDT Foundation
Measurable Data Token follows Litecoin and other established crypto currencies to
set up a non-profit organization (Public Company Limited by Guarantee) in
Singapore to issue, develop and promote MDT. MDT’s Singapore foundation is
approved and registered by Singapore Accounting and Corporate Regulatory
Authority (ACRA).

ENTITY: MEASURABLE FOUNDATION LTD.
TYPE: PUBLIC COMPANY LIMITED BY GUARANTEE
UEN: 201728042H
ADDRESS: 22 NORTH CANAL ROAD #02-00 SINGAPORE 048834
REGISTRATION DATE: OCT 2, 2017
The MDT Foundation aims to be an independent, and democratic governance body
for an open and decentralized ecosystem. The principle function of the MDT
Foundation is to support the ecosystem partners and provide the technology
necessary to ensure the platform develops sustainably. In order to fulfill the mission,
the foundation is responsible for:
-

Overseeing and supporting the decisions related to the ecosystem partners
Supporting research on new ways to improve the technology and governance
in the ecosystem
Funding and helping to develop more open source codebase for a sustainable
ecosystem

It is inevitable that the foundation will eventually be replaced by other more
advanced and innovative governance methodology in the future. However, we must
first create a formal governance model.
The Measurable Foundation will dedicate its resources in Research, Development
and Governance. The funds raised will first be directed to support the development
of tools that help the ecosystem to build, grow and create sustainable value.

6 Ethereum and MDT
Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing
platform featuring smart contract functionality, which facilitates online contractual
agreements. It provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, that
enables end users to construct smart contracts for transaction. (Wikipedia 2017)
New york Times commented in 2016 that, “ The promise of such a system is that it
allows the exchange of money and assets more quickly and more cheaply than
relying on a long chain of middlemen.”
We believe that Ethereum is growing to be a ubiquitous technology that not only
serves the blockchain field, but also permeates all areas of life.
MDT will be implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain, an industry standard
for issuing digital assets and smart contracts .
Meanwhile, we are always ready for new technology to surface and will readily
consider any superior solutions.

7 Issuance and Allocation
To finance the MDT roadmap, we will conduct a token distribution that will offer for
sale 500 million units out of 1 billion unit total supply of MDT.

8 Conclusion
MDT team’s vision since 2011 has been to build an open platform. Their first project,
Talkbox, is the first voice messenger app, with 13 million users. This functionality
was eventually adopted by major tech companies and is now a feature in most
messaging services. However, because Talkbox was a closed network, it ended up
at war with other closed networks, fracturing the voice messenger world into several
incompatible ecosystems. In 2015, They built MailTime on top of an open protocol to
enable it to become as pervasive as email or text messaging. MailTime debuted at
the TechCrunch Disrupt startup battlefield, and was awarded “Best of 2015” by
Apple’s App Store. The team was also invested by Y Combinator, Zhenfund, Mark
Pincus and many prestigious venture capital after its launch.
The journey of being an open platform continued when the vision of MDT surfaced.
As veterans of communication platforms, the MDT team had already identified a
number of established use cases within the new ecosystem and are confident about
its adoption and growth.
With the aim of fostering a decentralized and vibrant data exchange economy
surrounding the MDT cryptocurrency, the MDT team will pledge all its resources to
make MDT accessible to mainstream users. It will establish the MDT Foundation to
boost and maintain the growth of the MDT ecosystem and keep users and
ecosystem partners engaged in the Open Messenger platform.
The MDT cryptocurrency will be built on the Ethereum blockchain, and will be used
to compensate ecosystem partners and users based on the MDT solution for data
exchange. In the future, MDT aims to scale and become an industry standard for
data exchange and user incentive model.
