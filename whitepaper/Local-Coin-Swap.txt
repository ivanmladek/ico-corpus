Abstract
LocalCoinSwap (LCS) is a decentralised marketplace which allows buyers and sellers to trade
directly in any cryptocurrency using any method of payment. LocalCoinSwap provides a safe,
uncomplicated and fast peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform, allowing users to freely exchange
without unnecessary verification requirements or waiting times. The platform utilises a secure
escrow system that solves the inherent trust issues of online P2P trading.
LocalCoinSwap is holding a crowdsale event of LCS Cryptoshares. Cryptoshares are a digital
asset which will be used to facilitate distribution of all profits made by the LocalCoinSwap
platform, in addition to all profits made by new business ventures under the LocalCoinSwap
umbrella. Cryptoshare holders will additionally receive airdrops of new ICO tokens listed on the
LocalCoinSwap platform.
The platform implements a novel approach to traditional company ownership by utilising
blockchain technology to distribute the entirety of the site's profits to holders of LCS
Cryptoshares. This asset entitles investors to regular dividend payments denominated in all of
the currencies traded on the platform. Holders of the Cryptoshare may also participate in the
long run vision and decision making of the company itself through democratic voting in a proofof-stake system. This replicates the dividend payments and shareholder voting of traditional
companies, with the added benefits of blockchain technology and decentralisation.
Funds raised from this crowdsale event will be used to expand and speed up the development of
the LocalCoinSwap platform and increase the number of cryptocurrencies which the platform is
able to support on release.
Centralised cryptocurrency exchanges in their current form are fraught with inefficiencies, security
risks, long wait times and unreasonable verification requirements. This results in high barriers to
entry for a huge number of potential users. Commonplace also are unethical business practices
including insider trading, front running, and deceptive pricing.
As long as these problems exist, there will always be a demand for P2P marketplaces. P2P
marketplaces provide direct access between buyers and sellers, which represents the truest form
of free market trading.
The future of the digital currency ecosystem relies on the development of a robust P2P exchange
which supports a diverse choice of cryptocurrencies. The innovative distributed ownership model
offered by LCS Cryptoshares will bridge this gap in the market, while delivering the profits of
the platform back into the hands of its users. In addition, LocalCoinSwap will be the catalyst for
expansion of the cryptocurrency market by enabling new users through the elimination of all
barriers to entry.

Problem Overview
Cryptocurrencies and other digital assets are revolutionising the financial ecosystem. In 2017 alone
the market capitalizations of all digital currencies grew by 3171% to 700 billion ($700,000,000,000)
USD (source: coinmarketcap.com) .
Unfortunately the growth of the cryptocurrency economy has been fraught with friction from
the banking system. Hostile regulatory environments and conservative institutions have closed
the accounts of traders and exchanges en-masse, spread contention in the media, and forced
the implementation of onerous verification procedures which have transgressed the privacy of
the community.
The rise of cryptocurrencies has created huge economic and investment opportunities. However,
many people remain on the sidelines due to lack of patience or tech-savviness, inefficient
and lengthy subscription processes, and security concerns. Opening up trading accounts on
exchanges can be an especially difficult task for users. Many exchanges restrict the registration
of new accounts or require users to expose themselves to identity fraud and theft by submitting
pictures of their passports and personal documents online. Users are regularly asked to transfer
funds overseas to companies in countries with no legal oversight.
Existing P2P markets are also highly fragmented and non-inclusive. Traders who wish to buy and
sell outside the top few cryptocurrencies must access both a P2P exchange and a centralised
mainstream exchange. At present there lacks a single mainstream P2P marketplace which allows
more than one cryptocurrency to be traded for fiat currency simultaneously.
This has created additional onerous fees for users whose only desire is to purchase a nonmainstream cryptocurrency with fiat cash as their starting point, as they must utilise more than
one exchange and pay all associated fees to complete their purchase. They must also pay the
transaction fees involved in withdrawal from one marketplace to another. This increases not only
user inconvenience and wallet software requirements, but also user exposure to platform failure
or hacking.
In addition, the centralised ownership and clandestine company structure of mainstream
exchanges allows little investment opportunity for the typical individual. Top exchanges have
daily volumes in the billions of dollars, and investors have no mechanism through which they
can share in the profits. Giant monopolies now dominate the cryptocurrency exchange market
counterintuitively to the very fundamental global economic inefficiencies that blockchain
technology has the ability to solve.

LocalCoinSwap

Creating the Solution
The digital ecosystem is here to stay, and the mainstream economy is beginning to embrace the
ideas of decentralisation and unrestricted trade.
LocalCoinSwap represents a return to the most fundamental system of asset exchange without
reliance on mainstream institutions - the P2P trade. By enabling P2P trading of all digital
currencies LocalCoinSwap will put the market back into the hands of its users, allowing them to
directly trade any cryptocurrency using any conceivable payment method in any geographical
location.
There is currently a gap in the cryptocurrency market creating an unserviced demand.
Across community forums and social media sites in which traders participate, it is a common
frustration that users are unable to quickly or easily purchase non-mainstream cryptocurrencies.
Users also express repeated concerns about overseas banking transfers and onerous
verification procedures.
The LocalCoinSwap infrastructure will close this gap in the market, not only by offering a P2P
exchange for all cryptocurrencies, but by also tokenizing ownership of the exchange itself
into the hands of its users through the world-first Cryptoshare system.
The LCS Cryptoshare system utilises blockchain technology to replicate traditional company
ownership through shares in a more secure and decentralised manner. Much like the issuance
of regular shares and profits distributed through dividends, LocalCoinSwap issues Cryptoshares
which entitle holders to regular redeemable dividend tokens. Unlike a traditional financial
organization the ownership and dividend structure of LocalCoinSwap is hosted entirely on the
Blockchain, providing a publicly auditable and unforgeable ledger of the company’s financial
performance.
LCS Cryptoshares allow all traders on the exchange to take ownership in the platform they
are trading on. Despite the straightforward nature of this concept, LocalCoinSwap is the first
ever implementation of an exchange where the profits are distributed entirely through a smart
contract Cryptoshare system, with the initial launch planned by August 2018.

LocalCoinSwap Cryptoshares
Cryptoshare overview
LCS Cryptoshares are not like traditional ICO tokens. Instead of a vague promise of possible
future returns or idealistic visions which may never eventuate into product, Cryptoshares entitle
the holders to guaranteed rights to 100% of the total profits from the Localcoinswap exchange
through cryptocurrency dividends.
Cryptocurrency profits are paid to shareholders in the same cryptocurrencies in which they are
made, allowing the investor to receive a regular stream of portfolio income. By holding a single
Cryptoshare asset, the investor is entitled to a wide variety of cryptocurrency profits across the
entire spectrum of the digital economy.
Cryptoshare holders are also entitled to receive airdrops of new tokens when ICO’s are listed on
the LocalCoinSwap platform.
In addition, LCS Cryptoshares entitle the holder to voting rights in the platform’s decisionmaking process, such as the listing of new tokens on the exchange, the direction of new business
ventures and design considerations or functionalities for the platform. Cryptoshares in
LocalCoinSwap are more than just a stream of dividends, by investing you become an integral
part of the future of the exchange itself.

LocalCoinSwap

The protocol behind the LCS Cryptoshare, dividend distribution and voting token is provably
achievable with existing technology and does not require any fundamental advances in Blockchain
technology to implement. The development focus of the Cryptoshare is on the direct utility it
provides for the user rather than aiming to be disruptive technology.
At the end of each financial period, profits for all cryptocurrencies are calculated and published
publicly before being distributed back to LCS Cryptoshare holders. A dashboard is available
on the LocalCoinSwap platform detailing the dates, amounts and distribution details for the
current period.
To claim dividends such as ETH, BTC, BCH, DASH, ETC, or Monero, the holders of LCS Cryptoshares
are automatically entitled to claim ERC20 dividend tokens on a 1-to-1 basis according to their
holdings of Cryptoshares. After claiming the dividend tokens, holders can use the token to sign
a message containing their wallet addresses for the currencies they wish to claim. They then
broadcast the message and dividend tokens back to LocalCoinSwap’s decentralised contract
address, at which point the dividend currencies are transmitted automatically to their respective
wallets. Alternatively, the dividend tokens can be redeemed directly into the wallet balances of
user accounts on the LocalCoinSwap platform.
Because of this, there is no obligation to redeem the cryptocurrency portfolio income into the
private wallets of LCS holders, and users may instead hold on to their dividend tokens, choose
to redeem their funds at a later date, or even liquidate the token through an off-market sale.
LCS dividend tokens can thus act as a placeholder for an entire cryptocurrency portfolio, without
forcing the user to deal with the process of setting up multiple cryptocurrency wallets.

Dividend and voting tokens
Profits from the exchange are calculated and distributed at the end of each fiscal period. The total
issuance of dividend and voting tokens will be the same as the total supply of LCS Cryptoshares.
These tokens are then issued to holders of LCS Cryptoshares on a 1-to-1 ratio.
When dividend and voting tokens are redeemed they are destroyed by the contract they are
broadcast to in order to prevent malicious attempts to claim extra funds or manipulate votes.
LocalCoinSwap contracts holding non-issued Cryptoshares (such as the security bounty or
venture-fund contract) automatically burn all voting tokens they are issued.

7

LocalCoinSwap

Currencies offered as dividend payment
LocalCoinSwap will launch with as many of the most traded cryptocurrencies as development
time allows. The initial launch aims for a minimum of the leading 10 cryptocurrencies. The
platform will add new cryptocurrencies at a constant rate in order to encompass the majority of
the cryptocurrency market.
LCS Cryptoshares will entitle users to a vote in the listing priority of new currencies through a
direct democracy contract using their voting tokens.
LocalCoinSwap recognises that the cryptocurrency economy is a constantly changing environment
with new assets emerging on a regular basis. By actively engaging with the holders of Cryptoshares,
LocalCoinSwap will implement the coins which the community wishes to trade.

Airdrops of new ICO token listings
LocalCoinSwap provides a listing service for new ICO tokens to allow them to launch on the
LocalCoinSwap platform or raise pre-ICO and presale funding.
The requirement for listing new ICO tokens is that holders of LCS Cryptoshares receive an airdrop
of some proportion of the new tokens in advance. These airdrops are automatically distributed
through the same mechanism as the dividend and voting tokens. The specific requirements for
new ICO tokens to list on the LocalCoinSwap platform will be decided through the proof-of-stake
voting system.
The requirement for new ICO tokens wishing to raise pre-ICO funding is that LocalCoinSwap users
and Cryptoshare holders must be entitled to special discount offerings.
The expansion of LocalCoinSwap to provide a comprehensive listing service for new ventures to
perform pre-ICO, presale and ICO is a fundamental priority for the platforms development after
initial launch.

8

LocalCoinSwap

Decentralisation of ownership
Cryptoshares owners are valuable members of the LocalCoinSwap community. As such, they are
entitled to provide input in all facets of site development, new business ventures, as well as having
complete ownership of their respective share of profits. These voting rights include uses of the
sites revenue. No significant new ventures will be undertaken without a vote amongst holders of
the public issuance.
All holders who wish to participate will vote in a proof-of-stake system handled by the issuance
of a voting asset which can then be used in a public and transparent democracy contract. The
democracy contract is open source and the outcome of votes publically tallied.

Transparency
LocalCoinSwap will provide an open and transparent exchange to its shareholders. The
blockchain itself will provide an unforgeable record of all dividend payouts to Cryptoshare
holders. LocalCoinSwap will have a continuous, transparent, and blockchain-based overview of all
cryptocurrency revenues generated and to be distributed.
Each monthly Cryptoshare holder announcement will detail developments of the exchange and
issues which will be voted on by Cryptoshare holders before the next announcement. These
issues will include new-venture projects, new coins added to the exchange, design
considerations, and more. Cryptoshare holders may submit questions to be voted on
through the platform’s integrated community forum.

Allocation breakdown
100,000,000: Total supply of Cryptoshares which are minted in advance of presale. The contract
for the Cryptoshare locks this limit as unchangeable so no more Cryptoshares can ever be
created. This limit was chosen to give higher possible future values to individual Cryptoshares.
This contract is open source and publically available on the LocalCoinSwap Github repository.
70,000,000: Maximum issuance of the Cryptoshares through the pre-ICO, presale and ICO period.
At the end of the crowdsale period all unsold Cryptoshares from this portion of the issuance are
destroyed to increase the value of remaining Cryptoshares.
10,000,000: Reserved for special community venture fund. These Cryptoshares and associated
dividends are frozen for 1 year. After the end of the freeze LCS Cryptoshare holders may vote on
the use of these funds and dividends for the purposes of developing the company. Staff
members are ineligible from voting on the use of these funds. This fund provides incentive
for holders of Cryptoshares to participate in the community aspect of the platform..
10,000,000: Reserved for equal share between the core development team. These Cryptoshares
are frozen for 1 year to incentivise staff to grow their value.
5,000,000: Allocated to security reward program. This will increase the security of the platform by
incentivising malicious actors to report any exploits found rather than taking advantage of them.
5,000,000: Reserved for the bounty program. This program will assist with the promotion and
marketing of the platform users. These bounties will be paid out for services such as translation,
content creation and brand development.

Hard and soft capitalisation
The minimum cryptocurrencies available for purchase of Cryptoshares during the crowdsale are:
Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ripple (XRP) & Tether (USDT).
Purchase via SWIFT transfer in fiat currency may also be made directly using: US Dollar (USD), Euro
(EUR), British Pound (GBP), Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD) & New Zealand Dollar (NZD).
SWIFT transfer can be made in other currencies however this is subject to a standard exchange
rate fee. Cryptoshares paid for via SWIFT transfer are released upon settlement of the transaction
by our corresponding bank. Additional crowdsale cryptocurrencies may also be available if
development time allows.

11

LocalCoinSwap

Initial pricing for the Cryptoshares is currently set at 0.4 USD per LCS. Other payment
currencies are set at equivalent ETH value. This is subject to change should there be a large shift
in the price of ETH/USD to ensure the hard cap is maintained.
The soft cap for the Cryptoshare crowdsale event is $500,000 USD in total value of all sale
currencies. Should this soft cap not be reached all funds will be returned to investors.
The hard cap for the Cryptoshare crowdsale event is $20,000,000 USD in total value of all sale
currencies. Should this hard cap be reached the crowdsale will be closed and all remaining
Cryptoshares on offer destroyed. This limit was chosen to give investors confidence in the maximum
amount their equity in the site can be diluted, and to increase the value of the investment for all
holders of Cryptoshares.

Crowdsale bonus structure
The presale period will run with a bonus allocation of 40%. The presale will be closed immediately
if 10,000,000 Cryptoshares are distributed. During the crowdsale period funding milestones have
been set at each $5,000,000 increment.
As each increment is reached all existing purchasers of the crowdsale event receive an additional
5% airdrop of Cryptoshares to be distributed once the crowdsale closes. These airdrops are also
distributed to presale purchasers, but not to Cryptoshares held by the development team,
security/bounty fund & new venture fund.
• $5,000,000 of funding reached: All existing Cryptoshare crowdsale investors receive 5%
additional Cryptoshares.
• $10,000,000 of funding reached: All existing Cryptoshare crowdsale investors receive
5% additional Cryptoshares.
• $15,000,000 of funding reached: All existing Cryptoshare crowdsale investors receive
5% additional Cryptoshares.
• $20,000,000 of funding reached: All existing Cryptoshare crowdsale investors receive
5% additional Cryptoshares. Residual tokens are then destroyed to increase total value
to all investors.

The primary use of all funds raised from the crowdsale is to expand the features of the platform
and support addition of new coins. The exact allocation of funds between platform development,
security and coin addition will depend on the amount of investment made. Primary consideration
is always given to increases to security of the platform during budgeting considerations.
30%: Allocated to increase the security of the platform. LocalCoinSwap offers trading in a large
variety of digital assets. To protect against all possible threats multiple layers of redundancy
have been implemented in wallet systems, and security critical processes abstracted to separate
servers. A large allocation of crowdsale revenue towards security will provide users assurance
that LocalCoinSwap is a safe platform on which to trade.
30%: Allocated exclusively for the addition of new coins. LocalCoinSwap aims to provide the
maximum diversity of trading options upon launch and will hire dedicated staff solely to investigate
and implement new cryptocurrencies.
20%: Used for further development and expansion of the platform. This will enhance scalability
and the number of features which will be offered on initial launch.
15%: For business development, marketing & advertising. LocalCoinSwap will implement broad
marketing & advertising strategies to increase the user base of the platform upon launch. These
strategies are refined and focused campaigns based on the data and analytics gathered during
the Cryptoshare issuance.

80%: Distributed through the dividend system equally to all holders of LCS Cryptoshares.
9%: Used for administration costs which consists primarily of staff wages and fees paid to
contracted workers. LocalCoinSwap staff are paid a maximum of a market wage in line with
their relevant qualifications and experience. All salaries and contracted rates will be detailed
in LocalCoinSwap’s financial announcements to increase the transparency of the platform.
6%: For maintenance of the exchange platform. This includes costs of servers, replacement
of physical equipment and fees paid to technical services.
5%: Allocated to enhance security of the platform. These expenses include security audits,
penetrations testing and costs of implementing additional protection measures.

LocalCoinSwap

Technical information
All digital assets issued by LocalCoinSwap will be ERC20 compliant and will include other
mainstream standards where possible. This will enable LocalCoinSwap derived assets to be
transacted by as many Ethereum wallet programs as possible and be accessible across a wide
variety of secondary exchanges.
All reasonable efforts will be undertaken to conform to industry standards where possible in smart
contract development. This will include independent auditing if necessary to increase security.
Contracts used by LocalCoinSwap in the Cryptoshare issuance, dividend tokens and voting tokens
are open source and all code is publicly viewable on the LocalCoinSwap Github.
The contract development process is modulated where technically possible, with extensive whitebox and black-box testing of all individual units on private testnet before public deployment.
Because the security of financial systems is critical to the company, all code additions are
independently reviewed by all technical members of the development team.

LocalCoinSwap

LocalCoinSwap
Trading Platform
Platform overview
Development on the LocalCoinSwap platform began in August 2017 and is estimated to be ready
for initial release by the end of August 2018. The platform borrows the best elements and features
of existing platforms but has been redesigned with an enhanced focus on user experience, coin
additions and incorporation of social media interactivity.
The core development philosophy for the LocalCoinSwap platform is: safe, easy, enjoyable.
Primarily the platform has been developed with the security of the user in mind. Careful attention
has been taken to implement intrusion detection mechanisms and segregation of critical
components. Extensive research was conducted on previous hacks and the security models of
comparable exchanges before development began.
The ease of use of the platform was the second most important design consideration. It is
important that the user has a smooth experience, can quickly find and use the features they
need, and is not burdened by excessive pages or complicated interfaces. Where possible the
focus has been on offering as many features as possible while maintaining visual simplicity.
The signup process has been streamlined with no identity verification required for registration.
Users are able to quickly access the platform and begin trading immediately with no restrictions.
The final consideration, and of equal importance, is that the platform is enjoyable for the
user. The development team is integrating several social media aspects to the site designed to
enhance the community element of the experience. This includes trending coins, interactive
charts & graphs, achievement badges, custom profile pictures, and a fully integrated forum.

Coins offered
LocalCoinSwap aims to offer trading on the majority of cryptocurrencies and digital assets to
benefit the greatest number of users. The platform will open in stages due to development
budget, opening with the widest possible selection of coins and continuously integrating more.
When there is uncertainty as to whether certain crypto assets should be implemented, or the
order in which cryptocurrencies should be implemented, a vote amongst Cryptoshare holders
will take place.

16

LocalCoinSwap

LocalCoinSwap has a non-discriminatory attitude towards coin coverage. The platform’s focus is
on servicing the needs of the greatest number of users possible, rather than providing preferential
treatment to any single cryptocurrency.

Escrow system
The LocalCoinSwap escrow system acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers to create
a trustless solution to the inherit trust issue which hampers P2P transactions. LocalCoinSwap will
implement a multi-signature transaction option for users in currencies where this is possible. This
will allow users to exchange with zero platform risk.
When a new trade is initiated between traders, LocalCoinSwap takes possession of the
cryptocurrency portion of the transaction, while the fiat currency payment is made directly
from the buyer to the seller. Once the payment has been made, and the seller can verify the fiat
currency transaction has been received, the cryptocurrency is released to the buyer.
To prevent users funds from being locked up during volatile market periods, time limits for each
step of the contract process can be specified by the buyer or seller and are agreed to in advance.

Dispute resolution
If a dispute occurs, the escrow release is paused and supporting documentation is requested
from each party to mediate the settlement. LocalCoinSwap has scenario-tested all reasonably
foreseeable instances where disputes may be initiated and has created stringent processes to
fairly deal with each individual case. A global support team will ensure that staff members are
available to mediate trading issues at all times.

User feedback
User feedback about buyers and sellers is an important component to maintain a community of
reliable traders. Both parties have the opportunity to leave feedback and respond to it after the
transaction is complete. Traders additionally may view feedback before deciding whether or not
to accept incoming trades.

17

LocalCoinSwap

Community engagement
A key catalyst to user disenchantment of many cryptocurrency exchanges has been the lack of
active community engagement. To ensure LocalCoinSwap users are fully aware of all important
changes or news regarding the platform, regular contact will be disseminated through frontpage updates and announcements from the operations team.
Additionally, LocalCoinSwap will engage with the trading community through its public Telegram
groups, Slack channel, social media accounts, and integrated forum.

Security
A full-time dedicated security team has been enlisted to safeguard all vulnerable information at all
times. 95% of cryptocurrency deposits will be stored in offline wallets to minimise potential loss
due to hacking. Regular security audits by penetration specialists have been scheduled to ensure
the security system is fully up to date. In addition, third party monitoring systems have been
implemented for all servers with automatic shutdown mechanisms in cases of detected intrusion.

Simplified fee structure
LocalCoinSwap only charges commission to the market maker of the transaction (the trader
advertising their services on the platform). The price advertised is the price paid, without
withdrawal or deposit fees, and no other hidden charges.
For sellers who regularly engage in high volume trades, a special pro-trader status will be awarded,
conferring lower trading fees and an official ‘trusted’ banner on their profile.
Fees for trading will be set based on comparable exchanges, with the aim to match or beat the
fees offered by any competitors (currently this is 1%).

Development overview
The LocalCoinSwap platform is developed using a modular process. The platform’s development
has been divided into 5 core systems and approximately 350 features. Each feature is developed
individually and then reviewed by the entire development team before integration into the master
branch of the project repository. Unit tests have been implemented to ensure that no element of
the website is compromised by the addition of a new feature.
The LocalCoinSwap non-technical staff work independently as bug finders on the development
website. Additionally, an independent contractor with experience in penetration testing
continuously attempts to find vulnerabilities in the websites security.

18

LocalCoinSwap

All critical components of the website are server-isolated with different software architecture
to reduce the risk of zero-day attacks. Software used in the project is kept up-to-date and
development conforms to industry standards of best security practices. These processes ensure
there are multiple layers of redundancy in the LocalCoinSwap platform development.

New business ventures
In the event of a highly successful crowdsale there will be several new community ventures
immediately available for a vote by LocalCoinSwap Cryptoshare holders. In the event of a less
successful crowdsale the votes will be undertaken as soon as sufficient revenue has been made
by the platform to expand.
Holders of Cryptoshares are encouraged to submit ideas for new ventures to be taken to a vote.
These could include but are not limited to
• Full integration of all ERC20 tokens through a dedicated development team.
• Translation, marketing, and support staff for the platform in new geographical locations
where English is not a primary language.
• Enhanced token listing services for new ICO’s including rating systems and seed funding.
• Customizable themes and trading interfaces
• Secondary atomic-swap marketplace built on top of P2P platform.
• Strategic partnerships within the cryptocurrency community.

Value Proposition
Value overview
Of significant interest to investors in this project is both the potential returns and initial valuation
of the company.
The exact valuation of the company will be decided by the public through the crowdsale event.
As 70% of the Cryptoshares are available on market, and the hard cap for the crowdsale event is
20 million ($20,000,000) USD, the maximum initial valuation of LCS through the token generation
is 28.57 million ($28,570,000) USD.
This limit was primarily chosen so that Cryptoshare holders could be assured of attractive
potential dividend return on their initial investment, and also because it is unnecessary to raise
further funding for initial platform development.
This initial evaluation also allows room for the market capitalisation of the company to rise
naturally, through demand for Cryptoshares on secondary markets.
The following research has been conducted so that investors may have some idea of potential
dividend returns of their Cryptoshares. All research is speculative so the following projections
should be considered optimistic (though still reasonable) as a good-case scenario.

Cryptocurrency markets - Sector analysis
The cryptocurrency market is fast approaching a 1 trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) USD market cap,
with a total capitalisation that has peaked over 700 billion ($700,000,000,000) USD. This growth
has been exponential in nature. This trend is expected to continue, as cryptocurrency adoption
becomes increasingly mainstream.
As of writing there are 1426 cryptocurrencies in circulation, with an average of more than one
cryptocurrency being created each day.
The increases in market capitalisation are also reflected in trading volume across major
exchanges. In 2017 the average 24 hour trading volume across the entire market was 120 million
($120,000,000) USD. In early 2018 the average 24 trading volume was already approaching 50
billion ($50,000,000,000) USD, the same as the New York Stock Exchange.

P2P markets - Industry analysis
Since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, P2P exchanges have been a key instrument in its
dissemination and popularity. Trade volume for Bitcoin has increased exponentially
alongside the overall cryptocurrency economy. The week starting 23rd of December 2017
saw over 130 million ($130,000,000 ) USD worth of Bitcoin change hands via
Localbitcoins.com – comprising the largest week of P2P trade in Bitcoin’s history.
LocalBitcoins.com currently hold the title of the world’s largest P2P Bitcoin exchange.
LocalBitcoins.com has no plans as of writing to support additional cryptocurrencies.

Comparable exponential growth has occurred in startup P2P exchanges for other cryptocurrencies.
The P2P market for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, Ethereum or Monero is virtually nonexistent, representing a lucrative source of untapped revenue.

Revenue projection
The following revenue projection is based on current trading volume data taken primarily from
“Coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin P2P market share was calculated using LocalBitcoins.com data taken
from Coindance.com. A full breakdown of calculations is contained in the appendix to this whitepaper.
Care has been taken to base the following analysis on justifiable and realistic assumptions.

2019

2020

2021

2022

$0.34

$1.96

$9.83

$49.62

Note that the preceding graph was made under the assumption that the hard cap has been
reached. In the event that the hard cap is not reached dividend returns per Cryptoshare will be
higher, due to the burning of unsold tokens.
LocalCoinSwap has developed the Cryptoshare model with the goal of maximizing investor value.
The selection of the total issuance amount, token freeze and hard capitalisation were chosen with
the view that it provides the best long term value to the investor if the company has room to grow.
While the preceding projections can be considered a good case scenario, the presumptions
underlying them are reasonable. A dividend per $1 USD invested of $49.62 in 2022 still requires
the total revenue of LocalCoinSwap to be less than half of the current revenue of some of the top
exchanges in 2018. A poorer outcome scenario of $0.34 annual dividends per $1 USD invested
only requires LocalCoinSwap to capture a small fraction of the current market share for any of
the leading 10 cryptocurrencies.
Additional value for LCS Cryptoshares comes in the form of air-dropped tokens from new listings
on the LocalCoinSwap exchange. Though hard to forecast, this will provide a potentially lucrative
source of additional income for investors.
LocalCoinSwap will also be a catalyst for expansion of the cryptocurrency market by eliminating
barriers to entry for non-mainstream cryptocurrencies. The preceeding analysis is based only
on the leading cryptocurrencies and justification can thus be made that the estimates are
conservative in respect to potential market size.
The Cryptoshare model values the input of investors in the project, and all holders of Cryptoshares
are encouraged to submit feedback and suggestions to grow the total valuation and profits of the
enterprise.

About the team
and company
LocalCoinSwap was started by a team of qualified cryptocurrency experts and enthusiasts
frustrated by their inability to quickly or easily buy and sell new digital assets. While plenty of
mechanisms exist to purchase cryptocurrencies with other cryptocurrencies, there is little support
for those who wish to enter the market with fiat currency and quickly purchase using a variety
of traditional payment methods. The idea for LocalCoinSwap was born from our own needs
and wants.
Together our team draws on a wealth of experience from a wide range of fields, including
Economics, Computer Science, Commerce, Marketing, Maths & even Molecular Genetics.
The decision-making process in the development team is democratic and based on the vision
shared by all members of the team.
LocalCoinSwap operates under a corporate entity in Hong Kong, which was first incorporated in
2015. It originally operated as a private hedge fund owned by two of the staff members before
development of the exchange began. Geographically the staff of LocalCoinSwap reside in Hong
Kong, Australia, Canada & New Zealand.
We strongly believe in the success of our company and look forward to partnering with the
cryptocurrency community as we work together to strengthen the digital economy.

Questions & answers
How I can I take part in the crowdsale offering of LCS Cryptoshares?
Cryptoshare assets in the company can be purchased for ETH, BTC and others through our
website sale portal, up until the close of the crowdsale or the reaching of the hard cap target.
Which countries may participate in the Cryptoshare offering?
Citizens of all countries may participate with the exception of Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (North Korea), Iran, Sudan and Syria.
Will LCS Cryptoshares and other assets be tradeable on mainstream exchanges?
All digital assets created by LocalCoinSwap will be compliant with ERC20 and other mainstream
standards where possible, and can thus be traded on secondary exchanges. We are in the process
of reaching out to several exchanges to ensure liquidity on secondary markets is available before
the launch of the exchange platform.

Appendix
During the year 2017 LocalBitcoins.com accounted for only a tiny fraction of total Bitcoins traded,
despite making an average revenue peaking over almost $800,000 USD each week.

Traded on LocalBitcoins.com $USD
Traded on other exchanges $USD

• Total BTC traded ($USD): 869,746,425,900
• Traded on LocalBitcoins.com ($USD): 2,335,376,575
• LocalBitcoins.com market share 2017: 0.2685%

This percentage was used in the following calculations to estimate the scale of P2P trading in
the next top 10 cryptocurrencies. Revenue forecasting was performed using the assumption that
LocalCoinSwap is able to capture:
• 20% of LocalBitcoins.com market share within 5 years (starting at 5% in the first year and
increasing at a linear rate).
• 20% of the total P2P trading in ETH.
• 50% of P2P trading for the next 8 most popular cryptocurrencies. These markets contain no
major competitors for LocalCoinSwap.
To make the estimations increasingly conservative the average monthly growth rate for each
cryptocurrency during 2017 was used as the growth rate for each entire following year. This was
to account for a slowdown in recent exponential growth.
The percentage of trading revenue taken as fees was calculated to match fees offered on
LocalBitcoins.com and LocalEthereum.com (1% at the time of writing). These calculations are
considered an estimate of a good-case scenario in which the exchange is successfully able to
capture significant market share, and should not be taken as a statement of fact. Efforts have
been taken to make the figures conservative, however it is impossible to predict the future in a
volatile and new market.
