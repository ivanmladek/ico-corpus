In a fast-moving cryptocurrency world, it is necessary to establish a
wide distribution and a focused, well-informed community to assist
adoption in the name of freedom and liberty for all. Trade should be
controlled solely by the buyer and the supplier.
However, we operate in a society where there are far too many
middlemen and hidden costs that destroy our economies, forcing
smaller to medium business to crumble under inflated taxes and
pressing end consumers to pay inflated prices. This cycle, in turn, fuels
poverty in places predominantly controlled by the elite.
BZEdge believes, that with its technology, businesses will be equipped to take back control, drive growth and breed
success. BZEdge is committed to achieving these goals and realizing this mission, with a powerful community
following, backed by a strong development team.

Fork Details and Methodology
BZEdge forked from BitcoinZ and is intended to provide a 4th generation, technologically agile blockchain. It will
provide growth and added value to the community with low supply, fast block times, and freedom to pursue
advanced technological improvements.
All BTCZ holders, prior to the fork, can acquire their BZEdge (at a rate of 1:1) using their BitcoinZ private key. Please
use the latest BZEdge wallet to do this.

Total Supply: BZEdge will have a final distribution of just over 3.03B BZE.
Proof of Work: Equihash 200,9 - same POW as Z-Cash - up to block 200,000. Beyond block 200,000 POW will utilize
Z-Hash - the same algorithm as BitcoinZ.

POS and Masternodes: While not currently on the roadmap, a fork to add Masternodes and/or PoS is permitted.
Block Interval: Up to block 200,000 the block interval will be 2.5 minutes. Beyond block 200,000 it will change to 1
minute.
Block Reward: (up to block 200,000) = 12500 coin. After block 200,000 the emission rate will halve to 6250, with
per-block emission dropping to 1/5th, and with speed increasing 2.5x. Emission will halve, approximately, every
100,000 blocks, approximately 70 days, up to block 1,000,000 (March 2020). At block 1,000,000 emission is set to 8 per
block. At this point, block emission will continu

Introduction

Technologies

As is apparent with Bitcoin, centralization of mining power can negatively influence development. Whilst
developers clearly intend to deliver value, these outside factors can prevent profitable advancement. Even to the
extent that a pre-eminent coin can lose market share.
The BZEdge developers intend to prevent this by implementing a path that is free from vendor lock-in. Thereby
minimising the influence of any given vendor, and preventing an undesired negative influence upon BZEdge.
This means, that in the event of a threat such as limited hash in the vertical market - be it from silicon die producers
or custom ASIC design houses - BZEdge will implement a proof-of-work algorithm change to protect the integrity
of the blockchain.

Transactions

The purpose of BZE

The BZEdge protocol currently supports two types of addresses: ‚Äút-addr,‚Äù or transparent addresses and ‚Äúz-addr,‚Äù or
shielded addresses.

Road map, Strategy and
incentives outlined

BZEdge provides its users with fast, secure, and anonymous (zk-SNARKs privacy) transactions, and equihash
provides a proof-of-work architecture with low transaction fees benifiting both the community and businesses alike.

People with development and business skills are encouraged to join the community development and operational
effort, and will inherently act as stakeholder development leaders or stakeholder operational leaders or advisers.
Developers and stakeholders are expected to work toward the interests of the coin holders in the light of their skills
and available resources.

The Purpose Of BZEdge
BZEdge aims to improve upon its origin points as a value and asset-based cryptocurrency. It enjoys a structure of
freedom that allows for the rapid development of cutting-edge technology and a lowered barrier of entry for
business services.
Gone are the laborious decisions which take weeks instead of hours. Gone are the limitations of white papers.
Say, "hello" to a strong and powerful ecosystem with the freedom for both on-chain and off-chain software
implementations that will bring cryptocurrency to a new level and increase value for users, investors, and holders
alike.

Roadmap, Strategy and
Incentives
BZEdge will have an organisational structure to facilitate contracts and agreements to bodies interested in sharing
and developing crypto technology portfolios. Members of the community are reminded that the coin technology is
free software, and both the code and the blockchain may be forked if there is sufficient development potential and
passion in providing an alternative for the community. This, in essence, provides a strong voting mechanism,
making the decisions of the developers and the roadmap mutable.

Bitcoin, the first widely adopted use-case for blockchain technology demonstrates a thirst for a currency with a
limited supply, and a worldwide system-wide consensus model that provides an effective voting role for all
participants. The original mantra of Satoshi Nakomoto was 1 CPU, 1 Vote. BZEdge seeks to further and improve upon
this vision.
Z-cash is one of the most innovative coins, with superb, extremely intelligent and articulate developers. Z-cash
incorporates the fundamental technology of Bitcoin, adding a layer of privacy, where transparent coins are
essentially dissolved when they enter a shielded pool of transactions invisible to public blockchain observers. The
transparent Bitcoin-like funds are essentially minted afresh when funds move from the Z pool back to the transparent
pool. This development provides privacy in transactions, but also erases a spending history for coins, since, like a
fresh banknote, they have no previous spends. Just like a fresh banknote from a bank, your legitimately received
coins will be free of competing claims.
BitcoinZ is a 3rd generation coin, incorporating the technology above, yet following a similar maturity path of 4 years
per halving. BitcoinZ aims at full decentralization, with a final coin production of 21 Billion.
BZEdge is a 4th generation coin, based on the preceding coin technology, incorporating strong privacy features, the
strong fungibility of the currency units, and a circulation level to make the currency units of a workable magnitude in
terms of value. BZEdge accelerates the maturity period by revising each coin reward halving from approximately 1460
days to 70 days. This is both possible and necessary in a fast-moving cryptocurrency sphere. A very long mine-out tail
will be provided to assist long-term mining viability.
