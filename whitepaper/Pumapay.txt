Since chargebacks may be received weeks or even months after the original
transaction took place, it is sometimes difficult to recover the funds from the
merchant. To protect themselves, acquirers may be very conservative in their
underwriting: they will implement special policies such as reserves or holdbacks
to mitigate loss and may sometime require personal guarantees from business
owners, whom they will hold personally liable for the business’s financial obligations.
Card networks (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) set standards for chargeback ratios. For
example, Visa does not allow merchants to exceed a threshold of 1% chargebacks

for iOS. See our development roadmap for more details.
■■ Chrome-based application, something conceptually akin to Metamask.

PumaPay Server & API
The initial version of the PumaPay architecture which we are currently working on
is relatively centralised and relies on the PumaPay Server. To start using PumaPay
and accepting PMAs as a means of payment, the merchant would need to register
through the PumaPay Server to receive an API key. In turn, the PumaPay Server
would communicate with the merchant’s SDK where the rules for the transaction
would be set. These rules would then translate into a PullRequest targeting the
client’s wallet. To be able to access the details of the PullContract available in the
wallet, the client would need to scan a QR code generated by the merchant. If the
information contained in the PullContract is compliant with the parameters set in the
client’s wallet, he or she then digitally signs it off and the data is automatically sent
to the PumaPay Server. The PumaPay Server would authenticate the transaction,
which would then be published on the Blockchain. Ultimately, the PullTransaction
would take the form of a Smart Contract on the Blockchain network.
In the next iterations, PumaPay is aiming to evolve into a truly decentralised payment

The PumaPay Protocol SDK (Software Development Kit) is an off-chain set of

Implementation Considerations
As with all platforms and protocols, there are implementation considerations for the
PumaPay Protocol. It is important to note that not all of the implementation and
security considerations that are mentioned will be dealt with by the Protocol itself,
as the Protocol is meant to be as open as possible. Nevertheless, it is important to

the certification of contracts within the wallet.

Lack of Flexibility with the Implementation of PumaPay Protocol
It is to be noted that because the implementation of the PumaPay Protocol will rest
on the Token Contract, making changes could be made difficult. PumaPay deals with
a portion of this issue by creating massive flexibility in PullContracts and in Limiters.
This flexibility in these contracts is designed to reduce the technical strain on the
Token Contract and to place the evolution of the Protocol alongside the evolution of
the PullContracts and Limiters.

Resources
Use Case: Electric Bills
Sarah has just gotten her first home and now she has to pay bills. She looks at her electricity bill and sees that
her utility company has integrated PumaPay. She goes to the website and plugs-in her account details. When
she selects a payment method, she chooses PumaPay.
Upon doing this, a PullContract is created by the utility company’s web-app using the PumaPay SDK.

A QR code that links to the PullContract is generated and displayed to Sarah.
Sarah can scan this QR code and get the details of the contract, which states that it can withdraw a variable
amount from her account monthly with this amount being dependent on her electricity consumption.
Sarah accepts the PullContract, it is stored on the Token Contract and Sarah is connected to the power grid.

conditions, we will not conduct an open Crowd-Sale. Participation in the Pre-Sale is

Contributors may choose to place their contribution in a special elective
