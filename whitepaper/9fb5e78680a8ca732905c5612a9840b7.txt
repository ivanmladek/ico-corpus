ELECTRIFY
Be the power

ICO WHITEPAPER

VERSION 1.8

ABSTRACT
60% of the world’s population lives in Asia and almost
half of this population live in cities; and they’re all
connected to central power grids. Japan liberalised
its power grid in 2016, China has done so in parts and
Singapore will be the first in Southeast-Asia. As more
countries liberalise their electricity markets, consumers
will get greater choice in choosing their electricity
retailers and the way they want to consume energy.

Annual energy expenditure in Asia is expected to
grow from US$700 billion to US$1.6 trillion, by 2035.
Source: Asian Development Bank

In these liberalised environments consumers still
consume power from centralised grids managed by
corporatised grid operators. There’s also fast growing
demand for alternative energy resources like solar
panels, biomass and wind.
However centralised electricity systems are lagging in
innovations and alternatives. Solutions like renewable
energy and peer-to-peer energy trading are still not
prevalent. Without access to alternatives, consumers
are not getting the choices they deserve.
ELECTRIFY will enable the decentralisation of power
production and bring the power of choice to the
consumer. We aim to build a better electricity network,
and it starts with an intelligent energy ecosystem.
At the heart of this new ecosystem will be energy smart
contracts secured on the blockchain, fueled by the
ELEC token.

The lack of transparency between
electricity contracts means
customers may not always be
clear about retail energy prices,
the sources of energy and the
carbon footprint.

In a centralised grid infrastructure,
there is no framework for a reliable
peer-to-peer trading platform,
making it difficult for renewable
generator owners to buy or sell
power

Without a decentralised trustless
credit database and payment
platform, retailers are unable to
filter out customers with a poor
credit history, resulting in higher
costs for all consumers.

EXISTING BUSINESS
RETAIL ELECTRICITY MARKETPLACE
Founded by two senior executives from the Singaporean energy industry in early 2017,
ELECTRIFY is the first retail electricity marketplace in Southeast-Asia addressing the
need for transparency and security in the energy market. With a GMV of over SGD$5
million to date, ELECTRIFY has transacted more than 30GWh of electricity for business
consumers since incorporation.

ELECTRIFY
ECOSYSTEM
The ELECTRIFY ecosystem will operate as the consumer-facing,
ELECTRIFY Marketplace 2.0, driven by smart-contracts and a
peer-to-peer energy trading platform, Synergy.
ELECTRIFY’s existing marketplace business model will be transformed into the
ELECTRIFY Marketplace 2.0, ensuring a legitimate use case for the ELEC token. With
the upcoming liberalisation of the energy market across Asia, Marketplace 2.0 will be
enhanced to host retail electricity smart contracts and provide homeowners an avenue
to browse and purchase electricity from a retailer or a small-scale energy producers.
Synergy, a P2P platform hosted within Marketplace 2.0, will connect many small-scale
energy producers and consumers, ensure price certainty and cut out the middleman.
Synergy will allow the ELECTRIFY to rapidly expand into other geographies, using the
P2P platform to promote an active energy ecosystem.

PEER-TO-PEER ENERGY TRADING PLATFORM

Synergy allows consumers to buy
power directly from small-scale
producers, such as residential
rooftop solar and wind turbines.
Synergy removes the middleman,
and reduces energy costs for all
consumers.
P2P trades will ride on a Contract
for Difference (CfD) settlement
mechanism.

POWERPOD
To accurately track and audit the production
from a small-scale energy producer, we have
developed an IoT smart device to measure
and enable P2P trades via Synergy smart
contracts. PowerPod will log the energy
produced onto a blockchain.
Producers will be required to deposit at
least 200 ELEC/kWp of rated generation
capability as permissioned access to write
energy data onto the blockchain. This
encourages long term ownership and
disincentivises tampering and dishonest
behaviour.
This data will also allow producers to be
awarded with a renewable energy certificate.

eWALLET
The eWallet wil be used to facilitate payments via the
smart contracts, allowing consumers to pay for their
energy usage. This will enable automatic and secure
payments and allow energy suppliers to manage their
credit risk.
This will be the standard for payments in Marketplace 2.0
and Synergy.

OPPORTUNITIES
As countries around Asia gear up for the liberalisation of their electricity markets,
ELECTRIFY will deliver value through our marketplace and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms.
Singapore’s Open Electricity Market liberalisation in 2018 will be an excellent test bed
for our solutions.

DISCLAIMERS
IMPORTANT NOTICES

RISK FACTORS

The ELEC tokens are not securities as defined under Singapore’s
Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289) (“SFA”). Accordingly, the SFA
does not apply to the issuance of the ELEC tokens. For the avoidance
of doubt, the offering of ELEC tokens need not be accompanied by any
prospectus or profile statement and no prospectus or profile statement
needs to be lodged with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”).

REGULATORY RISKS
The regulation of tokens such as the ELEC tokens is still in a very nascent
stage of development in Singapore. A high degree of uncertainty as to
how tokens and token-related activities are to be treated exists. The
applicable legal and regulatory framework may change subsequent to
the date of issuance of this White Paper. Such change may be very rapid
and it is not possible to anticipate with any degree of certainty the nature
of such regulatory evolution. Electrify does not, in any way, represent
that the regulatory status of the ELEC tokens will remain unaffected by
any regulatory changes that arise at any point in time before, during, and
after this offering.

This White Paper does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation to
purchase, the ELEC tokens in any jurisdiction in which such offer or
sale would be unlawful. No regulatory authority in Singapore, including
the MAS, has reviewed or approved or disapproved of the ELEC tokens
or this White Paper. This White Paper and any part hereof may not be
distributed or otherwise disseminated in any jurisdiction where offering
tokens in the manner set out this White Paper is regulated or prohibited.
The information in this White Paper is current only as of the date on
the cover hereof. For any time after the cover date of this White Paper,
the information, including information concerning Electrify’s business
operations and financial condition may have changed. Neither the
delivery of this White Paper nor any sale made in the related token
offering shall, under any circumstances, constitute a representation that
no such changes have occurred. Electrify does not make or purport to
make, and hereby disclaims, any representation, warranty, undertaking,
or other assurance in any form whatsoever to any person, including any
representations, warranties, undertakings, or other assurances in relation
to the truth, accuracy, or completeness of any part of the information in
this White Paper.
Whether taken as a whole or read in part, this White Paper is not, and
should not be regarded as, any form of legal, financial, tax, or other
professional advice. You should seek independent professional advice
before making your own decision as to whether or not to receive
any ELEC tokens. You are responsible for any and all evaluations,
assessments, and decisions you make in relation to investing in the ELEC
tokens. You may request for additional information from Electrify in
relation to this offer of the ELEC tokens. Electrify may, but is not obliged
to, disclose such information depending on whether (i) it is legal to do so
and (ii) the requested information is reasonably necessary to verify the
information contained in this White Paper.
Electrify is not responsible for compelling any person to accept ELEC
tokens and disclaims, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all liability for
any adverse consequences arising out of or in relation to such rejections
of the ELEC tokens.
Upon receiving any ELEC tokens, you will be deemed to have reviewed
this White Paper (and any information requested and obtained from
Electrify) in full and to have agreed to the terms of this offering of the
ELEC tokens, including to the fact that this offering does not fall within
the scope of any securities laws in Singapore and is not regulated by the
MAS. You further acknowledge and agree that the ELEC tokens are not
securities and are not meant to generate any form of investment return.
The ELEC tokens and related services provided by Electrify (if any)
are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Electrify does not
grant any warranties or make any representation, express or implied or
otherwise, as to the accessibility, quality, suitability, accuracy, adequacy,
or completeness of the ELEC tokens or any related services provided
by Electrify, and expressly disclaims any liability for errors, delays, or
omissions in, or for any action taken in reliance on, the ELEC tokens
and related services provided by Electrify. No warranty, including the
warranties of non-infringement of third party rights, title, merchantability,
satisfactory quality, or fitness for a particular purpose, is given in
conjunction with the ELEC tokens and any related services provided by
Electrify.

NO REGULATORY SUPERVISION
None of Electrify or its affiliates is currently regulated or subject to
the supervision of any regulatory body in Singapore. In particular,
Electrify and its affiliates are not registered with MAS in Singapore as
any type of regulated financial institution or financial advisor and are
not subject to the standards imposed upon such persons under the
Securities and Futures Act, Financial Advisors Act, and other related
regulatory instruments. Such persons are required to comply with a
variety of requirements and standards concerning disclosures, reporting,
compliance, and conduct of their operations for purposes or maximising
investor protections. Since Electrify is not subject to such requirements
or standards, it will make decisions on those issues at its own discretion.
While Electrify will have regard to best practices on these issues, holders
of ELEC tokens may not necessarily enjoy the same extent and degree
of investor protections as would be the case should they invest with
regulated entities instead.
NO FIDUCIARY DUTIES OWED
As Electrify is not a regulated financial institution, it does not owe
investors in ELEC tokens any fiduciary duties. This means that Electrify
has no legal obligation to always act in good faith in the best interests of
holders of ELEC tokens. While Electrify will have regard to the interests
of holders of ELEC tokens, it is also permitted to consider the interests
of other key stakeholders and to prefer these interests over the interests
of ELEC token holders. This may mean that Electrify is permitted to
make decisions that conflict with the interests of ELEC token holders.
Not owing any fiduciary duties to holders of ELEC tokens also means
that holders of ELEC tokens may have limited rights of recourse against
Electrify and its affiliates in the event of disputes.
TAX RISKS
The tax characterization of ELEC tokens is unclear. Accordingly, the tax
treatment to which they will be subject is uncertain. All persons who
wish to receive ELEC tokens should seek independent tax advice prior to
deciding whether to receive any ELEC tokens. Electrify does not make
any representation as to whether any tax consequences may arise from
purchasing or holding ELEC tokens.
RISKS FROM THIRD PARTIES
The tokenised nature of ELEC tokens means that they are a blockchainbased asset. The security, transferability, storage, and accessibility of
blockchain assets depends on factors outside of Electrify’s control, such
as the security, stability, and suitability of the underlying blockchain (in
this case, the Ethereum blockchain), mining attacks, and who has access
to the smart contract where the ELEC tokens are stored. Electrify is
unable to assure that it can prevent such external factors from having
any direct or indirect adverse impact on any of the ELEC tokens.
Persons intending to receive the ELEC tokens should note that adverse
events caused by such external factors may results in the loss of some
or all of the ELEC tokens. Such loss may be irreversible. Electrify is not
responsible for taking steps to retrieve ELEC tokens lost in this manner.
RISKS IN RECEIVING THE ELEC TOKENS
Electrify cannot and does not guarantee or otherwise assure that there
are no risks in relation to the issuance of the ELEC tokens. The ELEC
tokens may, depending on the manner in which the relevant issuance is
effected, involve third parties or external platforms (e.g., wallets). The
involvement of such parties or platforms may introduce risks that would
not otherwise be present, such as misconduct or fraud by the third party,
or your failure to receive the ELEC tokens upon duly making payment
because of a third-party wallet’s incompatibility with the ELEC tokens.
Electrify is not responsible for any risks arising due to the involvement of
third parties, including the risk of not receiving (or subsequently losing)
any or all ELEC tokens issued to you.
