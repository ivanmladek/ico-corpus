1 Executive Summary
1.1

Introduction

V-ID is built to help prevent document fraud and add value by validating and
verifying documents using blockchain technology. Our mission is to safely
certify and secure all digital assets, so fraud and errors no longer hold back
society's innovations in digitalization.
The service utilizes generic and trusted principles to enable validation and
verification for any digital file, of any publisher. This is possible thanks to the
immutable and transparent nature of blockchain. Our clients are impressed by
the ease of use and the enormous gains in efficiency.
Among our first clients who currently use V-ID are Airbus Defence & Space,
Krohne and BaanVelgen. Among our first clients who currently use V-ID are

The video below explains the basics of how V-ID works in 90 seconds.

V-ID introduction video, link

The issuing organization can register any file through the validation process
of the V-ID platform, allowing each recipient to verify its authenticity within a
matter of seconds and for free.
V-ID does not save a copy of a validated file and therefore easily complies
with the GDPR guidelines.
V-ID is being developed by WIDIDI. Since 2008, WIDIDI employs its
continually developed versatile platform, called M16, to execute software
projects for their client-base. WIDIDI is specialized in secured environments,
connections and communication.
Compared to WIDIDI's regular big scale projects, V-ID is a unique and
scalable service. Therefore, optimal expansion of V-ID as a service requires a
different approach. One of the milestones in 2018 will be to establish V-ID as
a separate organization.
Funding will be generated through a large-scale Token Sale, in order to
speed up development of the V-ID platform as well as facilitate market
research and marketing.

www.v-id.org | V-ID © 2019

V-ID

Over the next 3 years V-ID will transform into a market leader in file fraud
protection, just like SSL has become for secure internet connections. We are
convinced that we can achieve this, knowing we have a strong team with the
necessary professionals, and work together with recognized parties and
individuals. Also, V-ID’s progress with the current adoption and conversion
gives us a good picture of the product market fit. To take the momentum and
stay ahead of other initiatives, we are organising a Token Sale.
Following the Private Sale, funding will be allocated for a marketing campaign
to promote the Token Sale.
The V-ID Utility Token offers a concrete added value in identifying issuing
organizations, saving digital fingerprints in a smart contract and processing
payments for validating.
Technical development of V-ID focuses on a broad application of fail-safe
fraud prevention.

V-ID

V-ID is developed by WIDIDI, a software developer based in Zwijndrecht,
Ridderkerk and London. WIDIDI has been developing its universally versatile
M16 Platform in-house since 2008.
Based on this platform, WIDIDI has specialized in secure applications in
recent years, specifically for shipping, industry, police and defense. The
platform is continuously probed for potential sensitivities and cyber attacks.
Independent third parties carry out the penetration tests.

Motives

As society continues its digitalization process, new types of digital crime
emerge. The media report on incidents such as data leaks, identity fraud,
document forgery and fake news on a daily basis.
We believe one specific new technology can provide a breakthrough in the
battle against these criminal side-effects. This technology, blockchain, has
the potential to become one of the most important technological pillars of the
modern world. For an IT company like us, the opportunity to help shape this
technology with concrete applications and added value is the most exciting
and important work imaginable.

V-ID

2.5

Ambitions

“What was the standard mode of operation before V-ID?” Just like it is now
difficult to imagine what the world was like prior to the internet, we believe VID will become an accepted and widely used element of modern digital
society.
V-ID will be used by any organization that wants to fraud-protect its digital
files in a fail-safe way. Comparable to how certified SSL connections are
currently used for websites.
We believe that fast adoption of V-ID’s technology is possible, because it is
radically different from other current fraud prevention technology. V-ID offers
validation of any digital file with maximum security, optionally on site with a
certified notary present, to oversee the process. Implementing V-ID is costeffective, fast and completely non-intrusive to existing workflows.
Any recipient can verify the file in 5 seconds, without an account, from
any device with an internet browser.
At a later stage, V-ID can focus on online identification and analysis of both
individuals and companies.

3 The V-ID service
3.1

The problem

One of the downsides of the digitalization of society is the difficulty in
combating fraud with digital files.

Source: ITV News, November 2017, link

3.2

The solution

V-ID is a service that uses blockchain technology to make fraud with digital
files impossible. V-ID users can be divided into two groups: creators and
receivers. Once a creator registers a file in V-ID, this file’s authenticity can
then be verified by the recipient.

www.v-id.org | V-ID © 2019

18

V-ID

V-ID’s validation process guarantees that the person registering the file
actually represents the organization issuing the file. V-ID does not save a
copy of a validated file and therefore easily complies with the GDPR
guidelines.

3.3

Verification

The recipient of the file can verify the authenticity and content of the file by
entering it into the verification terminal at https://www.v-id.org. Once the file is
verified, V-ID generates a report of the verification.
An OIC (Origin Information Certificate) is offered in PDF format. This
certificate contains all the details about the issuing party, the file itself and all
blockchain data such as timestamp and proof of existence.

www.v-id.org | V-ID © 2019

19

V-ID

The validation process

Validation can take place in two ways: validation by a certified V-ID employee
and self-validation.
A transaction with V-ID tokens takes place for each validation. Due to
the data connected to these transactions in the blockchain, both the
validating party and the validated file are fully transparent.

3.4

Validation by a V-ID employee

Remote validation (level 1)
The issuing organization submits the files to V-ID using a secure connection.
V-ID then validates the files.
On-site validation (level 2)
A V-ID employee validates the files at the issuing organization’s location.
On-site validation under notary supervision (level 3)
A V-ID employee validates the files on-site at the issuing organization’s
location, with a notary present to supervise the process.

www.v-id.org | V-ID © 2019

20

V-ID

3.5

Self-validation

This method allows an employee of the issuing organization to validate files
at any time. V-ID appoints a wallet to the issuing organization containing a
balance of V-ID tokens.

State of affairs

V-ID has been in development since February 2017.
The V-ID promotion website has been live since March 2017 and the V-ID
Verification Terminal is operational since August 2017.
A beta version of the Token Sale platform for overview and management of
credits has been in operation since May 2018.
A full beta version of the Validation Platform is planned for Q4 2018.
A first version of the V-ID token was developed in Q1 of 2018 and a soft
launch of this Utility Token took place in Q2 of 2018.
Users

V-ID is now in use at Airbus Defense & Space, Dutch college HBO
Drechtsteden, fiber-optic supplier Vitrumnet and ESHRE (European Society
for Human Reproduction and Embryology).
ESHRE (Belgium) uses V-ID to protect the diplomas and certificates that they
assign to students in PDF format against forgery.
HBO Drechtsteden (the Netherlands) immortalizes diplomas using V-ID
technology. Sander Fischer, student Entrepreneurship and professional
footballer at Sparta was the first graduate to own a V-ID blockchain validated
diploma.

4.1

Trends and developments

source: CBS, April 2017

source: Computable, September 2017

On the one hand, digitalization, across the full breadth of society, is seen as
the solution for saving costs and making services easier for the customer. At
the same time, as a side effect, we see daily reports about explosively
growing cybercrime in the media.

www.v-id.org | V-ID © 2019

V-ID

source: Bouwmachines, Februari 2017

A simple Google search is enough: digitalization is the key word in almost
every facet of society. In nearly every sector, digitalization is mentioned as
the way to lower operational costs.

source: SpoorPro, Januari 2018

source: SVA, Januari 2018

This means more and more paper documents are replaced by digital
documents. As a file travels from the start to the end of a process, it passes
dozens of stations. Through computers, modems, network towers, internet
nodes and corporate networks that are managed by different organizations,
the file, or one of the copies, ends up in an environment that may or may not
be secure.

www.v-id.org | V-ID © 2019

V-ID

26

This complex route creates numerous opportunities for unlawful manipulation,
without the average employee, who is part of the process, being aware of it.
source: Emerce, November 2017

The complexity of the route that a file follows is hard to reduce, but a
watertight check on the contents of a file is perfectly possible.
Below are a few examples of digital files that can undergo unauthorized
changes without V-ID.

4.3

Competition

There is no de facto standard solution against document fraud.
There are a number of startups and research groups that experiment with a
form of security using blockchain technology.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) conducted a pilot program
in 2017 with 111 students, who received a digital version of their diploma
alongside the physical version. In this concept, only the student can download
a copy of the diploma. The concept only works through an app, and the
recipients cannot check the certificate for authenticity at a later time.
Gradbase and Skillchain are two startups that focus exclusively on resumes.
Both are still in the development phase and have no customers yet.

www.v-id.org | V-ID © 2019

30

V-ID

DiguSign is a project under development by a community of enthusiasts
around the DigiByte coin.
It uses a digital signature for documents and records them in the blockchain
via a project environment. They leave the validation process to the users.
There are no customers yet, but DigiByte claims to have more than 1,000
users.
Furthermore, there is a fairly large number of commercial organizations, such
as Adobe and Signix, which offer some certainty about the origin of
documents with a digital signature.
However, these are one-sided, not easy to implement and not easily verifiable
methods. In addition, the relevant files have to be adapted for this purpose
and these "signatures" or password protections offer no real, flawless
protection against changing the file.
Verification services are offered by a growing number of market parties, such
as Nuffic and Trulioo. These services use methods based on human control,
using knowledge, experience and sampling.
An interesting concept is Civic which offers a similar validation and
verification service for personal identification (passports, etc.). Civic also
bases its method on the Bitcoin protocol, the most established blockchain in
the world.

4.4

Conclusion

The potential market for V-ID is virtually unlimited and growing rapidly. The
worldwide digitalization ensures that paper file fraud is increasingly moving to
digital file fraud.
The validation service is still new and unique. Currently, there is no
organization that has already won any significant market share.
V-ID provides the simplest, most scalable and most generically applicable
solution.
The V-ID service approach is not market or application specific and therefore
has a very large potential to scale up and thus become the de facto standard.

5 Marketing plan
5.1

Product

V-ID is a service that allows companies to protect their digital files against
fraud. The files are validated via the V-ID platform, after which they can be
checked for authenticity at any time and within seconds.

5.2

Promotion

Initially, we see the most concrete possibilities within WIDIDI's existing
customer base. In addition, we want to focus our market approach on early
adopters. Organizations that want to take the lead and thus act as a V-ID
advertising board.
Our goal is to make sure the V-ID service will become an established name
with excellent brand recognition. The V-ID concept is very suitable for catchy
news headlines and an aggressive marketing campaign should lead to rapid
market penetration.
Overall we envision the following market approach:
- generate leads for medium to large organizations that will use V-ID; this
reinforces the proposition of V-ID during a Token Sale).
- finding a solid partner to launch a Token Sale for generating the funding to
further accelerate the development of the V-ID Platform, to do market
research, expand marketing and scale up the organization.
- through a Private Sale, funds will be raised for the marketing campaign to
promote the Public Sale.
- approach and select a partner that wants to leverage its network and
expertise to make V-ID a worldwide concept.

5.3

Location

V-ID currently has active users (paying customers) in the Netherlands,
Belgium, France and England. We have the ambition to expand the number
of countries, but for now we expect the most accessible expansion within the
Netherlands.

5.4

Price

V-ID is a new service and therefore the market prices have not yet been
determined. At first, more research is needed to determine the price
proposition. Whoever approaches the market for the first time has the
possibility to determine the price within a certain bandwidth.
The security, but especially the news value, plays a crucial role as well. With
SSL and hosting services, we see price-determining factors that we also
consider to be realistic for V-ID:
- safer means more expensive
- a larger purchase, reduces the price per piece

www.v-id.org | V-ID © 2019

34

V-ID

In our first estimate, these prices can and should differ per sector and per
organization.
The start-up costs mentioned, include a (physical) identification of the issuing
organization and all people involved in the process.

Beyond Q4 '19
Simultaneously with the development and rollout of the B2B applications of
V-ID, a basis is built for B2C applications. Initially, we focus on a private
version of Self Validation, and a V-ID technique-based toolset that makes
online identification possible.
Consumers will be able to use their V-ID tokens with these applications for:
Self Validation
Example:
Artists can record their work using V-ID, ensuring the ownership of their work.
Gathering and recording (photographic) evidence for insurance claims.
Gathering evidence for patent claims.
Determining the state of e.g. a rental car or holiday home to prevent
unauthorized withholding deposits.
Identification
Example:
Consumers can validate their personal data with V-ID. Online services can
offer V-ID as a registration method for new accounts, or as verification of a
customer's identity in transactions or purchases.
This means consumers no longer have to leave their information with
countless online services and that the online service has certainty about the
identity of its users.

What not to do

V-ID will not deliver customization, and will only provide a standard product in
a small number of variants
V-ID will become a service provider with a standard, ultimately scalable
and white label solution
V-ID will not rush into the scale up phase, in order to protect quality
V-ID chooses bootstrapping; to retain independence and to perfect the
concept with quality as the sole motive
V-ID does not want debt
Anyone who represents V-ID, in any way, is as cost-effective as
possible from day 1 and will act decisively in terms of expenses

Technique

Blockchain
Ethereum (ERC20)
Proof Type
Not mineable
Technical = Non-native Protocol Token
The V-ID utility token is an ERC20 token that is used to identify wallet
addresses (for issuers / validating parties) and is used as payment per
validation.
Purpose / underlying value = Network Token / Network Value Token
The platform can be used online (human interface) and will be expanded with
a number of apps, white label widgets and SOAP and REST APIs, to form the
ultimate safe bridge for validating and verifying with most common modern
software (using web services and system interfaces).
Utility / Legal status = Usage Token / Utility Token
The V-ID blockchain is anchored in both the Bitcoin and Ethereum
blockchain. A third blockchain is expected but is not yet scheduled.
The token price must be high enough to cover the operational costs of V-ID,
including Ethereum and Bitcoin transaction fees.

Tokenomics

IMPORTANT NOTE
To comply with exchange listing requirements and to prevent legal
issues, V-ID changed the tokenomics model in March 2019 to exclude
dividend. This section has been updated in March 2019!

www.v-id.org | V-ID © 2019

V-ID

43

To summarize, the V-ID tokenomics show the following expected factors
contributing to the increase of the V-ID token value:
Utility and scarcity
B2B
V-ID tokens are at the heart of the validation process. To validate files, a
publishing party pays with V-ID tokens only. V-ID provides all other
cryptocurrency required + cloud hosting for the platform.
The token eliminates the need to buy DGB, ETH and BTC for transaction fees
as V-ID takes care of this. The transactions are key to the identification and
confirmation of the identity of the publishing party.
The number of V-ID tokens that will be issued is limited. VIDT cannot be
mined and 20% of the tokens spent are burned quarterly.
V-ID transactions are public and traceable, providing transparency.
The number of V-ID tokens needed for validating files is expected to increase,
because the number of organizations that validate files with V-ID is expected
to increase.
The price per validation (in VIDT tokens) is controlled by V-ID. Clients can
choose between a fixed or market price.

B2C
After first establishing a client base of medium to large businesses, the V-ID
Platform will be further developed to facilitate consumer-oriented services.
These services will open up an additional market of consumers, who will use
V-ID tokens for a range of applications around online identification, rights
management and file validation.
These API based applications will enable any website to implement a V-ID
service to, for instance, simplify the registration and due diligence process for
new members.

Founders lockup

In addition to our stimulus actions that are build-in in V-ID’s Tokenomics, we
commit to a founders lockup. This is an extra measure to help maintain a
calm and steady development of the exchange rate. The lockup means that
V-ID mandates a 5 year lockup on V-ID Tokens for its founders and advisors,
with 20% released per year.

7 Financial plan
We assume a three year turnover growth and will reach the break-even point
within 5 years.
The number of documents validated with V-ID is estimated at five hundred
thousand in Year 3 and at least 1.5 million in Year 5. The exponential growth
will mainly be driven by automated validation and verification, by means of
integration with existing systems.
In the course of the first years, the revenue ratios will shift from "licenses and
implementations" to turnover "per document". The ratios of the expenses will
shift from "marketing and development" to "sales and support".
Our strategy for the first years is mainly aimed at increasing brand awareness
and establishing the V-ID brand. The funds that the Token Sale will generate,
will be allocated as seen in the diagram below.
Distribution of the ICO Funds

30% Marketing
25% Operations
