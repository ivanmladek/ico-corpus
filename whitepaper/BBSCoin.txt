A Bridge from Forum to Forum.
A Bridge from Site to Site.

Whitepaper v1.0.0
Early 2018

Brief

BBSCoin is a cryptocurrency designed for internet forums.
We aimed to provide an easy way to let forum user exchange credits/points
from different forums freely.

Begin from forums, but we will not stop at forums, we will create a
exchangeable credits/points for all Web Sites.

Breakthrough Point

An Internet forum, or message board, is an online discussion site where people can
hold conversations in the form of posted messages. They differ from chat rooms in that
messages are often longer than one line of text, and are at least temporarily archived.
Also, depending on the access level of a user or the forum set-up, a posted message
might need to be approved by a moderator before it becomes visible.
Forums have a specific set of jargon associated with them; example: a single
conversation is called a "thread", or topic.

A discussion forum is hierarchical or tree-like in structure: a forum can contain a
number of subforums, each of which may have several topics. Within a forum's topic,
each new discussion started is called a thread, and can be replied to by as many people
as so wish.

Current Situation

Forums are still popular in the world.
People are used to exchanging valuable information through forums and are
even willing to pay for it.

Reddit is popular in the US, Baidu Tieba is popular in China, also 5ch is
popular in Japan now.
Webmasters can also easily set up forums through open source software.
Hundreds of millions of people still use the forum on a daily basis. *

Current Situation

Internet forums are isolated. Forums are just a platform for users sharing
their contents, but can’t get any profit.
The current point system is useless. Just get point, but can’t make it
effective.
We try to open a first decentralized
cryptocurrency exchange system based on existed
web sites and forums.

end up something like 100k:1. We think this is a good supply for this scene.
