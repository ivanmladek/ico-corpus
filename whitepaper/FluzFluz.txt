Journey:
• After someone invites you, you sign up
with your ID details. After clicking on a
confirmation email, you are officially a
Fluzzer! You can start making money on
every purchase.
• Assuming you meet the minimum
requirements of two gift card purchases
a month, you can continue to use the
Fluz Fluz application and accrue points.
If you want to earn even more points, you
can invite two other people to become
Fluz Fluz members and you get points
when they spend!
• If you wish to increase your involvement
and make even more money, you can
become a brand ambassador and host
meetups. Meetups provide chances to
teach people in your extended network
about Fluz Fluz. In addition, you can
enjoy perks like free merchandise from
