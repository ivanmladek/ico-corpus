Executive summary

At Flexa, we believe that the best way for global
commerce to become more efficient and accessible is
by making cryptocurrency spendable everywhere.
With cryptocurrency transactions exceeding 20 billion USD each day,1 it’s
simply a matter of time before digital commodities become a central part
of global commerce. And yet, cryptocurrency’s collective value of 0.25–
0.5 trillion USD2 remains practically unusable in physical retail.
Considering that 90.9 percent of retail sales in the US still take place
offline,3 brick-and-mortar payments are the primary hurdle in realizing
the true utility of cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, widespread retail
acceptance of cryptocurrency is critical for its sustainable value.

The solution to blockchain payments
We have developed the Flexa network as an open standard that enables
instant cryptocurrency payments in stores and online. This new network
is designed to act as an intermediary between merchants and the
blockchain, offering them inexpensive and fraud-resistant transactions
without volatility exposure. Flexa enables consumers to pay with
their preferred cryptocurrency while preserving their freedom,
security, and data privacy. And, Flexa doesn’t require any physical
cards or merchant point-of-sale upgrades.
Flexa was developed from decades of experience in fintech,
retail, and payments. Today, Flexa features many high-profile
merchants on its platform, the launch of which marks the
first real instance of a decentralized, global payment
network with the power to make commerce more
efficient and accessible for billions of people.

We’re making
cryptocurrency useful
In the original Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi Nakamoto
outlined a perspective on the fallacies of modern-day
commerce, which relies “almost exclusively on financial
institutions... to process electronic payments.”4

Digital payment instruments in the United States and around the world
consist of complicated financial settlement processes—costing merchants
up to 4 percent in processing fees for purchases and involving up to
twelve different entities (each a discrete point of failure) to process a
single exchange. Meanwhile, retail fraud losses in the US alone continue
to reach all-time highs, claiming more than 48.9 billion USD in 2016.5
However, present-day payment instruments are extremely useful to
consumers because they have widespread merchant acceptance. And in
order for cryptocurrencies to realize similar real and sustainable value, it is
critical that they become spendable everywhere.
Many companies have recently developed wallets and apps that enable
retail blockchain payments, but they are universally dependent on existing
payment networks. The promise of cryptocurrency is not being realized
when it also requires physical debit cards, linked accounts, or centralized
payment infrastructure to facilitate the purchase of a cup of coffee.
Flexa is the first network specifically designed to facilitate practical
cryptocurrency payments by enabling instant, no-fee transactions at
stores, restaurants, and online. Flexa represents a milestone in the utility
of cryptocurrency—payments that are both consumer and merchant

friendly. With a simple SDK, Flexa allows developers to add retail payment
features to any app, streamlining acceptance of cryptocurrencies for
merchants and eliminating volatility exposure.
Flexacoin (FXC) is the new digital collateral token for facilitating retail
cryptocurrency payments on the Flexa network. Flexacoin is staked to
collateralize every payment on the Flexa network, enabling instant, fraudfree point-of-sale transactions at merchants worldwide—helping to achieve
a long-term vision of making cryptocurrency spendable everywhere.
As a simple, neutral, fixed-supply ERC20 token, Flexacoin ensures that
the network itself is blockchain-agnostic, and allows people to spend the
cryptocurrencies that are meaningful to them. Anyone can use Flexacoin
to stake wallets on the Flexa network. Stakers help to collateralize
payments made by those wallets, and in return, they earn stake rewards
based on transaction volume.

By connecting merchants, banks, and the blockchain
with this open network, we’re building a new, global
payment system to challenge the status quo.
We envision that the Flexa network will ultimately come to represent open
network infrastructure for any blockchain payment, similar to how card
associations such as Visa, Mastercard, UnionPay, and American Express
offer closed payment rails for credit cards. Beyond that, with digital global
payments in excess of 10 trillion USD each day,6 this retail platform will
make cryptocurrency more valuable, meaningful, and useful.

7

The blockchain as
the future of commerce
The limitations of traditional payment instruments—
fraud and cost—are solved by the primary strengths of
blockchain technology. Accordingly, merchants and the
greater blockchain community each stand to benefit
from making cryptocurrency spendable everywhere.

For many merchants, payment card fraud and transaction expense are
two of the most significant operating costs to manage and actively reduce
(e.g., in 2017, losses due to payment card fraud amounted to an estimated
28 billion USD worldwide).7 Payment card fraud today takes many forms,
from stolen account numbers to abuse of marketing incentives. Even
chargebacks, initially developed as a consumer protection over forty years
ago, have become a vehicle for malicious activity. And smaller merchants
ultimately share a disproportionate share of the damages, as they have
fewer resources to counter sophisticated fraud or defend themselves in
the case of a dispute.
In addition to the costs of fraud, the very act of processing a payment
can be extremely expensive, due to the variety of fees and operating
expenses involved in handling cash, payment cards, and other payment
instruments. For instance, in 2016, the top twenty-five merchants by
revenue worldwide spent a collective 19 billion USD to accept payments.8
In general, these expenses are a result of complex settlement processes
across a variety of network participants, including payment gateways,
processors, card associations, and financial institutions. Due to this
complexity, a standard payment card transaction in the United States
involves more than ten discrete steps.

The blockchain as the future of commerce

How merchants and the blockchain stand to benefit
The blockchain offers a practical solution to merchant concerns of fraud
and cost. It dramatically reduces the number of possible fraud vectors
by enforcing tamper-proof transactions on a ledger, and it decentralizes
transaction verification—creating an open market for processing that
more closely represents the actual computation cost. As an added
benefit, the blockchain provides native support for borderless payments,
which opens merchants to a global community of customers without
requiring additional payment infrastructure or currency exchange.
Meanwhile, the blockchain needs merchant adoption in order to become
a viable supplement to other payment methods. Additionally, with this
increased utility comes more straightforward cryptocurrency valuation,
reduced volatility, and market stabilization. Growing merchant acceptance
will make cryptocurrencies substantially more valuable, and truly enable
the globalizing effects of peer-to-peer electronic cash that Satoshi
Nakamoto envisioned.

Blockchain adoption is inevitable
For these reasons, we believe that the blockchain complements the
infrastructure of traditional payment instruments. However, due to the
operational and technical complexity in managing native cryptocurrencies
at scale, many merchants will require an intermediary service. This service
must be designed so that it cannot compromise the core principles of
data protection, decentralization, and choice that have bolstered the
cryptocurrency community since its inception.
We believe that the Flexa network offers the first practical cryptocurrency
payments service for retail, dining, groceries, fuel, travel, and more. We
remove the complexities of acceptance to bring fraud resistance and
low-fee processing to merchants, while still protecting consumer tenets
of privacy, decentralized governance, and freedom of choice. By allowing
merchants and their customers to engage directly as buyers and sellers,
global commerce becomes vastly more efficient.

11

A framework for
consumer adoption
The software that moves the vast majority of money
around the world today still uses legacy standards
created during the late 1970s,10 but in the absence of
a compelling alternative, consumers are trapped into
maintaining the status quo.

Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain communities have
attempted to make cryptocurrencies a useful complement to traditional
payment instruments like credit cards, debit cards, and cash. However,
fundamental user-experience challenges such as unintuitive QR code
interfaces, complex address strings, new security protocols, and network
capacity issues have hindered commercial adoption. Various scaling
solutions such as multi-layer protocols and Proof of Stake consensus
algorithms show considerable promise for improving the speed and
utility of blockchain transactions, but create issues of complexity and
compatibility for merchants.
A variety of mobile wallets are promoting cryptocurrency payment
solutions, but unfortunately, they are completely reliant on existing legacy
infrastructure. These wallets utilize high-fee virtual Visa and Mastercard
debit cards—requiring bank accounts, physical cards, and multiple tiers
of centralization. Digital payments on these platforms are subject to low
transaction limits (in some cases, less than $100),11 as well as Apple’s
restrictions for NFC access on iOS devices.12 Justifiably, these systems
have extremely low consumer adoption due to the increased friction
compared to a typical payment card.

12

A framework for consumer adoption

The solution to blockchain payments is not building
cryptocurrency acceptance on top of the existing
multi-layer networks, but creating a new network that
solves merchant and consumer needs alike.
While decades of retail payments experience confirm the pain points of
fraud and processing cost, we find that consumers’ needs are distinctly
different. Consumers evaluate payment instruments against an individual
framework of five basic criteria:

Basic consumer criteria
Freedom of choice
The need to avoid fees, and
mechanisms of unwarranted control

Value

Speed, usefulness, and value are often the most critical factors in
choosing a particular payment instrument at retail. Each of these features
must be addressed for cryptocurrencies to see widespread adoption.

13

A framework for consumer adoption

In order for a viable blockchain cryptocurrency
payment network to achieve meaningful scale, the
table stakes for consumers are the following:
1

Real-time transactions
Merchants and their customers need to receive confirmation that a
transaction was successful in less than one second.

2

No consumer-facing fees
Consumers will not pay a premium to use blockchain
cryptocurrencies, because such a cost represents negative
value in their decision-making framework. The fee must be zero
on the consumer side of the transaction, and ultimately provide
competitive spending incentives.

3

Broad acceptance
In order to see widespread consumer adoption, it must be possible
to use cryptocurrencies for the majority of daily expenditures. Any
less than that, and the mindshare required to maintain “front of
wallet” utility will not be attainable.

Meeting and dramatically exceeding these expectations will be
challenging, but any new payments network must comprehensively solve
both consumer and merchant needs. We believe that Flexa satisfies all of
the core consumer requirements necessary to break the legacy payments
status quo.

17

A new network

The Flexa payment experience
Flexa payments are designed to be as simple as possible. With just a
single tap and scan, Flexa verifies your cryptocurrency balance against a
public index rate and generates a proprietary flexcode for payment.
Because Flexa payments do not require NFC (like traditional payment
cards), they are not restricted by Apple’s requirements for payment
cards to be loaded into the Wallet app, nor by tap-to-pay (contactless)
implementation timelines or transaction limits. This greatly reduces the
network’s risk as compared to other cryptocurrency payment solutions.
A Flexa transaction has two primary components, which are delivered to
client apps through the Flexa Wallet SDK:
•

The first is called an FPAN, or flexible primary account number, which
is a one-time authorization that allows a merchant to debit local fiat
currency against the selected cryptocurrency wallet balance.

•

The second is called a flexcode, which is a proprietary and backwardscompatible barcode format that is scannable by standard point-of-sale
barcode readers. Each flexcode conveys the FPAN with any userauthorized metadata through the merchant’s point-of-sale system.

Because all Flexa transactions use the same
authentication process for payments, they represent
the only interface that is just as secure—and just as
usable—whether used in stores or online.
Online Flexa transactions will make use of identical FPAN provisioning
mechanisms and back-end integrations. In fact, online Flexa transactions
will differ from physical Flexa transactions only in their form of approval.
Instead of using a flexcode, virtual Flexa transactions will relay an FPAN via
an account-linked device.

18

A new network

Principles for network development
Flexa has presented six principles for the network, representing our vision
for its ongoing development and sustained platform growth.

In order to become a trusted, public cryptocurrency
payment rail, we believe that Flexa must be:

Compliant

Secure

Instant

Open

We present these principles to help guide the development of Flexa, and
we hope to build trust and transparency with the blockchain community
by articulating them as the ongoing intentions guiding the network:

Compliant
We designed Flexa to support local compliance requirements and data
protection regulations. Notably, unlike alternative solutions for institutional
cryptocurrency payments, the network does not require Flexa or third
parties to act as custodian of funds; the technology functions as a direct
payments processor without volatility exposure for merchants.

Secure
The Flexa network has been designed with open-source, end-to-end
encryption for resilience from man-in-the-middle attacks and other forms
of surveillance or tampering, and exposes only non-sensitive information
in the course of completing a transaction.

Simple

Useful

19

A new network

Instant
Flexa is the only network to offer instantaneous conversion of
cryptocurrency via direct bank deposits at merchant point-of-sale,
regardless of block time. End users need only one tap to authorize
payment, with transactions (confirmed by point-of-sale) currently
measured at less than a second. Flexa transactions are designed to be the
absolute fastest payment solution available in the world.

Open
Flexa is designed to enable the free and open use of cryptocurrency at
retail. The network will be accessible to a wide variety of developers and
merchants around the globe. To support this widespread acceptance, the
network community need only stake Flexacoin. Therefore, Flexa requires
no proprietary license or gateway in order for developers to integrate their
wallet or transmit cryptocurrency transactions.

Simple
From tap to transaction, Flexa supports simple, straightforward API
methods for exchange and payment. Because the network is not reliant
on existing payments infrastructure, payments are pre-authorized in a
single message, enabling authorization signatures and settlement to
be combined into one fraud-resistant transaction. Flexa’s simplicity of
integration, operation, and settlement makes cryptocurrency payments
easy for merchants and their customers alike.

Useful
Finally, Flexa is designed to be backwards-compatible with existing POS
systems, and as interoperable with as many partners and platforms as
possible. We have developed the Flexa network toward broad accessibility
and widespread acceptance—starting with the very first apps on the
network, which take advantage of existing POS integrations and require
no new hardware or merchant upgrades.

The present state of digital payments

Direct bank transfer
In general, non-cash payment instruments are underpinned by a

commercial bank or credit union. Whenever money is exchanged via

SWIFT

one of these payment instruments, whether electronically or by an

offline ledger, it is ultimately transmitted between financial institutions.

30.7 million transactions18

To reconcile these payments, a variety of domestic and international
standards are used for direct bank transfer between businesses and

consumers (also sometimes called “electronic funds transfer”), such as

2.1 trillion USD21

ACH/IAT, CHIPS, SWIFT, RTGS, Fedwire, BEPS, NEFT, and KFTC.

Despite their ubiquity, each of these systems rely on legacy infrastructure

that remains vulnerable to fraud and transaction inefficiencies.

430,000 transactions

Legacy infrastructure
The underlying technology of the global financial network is difficult
to navigate, consisting of a variety of incompatible legacy protocols
and standards; many of the current electronic settlement systems have
remained relatively unchanged for 40 years. For instance, Automated
Clearing House (ACH) transactions in the United States are still
conducted via fixed-width text files (with precisely 94 characters per
line), uploaded to various FTP servers and downloaded at specific times
of day for settlement. Until 2016, these transactions cleared the following
business day, when NACHA announced an update allowing for same-

70.1 million transactions

The present state of digital payments

day payments.20 This “upgrade” involved no changes to the underlying
specification; rather, banks were required to process transactions twice
instead of once daily.
Other clearing systems include the Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT); the New York Clearing House
Association’s CHIPS network; and the Federal Reserve’s Fedwire network.
Each involve substantially more robust checks and balances than ACH
and benefit from greater speed, increasing the complexity of the global
financial system. Together, these systems transmit a staggering 3.6
quadrillion USD in global volume.21

Fraud vulnerability
Despite the additional supervision involved in these ledger systems, their
protocols and networks are vulnerable to fraud. In a 2016 survey of the
largest financial institutions, “cybersecurity concerns” was the mostresponded challenge that bank executives said they faced in their day-today role,22 and many such instances of theft have recently become public.
In 2016, thieves made off with 81 million USD by impersonating Central
Bank SWIFT operators.23 Throughout a single weekend, they routed four
transactions through the New York Fed’s mostly automated system,
moving 101 million USD from Bangladesh to the Philippines. It was only
when a New York Fed official caught a thief’s misspelling of the beneficiary
name that they were able to alert Bangladesh Bank officials and prevent
the transit of an additional 920 million USD.
In 2018, a larger heist was discovered involving the Punjab National Bank
and promissory “letters of understanding” issued through SWIFT, where
funds were laundered by using a password provided by bank officials
for direct access to the SWIFT network.24 Letters of understanding were
issued for the equivalent of nearly 1.77 billion USD, and they were not
correlated with the lesser amount that was registered via SWIFT in the
bank’s holdings. Despite repeated warnings against fraudulent SWIFT
messaging from the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the
scam went undetected for nearly seven years.25

The present state of digital payments

Transaction inefficiency
Despite the underlying fraud vectors, funds transmitted over SWIFT,
Fedwire, CHIPS, and ACH incur costs of approximately 18 billion USD
every day.26 Additionally, transfers require three to five days for settlement,
and up to 4 percent of payments fail due to technical reasons.27
The blockchain could potentially offer several enhancements in these
systems, namely cryptographically secure transactions, immutability,
and data redundancy. For instance, Ripple, a prominent US startup,
allows financial institutions to quickly settle cross-border payments
using its xCurrent network, claiming a 60 percent reduction in net cost.28
Remittance providers such as Western Union and Moneygram have also
piloted using native Ripple blockchain tokens (XRP) for settlement.29 Using
products such as these, we believe that blockchains have the potential to
influence well beyond the primary layer of the global financial network.

Payment cards
Direct bank transfers are just one of the several steps involved in

debit card). In practice, the payment card authorization and settlement

Many single points of failure
The companies involved in payment card processing serve mutually
exclusive roles and extract a share of the transaction fee. This fee is called
“interchange,” and has been variously regulated by the European Union
(Interchange Fee Regulation, April 2015), and the Federal Reserve (Durbin
Amendment, July 2010).
Payment cards also mandate a secondary network provided by entities
called “card associations.” Card associations work with payment
processors to conduct the three broad stages of a payment card
transaction: authorization (verifying funds in accounts on either side
of a transaction), clearing (transferring funds between banks after the
exchange of goods or services) and settlement (paying a merchant).

31

The present state of digital payments

In order to accept payment cards, merchants incur
disproportionately high processing fees which are
often one of their largest operational costs.
In 2012, responding to these rising processing fees, some of the largest
merchants in the US—including Walmart, Target, Best Buy, CVS and
7-Eleven—created a cooperative organization called Merchant Customer
Exchange (MCX), with the charter of developing an ACH-backed payment
instrument to avoid interchange fees.34 After three years of continuous
merchant investment and delayed development, the MCX mobile app
never exited a pilot phase. Although it was successful at reducing
merchant costs of processing, MCX was never able to deliver a compelling
consumer value proposition. In 2017, JP Morgan Chase acquired the MCX
technology to integrate with its existing Chase Pay system.
In the past decade, payment card processing fees have skyrocketed for
two main reasons: first, because of an increase in fraud, including losses
that are paid by issuing banks when they reimburse their customers for
unauthorized charges; and second, because of the consumer demand for
better card benefits and rewards on high-end credit card products.

Rising costs of fraud
EMV (Europay Mastercard Visa) chip cards have found mainstream
adoption in Europe, Asia and the US, but payment card fraud in aggregate
has continued to rise. Despite broad acceptance of the card-based
technology, 2.8 million fraudulent accounts were created in 2018,35
and account takeovers cost merchants 5.1 billion USD.36 Additionally,
transactions made online (i.e., “card-not-present”) have seen fraud
losses increase more than 100 percent since the introduction of the EMV
standard.37 Chip-enabled cards have subsequently increased payment
security, but are still vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, especially
when merchants don’t upgrade their systems to support encrypted
transaction data from EMV-capable terminals. Cards can also be cloned
from unsophisticated account enumeration, physical card skimmers, RFID
readers, or simply a restaurant waiter with a cell phone camera.

32

The present state of digital payments

In 2016, the total fraud losses for payment cards worldwide was estimated
at 22.80 billion USD,38 with 46 percent of all US citizens reporting card
fraud within the past five years.39

Recently, the rate of identity theft has soared, with
more than 1,500 corporate data breaches,40 including
the theft of 143 million credit reports from Equifax41
and 40 million credit card numbers from Target.42
Yahoo—now part of Verizon—also revealed that hackers obtained the
personal information of its entire database of 3 billion worldwide users
during an attack in 2013.43

Incentive fees
Credit card rewards points also contribute to the high fees incurred by
merchants to accept these payment instruments. Originally introduced by
American Express in 1991,44 these points have since become a cornerstone
of consumer marketing for major credit card products. Today, travel and
dining bonuses have become extremely competitive for the major credit
card issuers: Chase, Capital One, and American Express are each vying
for coveted “front of wallet” placement by offering up to 5× points or five
percent cash back on various purchase categories.
As a result, many industries have developed to help the affluent consumer
“optimize” their spend for maximum returns, perhaps without realizing
that the true cost of these rewards is subsidized either by the small
merchant businesses (which lack the required leverage to negotiate more
affordable interchange rates), or the other payment card consumers who
finance debt through high monthly APR interest. Many small businesses
ultimately choose to avoid payment cards altogether and revert to cashonly transactions, putting them at a significant consumer disadvantage.

33

The present state of digital payments

Mobile wallets
More and more, third-party mobile wallets are becoming mainstream

Daily processing volume

payment instruments, capitalizing on their ability to aggregate various
aspects of bank accounts and payment cards and offer even more

Alipay

consumer choice and convenience. While some (like Apple Pay, Google

4.7 billion USD45

Pay, and Samsung Pay) simply serve as vehicles for virtual cards by

175 million transactions

proxying existing payment cards’ primary account numbers, or PANs;
others (such as Alipay, WeChat Pay, PayPal, Venmo, Square Cash,

WeChat Pay

and Apple Pay Cash) have built a suite of value-added services and

3.3 billion USD46

integrations on top of what is essentially a stored value account.

130 million transactions47

Many of these mobile wallets have seen substantial growth in recent

years—especially in China—but their traditional payment instrument

underpinnings present limitations on the ability to provide meaningful

incentives, grow internationally, and manage fraud vulnerabilities.
Paytm

Limited incentives
Today, even the largest and most successful mobile wallet apps and
services enable the vast majority of their transactions by proxying an
underlying insured or regulated payment instrument, such as a bank
account or payment card. By functioning as this abstraction layer, services
like Apple Pay and PayPal are able to offer value-added features like
enhanced security or purchase protection, but are limited in their ability
to provide unique incentives or sustainable bonus structures beyond what
the underlying instruments already support natively.

55 million USD50
11 million transactions

34

The present state of digital payments

International incompatibility
Moreover, mobile wallets have seen substantial growth in markets
without entrenched financial institutions. For example, in the absence
of traditional, credit-based payment infrastructure throughout China,
companies like Alipay and WeChat Pay have built a direct system that
facilitates mobile transactions on a private payment network over the
internet. The rapid growth of these platforms—in terms of both scale
and versatility—is impressive. But because the underlying financial
infrastructure is still provided by domestic financial institutions,
international growth is encumbered by the overhead of adapting these
systems to foreign banks and exchanging currencies.
Outside of payments, the major value in third-party mobile wallets is their
usefulness for internal or peer-to-peer transactions via network effects.
Many people join Alipay, WeChat, Venmo or Square Cash because their
friends are there, or because it’s easier to send money to a phone number
or username than it is to share account numbers. These features build
community, but ultimately limit platform growth to these regional groups
because users have limited incentive to interact internationally.

Fraud vulnerability
Mobile wallets are essentially an interface to existing payment
instruments, which can make them vulnerable to certain types of fraud.
By storing many payment instruments behind a single online account and
password, these apps create an opportunity for account takeovers, which
in 2018 amounted to 5.1 billion USD in losses.51 Many apps also distinguish
between peer-to-peer payments and payments for goods and services
because of their inability to mitigate buyer fraud, such as chargebacks
and ACH returns.
For example, due to its ACH underpinnings, Venmo’s terms and conditions
explicitly warn against using the app for retail payments. When a fraudster
reverses an ACH transaction used to load a Venmo account, the company
is forced to reverse the transaction within its own ecosystem, sometimes
by directly debiting beneficiaries’ bank accounts.
