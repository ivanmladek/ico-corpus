Abstract
SALT is a membership based lending and borrowing
network that allows users to leverage their
blockchain assets to secure cash loans. Our Secured
Automated Lending Technology is a protocol and
asset agnostic architecture designed to adapt to the
constantly growing class of blockchain assets. The
system is designed such that, if you have an asset you
want to hold on to, you can borrow the asset you want
to spend, regardless of credit history or geographic
constraints. The SALT Platform is automated,
efficient, and cryptographically secure. It offers a
compelling solution to the problem many consumers
face when they need or want cash to make a
purchase, but do not wish to liquidate their assets.
Instead of selling, SALT enables the members of the
SALT Lending Platform (Members) to leverage the
value of certain digital assets, thereby giving them
access to cash, offsetting tax events, avoiding
exchange fees and maintaining their long position in
the asset they hold. SALT is a lending platform
specifically designed for blockchain assets;
operating as a second layer protocol which sits atop
any public or permissioned blockchain, allowing the
underlying asset to be used as collateral for access to
credit.
SALT also offers lenders a powerful, globally
available solution to access a rapidly expanding and
immediately addressable borrower base, while
providing new tools for managing lender risk. Unlike
traditional forms of collateral, such as real estate and
automobiles, blockchain assets are divisible,
fungible, and in many cases instantly transferrable.
These potential advantages can be fully realized with
SALT’s volatility risk mitigating technology.

1. Our Vision
People are happiest when they have access to the
things they need or want. This is called purchasing
power and it’s what credit provides. Over the years,
the lending landscape has gone through several
periods of change, and blockchain technology is
driving the next evolution. Income-based lending is
borrowing from the future to spend money today.

This exists in contrast to asset-based lending, which
is a form of monetizing assets already owned. At
SALT Lending, we see a future where people worry
less about their credit score and spend more time
recording and monetizing the assets they already
have. We seek to enable a new way of monetizing an
ever-expanding universe of blockchain assets.
At SALT, we believe that in the not too distant
future, ownership of all assets will be recorded and
transferred on various blockchains. The increasing
recognition of personal assets, at low cost and in a
secure and immutable way, will offer consumers
greater financial freedom. The SALT Lending
Platform is a system that seeks to give value to
previously latent capital, unlocking the wealth within
physical and social assets, providing a new source of
money creation.

2. Background
Created in the wake of the global financial crisis,
Bitcoin, and its underlying blockchain technology,
sparked a wave of innovation that has changed the
way people think about transferring and storing
value. The distributed ledger technology that
underpins Bitcoin, and other digital assets,
decentralizes the tasks of tracking and validating
financial
transactions.
This
technological
breakthrough streamlines settlement systems that
had previously relied on fallible third-party
intermediaries. The intrinsic benefit of this new
technology has led to explosive growth in
blockchain-based assets, which exist within a highly
secure digital infrastructure. Reliance on
intermediaries that introduce counterparty and
settlement risk, in the context of blockchain assets,
has been replaced by trustless, open-value networks
which operate without the constraints of
geographical borders or market hours.
Holders of digital assets have limited liquidity
options in today’s cash based digital economy.
Bitcoin was the first peer-to-peer electronic cash
system enabling trustless transfer of value and we are
witnessing the emergence of a new asset class based
on value networks. Some of these blockchain assets

are natively digital, others are digitized forms of
traditional assets which, like Bitcoin, face critical
liquidity challenges.
Resolving liquidity challenges is important because
spending drives growth in economies and is based on
the summation of money and credit available.
Bitcoin and its associated blockchain technology
created an efficient, trustless cash network free from
expropriation through unknown inflation, but
Bitcoin’s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto neglected to
address credit. Credit links savers and borrowers and
is as important as cash markets to an economy’s
financial development, because it represents
spending in the economy on an order of magnitude
greater than cash based transactions. Distributed
ledger technology allows for transaction and
settlement without counterparty risk. However, the
purchasing power held within this new blockchain
technology need not be limited to assets held. The
access to credit provided by the SALT Lending
Platform is intended to let the world of blockchains
grow beyond the economic limitations of simply
buying and liquidating assets. Credit is not only an
important economic factor, it is a vital component of
personal financial freedom and, along with asset
accumulation, gives individuals greater purchasing
power. Crypto-credit products, like those accessible
through the SALT Lending Platform, offer a
revolution in personal finance by granting control
over the medium of exchange to owners of
blockchain asset based wealth who wish to preserve
their assets, rather than spend them.
Traditional financial institutions often face
significant challenges adapting to changing
landscapes. This is especially true of the assetbacked credit market, where there is still no product
offering an adequate solution for monetizing the
value of blockchain assets without forcing
liquidation. Technological, custodial and regulatory
barriers have prevented existing financial service
companies from overcoming the risk needed to
operate in a system without centralized oversight.
This has left blockchain asset holders with limited
borrowing options in today’s digital economy.

SALT’s Secured Automated Lending Technology
creates a solution that removes many of the barriers
that have kept traditional financial institutions, and
their capital, from serving the rapidly growing base
of individuals and businesses holding assets on
blockchains. The SALT Lending Platform provides
the tools to mitigate the risk of asset price volatility
and borrower default, giving investors the ability to
safely lend against blockchain assets.
A blockchain asset is a natively digital asset like
Bitcoin or a digitized traditional asset like digital
gold, a stock, or a title; where the record of
ownership is recorded within a public or
permissioned distributed ledger network. All
blockchain assets have the potential to be used as
collateral for Blockchain-Backed Loans!, subject to
lender determined collateral suitability.
The SALT Lending Platform is intended to facilitate
the creation of lending agreements, secure and
monitor the value of the blockchain assets acting as
collateral, and automatically enforce the terms of
each smart contract credit agreement. This low-cost,
efficient technology gives investors and institutions
a way to lend against a new asset class, while
addressing the needs of a massively underserved
borrower base. It is also designed to provide a new
way for individuals to access the value of their
blockchain assets that does not involve a liquidation
of their asset. Deficiencies inherent in traditional
forms of collateral can increase costs to borrowers,
decrease liquidity, and necessitate the need for
income-based credit evaluation. SALT’s technology
was built to address these shortcomings, while
emphasizing the aspects of blockchain assets that
make them a functional form of collateral divisibility, fungibility, and transferability. With
SALT, blockchain assets are transformed into
collateral that can be incrementally liquidated in a
calibration
process
intended
to
ensure
overcollateralization in a fast, trustless, and secure
process. Blockchain-Backed Loans™ offer a new
mechanism through which lenders can indirectly
gain exposure to digital assets in a regulated
environment with sophisticated tools for managing
the risks associated with lending.

3. About SALT

lenders. The SALT smart contract credit agreement
has several key functions:

The SALT Lending Platform is designed to enable
its Members to leverage their blockchain assets to
secure cash loans, making it easy to get money to
spend without having to sell their blockchain assets.

●" Secure Collateral Storage. The blockchain
assets underlying each loan are stored in a
fully audited, ultra-secure multi-signature
architecture throughout the life of the loan. !

What is a Blockchain-Backed Loan™?

Key Features Include:
○" scalable management of collateral!
○" mitigated counterparty risk!
○" streamlined arbitration!
○" non-custodial escrow; and!
○" automated loan servicing!
!
●" Automatic Collateral Management. SALT
Lending’s read-write oracle smart contract is
specifically designed for blockchain asset
collateral management. The SALT oracle
smart contract amalgamates real-time global
market price metrics from multiple data
channels to assess the mark-to-market
valuation of the collateral securing the credit
agreement, while simultaneously tracking the
borrower's loan balance. If the value of the
collateral depreciates below a dynamically
determined threshold, a maintenance call
notice is issued to the borrower. In the case of
a maintenance call, the borrower can either
add more collateral, make an extra payment
reducing the loan balance, or do nothing and
the SALT oracle smart contract will
automatically initiate the liquidation of a
portion of the collateral in order to recalibrate the overcollateralization of the loan.
Liquidation occurs through an automated
trading engine, which utilizes proprietary
investment logic to optimize trade execution

A Blockchain-Backed Loan™ is money borrowed
for any kind of personal or business use, such as
making a big purchase, paying off credit card debt,
investing in home improvements, taking a vacation,
or paying for business expenses. The loan is
collateralized by a blockchain asset, such as Bitcoin.
SALT wants to make things simple for its Members.
There are no origination fees, closing costs, or
prepayment penalties on the fixed rate term loans
arranged through the SALT platform. Members may
elect at any time to pay off their loans early at no
additional cost to them. This is in strong contrast to
terms often offered by conventional lenders.
Typically, conventional loans are accompanied by a
myriad of itemized fees such as upfront origination
fees, which can exceed 5% of the loan balance, and
monthly servicing fees that are paid by the borrower
on top of the monthly payments to the lender. SALT
has opted for a simple model where fees charged to
borrowers are rolled into an annual Membership to
promote transparency and fairness.

3.1 Secured Automated Lending Technology
SALT Lending has developed protocol agnostic
technology to automatically manage blockchainbacked credit agreements between borrowers and

Terms and conditions apply. Subject to suitability, KYC & AML screening.

based on a live assessment of available
liquidity, order book depth, and price
velocity across multiple exchanges via
distributed market orders for each currency
pair. !
!
●" Credit Agreement Terms Enforcement.
The SALT smart credit agreement performs
several
loan
servicing
functions
autonomously. It monitors the origination of
the loan, directing cash from the lender’s
bank account to the borrower’s bank account,
and it tracks monthly payments from the
borrower to the lender. If a borrower misses
a payment, the technology automatically
liquidates a portion of the collateral and gives
sale proceeds to the lender as payment on the
borrower’s behalf. Once the borrower repays
the loan in full, the remaining collateral is
returned to the borrower.!
!
If the value of a borrower’s blockchain asset
increases, then depending on the terms of the loan,
the borrower may have the option to (1) add the
increased value to the principal of the loan for an
additional extension of credit from the lender or (2)
withdraw excess collateral. The options available to
the borrower depend on the loan terms agreed to at
the time of loan origination. There are no
prepayment penalties associated with early
retirement of debt. Borrowers who are unable to
increase the available principal balance of the loan
have the ability to repay the loan in full and reapply
for a new product, subject to Lender specific
borrower eligibility and refinance restrictions. Any
appreciation in the blockchain asset collateral is
retained by the borrower following the full
repayment of all outstanding loan principal, interest
and fees.

SALT’s smart credit agreements act as a bridge
between two historically divided systems: the world
of blockchain assets and the world of traditional
financial infrastructure. The SALT Lending Platform
is structured to provide financial institutions and
lenders with the ability to capitalize on this rapidly
growing asset class. SALT’s technology is designed
to systematically quantify and mitigate lending risk,
while simultaneously giving borrowers an alternative
means of accessing the value of their assets.

Example of How a SALT Lending Loan Works *

Overcollateralized Loans
Origination: As an example, a one year $100,000
loan with a 10.00% annual percentage rate (APR) has
twelve scheduled monthly payments of $8,791.59
representing repayment of principal and interest on
the loan. At origination, the $100,000 loan balance is
secured with $125,000 of bitcoin, which is posted to
a multi-signature wallet as collateral. The borrower
and lender each retain a private key to the wallet,
along with a third-party custodian and our SALT
collateral management oracle. In this example, the
collateral balance equates to 50 bitcoin valued at
$2,500.00 per bitcoin. As a result, the loan has an
origination loan-to-value ratio of 80.0%. Stated
differently, the loan is overcollateralized by 25%.

risen to 92%. As a result, the SALT oracle smart
contract issues a collateral maintenance notice to the
borrower, instructing them to either deposit an
additional 7.53 bitcoin to the collateral wallet or
make a loan prepayment of $12,041.74. Either option
would result in the loan returning to an 80% loan-tovalue ratio. The SALT oracle takes reasonable
measures to notify the borrower of the notice, via
email and SMS communications which include an
estimated time allotment to meet the maintenance
call. The actual time period allotted to a borrower to
meet a call is subject to the velocity of the price
decline, and there is no guarantee to the accuracy of
the time estimate.

Payment: The loan balance is reduced to $92,041.74
following the borrower's first $8,791.59 monthly
payment, which represents $833.33 of interest and
$7,958.26 of principal. This payment reduces the
loan-to-value ratio to 73.6%, creating an improved
risk profile for the lender, assuming a static collateral
valuation.

Default: If the borrower is unable to act, or chooses
not to meet the maintenance notice, then the SALT
oracle initiates a partial liquidation transaction along
with the lender and custodian, resulting in the sale of
the amount of collateral needed to return the loan-tovalue ratio to 80%. In this hypothetical example, a
sale order of 30.1 bitcoin would be issued, generating
the $60,200.00 needed to reduce the loan balance.
After the sale, the remaining loan balance of
$31,841.74 would be secured by 19.9 bitcoin at
$2,000.00 per, totaling to a dollar value of
$39,800.00 and resulting in the loan returning to an
80% loan-to-value ratio. The incremental liquidation

Depreciation: Next in this example, the market
value of bitcoin depreciates to $2,000.00, causing the
approach of a 1:1 ratio between the $92,041.74 loan
balance and the new valuation of the 50 bitcoins
posted as collateral. The loan-to-value ratio has now

*Actual terms, rates, loan-to-value thresholds and available credit are subject to market
conditions and suitability, along with KYC & AML screening.

process would next repeat if bitcoin continued to
depreciate to a $1,739.25 price level.
3.2 SALT’s Network of Lenders
Traditional financial institutions have historically
avoided the world of blockchain assets because of the
challenges faced in adapting to this relatively new
technology and asset class. The SALT Lending
Platform provides these institutions with a means to
loan national currencies to holders of blockchain
assets without having to change their internal
business models or add to their operational costs.
While the barriers to adoption have thus far kept
these institutions on the sidelines, the interest and
demand for access to this disruptive technology has
been steadily growing. SALT meets this growing
demand by providing the processes, compliance,
security and technology needed to lend against
blockchain assets.
SALT’s extensive network of lenders is designed to
give Members access to capital-on-demand.
Qualified Members may select the size, type, and
term length of the loan they wish to obtain from the
available options listed. Loan applications are then
automatically matched with qualified lender capital.
Lenders benefit from loan interest in an
overcollateralized fixed income vehicle that is
automatically managed by SALT’s technology and
denominated in a national currency of their choice.
SALT is built to support the lending of any type of
currency with sufficient demand, inclusive of cryptocurrencies. A more complex credit agreement or a
unique collateral type will require more SALT from
the Lender to account for the computational
and development resources required.
Lenders also purchase Membership to the SALT
Lending Platform which gives a Lender access to the
network and related services. Financial terms
reported on the SALT Lending Platform are
determined by qualified Lenders and are subject to
each Lender’s specific risk tolerance. As a result,
annual percentage rates (APR) and loan-to-value
(LTV) ratios offered to eligible Members are subject
to market conditions. All network participants drive
additional demand for access by lending or
borrowing capital.

3.3 SALT Membership
SALT Membership is an Ethereum-based Erc20
smart contract representing levels of access to the
SALT Lending Platform. It can be redeemed for
products and services and other rewards offered
through the platform. A total fixed supply of
120,000,000 Membership units exist. Demand for
lending and borrowing on the SALT Platform will
drive the demand for Membership.

4. How to Purchase Membership
SALT Membership may be purchased with Bitcoin
(BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or any cryptocurrency
supported by ShapeShift. SALT Membership is
priced in United States dollars (USD). Purchase of
Membership will be effective only when SALT
Lending accepts the application upon multiple
confirmations of payment. The purchase of SALT
Membership at a discount will end at the earlier of a
predetermined end date, or the date at which the sale
is either closed or terminated by management in its
sole discretion. Applicants will be alerted to whether
they were successful in purchasing a Membership by
email and an update to their account on the SALT
Lending
Platform
available
at
https://www.SaltLending.com.
The final purchase price is determined when two
confirmations have been recorded on the Bitcoin or
Ethereum blockchain. No refunds will be issued for
accepted Membership sales. Membership pricing for
the SALT Lending Platform is based on fixed
quantity tiers. Digital currency payments that carry
inadequate fees may experience an increase in price
between their initiation of purchase and SALT
Lending’s confirmation. If using a payment
processor that only allows a single unconfirmed
transaction to remain pending at any given time,
multiple purchases may result in delayed
confirmation. SALT Lending will determine the
exchange conversion rate for each purchase by
aggregating price feeds from multiple exchanges,
adjusting for volume, price variance, statistical
outliers and inactivity.

If an attempted purchase of Membership is not
accepted following screening procedures, those
funds will be promptly returned.
SALT Lending has engaged First Bank to hold USD
funds. In the event management terminates the sale
or doesn’t accept a Membership application, any
USD tendered by an applicant will be returned net of
any outgoing fees charged.
Purchasers of SALT paying in Bitcoin (BTC) or
Ethereum (ETH) will direct funds, into multisignature cold wallets specifically designed for this
sale. Each purchaser will be provided a unique
purchase destination address for the purpose of
acquiring a SALT Membership. In the event
management closes the sale or doesn’t accept the
Membership applications, any Bitcoin (BTC) or
Ethereum (ETH) tendered by an applicant will be
promptly returned by the multi-signature wallet net
of any outgoing fees charged.
4.1 Membership Status
Membership to the SALT Lending Platform is a
prerequisite for a Member to access information and
obtain the financial products offered through the
SALT Lending Platform. In order to purchase a
Membership, a person or entity must create an
account by providing a username and an email
address, among other requirements established by
SALT Lending. Satisfactory completion of both
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your
Customer (KYC) screening is required before
distribution of any purchase in excess of $2,000.00
(two thousand dollars) USD, and may be required for
any other purchase amount, as determined by SALT
Lending. Any Member actively looking to obtain a
financial product may be required to complete
further Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your
Customer (KYC) and SALT suitability screening.
Membership offers a subscription to the SALT
Lending Platform and is used as payment for
products and services. An initial purchase of a SALT
Membership, in any quantity, results in an immediate
redemption representing the purchase of a base

annual Membership to the SALT Lending Platform.
Members of the platform accumulate status through
their acquisition and redemption of SALT
Memberships above and beyond each minimum
threshold. The cost of Membership replaces most
fees charged to borrowers associated with loan
origination and servicing. Elevated annual
Membership status is achieved when additional
memberships are redeemed through the SALT
Lending Platform. SALT Membership is available
for purchase in any increment depending on
available inventory. Premier and Enterprise
Membership packages increase the loan product
types and maximum available loan balances
accessible to Members.
As outlined on the next page, products and services
are made available to Members in several tiered
packages, representing minimum redemption
thresholds. Benefits associated with Membership
status are based on redeemed SALT. Each tier
enables qualified members to gain access to
increasingly customizable credit products, ranging
from fixed rate term loans to lines of credit and
crypto-secured credit cards, all collateralized by
blockchain assets. Additionally, SALT can be spent
to reduce a portion of the interest rate associated with
a financial product underwritten by a lender on our
platform. Members have the option to redeem SALT
Membership prior to the closing of a newly
originated loan in exchange for a reduced interest
rate. This is called “buying down the rate”, and it
permanently lowers the monthly interest payment
due for the duration of that loan. Access to the
platform API is also denominated in SALT
Memberships, as is access to the platform’s lender
network for institutional accounts. This service
offers clients, such as exchanges, wallets, and digital
asset custodians, an API subscription service
whereby they can access the SALT Lending
marketplace to offer credit products to their own
customer base, for a subscription access fee. This
API plugin is available to them and ultimately
utilizes capital arranged via the platform’s lender
network. Subject to prevailing market exchange
rates. Terms and conditions may apply.

Select products and services, such as hardware devices, are available for purchase at additional cost. Loan
products available at launch are subject to Lender determined product offerings. SALT Lending anticipates
that only bitcoin collateralized US dollar denominated products will initially be available. Annual
Membership fees are subject to regular market based price adjustments.

The SALT Network

5. Sample Platform Use Cases

The borrowing power made available to Members
will be based on either the summation of a single
asset’s value or that of a portfolio of various
blockchain assets.

Crypto-Exchange - Integrated Leverage

The attractiveness of the products offered through
the SALT Lending Platform increases in conjunction
with an increase in the number of participants
utilizing SALT Membership, resulting in a classic
network effect. SALT Lending’s marketplace offers
consumer borrowers access to affordable credit, and
allows individual and institutional lenders the
opportunity to lend against a new class of assets. As
both sides of the equation grow, the advantages
(reduced risk, lower cost) scale accordingly,
attracting even more borrowers and lenders. The
increased participant pool generates competitive
interest rate dynamics and data, which is used to
improve the effectiveness of SALT Lending’s risk
models.
The SALT crypto-secured credit card

A crypto-currency exchange may desire to offer its
clients leverage through their internal interface.
SALT Lending is designed to enable this by
providing a streamlined API integration whereby, an
exchange can utilize the platform and
instantaneously offer leverage terms to their
customer base without requiring their users to
directly interface with the SALT Lending Platform.
Capital is arranged by our extensive lender network
and seamlessly integrated into the end user’s
experience. An arrangement of this nature requires
the crypto-exchange to purchase an Enterprise
Membership package and redeem SALT
Memberships for use of the API.
ICO - Business Development Line of Credit
A startup that has completed a token offering may
look to use sale proceeds for development of their
business. Often these costs require payment in
various national currencies and necessitate the
liquidation of the digital currency raised. An
Enterprise Membership would allow the startup to
access a working capital loan or line of credit to help
them grow their business, without having to liquidate
their blockchain assets.
Miner - Working Capital Loans

The SALT crypto-secured credit card is a form of a
line of credit that is collateralized by blockchain
assets. It will operate on established credit card
payment processor networks and allows for
payments in national currencies.

Proof of Work mining requires significant fixed and
variable capital expenses. A mining operation must
be constantly acquiring or developing purpose built
computer chips while also purchasing electricity to
run their systems. Often these R&D costs require
payment to third party suppliers denominated in
various national currencies. In order to maintain
production, a mining operation must therefore sell
their mining reward to reinvest in development. With
a SALT working capital loan, a miner can now better
manage
their
capital
allocations
and
opportunistically sell mined inventory when the time
is right.

6. The Technology

Key features of the SALT Oracle:

SALT Memberships exist on the Ethereum
Blockchain and loan collateral is recorded on its
native blockchain. SALT’s Secured Automated
Lending Technology is a protocol and asset agnostic
architecture. Any blockchain asset, including those
that exist on permissioned distributed ledgers, can be
used as collateral and managed by our smart credit
contracts. Our SALT oracle creates multi-signature
smart contracts on the collateral's native blockchain
or an external blockchain, case depending. Any
external transfer of the collateral, whether it be a
liquidation event or a reversion to the borrower, will
occur on-chain.

o" Monitoring of both the loan origination and the
payments made by the borrower to the lender
o" Monitoring of the value of the blockchain asset
held as collateral
o" Generation of alerts if the value of the blockchain
asset drops below an agreed upon threshold
o" Triggering of maintenance calls
o" Storage of collateral until loan terms are fulfilled
o" Dispersal and/or liquidation of collateral
according to loan terms

If the threshold for collateral liquidation is breached,
the SALT oracle triggers a liquidation event which is
co-signed by other parties. Liquidation events may
include fees which are passed along to the borrower.
The margin requirements are determined by lenders
and agreed to by borrowers. Terms are clearly
outlined in each loan agreement. The SALT
collateral wallet is a multi-signature blockchain
wallet that stores collateral and automatically
enforces lending terms. Throughout the duration of
the loan the borrower retains ownership of the
underlying blockchain asset and a key to the multisignature wallet.
The SALT Lending Platform can be directly
integrated into hardware wallet devices allowing for
additional security for loan collateral.

The SALT oracle operates autonomously. However,
a minimum of three signatures are always required to
trigger a liquidation order. This redundancy provides
an added level of security. The SALT Lending
Platform uses global server redundancy to protect its
Members. Servers are distributed across several
continents, through third party cloud based web
services and hardware devices. Additionally, SALT
Lending takes advantage of fully distributed server
systems.
SALT Lending’s decentralized, blockchain based
technology platform automates key aspects of
operations, including: the borrower application
process, data gathering, underwriting, loan funding,
servicing, collateral management, regulatory
compliance and fraud detection. This provides a
significant time and cost advantage over traditional
lending business models and we believe it enables us
to provide a superior user experience to both
borrowers and lenders.
Members interact with the SALT Lending Platform
either through a web and mobile user interface (UI)
or via an application program interface (API), which
allow seamless integration of the loan platform
functionality directly into the backend systems of
Enterprise Members. Whether through the UI or API,
Enterprise Members are able to offer decentralized
leverage products to their own clients via their
existing systems.

7. Privacy
The factors that define a Member’s participation
profile are private by default and are only revealed to
other platform participants with the explicit consent
of the Member. Data on the platform is held in a
distributed way. This is important to avoid the user
data breaches that befall centralized databases. With
the SALT Lending Platform, loan collateral is
independently secured in unique smart contracts
associated with individual credit agreements.
Continual development requires developers to have
permissioned access to update the software and as a
result, the back-end marketplace will be centralized
and under the control of SALT Lending as an
organization. The platform inherits the trustsensitive aspects of the protocol tokens which
underpin the products offered by SALT Lending.
SALT is committed to keeping any and all personal
information collected from the individuals that visit
our website and make use of our platform accurate,
confidential, secure and private. SALT is however,
required to verify the identity of Members who apply
for financial products through the platform.

8. Sale Mechanics
SALT Memberships will initially be distributed in
the form of a discounted sale. The purpose of the
discounted membership structure is to attract
Members early on who can provide feedback on our
prototype as we further improved our product. The
participation and feedback from the SALT

Community has been crucial to our development.
The largest discounts are being provided to the
earliest Members who provide direct feedback and
influence our platform’s development, as we move
from the prototype phase to launch. The sale
environment is designed to gather feedback. SALT
Lending is offering participants a discount for
helping to improve the systems, interface and
network strength. Each SALT Membership will
initially retail for $10.00 United States dollars (USD)
following the discounted sale period.
The sale will not follow a strict timing mechanism.
Instead, a set number of memberships will be
available for purchase at a set discount level.
Members will be unable to withdraw their SALT
Memberships until the discounted sale and
independent review is completed, and Memberships
have been allocated and disbursed. Following the
initial discount, SALT Membership will be available
for purchase at full retail price.

9. Business Development
SALT Lending completed a seed capital funding
round in early 2017 raising over $1 million USD, for
the purposes of capitalizing the company to develop
the SALT Lending Platform. All executive members
of the team and board members have contributed
personal funds to the development of the software
and the company. SALT Lending does not intend to
liquidate any cryptocurrency generated from
Membership revenue. SALT aligns itself with the
“hodl” ethos of the crypto community and will

borrow against the company’s balance sheet. This is
designed to emphasize SALT’s business model.
Management intends to use debt to fund further
development of the platform. Future expenses may
include security and financial audit fees, legal,
regulatory and other consultancy fees, retention of
talent, acquisitions, future patent registration,
systems licensing, and marketing fees.
SALT Lending intends to have its financial position
audited by a top tier accounting firm on a quarterly
basis. External and internal software security audits
are also an ongoing part of SALT’s business model
and
have
been
performed
by
Spirent
Communications Inc.
The lending and securities industries are highly
regulated throughout the world and the business in
which SALT Lending operates is subject to complex
rules and extensive regulations. Parts of the business
are subject to licensing and examination by various
regional, federal, state and local government
authorities. The ability to serve a global Membership
base is key to SALT Lending’s business model. As a
result, a considerable budget will continue to be
allocated towards the on-boarding of new
jurisdictions. This process entails meeting legal and
licensing requirements to ensure regulatory
compliance across continents and international
borders. This also often entails establishing regional
offices, legal counsel and several service providers.

We intend to set aside two percent of the total sale
proceeds for the SALT Financial Inclusion Initiative,
which seeks to provide blockchain backed lines of
credit to anyone who is currently unbanked and/or is
unable to get credit as a result of social exclusion.
Loans will be issued to qualifying applicants and
collateralized with bitcoin from sale proceeds.
Secure accounts will be established for individuals
and an education on blockchain-backed loans will be
made available to help recipients use credit the right
way, creating “good debt”.

12. Regulation
Some elements of SALT Lending’s businesses are
subject to state and federal regulation within the
United States and to foreign laws and regulations.
Loans arranged through the SALT platform are
originated by an SEC registered investment advisor
or other on boarded registered banking entities.

The SALT wallet will be built into the SALT
dashboard. The wallet will give Member's the ability
to upgrade their Membership, send additional SALT
to the public ETH address currently associated with
a Member's account, or choose a different public
ETH address in which a Member would like to store
and secure their SALT. Direct hardware wallet
integration will be available for added security.
We estimate that Member wallets will be available
15 days after the independent review of Membership
transactions. The internal review is estimated to
require one to three weeks from the close of the
discounted sale. For the sake of speed, we will allow
access to wallets once the members transactions have
been reviewed. Access to the wallet will vary based
upon when a member’s transactions have been
reviewed.

The SALT Brand
The SALT name originated from the historical
record of when salt became more than a commodity,
as it gained use as a store of value. Used as a medium
of exchange for food, clothing, and other general
provisions, salt broke the mold of what a commodity
could be. With the invention of blockchain
technology the boundaries are once again being
pushed. We are forced to rethink what defines an
asset or currency as well as the ways in which they
can be recorded and transacted. SALT is also an
acronym for Secured Automated Lending
Technology, the name given to our programmed
smart loan contract. The efficiencies and security
provided by our technology is SALT’s competitive
edge. Just like its namesake, SALT intends to be a
household name, a pillar in the financial market, and
a brand that breaks the mold on how secured lending
is conducted.
