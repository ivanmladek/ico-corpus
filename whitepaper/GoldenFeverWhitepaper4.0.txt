Online gambling market

Online gambling market

The gambling industry is growing each year. First started as casino-boom, the
market is moving towards online. New gambling websites and platforms are
launched every day attracting more and more players.


Online gambling revenues are growing at an incredible rate of 10.81%
current annual growth rate. $12 billion in revenue was earned in 2005,
$29.3 billion in 2010 and $56.06 billion in 2018. The global online
revenues are expected to double by the end of 2024 to $96.89 billion
in revenue. The online betting segment is anticipated to dominate
the market with more than 45% of the total market share by 2020.

Meanwhile, online gambling has many problems that stop the market f rom
growing even more

03

Online gambling market

Meanwhile, online gambling has many problems that stop the market
from growing even more.

A player does not know if the mathematics behind the games are fair.
Most of the games are made to rip off the players. Instead of the precise
algorithm, websites are using complex analysis of how much did the
player bet. The game decides, when does the player win or lose.
Moreover, wins are made for the player to bet and lose more.

Funds withdraw 

Once a player deposits money to his balance, it goes to the website
account. So it is for the platform to decide if they will cash out investor's
profits or freeze them on his balance.

Illegal industry 

Since most of the gambling platforms have the possibility to fraud
players money, they choose to remain anonymous in case of any user
will go to court.


Overall, online gambling remains mostly a dark
part of the internet. 



04

Online gambling market

The solution for those problems is smart-contracts. Smart-contracts are
implementing transparency to the core game algorithms, which anyone
can review code. All the rules are stated in the blockchain and accepted by
every party.

There are more and more reliable gambling platforms that use
smart-contracts. The ultimate benefits of them are:

Transparency

A player can be assured that the game is fair and
casino is playing by rules.

Flexibility

A player can use any size of the bet, no matter how
big or small it is.

Low Fees

Smart-contracts help business to surpass various costs on
administering and 24/7 support. Therefore, to become
profitable, the platform does not need a lot of income,
which allows it to decrease fees for all the players. Also, the
platform fees are transparent, since they are coded into
smart-contract.

Flexibility

Since a player does not need to trust the
third-side, his funds are not involved in the
risk of a scam.

05

Market depth and problems analysis

Market depth and problems
analysis

There are more than a hundred
decentralized gambling apps
(dApps). The total volume is more
than 25 million dollars per day. 


Considering the overall bearish
market, these results show that
gambling apps had a decent
demand and formalized their
niche within the online gambling
market.

80% of the market volume is produced by top-10 dApps. Those
games are pretty simple and straightforward: dice, bets, poker,
roulette and so on. Most of dApps are using EOS smart-contracts.
Others use Tron or Ethereum blockchains.

06

Market depth and problems analysis

The smart-contracts gambling apps niche is competitive. To
become the top-10 dApp it needs to solve multiple problems.

The smart-contracts gambling apps niche is competitive. To
become the top-10 dApp it needs to solve multiple problems.

It is tough to create some new gaming model that players would
like more than games they used to play for years. Meanwhile, all
the conservative games are presented on each gambling
platform. The platform needs to implement fresh ideas and
provide a top-notch user interface to attract new users.

3

Initial funds are needed for development
and marketing
There are two ways of funds allocation: investors or self-funded. In
either case, it is tough to predict the time when investments will
start generating profit

4

90% of the volumes are produced by 5% of
the players
The platform needs to find big players and provide various benefits
that will force them to stay.

In the end, the creation of the popular gambling platform requires
initial investments for marketing and development. While it is
challenging to obtain the first players, the online gambling market
is growing to produce enormous revenues for the top platforms


07

GoldenFever coin

GoldenFever coin

The core of the platform is the masternode coin called GoldenFever.
It serves as the instrument of funding, marketing, and utility for the
platform.

Coin as a passive income
GoldenFever implemented Proof of stake algorithm with the
combination of highly return masternodes for the currency to reward the
first players and investors. 


Proof of stake is a mining algorithm that allows getting coins by staking
them in the wallet. It increases the percentage of coins held in the wallets
on the long-term while providing a stable income for the holder.

Masternodes are the fully synchronized blockchain nodes that increase
the network stability and make decisions such as locking transactions
with InstantSend, coordinate mixing of coins, and voting on budget
funding. Masternodes receive rewards for administrating blockchain
features. In the case of GoldenFever, 80% of the block reward goes to the
masternode owners.

Besides decentralization, masternodes ensure the immersive value for
the coin. Masternodes are a useful tool for keeping the price stable
because it locks out most of the coin emission while creating a simple
way of mining coins.

The required amount of coins to launch the masternode is 1 000 GFR. The
average return of investment for masternode holder is 1 000% per year.

13

GoldenFever coin

Price support based on the platform's income
The crucial coin feature is that 30% of platforms income is spent on price
support and buybacks. The team is burning all the coins that were
bought from the market through price support. 


Usually, the masternode coins are dropping in price, because of the
excessive inflation without enough demand. However, in the case of GFR,
the bond between the platform and the coin assures that the high return
of investment masternodes is the source of stable profits for the first
investors.
Benefits of the masternode coin
Masternodes can be a great source of passive income for investors. The
creation of a highly profitable model of passive income attracts
thousands of people. They form an active community of coin holders and
believe in the success of their investment.

This community is the first players of GoldenFever platform. They test the
games, share their opinions and help developers to make the product
better. Those players help in boosting the platform's position on dApp
rating websites, which is the source of organic traffic.
Early investors are the first users of the referral system that creates stable
platform growth
Coin utility
There are three ways of using coin beside creating a passive income:
playing, marketing, and paying.

14

GoldenFever coin

lotteries. It is critical to creating as many
accessible lotteries as possible for all kind of

EOS coins on gambling. To surpass this
psychological barrier the variety of GFR
lotteries will be made, so every investor can
try out the games and have fun.

Marketing

Marketing
GoldenFever's goal is to reach $200 000 of daily volumes. To
achieve this GoldenFever created a sophisticated marketing
strategy with many elements that increase the effect of each other.

Platform marketing through the coin
The coin released earlier than the platform. Through successful
marketing, in the first month, the coin community will have up to two
thousand active members. GFR coin passive income is attractive for
investors. Therefore, the coin will form the community of early testers of
the platform.

GFR coin is an excellent source of organic traffic. Each marketing action
made to benefit currency and will attract new players for the platform.
Marketing actions: exchange listings, market making, YouTube reviews,
articles, bounties, monitoring websites listings, partnerships with services,
airdrops

19

Marketing

Platform marketing
The platform marketing consists of various sources:


Direct
marketing

GFR is constantly testing multiple marketing channels to
find the best conversion rates. It includes all types of
marketing: articles, YouTube reviews, direct advertisement,
streams, and so on.

Referrals

source of new users, without paying for that. That is why
GFR uses 10% of income on making the system more
profitable for all kinds of people who will use it. Potential
target audience: community leaders, influencers, websites
administrators.

advertisements.

Organic traffic

resource. The bigger the platform, the more new players
are arriving daily. This channel includes rankings and
monitoring websites. By reaching top-10, the GoldenFever
receives more than 10 000 views per day from new users.

20

Marketing

Coin marketing

Once the platform marketing provides a constant source of new players,
the coin will significantly benefit f rom it, because each player is the
potential buyer of the GFR coin. The platform becomes the source of new
investors to the currency.
The concept of passive income backed up by the platforms profits shows
the stability of the GFR investment, which makes GFR coin attractive
asset to buy.

Interactions with other coins and communities

The GoldenFever platform has many use-cases for other communities. It
can make games, engage other currencies into gambling, form a prize
pool sponsored by many projects to get much attention both for GFR and
for other products.
The most efficient way of promoting community is integrating with
projects with a similar target audience.
The typical example of a highly beneficial marketing campaign is the
massive lottery between communities of the many coins. Each currency
provides with a required amount of coins, which will be played amongst
participants. The lottery is taking place on GoldenFever platform. Each
coin advertises the event in their community, which gives the overall
thousands of views exposure. This attention spreads between the
currencies and attracts new players and investors to the GoldenFever
ecosystem. In the end, each coin gets hundreds of new investors by
merely providing a small number of coins.
