Introducion
Mindexcoin is a new way of payment and a global currency option. We have
constantly evolved, expanding our projects and each time conquering more.
Cryptocurrency is the future of financial transactions for the world economy and
this is no longer a hypothesis, but a fact. Blockchain technology has revolutionized
all sectors of human communication, bringing assertiveness, transparency and
perfection to all kinds of systems that can be imagined.
The Mindexcoin project has adapted, shaped itself to the needs and requirements
of the market and is developing, day after day, as a solid cryptocurrency and a clear
project.
Bigger, better, more eﬀective. This is the proposal of our project about the
cryptocurrency, wallet and payment system developed.

Vision
With the conviction that the cryptocurrency is the future of the world economy,
Mindexcoin was developed under the vision of covering all the technological areas
of a successful cryptocurrency.
From its ICO period, to bolder plans for the future, such as its own Wallet, a system
of payments to spread around the world, facilitating payments in cryptocurrencies,
and finally the development of its own blockchain, elevating MIC in another level,
placing it in a high position among the main cryptocurrencies in the world.
Therefore, through all these tools developed by our team, we intend to generate
more and more value in the scenario and get credibility through a service of
absolute quality and unquestionable, through the transparency and eﬀectiveness
of systems and processes.

Blockchain
Technology
Blockchain technology has revolutionized many areas of human current life. In
economics, education, science, health and even politics. We have no doubt that this
technology marks a new era for humanity, and it is also known that the blockchain
is still only in its beginning of exploration and use.
Knowing this, from the beginning of its development, Mindexcoin aimed to develop
its own blockchain technology. More transparent, faster, and safer transactions are
consequences of using blockchain as the basis of a cryptocurrency.
The development of an own blockchain for the MIC is fundamental to place the
currency in the spotlight, providing an even more eﬀective service to its users and
generating a credibility with the market of cryptocurrency, placing MIC among
the greatest ones of the market, generating value and increasing its volume
considerably.
Therefore, Mindexcoin has as its project to develop its own blockchain and,
consequently, to enable its mining, so that users can capitalize through the mining
fee, maximizing the security, transparency and speed of their transactions, which
will be validated by more and more decentralized mining machines.

Mindexcoin
Cryptocurreny
A faster, more transparent and secure cryptocurrency. Mindexcoin has evolved and
this shows how much its developers have been working to make this project keep
developing, increasing its credibility and popularity in the cryptocurrencies market.
In January 2019 Mindexcoin hired highly competent developers that, after many
studies and analysis of the technology, developed, based on Litecoin, an own
Mindexcoin blockchain, letting of be a Ethereum token network and conquering its
technological independence, expanding its possibilities.
Emitting new currencies made by the new blockchain, Mindexcoin aims to position
itself among the largest cryptocurrencies in the market, both in appreciation and
in marketing.

Airdrop Pool
To help with the stabilization and probable appreciation of the currency, Mindexcoin
has developed the Airdrop pool. Only the Mindexcoin that were in MindexWallet
before the launch of the new Blockchain will be in this system.
It will be available, from the Airdrop pool to your MindexWallet,
0.9% MIC per month, automatically.
This measure was taken to prevent a massive sale of the currency, leading to a
devaluation.
The user will receive in his MindexWallet automatically 0.3%
on days 5, 15 and 25 of each month, totaling 0.9% per month.
That is, the MIC’s automatically left the Airdrop pool and are transferred to your
MindexWallet. Mindexcoin counts on the understanding of all its users, who will be
the main beneficiaries with the Airdrop pool measure.
