INTRODUCTION
A lottery game built on the Ethereum blockchain will be a major innovation in the global
lottery industry. The lottery industry holds a 29% share of the global gambling revenue
[1], and is facing challenges due to the growth of the digital economy. Worldwide
demand for more transparent, fair services has grown concurrent with the advance of
technologies that enable the change. The distributed, decentralized nature of
blockchain technology offers tremendous opportunities for financial technology
innovation, and, similarly, for gaming industry modernization.
A gaming system built based on the use of the Ethereum blockchain would operate with
a high degree of autonomy, and its data and records would be cryptographically stored
in a public, decentralized blockchain. Available online and borderless, such a system
can resolve several challenges of traditional lotteries.
The proposed lottery will employ the random number generation (RNG) method, which
is secure and fair and prevents manipulation and fraud. This project implements a
completely secure RNG method based on the current version of the Bitcoin
decentralized protocol.

Global Lottery Industry
The global lottery industry grew from $187.1 billion in
2004 to $294.3 billion in 2016, representing a compound
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.3% per year. In 12 years
from 2004 to 2016, lottery sales have declined only once,
evidencing the stability of the business. More than 64% of
global lottery sales come from Europe and North America
[2].
Concurrently, with growing penetration of the Internet
and mobile phone adoption, online and mobile lotteries
are growing everywhere. The total revenue of mobile
lotteries in 2016 is estimated to be 43 billion, while 44% of
the amount is generated in Europe and North America. The
pace of technology adoption can be even faster in the
developing markets.

Fire Lotto can operate as a global blockchain protocol, but can also be offered to
governments of specific countries as a solution to challenges to ensuring a fair lottery.
Globalization, economic growth in the developing world and progress in information
technology are factors that will accelerate changes in the lottery industry, especially
in the emerging markets. The global lottery industry is moving closer to cross-border,
high-technology lotteries, and blockchain technology can be the stepping stone needed
for this innovation.

Challenges Faced by Lottery Industry
Blockchain technology can solve trust and fairness issues faced by the lottery industry.
As with all centralized services, lotteries have real and perceived trust issues. Some of
the most common lottery industry problems are described below.
Fairness
Ensuring fairness of the game remains the biggest challenge. Lottery players may
question the possibility of manipulation or fraud, e.g., several possible concerns:
▪

Are the ticket and lottery real?

▪

Is the money really accumulated in one pool?

▪

Is RNG truly random and secure?

▪

Is the jackpot winner real?

▪

Are the prizes paid on time?

The two famous cases of lottery manipulation described below illustrate the cause for
concern.
Hot Lotto fraud scandal (2010). Eddie Tipton, the former information security director
of the U.S. Multi-State Lottery Association, installed software code that allowed him to
manipulate random number generation and predict winning numbers on specific days
of the year and led to his winning a $14.3 million jackpot in 2010. The manipulation
was discovered, and Tipton was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in
2015.
The 1980 Pennsylvania Lottery scandal (also known as the Triple Six Fix). This was a
plot to rig the Daily Number, a three-digit game offered by the Pennsylvania Lottery.
All the balls in the three machines, except those numbered 4 and 6, were weighted,
and as a result the numbers drawn were almost sure to be a combination of those digits.
The scheme was successful in that 666 (one of the eight combinations that the

Page 2

conspirators were hoping for) was drawn on April 24, 1980; however, authorities were
alerted by unusual betting patterns. The chief participants in the plot were sent to
prison, and most of the fraudulently acquired winnings were never paid out.
Regulations
In some countries lotteries are not legal, and in most other countries only governments
and affiliated organizations can obtain a license to operate a commercial lottery
business. Corruption schemes that can affect distribution of funds may take place in
different regions.
Availability
Users from other countries cannot easily participate in some of the biggest lotteries in
the world such as Euromillions or some of the lotteries in the United States. Users are
limited to playing smaller, local lotteries due to the smaller size of their domestic
market, underdevelopment of the lottery industry at home, or strict regulation. New
online solutions that allow such players to buy worldwide or U.S. lottery tickets have
recently gained some popularity, but the service charges, as well as risks of fraud and
mismanagement, remain high.
Currently, lotteries are controlled by the state and regulated by law in most parts of
the world. On average, no more than 50% of all funds collected from ticket sales are
allocated to the prize pool. It should be noted that lottery participants have no control
over how much money is collected from ticket sales, and the average value mentioned
above is a rough estimate. In addition, lottery winnings are taxed, and in some countries
(for example, the U.S.) as much as 60% can be withheld.
The average price of a lottery ticket is about USD 2.00. Lottery machines are used to
draw the winning numbers for a lottery at different intervals. It is believed that the
winning numbers are drawn randomly, but there are ways to influence the results. In
order to make their lottery look more credible, organizers arrange live television
broadcasts and set up lottery commissions. However, it is easy to make the process
non-random by putting radio frequency identification (RFID) tags on lottery balls (even
a child could do this).
We can draw a firm conclusion that any lottery is a source of government revenue
earned at the expense of citizens through an unequal distribution of funds collected
from lottery ticket sales.
Many gambling industry representatives are unhappy with this system, and a few good
attempts have been made to organize an honest Internet lottery. However, the

Page 3

traditional approach to organizing a lottery which involves the use of a centralized
organizational structure (i.e., a single server that may belong to a single owner) has
long been mistrusted because nobody can check the RNG (random number generator)
or any other parameters of the lottery other than a narrow circle of interested parties.
The blockchain technology can help us solve this problem. However, projects that use
this technology are not always transparent enough. Let us take the TrueFlip project as
an example. If you carefully read their project description and code published on
GitHub, you will see their use of the blockchain technology is limited only to the RNG,
while data on the amount of funds collected and the distribution of funds is stored on
a single server.

HOW THE BLOCK CHAIN FIRE LOTTO WORKS
We have built a completely transparent and fully decentralized platform for organizing
and conducting a lottery using the blockchain technology and ETH smart contracts for
collecting and distributing funds, drawing winning numbers in a random fashion, and
paying lottery tickets sales commission to token holders.
The prize pool of the Fire Lotto lottery is formed from 70% of the funds collected from
ticket sales. The minimum size of a guaranteed jackpot is fixed—1000 ETH (~ USD
1,000,000) for the 6/45 lottery.[*] If nobody wins the main prize in a drawing, it will be
rolled over to the next drawing and increased. The jackpot will keep growing until it
finds its winner.
There will be five prize categories with a different prize depending on how accurately
the player predicts lottery numbers. All categories starting from 2 will be calculated as
percentages of the prize pool. If several winners win the jackpot in one drawing, it will
be split between them.
We will offer two types of lotteries: instant lotteries and draw lotteries.
The Roger’s Wheel instant lottery is a mix between the traditional wheel of fortune
and a slot machine. In this game, players can place bets ranging from 0,003 ETH (~USD
2.00) to 1 ETH (~USD 1,000.00) [*] and choose a payout rate from 2 to 20, which will be
used to multiply their winnings. Next, the player spins the wheel divided into 21 sectors
with different payout rates on them. If the wheel stops at the player’s chosen rate, he
or she will instantly have the winnings (the bet multiplied by the payout rate)
transferred to their cryptocurrency wallet. The player can turn an unlimited number of

Page 4

wheels in one game, which reduces the waiting time and increases the number of
tickets bought by the player. The wheel rotates for 20–30 seconds. The randomness of
the game is ensured by ETH blockchain-based RNG. Its description will be given later in
the text.

On average, 5-6% of the value of bets made is kept by the system.
We offer three types of draw lotteries: 4/20, 5/36, and 6/45. Our platform allows for
the addition of new types of lotteries in the future. The player enters the lottery site
with a traditional and user-friendly interface, where he or she can buy almost an
unlimited number of lottery tickets and choose numbers for each ticket. Tickets are
bought in one click through the user’s cryptocurrency wallet. An Ethereum transaction
goes to the smart contract of the chosen lottery, contributing to the prize pool. 70% of
all lottery ticket sales are allocated to the prize pool. Table 1 shows data on the
distribution of lottery funds.

There is a drawing every six hours in each lottery. Numbers are drawn randomly with
the help of the blockchain-based RNG (any four, five, or six numbers are taken from
the unique code of the latest bitcoin block mined). After all the numbers in the lottery
have been drawn, winnings are automatically transferred to the owners of the winning
tickets through the algorithm built in the smart contract. Table 2 shows the distribution
of the prize pool in the Fire Lotto.

Winnings are automatically paid in full within 90 seconds of the drawing. Transfers are
made to the cryptocurrency wallets that were used to buy the winning tickets. In the
draw lottery, every 10th ticket wins a prize. The thing is that many lotteries have a

Page 7

payout rate of 1 for two matching numbers, which means that players only win back
their bet. However, we should remember that there is a tax on gambling winnings,
which means that the player who guessed two numbers will lose at least 30% of their
bet rather than win anything. In our lottery, the minimum payout rate for two matching
numbers is at least 1.6, which means that the player will get paid back price of the
ticket plus half of its cost.
Fire Lotto token holders will also have sales commission transferred to their
cryptocurrency wallets after the drawing. The sales commission rate will be fixed in
the smart contract. Commission will be paid in ETH. Token holders will be free to use
their share of sales commission as they wish.
All processes and distribution operations in the system will be carried out based on the
mechanisms built into smart contracts, which will exclude the possibility of their being
influenced by the lottery organizers. Everything will be done autonomously, honestly,
and transparently.
In order to substantiate what has been said, we will publish the full source code of the
Fire Lotto at the beginning of our initial coin offering (ICO) so that anyone can check it
and see that the system corresponds to its description in this paper.

▪

There is no possibility of system abuse.

▪

The Fire Lotto is anonymous.

▪

Winnings of any size are paid out almost instantly.

▪

▪

The fact that the lottery platform is decentralized means that the platform
will operate independently and autonomously as long as there are gambling
enthusiasts, the Internet, and cryptocurrency.

▪

Sales commission payments are secured by smart contracts and provide token
holders with an almost endless source of income.

▪

The price of Fire Lotto tokens will constantly increase.

SALES COMMISSION DISTRIBUTION AND PAYMENT
Fire Lotto token holders are guaranteed to get 10% of the funds collected from ticket
sales. Sales commission is distributed after each and every drawing based on the smart
contract, regardless of the volume of ticket sales. Yield per token is 3.20 U.S. cents
from each 16 million tickets sold, which is more than 20% per annum of the amount of
funds invested in Fire Lotto tokens. Considering the fact that more than 150 billion
lottery tickets priced at USD 2.00 are sold globally each year, the profitability of Lotto
tokens may exceed 50% per annum in the very first year.

Note: According to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, 67 million lottery
tickets were sold in 2016 for the 6/45 lottery alone. Our lottery will be available in all
world countries, including those with a ban on lotteries. The global annual turnover of
the lottery market is more than USD 300 billion. Therefore, we believe that hitting 1
billion ticket sales around the world per year is a realistic goal. When this figure is
reached, yield per token will grow by more than 12 times.

Page 9

We should not forget that there is also the Roger’s Wheel instant lottery, which is in
effect a slot machine that keeps 10% of the value of bets made. The profitability of
instant lotteries and slot machines is difficult to underestimate.
It is also worth considering that Fire Lotto tokens will grow in value as a result of
promotion activities. After the ICO is complete, and the first commission pay outs are
made, one Lotto token will be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges at a price of at least
USD 1.00.

5. How will the project be launched?
Unlike other ICOs, our ICO will follow the launch of the lottery rather than precede it.
The product was launched on January 01, 2018. Once we collect enough funds the
lottery will be launched with a minimum prize pool of USD 1 million. The lottery source
code is available on Github for inspection. The lottery is launched in the operating
mode, which means that users will be able to enjoy all its features, play, and win. The
moment the lottery is launched, transfers will be automatically made within the smart
contract to the wallet responsible for collecting sales commission and paying them to
token holders.
▪

The pre-ICO will open on January 15, 2018 and close on February 15, 2018.

▪

The ICO will open on March 15, 2018 and close on April 15, 2018.

This means that when the ICO opens, investors will be surprised to see not only a
finished product, but also a huge prize pool available to be won and sales commission
distribution among token holders in real-time mode. This ICO roadmap is going to be
implemented for the first time ever, and it will become a distinctive feature of this
project.
6. How do I get Fire Lotto tokens?
Fire Lotto tokens will be transferred to the investor’s account linked to his or her
personal profile after the transaction has been confirmed. After the ICO is finished,
the investor will be able to transfer the tokens from his or her personal profile to any
ERC20 compatible Ethereum wallet.

Page 12

7.

How are you going to pay out sales commission?

Since the launch of the lottery, 10% of the funds raised in ticket sales will be transferred
to the smart contract responsible for the distribution of sales commission. The first
distribution of collected sales commission among token holders will take place after
the ICO closes. Commission will be paid in ETH to all token holders with 2 days after
tokens distribution.
Afterwards, commission will be paid out after each lottery drawing.
8.

When will Fire Lotto tokens be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges?

Our tokens will be listed within one month of the end of the ICO period.
9.

How much money can I invest during the private and open round?

The amount of money is not limited. Tokens will be sold at a price of 0.35 USD per
token (on private round) and 0.38 USD per token (on public round). Funds will be
converted to ETH by the lottery organizers at a current exchange rate between ETH
and the currency that the participant uses for making payments.
10. What happens if all tokens are not sold out?
We will freeze the unsold amount for one year. Afterwards, they will be available for
investors to buy.

12. How much will your tokens cost in the future?
Token prices are influenced by many different factors, including political and economic
ones. We can compare our product with TrueFlip, an online lottery that is already
operating. If you look at the diagram below, you will see that the average price of the
TFL coin (True Flip lottery) is about USD 1.00 (USD 1.05 as of October 20, 2017), (USD
3.29 as of January 07, 2018).

Page 15

We believe that the price of the Lotto token will exceed USD 1.00.
13. What will your marketing campaign include apart from the bounty program?
Will you offer any forms of collaboration?
There are several things that we will do to promote Fire Lotto.
13.1. A referral campaign. The code of the interface accessible to users is open
source and open access. Anyone can place a link to Fire Lotto on their webpage or
integrate the lottery interface into their website. In this case, up to 15% of the funds
raised in ticket sales will be automatically transferred to the referral partner’s
Ethereum wallet. We have already made settlements with a number of large gambling
companies and payment providers, and work on integrating our platform into their
resources is underway. As a result, our referral partners will be able to increase the
number of entertainment products offered to their customers without creating new
software and to gain good income due to the growth of Ethereum. As for the Fire
Lotto platform itself, the benefits that it will enjoy from this collaboration are
obvious. The structure of expenditure on advertising will be fully transparent. The
target audience will be attracted by the marketing specialists working for the referral
partner. There will be no need to employ a lot of staff. The advertising budget will be
managed in an effective way.

Page 16

13.2. An email marketing campaign which will cover more than 10 million target
customers worldwide.
13.3. The advertising campaign for the Fire Lotto ICO will include the promotion of
the lottery itself.
13.4. The lottery platform will be advertised at international gambling exhibitions.
The ICE Gaming Show and the London Affiliate Conference, which will be held in
London in February 2018, are the first exhibitions that our team will attend.
13.5. Some of the funds raised in ticket sales will be spent on placing banners and
articles on various websites.
14. How can I be sure that the information about winnings and the number of
tickets sold is correct? Is there any tool that can be used to check this
information?
There is a Statistics tab in the lottery menu. This tab contains information about the
number of tickets sold, numbers drawn, jackpots and winners’ wallets (showing how
many numbers were matched and what the payouts were). This information can be
verified through Etherscan and the program code shared on GitHub.
15. Where will the jackpot be stored and how will funds be transferred there?
The jackpot for each lottery will be stored in a corresponding smart contract. Funds
have already been transferred to the smart contracts, and anybody can win a jackpot
now. After we carry out all the necessary tests, we will transfer more funds to the
smart contracts. Funds can be transferred there at any time. Also, each lottery ticket
sold will make our jackpots grow. The lottery is already in the operating mode.
16. Have you had / are you going to have your smart contract checked by an
independent auditor?
No, we have not had it audited as there is no need for it. Subscribers of our Russian
and English Telegram groups, who know a lot about the technology, have checked our
code many times and confirmed that there are not any flaws. Anybody can go and
check it themselves. If our users find any flaws in the future, they will let us know.
Platform performance is monitored by the Internet community itself, which is a more
transparent way than having to trust an auditor. There are too many questions that
can be raised if an auditor is invited.Where was this auditor certified? How do we
Page 17

know that this person is impartial? How often does the auditor recheck the code? Why
was this auditing company chosen? Moreover, the fact that we are planning to obtain
gaming licenses means that our software will be certified.
17. If your ICO is successful, will you expand the platform (for example, adding
new lotteries)?
Yes, we are planning to launch Bingo 37 and Keno, two very popular lottery types
after the ICO is completed. If any other new lotteries appear on the market and start
gaining in popularity, we can easily add them to the platform. This is what makes our
product unique.
18. Do you have different development scenarios depending on the amount of
funds raised?
Funds raised in ticket sales will be allocated to the main and reserve prize pools. The
bigger the prize pool, the more interesting it is to play the lottery. We aim to allocate
at least 30% of the funds raised to the prize pools.
- 20% of the funds will be spent on software development and maintenance.
- 15% of the funds will be spent on legalizing the product and obtaining licenses and
permits (for example, Isle of Man, Gibraltar, Curaçao gaming licenses) in order to be
able to operate globally. We also need to obtain several licenses enabling us to
conduct currency exchange operations (fiat to crypto) and give our users the
opportunity to make deposits to and withdraw funds from their cryplocurrency wallets
as well as play the lottery using fiat money.
- 5% of the funds will be spent on having our tokens listed on no fewer than three
different exchanges.
- 30% of the funds will be spent on marketing and promoting the ICO and the product
itself.
19. Do you have a soft cap / hard cap?
Yes. Soft cap: USD 2,000,000 (7,000,000 FLOT tokens). Hard cap: USD 15,000,000. In
case if soft cap will not be reached all investment payments will be returned to
investors wallets.

Page 18

20. When the first jackpot is paid out, there will be no money left in the prize
pool. How are you going to make payments after that? Will you have to suspend
the operation of the platform?
Each lottery has its own jackpot. The chances of paying all of them out at the same
time are extremely small. The probability of winning a 6/45 lottery jackpot is 1 to
8.15 million. If somebody wins a jackpot, the new one will be formed using funds from
the reserve prize pool. The system is arranged in such a way that funds collected in
each drawing are used only in the next drawing. This means that the system
replenishes itself, has a reserve source of funding and will hardly ever have to face
lack of funds. Also, as it has already been said, each jackpot has its own
cryptocurrency wallet which our team can replenish with extra funds if needed.
21. What do you think are the main risks to the project?
21.1. A situation in which the global community stops using cryptocurrencies or they
become banned and criminalized in most developed countries.
21.2. The use of Ethereum, the main means of payment at the moment, as an
investment tool similar to the way Bitcoin is now being used. The cost of transactions
will become very high and people will prefer to keep their ETH on cold wallets,
hoping the currency will start growing in the future. If this happens, we will have to
switch to an alternative cryptocurrency with a commensurate level of security,
accessibility, and speed of operation. However, it will take some time.
21.3. We believe that the blockchain technology can solve current problems in the
lottery industry like no other tool. Its implementation will bring the lottery industry
to a new level of development, making it as transparent and accessible as possible.
22. Will you use KYC in the sales process?
Yes. In the near future, we plan to launch a tool that will make it possible to accept
non-cash payments using traditional currency. This way of purchasing FLOT tokens
requires that we use KYC.
23. How do you plan to minimize regulatory risks, especially those related to the
Howey Test?
The main difference between the security token and the utility token is that the first
one enables its holder to get profit without doing anything. A person can simply buy a
token and get dividends. Having analyzed the current international legislation, we

Page 19

adopted a set of measures aimed at making it clear that our tokens should not be
classified as security tokens:
- Holders of our tokens will get commissions from sales rather than dividends. This
system will be in essence the same as the system of referral payments discussed
earlier.
- In order to receive commissions, each token holder has to play the lottery. In other
words, each token holder will have to buy a certain number of lottery tickets every
month in order to be able to receive commissions from sales. The number of tickets
and the frequency of purchases are being calculated at the moment and will be
announced later. Given that one lottery ticket costs only 2 U.S. dollars, token holders
will not have to spend a lot of money on buying lottery tickets, and at the same time
this measure will help us solve legal issues and stimulate the lottery.
-Together with lawyers and advisors from New York, we are discussing the option of
inviting a professional investor to our team. This will enable us to attract funds from
U.S. citizens to our ICO in accordance with the rules and requirements established by
the SEC and U.S. government.

RNG ALGORITHM
Step 1: During a drawing, the 1st is taken after the time current publicly hash code of
a bitcoin block is taken from blockchain.info. For example:
000000000000000000229a9deacb0ed81b54afb92581e9b5b2e25dbd3a8069a2
Step 2: An array of all the numbers that can be drawn is built. For example, an array
for the 6/45 lottery will consist of 45 elements from 1 to 45 inclusive.
Step 3: The last n * 4 bytes are taken from the bitcoin hash, where n is the number of
balls drawn. For example, n * 4 = 24 for the 6/45 lottery.
Step 4: The number obtained from every four bytes goes through the modulo operation
and is divided by the remaining number of elements in the array of all available
numbers. The remainder serves as an index of the number that has been drawn from
the array of all available numbers. The number that has been drawn is transferred to a
separate array of numbers drawn and is deleted from the array of all available numbers.
Step 5: This iteration is repeated n times in order to get all n numbers drawn.

An optimized code for a smart contract is shown below.
function getWinNumbers(string randomStr, uint numberCount, uint
numberCountMax) constant public returns (bytes){
bytes32 random = keccak256(randomStr);
bytes memory allNumbers = new bytes(numbersCountMax);
bytes memory winNumbers = new bytes(numbersCount);
for (uint i = 0; i < numbersCountMax; i++) {
allNumbers[i] = byte(i + 1);
}
for (i = 0; i < numbersCount; i++) {
uint n = numbersCountMax - i;
uint r = (uint (random[i * 4]) + (uint (random[i * 4 + 1]) << 8) + (uint
(random[i * 4 + 2]) << 16) + (uint (random[i * 4 + 3]) << 24)) % n;
winNumbers[i] = allNumbers[r];
allNumbers[r] = allNumbers[n - 1];
}
return winNumbers;
}

LEGAL ASPECTS
In purposes of raising trust in our lottery, increasing a number of players and a
possibility to raise fiat funds we had several successful consultations with the Isle of
Man Gambling Supervision Commission. As a result, we received an affirmative
statement about a possibility of getting the Online Gambling Regulation Act license for
creating and holding internet gambling, including crypto lotteries with the right of
acceptance of crypto funds and their free converting to traditional worlds currencies.
The fact of this license opens the following possibilities:
▪

legal transparency of our business;

▪

fiat funds acceptance from investors to our company account;

▪

usage of the traditional payment services to sell the Fire Lotto lottery tickets
(VISA, MasterCard, Qiwi, PayPal, WebMoney and etc.)

▪

increasing numbers of Fire Lotto players in the world.

Period of licensing is approximately 4-6 months.
