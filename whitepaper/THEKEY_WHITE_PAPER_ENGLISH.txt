EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As more and more services and socializing shift from the real world to
the online world, identifying each other digitally has become a
prominent theme.

Development of Identity Verification (“IDV”)

Technology is one of the most significant trends, which will have a critical
impact on the digital economy. However, none of the existing online IDV
technologies

addresses

two

fundamental

requirements:

results

generated from online IDV should be undeniable and unalterable.
THEKEY Project is now developing a second-generation IDV solution for
the internet via BDMI technology. BDMI stands for “Blockchain based
Dynamic Multi-Dimension Identification” technology. Such a solution
perfectly echoes the main requirements for identifying each other in the
digital world, which is ‘The Key’ for migrating people from the real
world to the online world.

BDMI, as the name of it, synergistically

combines Dynamic Multi-Dimension Identification (“DMI”) technology
and blockchain technology. DMI has already passed its development
stage and is currently applied to THEKEY’s existing first-generation IDV
solutions, which has built a very solid ground work to guarantee the
successful development of BDMI,

THEKEY’s first-generation IDV solution is currently in use for
mobile social insurance pay in two pilot cities, which people can
receive their payment for their pension, or healthcare insurance
reimbursement. The IDV solution is currently being deployed in
another 41 cities, covering more than 130 million people.

authenticated by the relevant government authorities, are
connected on a real-time basis. This constitutes a solid foundation
of IDV.
•

Commercial contracts signed with world-leading firms and the
business model of our IDV products in this White Paper have
already been partly proven.

•

Six relevant national laboratories have been set up together with
government agencies, banks, insurance companies and one
university.

Along with the development of a second-generation IDV solution,
facilitated by token sales, THEKEY Project team will also develop THEKEY
Ecosystem for providing IDV services (the "Ecosystem"). THEKEY
Ecosystem will consist of three components of participants (Validator,
Service Provider and Individual User), Smart Contracts and TKY Tokens
(THEKEY Token). The objectives of setting up THEKEY Ecosystem are, 1) to
develop a healthy environment where Personal Identity Information
(“PII”) can be properly used and protected, and 2) to provide a
financial incentive to the participants in the Ecosystem.
THEKEY generates IDV results by crosschecking multi-dimensionally with
the latest PII, behavior data and scene data. Consider an example case
for IDV process in THEKEY Ecosystem. In THEKEY Ecosystem, when an
individual user living in Beijing needs to be identified, such as for the
purchase of medical insurance in Singapore, the insurance company will
trigger a request for IDV service and start a 8-step-journey as follows:
•

The insurance company, as the service provider, triggers an IDV
request including certain medical histories of the given individual
user.

•

The user accepts the IDV request by using his or her fingerprint
through THEKEY APP or the equipment of the insurance company,
and also signs off the relevant Smart Contract between the

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

insurance company, THEKEY and the user.
•

THEKEY will review the IDV data request sent by the service
provider against the KYC (Know Your Customer) policy of the
relevant industry to justify if the data request is reasonable.

•

THEKEY will make comparisons between fingerprint data sent and
the relevant data validated by the government, and then cross
check the latest PII data, behavior data as well as scene data of the
given user. These are all automatically settled through encrypted
interfaces.

•

Once THEKEY is satisfied with the validity of user’s ID, IDV will
continue. Relevant PII like medical history data will be collected
as defined by the Smart Contract. THEKEY will stamp its approval
on Blockchain as verification of the result so that the medical
insurance company can use it.

•

The Smart Contract will be settled by TKY Tokens.

•

At the same time, all previous calculations will be documented for
future data audit.

•

The credit of the user and the medical insurance company will be
regularly evaluated and calculated through the above-mentioned
data audit.

The IDV result generated from the above is efficient, accurate and
reliable. It could also be tailor-made for any specific ID requirement
from the Service Provider subject to relevant applicable KYC laws and
regulations.

This process will significantly reduce the cost of the

insurance company and therefore further reduce the premium to be paid
by the user.
Compared to other peers in IDV industry, who are also applying IDV into
blockchain, BDMI has the following three advantages:
•

More reliable results – The supporting data is gathered in real time,

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

is comprehensive, accurate and reliable. The data is also validated
in advance by government agencies or other public institutions.
•

Lower cost - Full use of existing data sources. Avoidance of
duplicate work for data collection, processing and authentication,

•

Better user experience – It is not necessary for individual users to
install any application or upload any information.

We now invite you to hold THEKEY with us.

BACKGROUND
Identity Verification (“IDV”) is a day-to-day demand for a growing
number of institutions and individuals. Just think about when you open a
bank account, take flights and go abroad, go to hospital and claim social
medical insurance, do shopping by using credit cards, even open the
door of your own home with a key, the request for proving that you are
‘you’ is raised everywhere and every moment in the real world.
With services and socializing shifted from the real world to the online
world, IDV is becoming increasingly prominent. As the internet is a more
anonymous space, people are able to hide their real identities on specific
websites. One specialty for IDV on the internet is that there is no stable
connection between the individual end user and the identity data stored
or uploaded on the internet for verification. A good example is credit
card fraud. The credit card user is not necessary the credit card holder
himself or herself, simply inputting the required information on the
credit card would enable the payment to proceed online. Although
nowadays, banks may provide a double confirmation mechanism such as
sending a random code to a registered mobile phone. However, what if
the mobile phone has been stolen at the same time? More importantly,
just like IDV in the real world, IDV on digital world is not only a matter of
digital security for privacy protection, but also heavily involved in the

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

discussions around financial, political, moral, legal responsibility, and
sometimes, even social stability and national security. The result of IDV
service, therefore, must be undeniable and unalterable in many cases.
The abovementioned example illustrates the features for solid IDV
solution on internet should include that
•

The supporting data should be accurate and reliable. The
identification data used for IDV service should be the data
authenticated by the relevant government authorities, not the
data uploaded by a user himself or herself. To use data uploaded
by users will give room for fraud and deceit.

•

The data needs to be crosschecked with other data of the same
user, but from different sources to ensure solidity of IDV on the
internet.

•

The data acquired is comprehensive, and serve various IDV
purposes.

•

The data is updated in real time to capture any changes.

•

The data is standardized and easy for digital processing;

•

The data is well protected, with its safety guaranteed. This is not
only for privacy protection but also for social stability. In some
cases, it needs to address national security issues as the regulator
expects.

Failure to meet these requirements might cause substantial loss,
especially in the areas indicated below:
•

Asset loss in peer-to-peer value transaction, like credit card fraud.

•

Legal

and

reputational

implication,

such

as

inappropriate

statement published online by an impostor who dishonestly uses
someone else’s name.

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

•

Disclosure or theft of personal data.

•

Disclosure of national confidential information. The data’s safety
is not only related to privacy protection, but also about national
security. Some statics based on sensitive individual data, such as
the data carrying medical and health information, are classified as
national confidential information. To avoid any misuse or causing
social instability, access to such information requires government
authority approval in advance in many countries.

The existing IDV technologies, which have been developed and applied
on the internet, can meet parts of the requirements. However, none can
address all the issues listed above and the current IDV result could be
denied and altered.

THEKEY PROJECT
WHAT is THEKEY Project
THEKEY Project, a world-leading solution provider in IDV industry, is here
to leverage innovations in Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies
to develop its second-generation IDV solution to address all the
above-mentioned issues in the internet world.
THEKEY smart contract system will use NEO smart contract, and develop
under DNA framework. THEKEY will co-establish a smart economy which
consists of digital asset, digital identity and smart contract together with
NEO. Focusing on identity verification, THEKEY will be the fundamental
element of the whole system. The compatibility of NEO towards
multi-programming language and the lightweight, high concurrency and
expansibility

of

NEOVM

will

facilitate

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

The second-generation IDV solution will be realized by BDMI technology.
BDMI

stands

for

“Blockchain

based

Dynamic

Multi-Dimension

Identification” technology, which aims to set up a powerful and
cost-efficient identity verification tool for the internet. The ultimate
objective of BDMI is to generate undeniable and unalterable IDV results.
BDMI embraces the six elements below simultaneously to deliver the
perfect solution for IDV:
•

Unique biometric data serves as the base of BDMI.

•

The key data of BDMI used for IDV, including biometric data, are all
validated in advance by the relevant government authorities.

•

The data of BDMI used for IDV are comprehensive enough so that
it can meet the different requirements of various clients.

•

To ensure the reliability of BDMI, cross-checking is always carried
out during IDV, between the government validated ID data and
behavior data and scene data of the same user.

•

To ensure solidity of BDMI, BDMI always uses updated data when
an IDV is executed, to capture the latest changes, if any.

•

Once an IDV is completed, the result will be properly documented
for audit so that personal credit of the user can be evaluated and
calculated.

HOW THEKEY Project Works
BDMI is a combination of two technologies, i.e. DMI and Blockchain.
DMI
Instead of setting up a centralized database for IDV solution THEKEY
deploys its DMI System within the Information Centers of provincial or

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

municipal governments. The biggest advantage of such deployment is
avoidance of duplicate work for data collection, processing and
authentication.
DMI system deployed in different cities focus on processing the
centralized acquired data and mainly includes five modules as indicated
hereunder:
•

Data Collection Module. It is based on ETL technology, which
enables data extracted from different data resources, transformed
to a uniformed format and upload to a central site. IDV based on
the existed data can avoid the reduplicative cost on data collection,
data processing, analysis and data verification.

•

Data Standardization Module. Once the data is collected, it needs
to be standardized before it can be properly used. In data
standardization module, two sub-modules are important, as
indicated below,
1) Communication Protocol Standardization module. This module
carries out an interactive transmission of the information among
different data systems. When there is an information exchange
between different systems, the module will fulfill the information
visit and exchange by standardized communication protocol. The
flow chart below illustrates how this module works.

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

2) Term Standardization module. Each industry has its own
terminologies. Even the same term used in different area may refer
to different thing. This module relies on three pillars: ontology,
NLP (Natural Language Processing) and AI (Artificial Interference),
to solve this problem and build up the foundation for data
application in diversified scenarios to serve various purposes. The
chart below shows how terminology is standardized under this
module.

•

Primary User Index Module. This module is to build up a search

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

dictionary, which can be used to easily find all the relevant files of
every individual. All PII of a given individual will be collected as per
his or her ID/ SSN and the module will organize the data as
time-based inveted file. In an inveted file, the data will be
structured as a tree, which contains a primary index, a secondary
index and child indexes. The module categorizes the collected and
processed data for IDV into different level of indexes as defined in
advance. When an IDV process is triggered, the input data will be
extracted and searched, if it matches the information in primary
index. If the information matches, it will continue to cross-check
the information in secondary index
•

Data Warehouse Solution Module. This module is to ensure all the
individual files are properly stored in the data warehouse so that
once an IDV process is trigged, the relevant files can be easily
found. The data warehouse solution will also embrace functions
like data input, revise, statistics and retrieval.

•

IDV engine. The main function of the IDV engine is to complete
the IDV service in forms of attestation based on the data exchange
platform, which embraces the four modules as described above.
When an IDV process is trigged, the biometric data sent by the
user will be verified by the IDV engine against the biometric data
of the same user but authenticated by data stored by government
authorities. The initial verification will be further crosschecked with
the latest behavior and scene data of the given user, received from
other validators. Once the IDV engine is satisfied with the validity
of the biometric data sent, the IDV process will continue. Relevant
PII and other metadata will be collected by the IDV engine as
requested, and the result of IDV service will be released in forms of
attestation. At the same time, the results of all previous
calculations from every step of IDV will be properly documented
by the engine for regular audit. Personal credit will be evaluated

and calculated through the previously mentioned audit.
As demonstrated above with DMI technology, the centrally collected
data could be well processed, transformed and easy to exchange among
different systems. Afterwards, the data will be encrypted with a hash
algorithm in Blockchain for decentralized application. Data ownership
verification, authorization, pricing and payment will all happen on
Blockchain.
+ Blockchain
Blockchain is a distributed ledger where the data is stored and recorded
by different nodes, which maintain the data and transaction activities.
Blockchain uses an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, ensuring the
data transmission and the safety in utilization, which is characterized by
several features e.g. immutability, irreversibility, security etc. In particular,
smart contracts are realized by programmable scripts, increasing the
practicability of Blockchain. With those features, the application dilemma
of identity verification technology is overcome. The following logical
structure map clearly shows how the DMI technology applies on
Blockchain to develop the new revolutionary IDV solution.

13／36

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

THEKEY Project team is working on combining DMI technology on
Blockchain so that the following could be delivered:
•

Individual user would have full control of their PII information and
KYC standard in each industry should be followed as part of Smart
Contract when initiating and processing IDV request;

•

All records of PII relevant data collection and use will be stored on
the Blockchain for auditing in the future, and to avoid any misuse;

•

To address the requirement of an IDV result being unaltered and
to avoid catastrophic breakdown, relevant data currently saved in
centralized servers of various organizations will be indexed with
identity data block correspondingly and stored in a distributed
way.

•

Due to the limit of storage size on Blockchain, an alternative
option is to save PII data in the ETL database of the Validator in
THEKEY Ecosystem, and save the hash value of the underlying data
on Blockchain.

= BDMI
The BDMI framework can be divided into three different layers - protocol,
interface and application as shown below.
The protocol layer is set up based on Blockchain, which is applicable for
BDMI technical selection, such as ETH, EOS, NEO etc. This layer sets the
safety level, data authority, concurrency and flow processing.
The interface layer provides identification data modeling by which the
protocol layer can be connected with applications, to realize data
standardization, anti-fraud modeling and smart contract trigger etc.
The application layer will realize the scenarios where identification can
be used, where interface and SDK (Software Development Kit) shall be
provided for the data exchange.

Existing IDV Solution
Before we continue with the second-generation IDV solution we are
working on, let us look back at our existing IDV solution. Our existing IDV
solution, developed by THEKEY Project team, is now being used in an
APP known as “Social Medical Insurance 123”, by which people can
make mobile social medical insurance payment.

The APP has a

connection between the individual users and hospitals. The user can
login the APP to instruct a payment for a prescription sent by a physician
when going to the hospital.

Unlike other smart payments in our daily

life which are made out of personal bank accounts (for example
shopping), social medical insurance payment is made out of a social
medical insurance account. More requirements need to be fulfilled
before a social medical insurance payment is made. Due to the nature
of social medical insurance, it is critical to identify if the payment
applicant is the same person as the beneficiary of the scheme. Our
existing IDV solution facilitates this process by an 8-step-journey as
indicated hereunder,
•

Registration. The user needs to upload his or her biometrics data
for registration on the APP. Such biometric data will be checked

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

against

relevant

data

validated

at

the

medical

insurance

administration agency. Meanwhile, it will be further crosschecked
with the data that has been validated and stored by other
organizations, such as telecommunication companies and banks.
After the dual-check work, the registration could be completed.
•

Once the user goes to hospital, s/he uses his or her finger print or
face to make the payment instruction through the registered APP
which triggers an IDV request.

•

In response to the user’s payment instruction the hospital will
send the prescription as the claim, via the registered APP of the
user, to medical insurance agency.

•

THEKEY will first make comparison between the biometric data
from the user and the biometric data authenticated and stored by
medical insurance administration agency.

•

Once THEKEY is satisfied with the consistency on the first
checkpoint as described above, THEKEY will further crosscheck
with the latest information collected from other institutions, like
public

security

agencies,

telecommunication

and

internet

companies, among many others. This is to assess 1) if the user is
still alive, and 2) if s/he still enjoys the entitlement of medical
insurance.
•

Once the user has been proven to be eligible for medical insurance，
THEKEY will then collect all other relevant information for
authenticity, eligibility, compliance and rationality checks against
the claim submitted. Once the medical insurance administration is
satisfied with those checks, the payment will be approved.

•

The results of the above calculation will all be properly
documented after the transaction is completed for regular audit.

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

•

In the audit, credit of both user and hospital will be evaluated,
calculated and documented, as per the anti-fraud, abuse and
waste policies of the medical insurance administration agency.
Criteria

from

other

industry

like

financial

industry,

telecommunication, fintech companies are also used, on pilot
basis, for personal credit evaluation.
Two remarkable features in our existing IDV solution compared to others
are:
•

The data used for validation is not acquired by the individual user.
Instead, the consistency leading towards IDV results is between
the data uploaded by individual user and the data which has been
validated from government or public authorities. The biggest
advantage of this structure is to avoid “contamination of data
source right from the starting point of IDV” since acquiring
identity-related data from a user and then using it as the reference
will provide room for fraud and deceit.

•

What the App provides is a channel bridging the information
submitted by the user and the user’s own identity record stored
in government or public institutions. We do not need users to
store their Personal Identifiable Information (“PII”) on the App.
Therefore, hackers are unable to access to users’ information by
invading any newly developed platforms.

We have so far already achieved the following with our existing IDV
solution, which constitutes a solid foundation for BDMI,
•

23 copyrights have been obtained, 15 patents have been accepted
by SIPO (State Intellectual Property office of the P.R.C) and start
attestation process.

•

The previously mentioned App is used in two pilot cities, with
which people can make payment directly from their social medical

insurance account. The IDV solution is now being deployed in
another 41 cities, covering more than 130 million people.
•

Personal identity data, authenticated by relevant government
authorities of 210 million people in 66 cities, are connected on
real-time basis, which constitutes a solid foundation of IDV.

•

Commercial contracts signed with the reputable firms worldwide,
and the business model of our IDV products has been proven.

•

Six relevant national laboratories have been set up together with
government agencies, banks, insurance companies and one
university.

The existing IDV solution of THEKEY project team has demonstrated the
feasibility in technology realization and massive commercial value.
Although we have already made substantial progress in IDV industry, our
existing IDV solution is only applicable in a centralized community at
present. Hence, as mentioned above, we are planning to improve our
IDV solution by introducing Blockchain technology. Blockchain offers a
compelling solution to the problem of combining accessibility with
privacy and security. Records can be held securely, using end-to-end
encryption,

and

yet

openly

referenced

and

documented

in

a

decentralized autonomy community. This solves the problem of dealing
with highly sensitive or classified information in a way that still enforces
all the privacy and confidentiality rights that consumers and regulators
expect. Moreover, Blockchain technology will also help us to establish an
ecosystem, through smart contract and digital currency, so that all
participants are financially motivated. With Blockchain technology, we
expect our planned IDV product can serve users better. People will no
longer need ID card, passport, keys, credit card, even mobile phone for
making payments, opening bank accounts, applying for loans, receiving
pensions, and paying medical bills.

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

Comparing with other peers in IDV industry who are also applying IDV
into Blockchain, our second-generation IDV solution has the following
relative advantages:
•

More reliable results – The supporting data is gathered in real time,
is comprehensive, accurate and reliable. The data is also validated
in advance by government agencies or other public institutions.

•

Lower cost - Full use of existing data sources. Avoidance of
duplicate work for data collection, processing and authentication,

•

Better user experience – It is not necessary for individual users to
install any application or upload any information.

THEKEY ECOSYSTEM AND TKY TOKEN
Along with the development of second-generation IDV solution,
facilitated by token sales, THEKEY Project team intends to develop
THEKEY Ecosystem for providing IDV service (the "Ecosystem"). The
THEKEY Ecosystem will be a decentralized autonomy community, which
will consist of three components of participants, (Validator, Service
Provider and Individual User) Smart Contracts and TKY Tokens. The
objectives of setting up THEKEY Ecosystem are, 1) to develop a healthy
environment where PII can be properly used and protected, 2) to provide
financial incentive to the participants in the Ecosystem.

THEKEY Ecosystem
Ecosystem Participants
There are three parties in THEKEY Ecosystem: (1) Validators who process
the IDV request and generate the IDV result, (2) Service Providers who
initiate IDV request and (3) Individual Users who are the customer of the

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

service provider and need to give consent to validators to process the
IDV request.
Ecosystem.

Among others, the Validators are the backbone in the
The Validators may include THEKEY, government entities,

financial institutions and utility companies among many others. Since
THEKEY is already an IDV service provider trusted by the parties
concerned, it is easier to obtain data needed for IDV service from other
sources, including highly sensitive data from government agencies as
well as the data like medical records from hospitals. It is, therefore, an
important node or an important validator in a decentralized IDV
ecosystem. It is however not the only node or Validator in the Ecosystem.
Once Validators receive an IDV request against a User from Service
Providers, together with consent of the same user in forms of Smart
Contracts, they will process the IDV request and generate result. After
that, they are able to 'stamp' their approval on the Blockchain.
Smart Contract
Smart Contracts will play an important role in THEKEY Ecosystem. Before
an IDV service is provided, various Smart Contracts need to be signed off
by all parties concerned, including Validators, Individual Users and
Service Providers who are seeking IDV service against the same user.
Smart contracts will have “built-in” government rules, regulations as
well as KYC (Know Your Customer) policies of different industries. The
built-in policies of governments and industries will not only make a
healthier Ecosystem but also save customer time for confirming what PII
can be used every time when IDV service is needed.
Smart contracts are also enable the transactions among the Validators,
Users and Service Providers.

With Individual User’s consent,

Validators will provide with IDV service to the Service Provider who
makes such request. Service Provider, subject to applicable KYC policies,
can choose among the Validators for what hierarchy of PII and data
source it requires to serve its specific IDV purpose.

providing tailor-made IDV service will be adjusted by the Validators.
Such transaction will conclude in smart contract among the Individual
Users, Validators and Service Providers.
TKY Token
THEKEY token (“TKY Token”), another major component of the
Ecosystem, is the only method to settle smart contracts signed between
the participants in THEKEY Ecosystem. Once the Validator, Service
Provider and the Individual User all sign-off on the transaction via the
smart contract, the concerned parties will use TKY Tokens to settle the
contract according to the agreed price and payment sharing plan. TKY
Tokens would not only be obtained by purchasing in token sale events,
but will also be able to be earned. Individual Users, Service Providers
and Validators could perform valuable actions in THEKEY Ecosystem to
earn TKY Tokens.

For example, when government authorities, hospitals

and other Service Providers or Validators provide with valuable data in
the Ecosystem subject to Individual User consent, TKY Tokens could be
gained and shared among the data providers and Individual Users. In
addition, the credit obtained by current users who are using our first
generation IDV product could convert their credits to TKY Tokens and
spend in THEKEY Ecosystem.
TKY Tokens will be frequently used in THEKEY Ecosystem.

Other Validators will also

make their identity-related products and services available through the
Ecosystem. Moreover, THEKEY will also use TKY Tokens for paying to
other Validators or data providers when collecting data to enhance the

overall accuracy, comprehensively and completeness of PII for IDV
processing.

Compared to other existing tokens or even fiat currencies, the
unreplaceable function of the dedicated token, Key Tokens, in Key
Ecosystem includes that
•

It can be used for cross-border payment easily;

•

It can be used for the smart contracts generated in Key Ecosystem;

•

It is fractionally divisible.

A certain portion of TKY Tokens will become liquid during the token sale
to help promote THEKEY Ecosystem. Like other cryptocurrencies, units
of TKY Tokens are fungible and transferable. The ledger will provide a
secure mechanism for owners to transfer TKY Tokens to other
participants and TKY Tokens are expected to trade on cryptocurrency
exchanges in near future.

With the development and expansion of

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

THEKEY Ecosystem, as more and more participants in THEKEY Ecosystem
are using TKY Tokens for IDV service, the core value of TKY Tokens could
be realized.

How THEKEY Ecosystem works
The main features for IDV service process in THEKEY Ecosystem are
below:
•

Individual users are always in full control his or her PII.

An

individual user will use biometric data, such as fingerprints or face
through THEKEY App or device installed at the service providers,
to confirm his or her consent for validators to process the IDV
request which is sent by the Service Provider. No process will be
continued unless the individual user makes such confirmation.
•

Specific requirements on PII data in the IDV request will be
reviewed against the KYC standard policy of different industry
before processing IDV requests.

Aside from the confirmation

from individual users, validators will also check the eligibility of the
IDV request. For example, an IDV request sent out by a hotel
containing the information on individual users certain medical
history might be rejected, as it is not compliant with hotel KYC
industry standards. However, the same request from a medical
insurance company may be considered and accepted.
•

Individual user does not need to upload his or her PII. Validators
will collect requested data accordingly after ratification of the first
two items above.

•

Not one, but three sets of data of PII will be used during the
process of IDV conducted by THEKEY via BDMIs technology. IDV
service of THEKEY is a result of real-time cross-checking, between
identity data, behavior data as well as scene data of a given user.
Identity data are from government authorities, behavior data are

usually from financial institutions and utility companies among
many others, whilst scene data are normally from service providers
who are seeking for IDV service. For example, an IDV result as per
a request from a hotel in Hong Kong at 9:00 am is positive, one
hour later, the IDV result based on a request from another hotel
based in the United States against by the same user might be
negative, as there is some conflict in the Scene data for the given
user. It is difficult to obtain all the data required from various
data sources, and get them ready in advance at one point for a
particular IDV service. It is equally difficult to provide such IDV
service via a centralized service system. It is now possible, however,
through Blockchain technology, to use those highly sensitive data
for an IDV service widely and openly, while PII of users are well
protected. Every data source/validator in a decentralized IDV
environment is a node of the chain.
Consider an example case for IDV process in THEKEY Ecosystem. When
an individual user who is living in Beijing needs to be identified, such as
for the purchasing of medical insurance in Singapore, the insurance
company will trigger a request for IDV service and start a 8-step-journey
as follows,
•

The insurance company, as the service provider triggers off an IDV
request including certain medical-use history of the given
individual user;

•

The user accepts the IDV request by using his or her fingerprint
through THEKEY APP or the equipment of the insurance company,
and also signs off the relevant Smart Contract between the
insurance company, THEKEY and the user.

•

THEKEY will review the IDV data request sent by the service
provider against the KYC policy of the relevant industry to justify if
the requested data is reasonable.

•

THEKEY will make comparisons between fingerprint data sent and
the relevant data validated by the government, and then cross
check the latest ID data, behavior data as well as Scene data of the
given user.

These are all automatically settled through encrypted

interfaces.
•

Once THEKEY is satisfied with the validity of user’s ID, IDV will
continue.

Relevant PII and other metadata will be collected as

defined by the Smart Contract. THEKEY will stamp its approval on
Blockchain as the verification result so that the medical insurance
company can use it.
•

The Smart Contract will be settled by TKY Tokens.

•

At the same time, all previous calculations will be documented for
future data audit.

•

The credit of the user and the medical insurance company will be
regularly evaluated and calculated through the above-mentioned
data audit.

Such IDV process above would significantly reduce the cost but enhance
the accuracy and reliability for the medical insurance company, which will
help reduce insurance premiums.

FUTURE WORLD WITH THEKEY
In light of the rise in e-commerce and increasingly digital lives, the need
of IDV service has spilled quickly over every sector. THEKEY Ecosystem is
a perfect platform using BDMI technology built on a distributed model
with multi-parties attestation and fueled by TKY Token. It serves as the
fundamental layers to other ecosystems, either on-chain or off-chain.
The individual end users do not need to make any effort to prove who
they are, such as credit card, keys or mobile phones for IDV purpose, but
by simply connecting into THEKEY Ecosystem. Considering the huge

THEKEY WHITE PAPER

number of mainstream users and the rise of IDV service requirements,
we do believe THEKEY Ecosystem is very promising and expandable.
Here are some example uses below.

Convenient life
When you open the door, face recognition and fingerprint digitals on the
door handle will scan the user to confirm the identity, and compare it
with the latest behaviors maintained on Blockchain, by which it will
justify the rationality of the time and place you are now granting access.
Exit and entry through customs is complicated. However, with THEKEY
Ecosystem, things get easier via face recognition and fingerprint
verification, backstage information, blacklist from public security office,
visa record, flight information and hotel information, will ensure effective
clearance by the customs.

Automatic Diagnosis and Treatment of Diseases
The intelligent device on your body will detect the detailed data about
your body when you feel feverish. Moreover, it can also tell where you
are sick; MTS1 will diagnose your disease and recommend the most
suitable medicine or diagnosis and treatment scheme according to your
health record. It can even recommend the nearest and best doctor to you.
The mixed payment from social security funds, self-paying and pooling
funds will be completed in one action. Besides, the Blockchain IoT
technology will help you get the cheapest medicine as fast as possible,
which can be traced back to the source.

Accurate Recommendation
In the case that you want to purchase life or medical insurance, you can
choose to join a mutual insurance organization, or choose a large

insurance company. You can give certain access permissions to the
insurance organization, which it will base an appropriate insurance
package for you. The insuring, underwriting and claim settlement are all
based on your electric identity on THEKEY Ecosystem, and controlled by
smart contracts. Moreover, you can sell your own personal data to
insurance companies for actuarial purposes, which can decrease the
insurance premium you need to pay. This is also realized via smart
contracts in the THEKEY Ecosystem.
Every aspect of life is in need of IDV based on BDMI technology i.e.
security check, access permission, medical treatment and shopping, etc.
The existence of THEKEY Ecosystem will make the internet and the real
identity integrated together to facilitate your life.
