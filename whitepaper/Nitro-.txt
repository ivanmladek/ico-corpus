Risk Factors
In considering participation in this crowdsale of NOX Tokens, a prospective purchaser should
be aware of certain risk factors. This section sets out several of such risk factors (“Risk
Factors”). It should be noted that such Risk Factors do not purport to be comprehensive or
exhaustive, and prospective purchasers of the NOX Tokens should consider seeking
independent professional advice prior to participating in the crowd-sale.
Nature of NOX Token
The NOX Token is not a traditional security, such as a share or debenture. Purchasers of NOX
Tokens do not acquire any equity or security interest, in, or a debt owed by a corporate entity,
and do not enjoy the rights normally associated with such securities. Nonetheless, as
purchasers may be able to share in the revenues derived from the Nitro Marketplace, and be
able to vote on funding proposals, the NOX Tokens may be regarded as securities for the
purposes of securities laws in certain jurisdictions.
Liquidity and Tax Risk
Payment for the NOX Tokens will be made through ETH, and revenues shared will also be in
the form of ETH or additional NOX Tokens. Both ETH and NOX Tokens may not be freely
convertible into fiat currency and may be subject to fluctuations in value. The value of the
NOX Tokens may decline substantially after purchase. Purchasers of the NOX Tokens may not
be able to sell or otherwise dispose of their NOX Tokens. Purchasers of the NOX Tokens who
share in the revenues of the Nitro Marketplace or Nitro platform may be subject to tax in the
jurisdiction in which they are domiciled or residing.
Legal Risk
Residents of certain jurisdictions may not be permitted to participate in the sale and purchase
of crypto-currencies or digital tokens, and such participation may be illegal in such
jurisdictions. New or revised legislation, regulations, guidelines and directives may be
introduced in the jurisdiction of the purchasers of the NOX Tokens or which may affect the
Nitro Marketplace or other platforms in which the NOX Tokens are used.
Regulatory Risk
It is possible that regulators from the jurisdictions in which a purchaser of NOX Tokens resides
may, after the sale and purchase of the NOX Tokens, conduct investigations and take
regulatory action in respect of such sale and purchase, or prohibit the secondary sale and
purchase of the NOX Tokens. As noted under “Nature of NOX Token”, the NOX Tokens may
be classified as a security subject to securities laws, and be regulated accordingly.
Key Personnel Risk
The success of the NOX Tokens is dependent on the continued service and performance of
several key personal, referred to as the Nitro Team in this document, driving the Nitro
Marketplace or related Nitro projects.

Executive Summary
The video-games industry is booming. The industry generated over US$100 billion in
revenue in 2016, with experts predicting a growth of 30% over the next 5 years,
showing tremendous potential in this sector.
However, the structural problems currently present in the video-games industry
impose limits to the video-games community over the course of this growth. One
pertinent issue is the presence of an imperfect economy within the video-games
industry - a market that is currently controlled by oligopolistic large corporate actors.
Another issue is the presence of imperfect information between these actors, which
inevitably prevent the most socially beneficial outcomes from taking place within the
sector. The lack of access to funding for new Promising Game Studios also poses a
significant problem to this industry as well.
Enter Nitro; an independent, blockchain-based online collaboration platform, which
seeks to allow participation in the video-games economy, to connect various
stakeholders, and to achieve growth for the overall Nitro network.
Using a new blockchain cryptocurrency called NOX, this economic platform will bridge
the problems currently plaguing the various actors in the video-games industry, and
through the process, bring about massive benefits to the global video-games
community. Most importantly, we seek to democratise the economy of the videogames industry, creating a holistic community by bringing all the stakeholders onto an
integrated platform.
By purchasing NOX, NOX holders will be able to participate in the economy of the
video-games industry. Nitro will fund games voted in by NOX holders on the platform.
Promising Game Studios will have access to much needed funding and will be able to
connect with gamers earlier on in the development cycle. This will greatly improve the
quality and variety of games produced. On the side of the gamers, they will be able to
use the token as in-game currency to purchase games or in-game items. Gamers may
also be eligible for incentives, in the form of NOX tokens given out by game studios,
for performing actions such as trying out new games, participating in game
tournaments etc. We believe gamers are well positioned to be among the most prolific
early adopters of cryptocurrencies.
Revenue-share from funded game titles will be kept in a Vault and NOX Holders will
be incentivized with rewards distributed from Nitro’s Vault from time to time, as a
form of reward for their participation in growing the network.
This is among the first in the world, with NOX being the pioneering blockchain-based
cryptocurrency token to be backed by a publicly listed company, iCandy Interactive
Limited (ASX: ICI).
We believe that Nitro will disrupt the playing field, acting as a mean to connect and
grow the video-games industry in a manner that is equitable for all parties.

US$101.1 billion. This was the total revenue for the global video-games industry in
20161 - a sum that is almost nine times the revenue of Hollywood2, and close to three
times the size of the entire movie industry3 globally. And this revenue is poised to rise
further with an estimated growth rate of close to 30% over the next 5 years, with
projected industry revenue reaching $128.5 billion by the end of 2020.4

Yet, what is most exciting is that the most dynamic growth is actually happening in our
very own backyard: Asia. In 2017 alone, 1.14 billion gamers in the region are set to
generate $51.2 billion for the industry, an impressive growth rate of 9.2% from the
prior year.5

Most incredibly, these numbers comprise nearly 50% of the entire video-games
industry revenue stream, and come 2020, the fastest-growing region in the coming
years will be Rest of Asia (excluding China, Japan, and Korea), with total game
revenues more than doubling to $10.5 billion, up from $4.5 billion in 2016.6

1.1 Industry Players and Dynamics
Given this increasingly high demand for games, one might wonder: who are the ones
supplying them? Generally, game producers are split into 3 categories: Hobbyists,
Large Corporates, as well as a group of segmented or early-stage game developers firms which we term as Promising Game Studios (“PGS”). These players are
distinguished by their scale of production, but are also differentiated by the
commerciality of their games as well.
Hobbyists tend to produce aspects of games that are noncommercial in nature,
focusing on producing mods for existing games out in the market.
Large Corporates, such as Blizzard or King Digital, typically comprise of a network of
studios that develop games backed by its own established production and funding
system. This, while efficient, may inevitably give a commercial feel towards titles
produced by such developers. These are the ones that seemingly dominate industry
revenue.
Promising Game Studios, however, are placed in the middle of the spectrum. While
they do not possess the scale of big companies, they are arguably charged with a mix
of creative and commercial potentials that are surprisingly popular in the current
6

market; a market that has been criticised as “oversaturated” due to the numbers of
“indistinguishable games” flooding the market.
Currently, the video-games industry is dominated by a handful of Large Corporates. In
2015, $69.6 billion of the $91.8 billion global games market (or 75.8%) was generated
by almost 70 public companies worldwide.7

What is worrying is that this oligopolistic trend is intensifying rapidly; in 2016, the top
10 video-games companies accounted for an immense 54% of the global game market
revenue, up from 43% the prior year. If this continues, there will be less and less
diversity in the industry.

02 Target Audience
2.1 General Population

There is no easy way to participate and
beneﬁt from the video-games economy

Limited quantity of companies
Only a handful of video-games
companies are publicly traded

M ostly private companies
Many promising early-stage video-games
companies do not have r esources to
qualify for publicly tr aded capital mark ets

Concentration risk
A typical video-games company
tends to focus on a par ticular genre

Liquidity issue
Even if investors have the me ans to make
angel investments, their assets are illiquid
as these companies ar e mostly private

No access for
average investors to
easily invest in the
lucrative videogames industry
directly

Selection and diversiﬁca tion
Not easy to pick and conﬁgur e a
diversiﬁed por tfolio of investments into the
industry (golden rule of investment)

Geographical Limitation
Not easy to invest cross-border into both
public or private video-games companies

2.1.1 Problems: Lack of Participation Opportunities
While gamers help to generate over US$100 billion a year in revenue for the videogames industry, there are no easy ways for the average man or woman on the street
to benefit or participate in the growth of the economy, beyond the purchasing of
games.
One way to participate in the industry is through the traditional method of stock
ownership. However, there is a limited number of such companies to invest in.
Furthermore, many promising early-stage video-games companies do not have
resources to qualify for publicly traded capital markets, and hence unable to receive
investments in the public market. These severely limit the ability for the average
person to invest in the industry.
Another way of participating in the economy could be through angel investments in
private firms. However, such an option is seen to be highly illiquid, and this liquidity
risk will not sit well with the average person.
Shifting away from the private-public investment dichotomy, one other problem that
deters the average person from investing in the industry is the problem of
geographical limitations. It is often difficult for cross-border investments into private
or even public companies, due largely to the different securities and investment
regulations governing these different territories. This could make an otherwise
lucrative investment unviable due to the logistical hurdles in such investments.

12

Additionally, video-game companies also have a concentration risk by virtue of their
niche focus in game genres. Each video-game company tends to focus on one or two
genres in its video-game production, making the feasibility of its business susceptible
to the whims of gamer tastes, which change with the seasons. This risk may be hard
for the average person to negotiate when deciding on their investments into a videogame company.
Given the limited stock ownership opportunities available, it makes it near impossible
for an average person to pick and configure a diversified portfolio of investments
within the video-games industry, which is the golden rule of investments. It is no
surprise then that for a conflux of the above reasons, an average person will not be
able to benefit from the growth of the video-games industry.

2.2 Promising Game Studios (PGS)
Existing Problems for Promising Game Studios
While there are indeed many commercially successful studios in this sector, most of
them tend to be clustered in Europe or North America, by virtue of a more developed
eco-system to market and fund titles. The games ecosystem outside of these regions
appears to be relatively stunted, creating great problems for early-stage studios.
Even though the video-game consumer market is seen to be thriving, a multitude of
factors including the general inaccessibility to funding prevents Promising Game
Studios from fully exploiting this growing market.

2.2.1A Funding or Lack Thereof

And it’s also hard for Promising Game
Companies to raise funds

via Public listing
Only a handful of video-games companies ar e
publicly traded. Promising game studios have
difﬁculties accessing the public mark et

via Private funding
Difﬁcult to attract funding due to lit tle or no track
records of promising game studios, necessary to
assess the ability of the team

No easy way
to participate
in growth

via Traditional Crowdfunding Campaigns
The crowd does not have e xpertise to ascertain viability of projects and skills of team.

Barriers to Traditional Funding Methods
13

The increasing market size has created prime conditions for investment within the
sector. Yet, access to public funds is often limited for smaller and early-stage firms.
Only a handful of firms of considerable size are able to access funds through public
listing, with Promising Game Studios often lacking the resources to qualify for publicly
traded capital markets.
And while funds could be sought from institutional investors, of which there is no
shortage of, these funds are more often placed in larger companies, who would have
an established track record of successful titles, simply out of a need to balance risk
and commercial viability. Access to funds, at least through the capital markets, or
through institutional means, is thus limited for these early-stage video-games
companies.
Current Funding Options for Promising Game Studios
While other funding options are available within the industry, these options have
significant issues, which limit their utility for Promising Game Studios. One option
includes approaching publishers in the industry. However, due to the need to maintain
a balance between risk and commercial viability, such publishers tend to shun niche
games, which inevitably affect the diversity of the video-games industry.
Other options include applying for funding from independent funds within the sector
- such as the Indie Fund - but such funds are often limited, and hence are only available
to fund a few selected titles within the industry.

Crowdfunding remains a viable option for early stage studios to receive funding pregame development, but there are limited platforms to facilitate this process in the
current market. Some of the more popular platforms include Kickstarter and
Indiegogo, but such platforms are not specific to the game industry, and hence have
limited usability.
The many problems associated with the current funding options thus limits the
success of Promising Game Studios, preventing them from fully exploiting the vast
potential of the growing video-games industry.

2.2.1B The Problem of Imperfect Information
Apart from funding, the main reason for this boils down to imperfect information flow;
which is a problem caused not by a lack of will, but a lack of opportunity.
Promising Game Studios would like to incentivise gamers to play new games that have
been launched, but current means of communicating (either through ad platforms or
app stores) make it difficult to reach out to gamers directly. Communication is only
possible through forums and/or social media platforms.
Promising Game Studios too would like to receive feedback (via playtests or other
types of tests e.g. polls) from these gamers, such that they can create games that can
be well-received. However, it is typically difficult to gather a large enough community
of representative gamers for feedback to be meaningful, with this problem being more
pronounced for Promising Game Studios due to their lack of resources.
However, there is no common platform for either party to reach out to the other,
resulting in this problem of a hit-and-miss in the games produced by promising game
studios.
On top of this, imperfect information exists amongst the other parties involved in the
process of video-games production. Financiers - an important driver of the videogames industry - arguably have difficulty assessing gamer sentiments for the different
genres of games available in the market.
Given that tastes and preferences often change, financiers will have significant
difficulty in determining which games to invest in, therein making investment within
this lucrative industry a risky option. Even if financiers want to invest in early-stage
studios - an option that is currently shunned due to its high risks - they often do not
have an easy way to reach out to them. The lack of connection between the two
parties creates significant problems in the industry.
Publishers are also required in the video-games industry, helping to roll out the games
for the market after its production. This process requires a two-pronged approach,
with a need to garner strong content for the market, as well as to reach out to
potential audiences. However, given that there exists significant imperfect
information between publishers and promising game studios - which are often elusive

due to their smaller scale of operations - publishers will have difficulties reaching out
to this group, resulting in a less diverse portfolio. Yet on the other hand, publishers
are also facing increasing costs in connecting with audiences, hence creating
significant problems for them, problems that will only amplify in the future.

2.3 The Potential of Promising Game Studios (PGS)
Even though barriers and challenges exist in the industry, there is still a lot of potential
for small game studios to flourish in this nascent market space. Various hits such as
Subway Surfers (revenue of USD 20 million; 2nd only to Pokémon Go in 2016 mobile
game downloads8) or even the relatively simple game 1010! (revenue of USD 5 million)
have been published by such studios, demonstrating strong market potential for
games produced by small and promising studios.
These successes, especially for mobile games, have been spurred on by dedicated
Indie game sections on Google Play (for Android devices) and the App Store (for iOS
devices), providing a visibility boost for such games to all smartphone users.
This is also true for the desktop, where game platforms such as Steam also have a
curated section for indie games. Many of these desktop games such as “Don’t Starve”
(rated 10/109) and MineCraft (eventually bought over by Microsoft for $2.5 billion10)
have successfully held their own against similar titles from bigger game developers.
However, unless access to funding for these Promising Game Studios catches up to
their market potential, these successes will continue to be few and far between, which
is a disappointment, considering how some funding could go a long way for these
Promising Game Studios. The problem of imperfect information is also pertinent in
the industry, creating less than optimal outcomes for many of the key stakeholders in
this industry. Given the inaccessibility of funding and information within the videogames industry, we believe that there needs to be a solution soon before the problems
become ingrained in the industry.

03 Solution: Nitro, an Alternative Platform
Noting the significant limitations of the current funding options present in the videogames industry, a new blockchain-based platform is being introduced as an alternative
to the current options.
This would be the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency ecosystem to be backed by a
publicly traded company - iCandy Interactive Limited (ASX: ICI), a mobile game studio
group publicly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. It has already attracted the
attention of the industry, and is currently backed by both game industry veterans and
venture investment professionals.
The platform - Nitro – harnessing the power of blockchain technology and
cryptocurrency, will empower token-holders globally to benefit from the video game
economy via:
1. Participating in selection and funding of promising games curated by experts
2. Engaging with game producers, marketers, publishers and financiers in the
games marketplace and exchanging tokens for in-game items/currency or
other benefits.
3. Potentially receiving rewards from the success of the games funded by the
Nitro network.

3.1 Vision
What is envisioned, is that the new platform will fix what we see as fundamental
problems within the industry. These problems, as mentioned in the earlier sections,
refer to the difficulty of the layman in participating in the video-games economy, the
lack of diversity caused by the presence of large oligopolistic market in the industry
and the communication inefficiencies that exist between all gamers and game
producers.
On the macro-level, Nitro seeks to connect what we see as a fragmented and
disconnected value chain, envisioning a holistic platform which brings together
developers, marketplaces, publishers, and gamers, in order to solve the problem of
participation and information flow between these various players for the overall
benefit of the industry.

3.2 Dynamics of the Nitro Platform
The initial coin offering will feature the minting of a new currency based on the
Ethereum platform. This currency, or NOX, will be the centrepiece of all activities that
are carried out on the Nitro platform. The dynamics and the process flow of activities
carried out on the platform are summarized below:

Issuance: Nitro will issue NOX: A blockchain-based token that is the centrepiece of
Nitro activities, to be used on the Nitro platform.
Curation: Nitro Team will curate Promising Game Studios (PGS) and submit videogame funding proposals to the Nitro platform
Voting: NOX holders can vote on their favourite games, and if sufficient votes are
received, the proposed video game will undergo a funding process.
Funding: Funding will be received in Fiat currency or Ether, which would be used by
the video-game studios to develop and market their games. This funding will be
provided by Nitro.
Post-Funding: Funded games will subsequently share its revenue with Nitro. A portion
of this sum returned to the pool for funding new video games, in order to ensure the
sustainability of the ecosystem. The remainder will be held in a Vault, which could be
distributed to NOX holders, from time to time, as a form of reward for participating in
the platform and to encourage the adoption of NOX.
Exchangeable to In-Game Sub-token: Upon launching of the Nitro marketplace, NOX
holders will be able to exchange NOX for sub-token called Nitro Dollar or NOD which
is pegged to US Dollar (1 NOD to 1 USD), NOD will be used for in-game credits and
items. All the games on Nitro Marketplace will use NOD as an in-game currency.

returned to the pool to fund new games by Nitro. The remainder (60% of proceeds)
will be held in a Vault by the Nitro team. This amount may then be redistributed back
to NOX holders from time to time, as rewards in appreciation for participating in the

3.3.2A Utility of NOX as an In-Game Currency
The other great potential lies in the ability to use NOX in games. NOX can be
exchangeable to sub-token NITRO Dollar (NOD), a form of In-Game currency for
gamers using the Nitro Marketplace. This Nitro Marketplace will have a published
Nitro SDK, in order to allow all stakeholders to easily connect to it, and to use NOD as
the de-facto currency to transact. NOD will be pegged to US Dollar at the rate of 1
NOD to 1 USD. The Nitro Marketplace will have spot rate that allows conversion of
NOX to NOD easily according to the prevailing exchange rate of NOX to NOD.
What is envisioned is that games, which are not funded by Nitro, will also have the
ability to accept NOD as a payment option for in-game items. This will first be rolled
out to games under the iCandy Interactive group, with established developers such as
Inzen Studio and Appxplore taking the lead in implementing the payment system for
their games, before other video game studios jump onto the system after it is tried
and tested. By making NOD ubiquitous among users, it will inevitably help to increase
the utility value of NOX as well.

Some examples of what the platform can offer to the various stakeholders are as
follow:

Connect

1. Gamers can easily exchange NOX into NOD, and vice versa on Nitro
Marketplace
2. Gamers can connect via Nitro Marketplace API to use NOD as an In-Game
Currency for purchase of virtual items in games.
3. Marketing companies can promote new games on Nitro Marketplace and
directly incentivize gamers with NOX or NOD to try out new games and provide
feedback
4. Gamers can trade virtual items with each other on the Nitro Marketplace, with
NOD as currency.
In offering NOX as a form of in-game currency, we hope to increase the connectivity

04 Overview of NOX Tokens
4.1 What is NOX?
NOX is a block-chain based token minted for specific usage on the Nitro platform. It is
based on the Ethereum protocol (ERC20 standard), and will be used as the designated
currency within the Nitro economy. The specific usage will be discussed in detail
within section 5.2. It should be noted that these features or purposes may not be
exhaustive, and may be altered over time.

4.2 What is NOX’s Usage?
Usage within the Nitro platform.
All activities on the Nitro platform will be facilitated through the use of NOX. The token
can be bought and sold on the cryptographic token exchanges for usage within the
Nitro platform, provided that users adhere to the specific laws of purchase in their
respective places of residence. Given that there are existing regulations with regards
to the circulation of securities in countries such as the United States of America, China
and Japan (but not limited to the aforementioned countries), purchasers have the
responsibility to check the respective legislation in their places of residence.
Tokens used for voting.
NOX will be used as a nominal token for the internal voting mechanism implemented
on the platform. Gamers will be able to vote for their desired games using NOX, a
process which would lead to their eventual funding.
Tokens used as a form in-game currency.
NOX will be easily exchangeable to subtoken Nitro Dollar (NOD), which is pegged to
US Dollar (1 NOD : 1 USD). NOD is used as a form of in-game currency to purchase
services and products. NOD can also be used for trading between gamers for
secondary market of in-game items for some games. Gamers can decide when they
want to exchange NOX to NOD, or vice versa anytime on Nitro Marketplace.
Tokens used as rewards for long-term supporters of the platform.
NOX holders are eligible to receive rewards (in the form of ETH, from Nitro’s Vault) for
their active participation in the Nitro ecosystem. This is distributed from time to time
at the Nitro Team’s discretion, as a form of incentive for supporters as the Nitro
economy continues to grow through increased participation of all parties.

4.3 What NOX is Not
NOX tokens are not securities in any jurisdiction.
This White Paper does not constitute a prospectus or offer document of any sort, is
not intended to constitute an offer of securities or a solicitation for investment, does
not pertain in any way to an initial public offering or a share/equity offering, and does
not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. The NOX tokens
are not intended to be marketed, offered for sale, purchased, sold, or traded in any
jurisdiction where they are prohibited by applicable laws or require further
registration with any applicable governmental authorities.
NOX tokens do not represent a loan or security.
The NOX tokens are neither debt instrument nor bonds nor securities of any kind nor
any other form of loan advanced to the Project. Acquisition of the NOX tokens,
whether through the Token Sale or otherwise, does not grant to token holders any
right of claim on Project’s financial or any other assets.
NOX tokens are not a promise of future performance or value.
No promises of future performance or value are or will be made in respect to the NOX
tokens, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments,
and no guarantee that the NOX tokens will hold any particular value.

05 Benefits to Parties using Nitro Platform and NOX
The use of the Nitro platform, and NOX, will provide a great range of benefits to all
participants. These benefits have been summarized in the section below.
Game Studios
First, video game studios are expected to receive better access to funding through
Nitro. This will provide them with the resources to create better games, for example
through the exploration of new gameplay mechanics and concepts that can better
excite the fans.
Second, game studios will be able to receive timely and immediate feedback on their
games throughout the video-games production cycle by interacting with gamers on
Nitro Marketplace. This will enable them to produce games that better fit the tastes
of gamers, improving game quality and their eventual success.
Third, game studios are not only able to improve on the quality of their games through
NOX, but also their outreach in marketing efforts. Through the Discover function,
gamers would have an opportunity to discover these otherwise obscure Promising
Game Studios that would have been hidden beneath the behemoths in the industry.
This will definitely help in promoting the studio’s games to the wider public.
Fourth, the use of NOX/NOD for in-game purchases will heavily benefit the
developers. While in-game purchases of virtual items already exist on major app
stores, such purchases are subjected to a 30% fee, with a payment delay of 30 days.
The Nitro Marketplace will not only offer a more favorable transaction fee, but would
also offer instantaneous transactions for game studios to provide greater liquidity.
Lastly, with the instantaneous transaction system to be put in place through Nitro
Marketplace, studios will be able to receive the proceeds from in-game purchases
immediately. This will greatly increase the liquidity of their business.
Gamers
Gamers will finally have a say in the entire game production process, with
opportunities to participate from concept right until production. This will no doubt
improve the quality of games that will eventually be produced, improving the eventual
game experience for users.
More importantly, as a reward for helping us build a community of the future, gamers
will be allocated a form of economic benefit from time to time. These rewards will be
given out either through the periodic distribution of NOX to the community, at the
discretion of the Nitro Team, or through other incentives given by developers
themselves for aiding in marketing or beta-testing efforts.
The use of NOX as an In-Game currency will also create greater linkages across all
parties using the Nitro platform. With NOX, gamers will be able to purchase in-game

items in a safe and secure fashion.
Using the platform, gamers can also be incentivized with in-game currency, to do beta
testing, provide feedback or perform any other forms of marketing activities
requested by game developers. This creates a well-integrated community that we
envision, a community that would be benefiting to both gamers, and developers.
These form compelling reasons for supporting this platform.
Game Publishers
Using the platform, gamers can also be incentivized with in-game currency, to do betatesting, provide feedback or perform any other forms of marketing activities
requested by game developers and publishers. The use of this platform will also help
to reduce the cost of connecting with the various parties, through the heightened
efficiency of directly bringing content, which is proven to be popular among the
community.
Financiers
The platform provides a manner for which game concepts can be validated before its
production. The market demand for the games listed on the platform can be
determined prior to the financing process, allowing financiers to better gauge gamer
sentiments. This will instill greater confidence in financiers to provide support for
products that could still be in its earlier stages - thus creating greater options for
investment.
Nitro also helps to link Promising Game Studios and other industry stakeholders
together, creating greater ease in the operations aspects of video-games financing
and development.
This creates a well-integrated community that we envision, a community that would
benefit not only the gamers, but also all stakeholders including the developers,
financiers and studios. These are compelling reasons for the support of the Nitro
platform.

8.4 Management Lock-up
2/3 of NOXs retained by the Nitro Team will be subjected to a lock-up period of 6

8.5 Unique Public and Private Markets’ Proposition
Nitro is the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency project in the world backed by a
publicly traded company on an internationally recognised stock exchange
(independently verified by DealStreetAsia.com). iCandy Interactive Limited, is a
leading Southeast Asian mobile games development company listed on the Australian
Securities Exchange, backed by reputable institutional investors such as Baidu,
IncubateFund and Fatfish Internet Group.

iCandy Interactive Limited’s subsidiary, iCandy Ventures Ltd will facilitate the
publishing of all games funded by the Nitro project and make available its resources
on an ongoing basis to support the game publishing operation of Nitro.
Some of the advantages of having iCandy Ventures Ltd on the Nitro project would
include:
1. As part of publicly traded group that is backed by reputable shareholders,
iCandy Ventures Ltd has reputational risk if it does not perform what it is
tasked to do.
2. Having a backer that is familiar with the video-games industry will translate to
greater resources and reach. iCandy Ventures Ltd will have access to an
expansive network of studios that can already participate in the platform, and
with it being an industry player itself, it will be able to reach out to other
smaller studios, which would greatly help to kick start the development of the
Nitro project.
3. Having a backer that is familiar with legal and regulatory framework will ensure
that the project adheres to the legal and regulatory frameworks in countries it
operates in, giving greater assurance to its success.
