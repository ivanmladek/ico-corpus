Executive summary for BitRent
BitRent - a platform for decentralized organization of real estate investment based on
Blockchain and Smart Contracts.

Our Mission
Provide everyone with the opportunity to make investments in real estate, both
commercial and residential, at any construction stage with no geographical reference.
Our ultimate goal is to make this process as fast, transparent, and secure as possible.

What Problem Does BitRent Solve?
One of the most widespread problems of the real estate market of today is a reserved
and conservative approach during the early stage of construction, when a developer
needs seed capital most of all. An outdated control and monitoring model in
construction sector usually causes construction rise in price and a failure to meet the
date of facility commissioning, thus, making this sector quite unaffordable for the
majority of people. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of a unified database of
construction objects in need of additional funds as well as the limited access to this
information of a general public. BitRent solves these issues by combining the following
innovative technologies within one platform: BIM, RFID, LEED, BREEAM, Blockchain,
Primavera and Smart Contracts. The mentioned above solution offers everyone, from
large companies to individuals, an access to the
opportunity to participate in
constructions at early stages and with no geographical reference. At the same time,
this platform provides developers from all over the world with the opportunity to pull
together funds from multiple unrelated sources, significantly increasing the pull of
participants. Such a system promotes competition and more adequate pricing.

How Does BitRent Operate?
A developer publishes an object on BitRent platform with the aim to draw funds. A
token holder (or the “Member”) who has an access to this platform chooses the object
that best meets his/her criteria/interests. Then, Smart Contracts Pool is built as a
basis for all platform’s elements functioning, including token holder - developer
cooperation. The Member transfers chosen cryptocurrency or fiat to the construction
project’s wallet. The Member controls all construction processes in real time.

The Company and Management
BitRent is headquartered and incorporated in the City of London. BitRent founder –
Dmitriy Starovoitov possesses extensive experience in real estate construction while
4

Carl Francis, architect and leading advisor, has worked in architecture sector for more
than 18 years worldwide.
The management of BitRent consists of a founder Dmitriy Starovoitov and co-founder
Dmitriy Shapran. Both partners will be taking hands-on management roles in the
company. Moreover, we have assembled a board of experts in construction and
blockchain fields to ensure efficient management operations. The experts are:
1. Carl Francis, Non-Executive Director at Imperial Corporate Capital
2. Abdulla Almansoori, Partner in Capital Capture (UK)
3. James Trefty, Senior Software Developer at California Earthquake Authority

Hard cap:
100 000 ETH
Limited emission: 1 000 000 000 Rntb
Ethereum ERC20 token

Pre-sale and ICO projections
In the course of Pre-sale, you have a unique opportunity to get tokens with a 40%
discount at the primary stage and 25% discount at the final one.
The price is to be determined during Pre-sale.
Duration: 78 days.
Emission: 200,000,000 Rntb tokens.
The amount of Rntb received for ETH should be counted based on the following
formula:
6

Sum = X・Y/Z
Sum stands for the amount of Rntb received.
X stands for the amount of ETH needed to buy Rntb.
Y stands for the emission of Rntb for a certain period.
Z stands for the total amount of ETH received in the current period.
Example:
A token buyer is willing to purchase the amount of Rntb worth 10 ETH. The emission
in the current period stands for 200,000,000 Rntb, with 1,000,000 ETH received
during this period.
Sum = 10 ETH * 200 000 000 Rntb/1 000 000 ETH = 2 000 Rntb
The use of such formula makes it virtually impossible for one token buyer to purchase
all tokens.
Sum = 10 ETH * 200 000 000 Rntb/50 000 ETH = 40 000 Rntb
Token price 1 Rntb = 0,00025 ETH
BitRent is a unique blockchain platform that unites crypto-community on the one hand
and real estate developers, on the other hand and allows every person in the world to
become a real estate owner in any part of the Earth.

Introduction
The primary stage of construction is the most beneficial for purchasing commercial
and residential real estate, but it is not obtainable for everyone. Our aim is to give
everyone an opportunity to access the most promising industrial, commercial, and
residential objects at all construction stages and all over the world and to provide
developers with a chance to access a huge pool of interested parties looking to buy
real estate at the construction stage. Moreover, an outdated model of construction
control and monitoring, which is generally performed almost in a manual way, leads to
a rise of the construction cost price and a failure to meet initial deadlines. BitRent
platform allows to deal with all such challenges by a symbiosis of open modeling BIM
technologies, monitoring automation of all building stages, green standards, and a
possibility of equity participation within the most perspective commercial and
residential objects at all stages of construction with the help of cryptocurrency.
Besides, using smart-contracts the platform makes investing in commercial, industrial
and residential real estate clear and predictable for an ordinary user anywhere in the
world. The decentralized blockchain system will provide much better control over
building process and will decrease transaction costs. We believe that BitRent platform
will change world’s view on blockchain in the area of the real estate. All technologies
introduced within this platform will ultimately change the status quo in building and
investing areas.

1. Description of the industry
1.1. Main tendencies of the industry
As indicated in this White Paper, the Rntb token provides token holders with an
access to the worldwide cross-functional trading platforms for real estate construction
projects at all stages of development. The real estate market has a number of
potential advantages. First, the real estate market has low-level volatility. Second,
despite the low-level risk, such assets’ income is quite high. Ownership in commercial,
industrial and residential real estate allows to get stable income. Third incomparable
important advantage of the real property is the protection from inflation. It also
prevents asset and rent price rise at the time of money depreciation. All of the abovementioned advantages make real estate purchasing extremely practical for the
purpose of portfolio diversification and minimization of market risks and
macroeconomic shocks.
In the context of permanent world-population growth and rapid economic
development, commercial real estate market has unlimited opportunities for
expansion, which means that more and more people will be interested in investing
their savings in such assets.
There is a new investing trend emerging in the financial field. More private individuals
are getting interested in small amount investments within equity construction market,
with P2P platforms appearing on the horizon. One of the most well-known examples
is RealtyShares crowdfunding platform, which allows to invest as little as $500. Their
user base already has 92,000 registered investors.
35% of investors consider real state to be the best low-risk asset for investments.
65% 35% Other assets: gold, bonds, state company stocks.

The real property market itself is the key element of the economy and a part of
national wealth of the country. In 2016, the amount of the world real estate market
was $217 trillion. What is more, $8.6 trillion from total amount was made through the
building market. According to Global Construction Perspectives and PWC's
predictions, by 2020 the amount of the world construction market is about to increase
almost by 74% - in money terms $15 trillion.
74% growth of the global market of the real estate construction expected within 5
years.

In the new decade, in 2020-2030, construction will be aimed at developing regions. It
will be explained not only by the rapid population growth, but also by the growth of
the economic attractiveness of India, China, and South Africa. In 2020, it is expected
that about 55% of the world construction market will fall on developing countries'
markets as against 46% in 2016. Due to the economic growth in China, India, and
Indonesia, the market of the real estate construction is to make 16.5% from GDP
against 14.9% in 2016. Besides, according to McKinsey Global Institute, it is expected
that in 15 years a quarter of all population is to be accommodated in 600 largest
cities' agglomerations, thus, building a new tendency in mass residential building,
commercial and industrial infrastructure.

The lack of necessary resources will become the new problem for the construction
market. By 2050 the Earth's population is to reach almost 10 billion people according
to the UN's predictions. According to the same source, by 2050 there might be
almost 200 million of eco-refugees all over the world. This is due to the shortage of
high-quality food, lack of clean water, and polluted air. All these predictions draw us
closer to the well-known trend of "green" construction.

Ecohouses
save up to

Ecological construction does not only bring positive externalities for the society, but
also improves economic health of a building. It is proved that economic efficiency of
"green" construction contributes to the increase of building's capitalization by
7.5-8.2% when ecological standards certificate is collected. One may also observe a
decrease of operating costs by 8-9%, quantity reduction of vacant areas, growth of
building's occupancy by 3.5% as well as an opportunity to raise rent from 3% to 8%.
Everise Consulting experts mark that applying such technologies may lead to reduced
building terms, infrastructure expenses as well as creation of a lot more attractive and
modern buildings.

According to the report of CBRE's 2017 National Green Building Adoption Index,
today almost 40% of areas of the commercial real estate in the 30 largest cities of the
USA already match green standards. Chinese five-year plan #13, started in 2016,
requires that at least half of new constructions have to be certificated on ecological
standards.
“Green” construction is closely tied to the introduction of new technological decisions
within building and management of the real estate objects. Such approach requires
permanent collection and deep analysis of information.

1) RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification)
RFID is a contactless data exchange technology. RFID tags are usually used for the
inventory and commodities identification with the help of a reader. RFID primary
advantage is an opportunity to read data within a certain radius, register objects'
movements, and perform search.
With the development of digitalization, more demands on RFID technologies will
appear. According to Grand View Research, RFID market will reach $40.5 billion as
against only $16,2 billion in 2016. One of the most promising directions for RFID
systems' development is their use in construction. First of all, RFID tags are placed on
all objects used during building process.
Afterwards, these tags are being read in real time, which means that we can track the
building process online. The primary benefit of such technology is timely notifications
as well as absence of human factor. In the case of below-proof issues or repairing of
damaged objects on the construction site, these faults will be traced with up-to-the
second accuracy, and, at best, fixed immediately upon their appearance.
Thanks to a powerful combination of blockchain and RFID technologies, tags and
readers will be effectively protected from any fake alternatives. Such synergy of two
technologies will allow to get reliable and quick information about the building stages
as well as object’s state up to its dismantling. Large companies all over the world
finally understood the importance of the combination of these two important
technological trends. Thus, IBM Company created a blockchain platform to keep track
of trucks and their cargo. In addition, such trucks are equipped with RFID systems
that collect data on distance covered, which is sent straight to blockchain’s memory.

12

2) BIM (Building Information Modeling)
BIM decisions are meant for creating and collecting information about the building
under construction at any stage of its existence. This technology allows to reproduce
an accurate, in all parameters, model on computers and other devices.
The use of BIM facilitates designing processes at all stages, performs analysis and
control of all construction activities. BIM technology takes into consideration all
geometrical features of a building and all its structural elements. Such a complete
model makes it possible to see all potential outcomes during construction in advance,
assess efficiency rate, compare alternative options in order to focus on the best one
and make an accurate schedule of all construction stages.
The combination of BIM, blockchain and RFID technologies, leads to resounding
accuracy growth of all processes. Blockchain amplifies data stream control and
protects it from any potential frauds.

#

3) Smart-contracts
Smart-contracts system is, without exaggeration, regarded as the main technology,
among those mentioned above, and forms a basis of the whole project. Smartcontracts system, built on blockchain technology, allows storing of reliable information
on all construction stages and deals made. Smart-contracts withdraw the trust issue
from the agenda between contracting officers and not only significantly speed up the
process, but also make it more transparent. Smart-contracts also simplify the
13

transacting process within real estate deals. These very smart contracts will form a
basis for registers of construction object ownership. Unlike traditional methods, these
documents are much safer. This cutting-edge technology guarantees safe money
transactions making them simpler and quicker.

1.2. Main problems of the industry
In spite of positive trends in the field of real estate and construction, this sector faces a
range of problems.

Problem:

purchase real estate anywhere in the
world from any location on the Earth
without being bound to a particular
country.

According to the statistics, 87% of real
estate buyers currently purchase real
estate items located in their place of
residence. This is due to the physical
ability to supervise the construction
process and better understanding of local
engineering standards. It also simplifies
the resale process due to familiarity with
local market.

BitRent platform enables members to
purchase any real estate item remotely. All
transactions are processed instantly.
Moreover, thanks to smart contract
register, your purchase and real estate
ownership are properly recorded and
effectively protected. You don’t need to
stand in lines to appropriate authorities
and go through a complicated process of
gathering multiple documents in order to
obtain a proof of ownership for immovable

Buying whole real estate objects require
possession of quite substantial capital
sums equal to the cost of the target real
estate (starting from $20,000 - 30,000
and higher), and lack of option to
purchase real estate objects in portions.

BitRent platform provides an opportunity
to every individual and company to
participate in eco real estate construction.
The real estate sector becomes more
technological, with meeting eco standards

Smart Contracts.

The dynamics of modern life makes all
processes go faster, including both
constructional and architectural.
Therefore, even a very slight construction
“freeze” turns into heavy losses of assets,
which, could go towards improvement of
aesthetical or functional qualities of
immovable property. The longer project is
considered to be “frozen”, the more vague
becomes the finishing date of a project as
well as the final costs of the construction.
One of the standard causes of unplanned
“freezes” is non-transparency of the
construction process and a great number

subcontracting parties.

Problem:

Solution:

building objects using

LEED and BREEAM certificates and
monitoring tags.
Currently, developers are not ready to
spend money on genuine ecoconstruction due to increased expenses
and project delivery time. BitRent builds a
distributed ledger using RFID, Smart
Contract, LEED and BREEAM
technologies. Such approach will cause
eco-construction to be more developer
attractive. An object built in compliance
with “green” standards automatically rises
in price by 25-30%, when on sale.

15

1.3. Competitors
Efforts have been made to address the mentioned above challenges with a help of
traditional projects as well as projects based on blockchain technologies, but none of
them have been successful so far. BitRent is the first ever project that resolves legal,
financial, and technical issues alltogether. Nevertheless, for the sake of our members,
we would like to introduce a comparison study of the big league technological real
estate market players possessing products based on traditional as well as blockchain
technologies.

Thus, BitRent is the first blockchain project, which includes a global proprietary rights
register, a platform allowing to find, access, participate in, and control real estate
projects, and pull together funds necessary to start or continue any construction
project in the shortest timespan anywhere in the world. Furthermore, such
construction will be the most transparent process ever because token purchasers can
check all legal, technological, and financial documentation provided by developer,
stored on blockchain, and available online. Besides that, this is the first project that
implements global eco standards in the field of real estate construction without raising
building costs.

2. About BitRent project
2.1. Brief description of BitRent project
BitRent project is a cross-functional purchase/monitoring/sale platforms for real estate
construction projects at all stages of development worldwide. Below is a detailed
description of each and every functional part.

2.1.1. Construction monitoring and comfort control of BitRent structures
As a rule, managing companies spend a lot of time to manually monitor all stages of
construction from the design to assessment of effectiveness and comfort level, which
negatively affects the cost and facility completion deadline.
Bitrent is the first decentralized platform that allows members to track in a real time
online mode all the processes of the construction from the modeling to the final
inspection of the finished building with the help of smart-contracts and blockchain.
Such a register is maintained through assigning to each operational process a unique
number kept in the architecture of smart-contracts (smart-contracts about modeling,
all stages of construction, the shared participation in investment etc.)

17

2.1.2. BitRent trading platform
BitRent is a platform for decentralized organization of real estate purchases based on
blockchain and smart contracts. BitRent is the first platform to provide access to the
worldwide database of industrial, commercial and residential real estate at all stages of
construction to all interested individuals and companies. It also allows to make secure
transactions and monitor statuses of various projects.

#

2.2. BitRent Goals
2.2.1. Construction control optimization
Aiming to optimize control over construction projects and to improve their efficiency,
blockchain-based BitRent platform developed a wide range of technologies that make
purchase of real estate at the initial stage of construction simple, transparent, and
available to anyone. This platform provides Rntb holders with an opportunity to
purchase real estate worldwide at the most beneficial stage of primary construction
with almost no expenses at all. Plus, they gain total online control over construction
process.

18

Thus, BitRent will transform the primary commercial and residential real estate market,
making it more affordable, transparent, safer, more reliable, flexible, and dynamic as
there will be no more need to hire audit companies that are inevitably involved in
construction process.

2.2.2. Aﬀordability
BitRent's platform eliminates any minimum requirements for participating in any real
estate project. BitRent's platform provides safe and efficient participation in
construction since all real estate operations are kept within smart-contracts
environment. Thus, BitRent represents a combination of legal, financial, technical, and
blockchain components meant to dramatically change the field of the real estate
market!

2.2.3. Implementing eco standards in construction
We believe that climate change and shortage of resources will reinforce eco
standards’ standing in construction. Nevertheless, we also believe that, with
competent management of construction funds, these standards will not lead to an
automatic price increase.
All constructions participating in BitRent platform will be equipped with trackers
transmitting data as shown on the figure below. The process will meet all Comfort
Energy Ecology standards based upon 9 key parameters (light version of LEED,
BREEAM, DGNB). BitRent platform will collect such data and pass it over to platform’s
members upon completion of the construction process.
This means that a client will be empowered to choose the most practical option in
terms of the comfort level, energy efficiency rate, and building conditions, will reduce
negative environmental impact, and will have better expense policy. Certain trackers
will be stored in buildings for about 50 years, which will help to control their condition
down to its dismantling or recycling.

19

Types of data to be transmitted via BitRent trackers

By adopting ecological standards, BitRent platform will also stimulate developers,
willing to be listed by BitRent, to focus on implementation of eco standards in their
construction projects. In doing so, BitRent platform will support self-sufficient circular
economy when all resources are recycled. We believe that eco standards will become
an integral part of the world real estate market!

2.3.3. P2P platform operation algorithm
The working process of exchange platform and collaborative use can be described as
follows:
1. Sellers display property description on BitRent platform.
2. Buyers search for real state that matches their criteria.
3. Buyers send offers using smart contracts to register subjects under
corresponding legal conditions.
4. Sellers accept offers by e-signatures.
5. Intermediaries fulfill their functions (agreement analysis, notarial procedures and
etc.).
6. When all the mentioned above conditions are met, smart contracts launch
payment system that enables buyers to deliver payments in digital money.
7. Smart contracts monitor payments and transfer property to a new owner in
BitRent register upon fulfillment of all conditions.
We design this system in modular way and enable buyers to monitor fulfillment of the
contract terms.

2.4. Legal framework for BitRent's activity
BitRent project is to be delivered by establishment of non-public companies in
accordance with the UK law. Legal organizational form is to be determined on
lawyers’ recommendations in compliance with safe and legally secure model of
dealing with digital money and its investors with ICO under preparation.
Public relationships between a company and members (or “ICO participants”) will be
governed by partnership liabilities (public offer) within the frame of funds’ tokens
produced. Tokens, however, do not grant the right to run a company since they do
not function as equity shares.

3. BitRent Business Model
3.1. BitRent Strategy
We aim to launch an entirely decentralized platform for attracting buyers into
construction sector based on blockchain technology. As for facilities to be offered for
sale, these are constructions selected by BitRent, that comply with eco standards and
equipped with BitRent trackers. This will provide token holders with exhaustive
information on the status of any real estate item within the decentralized network.

Escrow resources will be dedicated to financing of commercial
projects, which are currently under construction, using technologies
developed within this platform.

Collecting 50% or less of the planned amount:

50%

Forming Escrow
Establishing BitRent platform

The platform will be launched in any case, that is, it will be established even if
the required amount of funds is not collected.
The financial background of BitRent project is based upon analytical research of key
industry indicators as well as competitive ecosystems. Aggregated data on market
structure and its dynamics, including projected market share of the project and its
growth rates, has been used to provide more accurate assessment. The expected
world market volume of construction in 2018 will be $11,4 trillion.
We believe that, if marketing budgets are used properly, we may expect every
thousandth transaction to be made on our platform, which would give us 0,1% of
market share. Based on this prognosis and the average level of commission fees
between 1,5-3,5% from transactions amounts, we plan to expect an average annual
revenue of $ 171 million in 2018.

3.3.1. BitRent's oﬀered product
BitRent project is of interest for all real estate and construction market players,
including private individuals and companies. As mentioned above, BitRent is an
innovative platform meant to provide every interested person or entity with a real-time
access to a worldwide base of real estate projects and to enable secure and fast real
estate transactions using cryptocurrency with a help of construction monitoring
system.
BitRent's income consists of charging interests from real estate turnover transactions.

3.3.2. BitRent's planned sales
As previously noted, BitRent platform charges small interests upon successful
completion of transactions in digital currency as well as for usage of premium services
(with the interest rate averaging between 1,5% and 3,5% depending on the type of
transaction). All payments are made using digital currency (in countries where it is
officially permitted) and/or fiat money (in countries where digital currency transactions
are forbidden).
Given the fact that the foreign purchases/sales real estate market is rated $11,4
trillion, with BitRent project’s target markets covering almost all mature and developing
economies, we may strive to get the project’s turnover to amount to $11,4 billions,
provided its marketing strategy is carried out in a smart way. Interest, as well as
premium service payments, charged by BitRent, are well below those of the
competitors, which makes this product quite competitive and promising through the
lens of economics.

27

4. Token Rntb
4.1. Token Structure
1. Rntb is a utility token for the following purposes:

•
•
•
•
•

•

•

•

It does not provide any equity interest in BitRent company;
Its main function to provide an access to the BitRent base and transaction
system;
Funds collected will not be distributed until the platform is ready for launching;
All collected funds will be kept in escrow;
Token holders will have the right to select real estate projects to participate in,
to monitor their progress, and to stop their participation, i.e. they do not rely
exclusively on the actions of others;
In addition to access rights, the Rntb token represents a method of payment for
services and processing fees of the platform, including advertisement
campaigns and project promotion on the platform;
Priority access rights based on the number of tokens purchased by the holder
(currently, for buyers of 1000 tokens or more, but the platform reserves the right
to change the specified quantity);
Tokens can be driven out of the platform and sold on the exchange.

2. Prices for all services and processing fees are set in fiat, but to be paid in tokens.
When a payment is performed, the system determines the amount of tokens,
based on the going exchange rate, then takes them from a client’s wallet or buys
the necessary quantity according to the going rate on the exchange via integrated
exchange module.
3. Commission collected by the platform falls into two groups:
• 50% of tokens are reserved on the platform during services delivery;
• 50% of tokens are burned (the platform reserves the right to change the
specified percentage ratio) .
4. For the project to be placed on the platform, it has to first go through the
platform’s audit procedure; audit processing time varies in accordance with the
chosen service packages.
5. To take part in voting on the platform, all users should have no less than 1000
tokens on their accounts (the platform reserves the right to change the specified
quantity).
6. To get access to project information, token purchasers choose a range of services
via subscription based approach. These services differ by sets of information from
basic data to live stream from tags and cameras on site.
28

7. To promote projects, developers are provided with the service that can give their
projects higher position in search results.
8. In the form of additional services, the platform offers legal support/control for deals
with an object placed on the platform.
9. The platform renders Escrow services for projects and makes sure that the
projects use funds as indicated in the Roadmap.

4.2. Rules of vote and statement of construction objects
1. The user has to have on the account 1000 Rntb (the platform reserves the right to
change the specified quantity).
2. The developer undergoes preliminary registration to add the offered object to the
voting list.
3. Users get access to the voting list.
4. The voting list has a number of parameters to filter objects by specific criteria: type
of an object, its location, construction costs, rating of the developer, and other
factors.
5. To be listed, each object has to receive a specific number of votes. The required
minimum may vary depending on the project’s costs, country of placement,
developer’s rating and other factors. For example, a project with higher costs and
lower rating of the country will require a higher number of votes. Please see “The
table for determination of minimum number of votes below.” Example: Developer
wishes to begin construction on the territory of the USA requiring a budget of $2
million. According to this Table, it will require at least 400 voices (300 votes due to
the budget required + 100 votes due to the country of placement.) BitRent
reserves the right to change this Table.

6. Once the necessary number of votes is reached, a confirmation of passing
verification and final addition is sent to the developer.
7. Users voted for the passing developer receive privileges. Examples of such
privileges include a free set of digital copies of all project documents, a free 6month subscription to premium projects, and other preferences.
8. After each voting, 1000 Rntb (the platform reserves the right to change the
specified quantity) is written off the voting user’s balance. In exchange, except for
the cases of bonus access described in item 7, the voting user receives points
and increases his rating. To receive 1 point, the user must vote for 3 objects (the
platform reserves the right to change this option).

5. ICO Conditions
5.1. Issuing BitRent token
The Rntb tokens have a fixed total amount of 1 billion tokens. Therefore, as demand
will grow, there will be no increase in the total number of tokens. The number of
tokens that may be issued at each stage is indicated below.

5.3. Cost estimation of BitRent token
First stage of the token sale will last until December 1, 2017. During this stage, 200
million token Rntb (20% of the total emission) will be offered for sale. The second
stage starts on December 1, 2017, offering 699 million tokens for sale (69,9% of total
issuing). Remaining 100 million tokens (10% of the total issue) are reserved for BitRent
and will not be available for exchange trading. Token purchaser may use ETH or BTC
only to buy the Rntb tokens, with the price going unfixed and varied depending on the
market.
The amount of Rntb received for ETH should be counted based on the following
formula:
Sum = X・Y/Z
Sum stands for the amount of Rntb received.
X stands for the amount of ETH needed to buy Rntb.
Y stands for the emission of Rntb for a certain period.
Z stands for the total amount of ETH received in the current period.
Example
Token purchaser is willing to buy the Rntb worth of 10 ETH. The emission in the
current period stands for 200,000,000 Rntb, with 1,000,000 ETH received during this
period.
Sum = 10 ETH * 200 000 000 Rntb/1 000 000 ETH = 2 000 Rntb
The use of such formula makes it virtually impossible for one purchaser to buy all
tokens.
Sum = 10 ETH * 200 000 000 Rntb/50 000 ETH = 40 000 Rntb
Token price 1 Rntb = 0,00025 ETH
The minimum purchase volume of 1 token is 0,01 Ethereum.

CONCLUSIONS
Blockchain-based project BitRent is focused on general public and, in our opinion, it
will give a stimulus to the transformation of the entire commercial and residential real
estate market at the primary stage of construction and will make it accessible to
average people.

The project is to be implemented within the following stages:

Establishing a prototype
of the platform

The risk factors
The purchase of tokens is associated with a high risk degree, including, but not limited
to the risks listed below. Before purchasing Rntb tokens, each potential buyer is
recommended to carefully pay attention to all the information and risks outlined in this
White Paper, BitRent’s Purchase Agreement, and, particularly to the following factors:
1. Computer infrastructure dependence: dependence of Bitrent company on the
functioning of software applications, computer equipment, and the Internet means
that the Bitrent cannot guarantee that a break of the system will not adversely
affect the use of Rntb tokens owned by holders. Despite the fact that Bitrent uses
all reasonable measures to ensure network security, the servers of its data center
to computer viruses, physical and electronic hacking and other intrusions of a
similar character. Computer viruses, break-ins and other violations caused by
actions of third parties can lead to interruptions, delays and suspension of the
provision of services, which may limit the possibility of using Rntb tokens.
2. Limitations of the smart contract: the technology of a smart contract is still in its
early stages of development and its application is of an experimental nature. This
fact may threaten significant operational, legal, technological, reputational and
financial risks. Although an audit conducted by an independent third party
enhances security, accuracy and reliability of a smart contract, it can not serve as
the warranty, including any expressed warranty that the Rntb smart contract is
suitable for its intended use, or that it does not contain flaws, weaknesses or other
problems that may cause technical difficulties or complete loss of the Rntb token.
3. Legal regulations: Technology of the blockchain, including but not limited to the
release of tokens, may be a new concept in some jurisdictions that can apply to
current laws, or enact new legislative regulations based on blocking technology,
and such regulations may conflict with the current Rntb smart contract and the
concept of Rntb token.
4. Taxes: Rntb token holders may have obligations to pay taxes in relation with
transactions considered herein, in the United States or in their countries of
residence. In this case, holders of Rntb tokens are solely responsible for
compliance with US and other jurisdictions and all relevant taxes.
5. Force Majeure: The activities of the company Bitrent can be interrupted,
suspended or delayed due to force majeure circumstances. For the purposes of
this White Paper, force majeure means events and circumstances of an
extraordinary nature that could not be foreseen by Bitrent, and include natural
disasters, wars, armed conflicts, riots, industrial conflicts, epidemics, mass layoffs,
strikes with reduced productivity labor, long-term shortages or interruptions in
electricity supply or telecommunications services, the actions of the municipal 43

government, state and federal government, and other circumstances not beyond
the control of Bitrent, which were not observed at the time of publication of this
White Paper. If such circumstances occur before the release of Rntb tokens, and
Bitrent can not issue Rntb tokens within 1 month from the scheduled date, the
escrow agent may return the money paid to them by Rntb token purchase. The
refund is paid in the original amount and form of payment to the same digital
wallet or bank account where the funds were transferred from.
6. Information disclosure: Personal information received from holders of Rntb tokens,
information on the number of tokens belonging to holders of Rntb tokens,
addresses of used purses and other relevant information may be disclosed to law
enforcement and state authorities and other third parties if Bitrent is required to
disclose such information by law, subpoena or court order. Bitrent shall in no time
be responsible for the disclosure of such information for the stated reasons.
7. Token value: The cost of purchased Rntb tokens can vary significantly for various
reasons. Bitrent does not guarantee any specific price of Rntb tokens at any
specific time. Bitrent assumes no responsibility for any changes in the cost of Rntb
tokens.
8. Bitcoin and Ether fluctuations: Fluctuations in the bitcoin and Ether exchange rate
may affect the ability of the company to provide services at specified prices.
Assumptions in with respect to the above include judgments about future
economic, competitive and market conditions and business decisions, most of
which are not subject to control by the Bitrent team and, therefore, are difficult to
accurately predict. Although the Bitrent team believes its assumptions are
reasonable, any of them may in the future prove to be incorrect. Therefore, the
Bitrent team does not guarantee that the foreseen preliminary statements given in
this White Paper will be accurate. In the light of the considerable uncertainty,
inherent in the forward-looking preliminary statements provided in this document,
the inclusion of such information can not be interpreted as a guarantee from the
part of Bitrent or any other legal entity that the objectives and plans of the Bitrent
project will be successfully implemented.
A more detailed list of risk factors is set forth in the Risk Matrix document. Please,
take into consideration that the Bitrent project may be subject to other risks that the
project team can not foresee at the moment.
Note: We emphasize that Bitrent team cannot guarantee a steady growth of the price
of Rntb tokens, and is not responsible for the possible losses with speculative use of
tokens. Access to that Bitrent services is unconditionally guaranteed on the current
market price of the Rntb token.
