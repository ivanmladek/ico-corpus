Purpose Meets Opportunity
Schumpeter's hypothesis that technology would only serve to concentrate ownership and wealth
towards large corporations now seems prophetic1. Given the early promise of the internet era, it is
lamentable that the bifurcation of income between the ‘ haves’ and the ‘ have nots’ has become
even more profound during the internet age.

Despite market growth and increased prosperity, the vast majority of traditional tech startups fail
and the odds of their success are infinitely small even if they are executed well. Adam Smith’s
invisible hand is powerless against the tech giants.2 Their significant head-start on data gives an
application of artificial intelligence (AI) the potential to increase the scale of inequality and reduce
basic human rights to a free and democratic society.

We know a potential revolution is on the horizon as we escape the gravitational pull of the PC
internet era. The internet has come, it saw and it conquered us all with the data- mining-foradvertising model. The PC internet era had a baby and that baby is the decentralized Blockchain.
Distributed networks on blockchain have the ability to transform the world of traditional apps,
technology models, business models, and economic models across the entire planet - right now.

While there is great promise, there is also a problem with Blockchain that is not commonly
acknowledged. The problem is that there are hurdles that make the technology elusive for early
stage companies and hard to adopt for regular users. Most Blockchain use cases are still in
development and unproven. Furthermore, many of these use cases are in areas an average user
would be hard pressed to engage with. Transactions are anonymous, so data has limited value
without context or relevance. This makes it difficult to employ critical technology such as big data
and machine learning in a world where these technologies are set to dominate the landscape.

Mission Impossible for Traditional Startups
Despite the challenges, the number of new online startups continues to grow and low barriers to
entry create a huge fragmentation of effort. Consequently, very few startups achieve scale. At the
same time, users are interacting with fewer applications and their expectations are very high. The
capability a new startup needs to meet these expectations is almost impossible to achieve.

Digital business models are often highly reliant on data mining for advertising and newcomers are
starting from a very disadvantaged position compared to incumbents. Ubiquitous platforms are
rapidly consuming new niches with their bigger, multi-disciplined and agile teams and access to
data anticipating market movements.

“The average app loses 77% of its daily active users within the first 3 days of the install.
Within 30 days, it’s lost 90% of DAUs. Within 90 days, it’s over 95%.”

–

Quettra Mobile intelligence report 2016

Two key factors are working against market entrants achieving scale. Firstly, the number of digital
start-ups out there is rapidly expanding, fragmenting user attention, capital and technical resources.
Secondly, bigger platforms have a huge lead in user data, attention, capital and resource, which
enables them to either predict what’s coming or copy very fast.

On average, good plans, people, and businesses succeed only 1 in 10 times. This is because there
are many components that are critical to an enterprise’s success. The best companies might have an
80% probability of succeeding at each of them. But even with these odds, the probability of
eventual success will be less than 20% because failing to execute on any one component can
torpedo the entire company.3

If just one of the variables drops to a 50% probability, the combined chance of success falls to
10.5%.

The reality is in this model, a very small percentage of people own and/or control all the assets
and the system, in which the other 99% are effectively modern day serfs to their feudal kings and
queens4. Therefore, the holy grail and guiding purpose for Centrality Investments Limited (Centrality
or Centrality Investments) is to provide a platform that will create a decentralized community of
di gi t a l startups, successful in a world where the odds are otherwise stacked against them.

In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality identify the most important vertices
within a network of decentralized points. Applications include identifying the most influential
person(s) in a social network, key infrastructure nodes in the internet or urban networks5.

The Centrality Platform described in this White Paper allows developers and entrepreneurs to find
and create these connections between their applications and to create actions which join them
together in new degrees of closeness.

Centrality currently has 8 apps in market, generating revenue with a rapidly increasing user base.
Many of these applications have partnerships with listed companies and major corporations to help
accelerate growth. The Centrality Platform is already proving the benefits of sharing of data, users,
merchants and insights to these apps. This is creating lower acquisition costs and faster scaling.

Barriers to Mainstream Adoption of Blockchain
Blockchain technology has the power to transform the way industries operate around the world. Many
Blockchain companies are very technology-driven or trading- and fintech-centric. There is virtually no
mainstream consumer adoption as the concepts are not familiar and the user experience and interface
are quite technical.
Even if a company decides to develop on the Blockchain, the talent pool is limited and very few startups can access the talent required to create robust solutions.

Many ICOs to date have been very theoretical and overtly ambitious with little real world proof of their
10

value. The high failure rates are hardly a surprise and likely to continue considering the limited practical
use cases and user engagement strategies. This in itself represents a substantial risk to the ecosystem
and consumer adoption.
Blockchain companies, while often ambitious about their desire to change the system and create a
more distributed and decentralized world, are often following the same economic model as their PC
internet era startup companies in reality.

For example, they tend to:
1. reproduce the boiler plate for each application over and over
2. require the user to onboard over and over again
3. follow similar isolated value creation models and customer information silos as their incumbent
competitors
4. result in fragmented capital, human resources and user attention

The Solution: A New Startup Life Cycle
The Centrality Platform is an ecosystem platform that supports each stage of the startup life cycle. It
takes a human-centric approach that allows users to interact with a range of different applications with
very low friction. The Centrality Platform allows developers to create applications which leverage the
combined scale of the ecosystem in order to beat the incumbent startup hurdles that exist today.

Technology alone does not have the power to overcome the momentum that the incumbent
technology companies have, and with the advent of machine learning these incumbent companies
are extending their advantage at exponential rates. Without a radical shift in the way the economic
model behind a startup works, and without working in a different way to the typical startup model,
the landscape is unlikely to change.

Centrality’s direct customers are smart entrepreneurs who are trying to disrupt traditional value
chains and concepts by implementing Blockchain technology
The major advances in application development have been driven by platforms such as AWS and
AZURE, providing developers with tools, services, APIs and applications which enable them to focus
on the value-creating parts of the technology stack and user experience.

However, this has further concentrated power to the platform owners which have rapidly
consolidated. Imagine a world where the developers and customers harness the benefits from the
services provided by a platform like AWS and the value the applications create, instead of that benefit
being concentrated in a single central entity.
11

Centrality has built a platform, services and a library of applications that can be used as building
blocks to create a decentralized application ("DApp") business. This component-based design gives
startups flexibility over their product, while ensuring a standardised look and feel across all Centrality
Platform DApps. By standardising design for all scenes, it provides participants with a clean user
experience across the ecosystem.

This component library allows start-ups to access all of the tools from the Centrality Platform toolkit,
including Login with Blockchain, Hybrid Wallet, Blockchain Everywhere, API / SDK, Common
Microservices, Big Data Platform, Smart Contract Generator and Token Factory.

In addition to these tools, users can seamlessly move between applications without being subjected to
traditional approaches to customer application onboarding. This creates a network of interconnected
DApps that users can transition between in a human-centric way.

Being part of the Centrality Platform allows start-ups to create commercial connections using smart
contracts with other DApps who will help them grow. This avoids the cost and speed implications
of traditional commercial integrations and partnerships.

The Centrality Platform helps Blockchain developers circumvent the
startup model by:
1. Providing a place to incubate their DApp on a consortium platform where constraints of
performance and cost associated with public chains don’t exist
2. Providing the boilerplate services to get their applications up and running fast with minimal
effort
3. Providing a market place for different applications to share in the user pool, the data pool,
the merchant pool, and the content pool across the platform to overcome traditional ‘chicken
and egg’ scale issues
4. Enabling a machine learning framework that can help connect users in one application to a
relevant experience in another in real time to increase engagement
5. Enabling decentralized applications to be built TGE (ICO) ready with integrated
assessment/advisory investment banking support services
6. Providing access to post TGE services such as exchange listing, ongoing reporting and
performance monitoring

12

How the Centrality Platform works

The Centrality Platform creates the technological ‘foundation’ for DApps.
Centrality Platform will receive an allocation of a n y tokens issued by each
application it powers in return for delivering the core technology and
ecosystem. Developers create modules to add to the service catalogue that
the Centrality Platform provides.

Various DApps plug into t h e Centrality Platform. Each DApp uses the
CENNZ token to purchase modules for their app, create connections to
users, data, content, merchants, and tokens in the ecosystem.

DApps across different use cases work together to acquire users, data,
merchants and content. The use of smart contracts across the Centrality
Platform ensures different companies can trust each-other.

Each DApp is 100% focused on creating i t s own businesses, partnering
and on-boarding users, whilst Centrality Platform focuses on powering the
core technology and design

A Proven Business Model
Centrality has already proven the business model and technology. Within 6 months of being
established, Centrality delivered its platform technology phase 1 and received a stake in more than
10 real applications. These businesses are at varying levels of maturity, with several generating
combined revenue in the multi-million dollar range.
Centrality raised over 40,000 ETH in its pre-sale to continue to expand its network around the world.
13

Centrality has received a non-refundable research grant from the New Zealand Government of up
to $15m over 3 years.

Centrality has also formed strategic development partnerships with top tier blockchain companies
such as SingularDTV and Blockhaus AG.

Centrality in Action
Centrality has been able to connect a range of applications to t h e Centrality Platform that are both
DApp and hybrid using “Blockchain Everywhere” micro services. This solution allows developers
to deliver a wide range of block chain connected use cases that a user would consume on a daily
basis, without having to compromise on the quality of experience nor the application
performance.

These applications are grouped into one of ten ‘Scenes’ with the aim that a consumer will interact with
at least one application in each scene and to create their own group of DApp experiences they can use
to navigate.

14

App Boosting
Different applications on the Centrality Platform can help each other grow by connecting users to
relevant services across the ecosystem. Applications can lower their costs of scaling by sharing from the
marketplace of services, merchants, content and user.

On Demand UI
When applications are developed with the Centrality Software Development KIT ("SDK") on the
Centrality Platform, a user can transition between and transact with different applications or services
seamlessly without needing to download or install another application from the app store, sign-in, or
create a profile.

In the example below, a Belong customer has provided its staff with a discounted ticket to an
event as a reward. Belong has connected with another Centrality powered application, UShare, a
15

decentralized multi-modal, real time, transport application. The app connector tool allows Belong
to offer a ride to the event via UShare.

When the user clicks on this option the full UShare native application is installed on the fly, in less
than 5 seconds in their current app interface and populated with the user's profile, wallet, meta
data from their profile.

The user can now book the ride without having to install from the app store, create a profile, add
payment details or insert the address of their destination.

Belong and UShare both share in the upside of this connection via a smart contract they created.

16

The Centrality Platform’s Existing Marketplace

Skoot is a travel experience marketplace with a virtual companion
designed for inbound visitors and free independent travelers. It uses
patented technology to help users find interesting things to do, drive

Skoot also helps affiliate partners such as rental vehicle and camper hire
companies generate new revenue opportunities as well as improving
operational efficiency with data gathered in-vehicle. The Skoot
marketplace allows traditional tourism operators to streamline their
supply chains and enables a peer to peer market place for individuals
to offer experiences in their spare time.

Centrality owns 50% of Skoot.

Belong is an employee engagement platform and marketplace which
helps businesses provide rewards (or ‘perks’) for employees, including a
non-fiat currency to enable non-salary based incentives. Belong also
has a powerful financial services engine for managing group and
personal insurance plans, claims and entitlements. Belong acts as a
digital brokerage, leveraging its unique employer-provided user
insights to target and sell.

Centrality owns 25% of Belong.

17

UShare is a multi-modal on demand transport application. UShare
works across taxi services, rental vehicles, electric bikes and public
transport. UShare is changing the way ride sharing works by creating
a modern day co-operative between providers and users. As providers
provide services, they earn tokens in the ecosystem creating an
ongoing revenue stream as technology evolves into automated
services.

Centrality owns 25% of UShare.

Merge is a time management system for city dwellers. Simply tell
Merge when you want to leave, or when you want to arrive at your
destination. Set when you’d like to get notified and Merge will let
you know when it’s the best time to go. Merge uses smart technology
and an incentive model to schedule the time users travel to maximize
the throughput of a network.

Merge enables a real-time vehicle insurance model. Centrality owns
100% of Merge.

time demand management and insights to help optimize their business.
On average a venue can save $30,000 per year in costs.

Centrality owns 25% of FeedMi.

SingularX is a distributed cryptocurrency and token trading platform.
SingularX lets users trade crypto assets, make markets and convert
crypto currencies. Because SingularX is not a centralized exchange, it is
resilient to service-disrupting attacks and fraud.

Centrality owns 50% of SingularX.

19

Blockhaus is building the world's leading Blockchain-based financial
investment banking platform for tokenised ecosystems. The Blockhaus
consortium was founded by the people behind the global powerhouses
in global Blockchain, MME and SingularDTV.

Centrality developed the Blockhaus investment banking technology.

Pocketpos is a merchant point of sales aggregator providing access
to run campaigns, offers and vouchers and payments to businesses
and have them redeemed at thousands of retailers and vendors own
point of sales (POS) solutions. This allows users to complete the
purchase loop with cryptocurrencies directly with retailers own POS

The Economic Model
Centrality has partnered with a number of marketplace use cases that will prompt consumers and
brands to transact with and through the Centrality Platform. Through experimentation, Centrality
Platform plans to iterate on the product with applications that create unique three-sided
marketplaces for users, developers and investors. On the supply side, both bots or content creators
will create unique experiences. On the demand side, users will consume these products or services.

acquire users, data,

Centrality turns the traditional funding method on its head. Traditionally when somebody invests
money into a business, that money is used to build technology from scratch. This often results in
duplication of components that already exist elsewhere, making it hard to scale efficiently without a
huge investment.

With the Centrality Platform, the startup’s dollar goes further because it gains access to a network,
lowering the cost of acquisition per user, accelerating growth and providing a better, lower risk return.

The Centrality Platform aims to solve the issues with Schumpeter's hypothesis by ensuring that every
participant in the ecosystem will gain value from their participation.

Centrality Platform will have the discretion to airdrop these to the holders of CENNZ tokens.

The ‘Centrality Effect’ will mean both users and DApps who hold CENNZ tokens share the utility
created by the Centrality Platform. Everyone is incentivized to continue to drive activity to share in the
mutual success.

24

The Scene companies must pay Centrality Platform an access fee denominated in CENNZ tokens to access
the Centrality Platform. In addition, Centrality Platform will earn revenue denominated in CENNZ tokens from
developers who pay to use platform services in their applications. Centrality Platform also shares in the value
of the ecosystem’s token basket by receiving an allocation of each DApp’s native tokens (if they are issued).

Technology Approach
We have created a platform that helps applications become a part of the Blockchain and have wide
spread consumer adoption by building a range of components that overcome multiple hurdles.

The Centrality Platform Modules
Hybrid Consortium Chain
The Ethereum network currently operates on a Proof of Work Blockchain. Future versions of
Ethereum will work to improve throughput and scalability. The current average or block time is
approximately 17 seconds.

The number of daily transactions on the Ethereum network has been growing. Currently, the
number of daily transactions is as high as 1,000,000, with costs over $2 per transaction and wait
times over 2 mins for conformation and this volume is expected to continue increasing as new
applications and users continue to enter the Ethereum ecosystem.

26

The current throughput of Ethereum is approximately 8.5 transactions per second or approximately
740,000 daily transactions. Over time, the Ethereum network can also adjust to higher volume
conditions for additional throughput.

Ethereum transaction confirmation times result in an application experience that mainstream users
are not typically familiar with. Ethereum Blockchain requires fees to be paid for every transaction.
Fees are paid in Ether cryptocurrency, creating an adoption barrier for the average user.

The Centrality Platform has implemented and runs a consortium chain based on Ethereum with
several improvements for better performance and security. The design will (1) reduce latency and
congestion, (2) avoid network fees when creating transactions, and (3) avoid stress on the public
network due to large transaction volumes.

Blockchain Everywhere Microservices
With a complex set of applications across the Centrality ecosystem, not all applications are
comprised 100% of services which are suited to operating in a DApp context. For example, it
wouldn’t be practical to capture, write and process all the data for a real-time ride share matching
service. However, these services need to be able to interact with Blockchain services in order to
form a cohesive application and user experience.

In the Centrality ecosystem, all services have their own private key and public address. They can
interact with the chain (event), store data and retrieve data from the chain. This also provides the
mechanism for secure communication. Data storage will depend on the application’s requirements,
with a bias towards storing in-chain where it makes sense to the user experience and economic
model. This allows developers to build complex services that can transparently interact with pure
Blockchain components.

Token Factory
In order to facilitate the graduation from the Centrality consortium chain into a public chain application
or its own TGE, each application will be encouraged to create a native token when joining the
Centrality Platform. These tokens will be ERC20 compatible, which support the interaction and
standards with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem.

Once an application wishes to enter the main chain, their “pre token” can be exchanged for a new
token if the token owners wish to change the structure of the token.

27

Login with Blockchain
In order to enable users to move seamlessly between DApps within the ecosystem and to carry
their profile data to new interactions, a single user profile is required.

That user’s unique Ethereum address will be the user’s ID throughout the whole ecosystem.

Users will always own their own personal information. When a user signs up, their profile will be
created and stored on the chain via a smart contract. This smart contract address will be given to
the user. When a user wants to access a new DApp they just need to click the onboard button and
the platform will supply the profile address to the new DApp.

DApps always have the latest user information. When a user updates their profile, they only need to
update the information inside the existing smart contract, rather than updating each app
individually.

Login with Blockchain allows users to use their Blockchain profile to connect to non Blockchain
applications.

Hybrid Wallet
The Hybrid Wallet is the portal to the decentralized world. T h e Centrality Platform has developed
a hybrid wallet which operates both as a traditional fiat currency payment wallet and a
cryptocurrency wallet. This wallet can work inside a DApp or traditional platform application,
allowing businesses to transition their user base to Blockchain enabled platforms smoothly.

Checkout, Shopping Cart, Wishboard
Centrality has created a shopping cart and checkout module that allows for a combination of fiat
and cryptocurrency payments including real time conversions. Centrality Platform shopping carts
follow the user between applications. It is the user’s cart, as opposed to belonging to the
application. Any products from any application can be combined into a single shopping cart.

User Onboarding Wizards and User Management Console
Centrality has created modules to allow applications to onboard users and performs user management,
permissions controls and reporting.

Content, Inventory Management and Creation
28

Centrality has created modules to allow the creation, management and publishing of content and
inventory blocks. Attributes can be assigned to these blocks and they can then be combined to
create a wide range of products and offer types. Content, blocks and products can be shared
amongst the different applications.

Big Data and Machine Learning interface
One of the keys to startup success is meaningful data. Currently, all Blockchain data is anonymous
and analysis on the chain is very slow. Centrality’s Big Data engine enables applications to provide
reporting, data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence services to users where these
users have consented to this.

API and SDK
In order to enable users to move between applications instantly, without the need to visit an app
store, we have designed an SDK that allows developers to create applications which interact across
the marketplace. This helps maintain a consistent user experience across the ecosystem for common
components. Platforms are successful when there is a commonly understood user experience. Users
already have a learning curve to understand the way DApps work. Like Apple has shown, providing
a common design language for users across many applications will help Blockchain applications
establish mainstream scale. This React & React Native (Javascript ES6) compliant SDK includes wallet
features (balance, transfer, sign & receive etc), identity and a user profile SDK for getting user’s
profile, authentication, interaction with DApps.

Application Marketplace
Centrality applications will be more successful when they work together to grow the ecosystem.
The application marketplace will allow the creators of different applications to create connections
between each other where there is mutual benefit. For example, a ride hail application may work
with a food ordering application to reach more customers or reduce the cost of delivery.

App Connector Engine
In order to connect different applications together, a flow will need to exist between them. The
Centrality SDK will allow different applications to specify where they want to flow from one
process in their application to a different process inside another application.

Smart Contract Generator
To allow different applications to trust each other in marketplace, Centrality allows different
applications to create commercial relationships with each other via smart contracts. A range of
template contracts will be available or new contracts can be designed and provided to the marketplace
by developers
29

CENNZ Tokens
Overview
Centrality Platform Pte. Limited (referred to hereinafter as the "Issuer") will issue fully-functional ERC20
‘utility’ tokens CENNZ main tokens (the "CENNZ tokens" or "CENNZ") in a smart-contract based TGE.

CENNZ is the native token of the Centrality Platform. CENNZ will be used to help connect
applications built on the Centrality P latform modules, linking the customer information to different
processes. CENNZ is also the fuel for the Centrality ecosystem, used to access the network services,
purchase modules to build applications from and to enter commercial agreements between
application developers assured by smart contracts.

Utility: CENNZ is a utility token in the sense that you need CENNZ to operate many of the

modules/applications in the Centrality ecosystem and to create smart contracts with other
applications.
Recognition payments: DApp ("DApp X") may make transfers of CENNZs to another DApp ("DApp
Y") in recognition for DApp Y originating users onto the Platform which enter into transactions on

DApp X. Access and associated services will be provided to CENNZ holders, and such recognition
payments in CENNZs will be effected, in each case by the automatic execution of smart contracts.

Shared Success: CENNZ holders have the ability to share in the success of each individual DApp

by being allocated the Issuer’s Scene Companies native tokens by air drop on a discretionary
basis. This allows all CENNZ holder to participate in the success of the each DApp in the
ecosystem.

Please see the Centrality Platform Pte. Limited section of this White Paper for further information about
the Issuer.

Implementation and ERC20
CENNZ will be implemented on the public Ethereum Blockchain as an ERC20 token.
The Ethereum Blockchain is currently the industry standard for issuing custom digital assets and
smart contracts. The ERC20 token interface allows for the deployment of a standard token that is
compatible with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem, such as development tools,

30

wallets, and exchanges. Ethereum’s ability to deploy Turing- complete trustless smart contracts
enables complex issuance rules for cryptocurrencies, digital financial contracts, and automated
incentive structures.

Features and Functionalities of the CENNZ tokens
CENNZ tokens will entitle holders to the following rights:
1. the right to access the Centrality Platform, as detailed in the How the Centrality Platform works
section of this White Paper;
2. the right for holders’ decentralized blockchain applications’ (also referred to as DApps) to
access the Centrality Platform and related services, including services provided by other Dapps,
provided that the monthly access fee in CENNZ is paid to the Issuer;
3. the opportunity (but not right or entitlement) to receive an airdrop of the Issuer’s allocation of
the Scene Companies’ own native tokens (the "Scene Tokens") generated in their own future
token generating events if the Issuer exercises its discretion to make an airdrop.

Please note:
(a) CENNZ token holders will have no legal or beneficial ownership of the intellectual property
comprising the Centrality Platform, nor in the shares or other assets of the Issuer. CENNZ tokens
are not designed to be securities and do not constitute, nor are they characterised as, any of the
Singapore Regulated Products.
(b) For the avoidance of doubt, this White Paper, and the information contained in it and any
information accompanying it, are not, and are under no circumstances to be construed as an
offer to sell or issue, or a solicitation of an offer to purchase or subscribe for, any Scene Tokens.

CENNZ tokens are also subject to the selling restrictions described more specifically in the ‘Important
Information’ section in the beginning of this White Paper, including:
1. that no person who subscribes for CENNZ tokens in the TGE will sell, dispose or otherwise
distribute CENNZ tokens prior to the Release Date, except in the circumstances described in
the section “Wholesale Investor warranties and selling restrictions”; and
2. that no person who subscribes for CENNZ tokens in the TGE will sell, dispose or otherwise
distribute CENNZ tokens to any person who is not a wholesale investor within the meaning of
clause 3(2) of schedule 1 of the FMC Act.
In the TGE subscription agreement, each applicant for CENNZ tokens indemnifies the Centrality Entities
for any loss, cost, liability or expense sustained or incurred by the Centrality Entities as a result of the
breach by it of these selling restrictions.

Overview of the TGE
31

The Issuer will undertake a TGE to sell circa 840,000,000 CENNZ main tokens to qualifying wholesale
purchasers. This number represents 70% of the total supply of CENNZ tokens of circa 1.2 billion.

To purchase CENNZ tokens in the TGE, an applicant must enter into a subscription agreement and
meet the eligibility criteria which includes KYC/AML compliance.

The TGE will commence on 15 January 2018 and end on 15 February 2018, subject to any variation or
extension granted by the Issuer in its sole and absolute discretion.

The proceeds of the TGE will be used to finance the ongoing development and maintenance of the
Centrality Platform and associated services. The timing and volumes of CENNZ tokens sold in
the TGE during the TGE period will be determined by the Issuer in view of prevailing market
dynamics. At the conclusion of the T G E , the 840,000,000 distributed CENNZ will constitute the
entirety of the available liquid supply post lockdown date.

The aim of the TGE is to raise the equivalent of USD $100 million for application in accordance with the
following forecast schedule:

CENNZ Token Allocations in the TGE
In addition to the CENNZ tokens issued to wholesale purchasers, described in this section of this White
Paper, a further approximately 240 million CENNZ will be issued to Centrality Investments as
consideration for the arrangement with Centrality Platform Pte. Limited in respect of the intellectual
property comprised in the Centrality Platform made on an arm’s length basis. Centrality Investments
will not be able to sell or otherwise deal with its CENNZ tokens until after the second anniversary date
of the Release Date.

An additional circa 60 million CENNZ has been allocated to developers to ensure that they have a
personal incentive to grow the platform moving forward.

The remaining circa 60 million CENNZ will be retained by the Issuer (Centrality Platform Pte. Limited)
and released slowly to fund growth of the Centrality ecosystem strategically by supporting the
following four broad purposes:
1. Operational costs, infrastructure, developers
2. Sourcing and funding revolutionary start-ups and participants that will enhance the
Centrality Platform and ecosystem for all participants. (Note that holders of CENNZ tokens will
not have any ownership stake in the businesses acquired.)
3. Supporting and growing the Blockchain and Centrality developer community
4. Marketing and PR for the Centrality platform

Lock-down on CENNZ trading post-issue
There will be a minimum 6 week lockdown where CENNZ holders cannot trade CENNZ tokens
post issue.
Centrality Investments Limited and the platform developers that receive allocations described in
Implementation and ERC20 Section will be subject to a 24 month lockdown period.
Following t h e lockdown period, Centrality Platform Pte. Limited will limit its supply of CENNZ to
the market at a set rate e.g. 6,000,000 CENNZ or 10% of the total supply per month.

Risks summary
The key risks summarized in this section are not intended to be an exhaustive list of the risks that may
apply to you as a purchaser or holder of CENNZ tokens. You should read these key risks and consider
whether you are willing to assume such risks before you agree to subscribe for CENNZ tokens.

33

No assurance of returns or benefits: There can be no assurance that CENNZ tokens holders will be able

to receive a return of their capital or any returns or benefits. Any purchase of CENNZ tokens should
therefore only be considered by persons who can afford a loss of their entire investment or holdings in
the CENNZ tokens.

Market risk: The value of cryptocurrencies, can go down as well as up. The emergence of a new business

model can create opportunities for users and investors, but any young market carries significant risks for
all of its participants. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors
may not recover the full amount invested.

Regulatory risk: Regulation of digital tokens (including the CENNZ tokens) and token offerings such as

this, cryptocurrencies (including Ether), blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges are
relatively undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve, and vary significantly among various jurisdictions and
are subject to significant uncertainty.

New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations may adversely
impact the liquidity and market price of CENNZ tokens, your ability to access marketplaces on which to
trade CENNZ tokens, the Issuer’s or the Centrality Entities’ ability to operate as an ongoing concern and
the structure, rights and transferability of CENNZ tokens. The ability of a holder to access, use, transfer
and exchange its (or his or her) CENNZ tokens may be affected by changes to legislation, regulatory
guidance or actions, and judicial decisions in Singapore and in other countries. Therefore, there can be
no assurance that any new or continuing regulatory scrutiny or initiatives will not have an adverse impact
on the value of CENNZ tokens and otherwise impede the Issuer’s or the Centrality Entities’ activities.

No regulatory protection: The Issuer is not licensed or approved by the Monetary Authority of Singapore

nor the International Enterprise Singapore, and currently there is no intention for the Issuer to apply for
any financial services license or regulatory approval under the laws and regulations of Singapore. In
addition, the CENNZ tokens do not constitute, and are not characterised as, any of the Singapore
Regulated Products. Therefore, CENNZ tokens holders will not be able to invoke or avail themselves of
any regulatory protection or remedies applicable in respect of such Singapore Regulated Products under
the laws and regulations of Singapore, in relation to their purchase, holding or trading of CENNZ tokens.

Legal risk: There is little or no precedent on how existing law might treat the issue, fungibility, settlement

finality, transfer, collateralization, sequestration, loan, hypothecation, redemption or other disposition of
CENNZ tokens. There is also little or no precedent on how existing law might treat the rights and
obligations between and among the Issuer and the CENNZ token subscribers or holders. The occurrence
of any related issue or dispute could have a material adverse effect on the Centrality Platform, the
Centrality Entities, the Issuer’s business and/or the CENNZ tokens. New developments in the law and
regulations may also adversely affect the legal or regulatory treatment of the CENNZ tokens or the
34

Centrality Platform and/or the Issuer’s or the Centrality Entities’ businesses.

Tax risk: The tax characterization of CENNZ tokens is uncertain and a subscriber should consult its own

tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of their acquisition, holding or disposal of CENNZ tokens.
An investment in CENNZ tokens may result in adverse tax consequences to subscribers. Each potential
subscriber should consult with and must rely upon the advice of its own tax advisor with respect to the
tax consequences whether of Singapore or elsewhere of an investment in CENNZ tokens.

Issuer risk: The Issuer was incorporated on 4 January 2018 and has not commenced operations. The

Issuer is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business.

Lack of voting and liquidation rights: CENNZ tokens do not carry any voting, management or control

rights or other management or control rights in the Issuer. Accordingly, the shareholder of the Issuer will
control decisions of the Issuer, including any significant corporate transactions, or the election to liquidate
or dissolve the Issuer. In addition, upon a liquidation, bankruptcy or other dissolution of the Issuer,
CENNZ token holders will highly likely not be entitled to liquidation rights or other claims.

Key Person risk: Whilst Centrality Investments Limited and Centrality Platform Pte. Limited takes an

active role to managing key man risk through training, systemization, and succession planning there is
still a risk that loss of a key team member could cause delays to CENNZ platform development and
thus having a detrimental effect on price of CENNZ tokens.

Technology and Coding risk: Blockchain and smart contract technology is still in an early development

stage and its application of experimental nature which carries significant operational and technological
risks. It is possible that the TGE smart contract system or the early contribution smart contract system, or
elements of the Centrality Platform, could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs which could cause,
inter alia, the complete loss of the holder’s utility and/or the value of the CENNZ tokens by impacting
the operation and functionality of the Centrality Platform. Outside actors may exploit such errors or
vulnerabilities for personal gain or the Centrality Platform may be affected in any event without such
action.

Platform risk: While the Issuer and Centrality Investments are procuring the development of the Centrality

Platform, there is no assurance that the Centrality Platform will be designed or completed in the manner
described in this Whitepaper and if Centrality Platform is completed, there is no assurance as to the
continued operation and functioning of the Centrality Platform. The Platform is subject to change and no
representation is given that the any function or aspect of the Centrality Platform will continue to be
provided or made available at any time

35

Trading/Valuation risk: As a utility token, the inherent value of CENNZ tokens is derived from the

successful operation of the Centrality Platform. CENNZ tokens are not pegged to any fiat currency (legal
tender backed by a sovereign government) nor any cryptocurrency, and the exchange value from timeto-time given to CENNZ tokens on third-party exchanges may not always reflect your intrinsic valuation
of the CENNZ tokens. The risk of loss when purchasing or disposing of CENNZ tokens could be
substantial and losses may compound quickly (including up to total loss). As a token built on top of the
Ethereum network, the value of CENNZ tokens may be affected by the valuation from time-to-time of
Ether against fiat currencies and other cryptocurrencies.

Illiquidity risk: No CENNZ tokens will be issued after the TGE, although the reserves held by the Issuer

and the CENNZ tokens held by Centrality Investments will be released over time to the market. Should
you wish to temporarily, permanently or partially exit the Centrality Platform ecosystem, you may be
unable to liquidate your position by exchanging CENNZ tokens for fiat currency or cryptocurrency as
there may not be a willing buyer for your CENNZ tokens both in terms of price and volume. Holders have
no right to redeem or sell their CENNZ tokens. Although Centrality intend to list the CENNZ tokens on
several cryptocurrency exchanges, there can be no assurance that such exchanges will accept the listing
of CENNZ tokens or maintain the listing if it is accepted. There can be no assurance that a secondary
market will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the holders with liquidity
of investment or that it will continue for the life of the CENNZ tokens. There is also no guarantee from
any central bank or centralized authority for CENNZ tokens that ensures you will be able to redeem your
CENNZ tokens for fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the digital token market is a new and
rapidly developing market which may be subject to substantial and unpredictable disruptions that cause
significant volatility in the prices of digital tokens. There is no assurance that the market, if any, for the
CENNZ tokens will be free from such disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect a
CENNZ tokenholder’s ability to sell its CENNZ tokens.

Network risk: CENNZ tokens are ERC20 compliant tokens built on top of the Ethereum network, a

decentralized network containing, among other things, both cryptocurrency and smart contract
protocols. Neither Centrality Investments, the Issuer nor any their associated entities have control over
the Ethereum network, including confirmations of transactions and execution of smart contracts on the
network. Should the Ethereum network experience temporary or permanent issues, including network
slowdowns or transaction confirmation delays, this is likely to affect the ability of CENNZ holders to freely
use CENNZ tokens within the Centrality ecosystem and could impair the usability of the Centrality
Platform generally.

Cyber security risk: The nature of CENNZ tokens and the Ethereum network may lead to an increased

risk of fraud or cyber attack and may mean that technological difficulties experienced by the developers
and users of the Centrality Platform ecosystem could prevent access to or use of your CENNZ tokens.
For example, it is possible that an unauthorised third party could exploit a coding vulnerability in the
Centrality Platform code and damage, interrupt or otherwise attack it.

36

Private Key risk: Extreme caution must be taken whenever selecting, storing or transmitting private keys

for CENNZ tokens. You are responsible for the storage of your CENNZ tokens. If another person obtains
access to your private keys, they can steal your CENNZ tokens or other cryptocurrency you use to
purchase CENNZ tokens. Furthermore, if you lose access to your private keys, neither Centrality
Investments, the Issuer, nor any other entity, will be able to recover your lost CENNZ tokens or
cryptocurrency. If you hold CENNZ tokens on a cryptocurrency exchange, the private keys to those
CENNZ tokens is held by that exchange. Should that exchange be hacked or otherwise compromised,
your CENNZ tokens may be stolen or otherwise become inaccessible. We strongly recommend that you
store your CENNZ tokens privately (and not via exchanges) and use cold storage techniques to better
secure your CENNZ tokens.

Wallet risk: In addition to the private key risk described above, you should store your CENNZ tokens in

an ERC20 compliant hardware or software wallet. Should you attempt to send CENNZ tokens to a wallet
type that does not support CENNZ tokens, your CENNZ tokens may be lost forever.

Broker, dealer or exchange insolvency risk: There is risk that brokers, dealers, exchanges or wallets could

become insolvent or otherwise become insecure. There may be practical or timing problems associated
with enforcing the rights to assets in the case of an insolvency or security disruption of any such party.

Financial risk: If the solvency of the Issuer and/or any of the Centrality Entities is impaired, the ongoing

viability of the Centrality Platform and the utility and value of the CENNZ tokens may be impaired.

General risks:

The growth of the blockchain industry in general, as well as the blockchain networks on which the Issuer
rely, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The performance of the Centrality Platform is subject to
the following uncertainties, among others:
(i)

worldwide growth in the adoption and use of BTC, ETH and other blockchain technologies;

(ii)

government and quasi-government regulation of BTC, ETH and other blockchain assets and
their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain networks
or similar systems;

(iii)

the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the BTC or ETH
networks;

(iv)

changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;

(v)

the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and
services, or trading assets including new means of using fiat currencies or existing networks;

(vi)

general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies
and digital tokens;

37

(vii)

hacking and theft of cryptocurrencies and digital tokens; and

(viii)

popularity or acceptance of the BTC or ETH networks and the emergence of new
cryptocurrencies, digital tokens and blockchain networks.

The price of Bitcoin, Ether, digital tokens and other blockchain assets are subject to dramatic fluctuations.
Several factors may affect price, including, but not limited to:
(i)

global blockchain asset supply;

(ii)

global blockchain asset demand, which can be influenced by the growth of retail merchants’
and commercial businesses’ acceptance of blockchain assets like cryptocurrencies as
payment for goods and services, the security of online blockchain asset exchanges and
digital wallets that hold blockchain assets, the perception that the use and holding of
blockchain assets is safe and secure, and the regulatory restrictions or prohibitions on their
use;

(iii)

investors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;

(iv)

changes in the software, software requirements or hardware requirements underlying a
blockchain network;

(v)

changes in the rights, obligations, incentives, or rewards for the various participants in a
blockchain network;

(vi)

currency exchange rates, including the rates at which Ether and Bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies or digital tokens may be exchanged for fiat currencies;

(vii)

fiat currency withdrawal and deposit policies of blockchain asset exchanges and liquidity on
such exchanges;

(viii)

interruptions in service from or failures of major blockchain asset exchanges;

(ix)

investment and trading activities of large investors, including private and registered funds,
that may directly or indirectly invest in blockchain assets;

(x)

monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations;

(xi)

regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of blockchain assets;

(xii)

the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the Bitcoin or
Ethereum networks;

(xiii)

global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; and

(xiv)

expectations among blockchain participants that the value of blockchain assets will soon
change.

Blockchain networks are based on software protocols that govern the peer-to-peer interactions between
computers connected to these networks. The suitability of the networks for the Issuer’s or other Centrality
Entities’ business or the functionality of the CENNZ token depends upon a variety of factors, including:
(i)

the effectiveness of the informal groups of (often uncompensated) developers contributing
to the protocols that underlie the networks;

(ii)

effectiveness of the network validators and the network’s consensus mechanisms to
38

effectively secure the networks against confirmation of invalid transactions;
(iii)

disputes among the developers or validators of the networks;

(iv)

changes in the consensus or validation schemes that underlie the networks, including shifts
between so-called “proof of work” and “proof of stake” schemes;

(v)

the failure of cyber security controls or security breaches of the networks whether on the
Centrality Platform or technological assets, or your / third party network or devices, and the
associated risks of legal action or actions of regulators relating to loss of data, damage to
data / devices, threat or compromise to privacy and data protection, and the occurrence of
fraud or harm;

(vi)

the existence of other competing and operational versions of the networks, including without
limitation so-called “forked” networks;

(vii)

the existence of undiscovered technical flaws in the networks;

(viii)

the development of new or existing hardware or software tools or mechanisms that could
negatively impact the functionality of the systems;

(ix)

the price of blockchain assets associated with the networks;

(x)

intellectual property rights-based or other claims against the networks’ participants and risks
associated with such legal claims (including but not limited to the risk that the operation of
the Centrality Platform is disrupted by such claims including claims for remedies such as
injunctions); and

(xi)

the maturity of the computer software programming languages used in connection with the
networks.

Unfavorable developments or characteristics of any of the above circumstances could adversely affect
the Issuer’s or other Centrality Entities’ business, the Centrality Platform or the proper functioning of the
CENNZ tokens.

The foregoing risks do not purport to be a complete list and explanation of all the risks involved in
acquiring a CENNZ token. Potential subscribers are urged to consult their advisors before making a
determination whether to invest in CENNZ tokens.

39

Business Plan
Centrality already has an existing business with a strong team and a number of DApps preparing to
launch tokens, hence the acceleration of this model can occur very quickly.
The token raise will be used primarily in 3 ways
1. To improve and develop new platform services for applications to consume
2. To establish other venture studio locations in target markets and build reference applications
for developers along with acquiring users for the ecosystem
3. To invest in technology or user acquisition to help the platform advance and the user base
grow.

Development goals
Our vision is to grow an open ecosystem of digital services that consumers can easily explore and find
value in while giving developers an open and sustainable platform to develop, deliver, and enhance
those services and attract users.

To achieve this vision, Centrality Platform will direct and fund the development of tools that give
ecosystem partners the ability to build, grow, and create value for one another. As part of this process,
Centrality Platform will make its own codebase available as an open-source project that can be
leveraged to power new communities and add capabilities to existing ones. Centrality Platform
will further this work by engaging development teams to continue improving the technology suite
supporting the Centrality e cosystem, and it will maintain an open source codebase for the benefit
of ecosystem participants.

Centrality Platform will also promote DApp services. Such an approach demonstrates the power
and promise of a decentralization strategy, which provides a path to transition from a competitive
model to a co-operative one, where all participants benefit from their collective success.

Conclusion
The Centrality ecosystem is already a fully functional and integrated native DApp ecosystem
supporting real operating businesses. The TGE will allow us to scale this quickly to help the wider
blockchain ecosystem reach mainstream users and use cases. Centrality Platform will help repair the
current startup economy and create a more equal world for all participants.

With t h e Centrality Platform model, the Blockchain development ecosystem can grow quickly to
support everyday use cases. Entrepreneurs can get to market quicker, with a higher chance of
success. Applications can work together to gain scale which will challenge incumbent platforms.

42

Users, investors and developers can all share in the value the ecosystem creates, defining a new kind
of shared value economy that can overcome the extreme centralization happening in the broader
technology ecosystem.
