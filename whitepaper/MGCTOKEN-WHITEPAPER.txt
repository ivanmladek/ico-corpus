Abstract
Since the development of the blockchain, it has been the most promising and imaginative
technological revolution in the world.The blockchain is a decentralized,de-trusted network
that can achieve peer-to-peer value exchange, which is called the value Internet.
The decentralized concept of the blockchain is gradually overthrowing the traditional
monetary concept, and it has exerted great influence in the world within a short time.
More people accept the digital economy era brought by the blockchain. However, the
circulation of value and the storage of digital assets in the current block chains have
become a huge demand. As an innovative storage payment service platform, MGC Token
will also become the leader in the era of encrypted digital economy.
MGC Token is a global general digital asset storage platform. Users can use other
encrypted digital assets for transactions. MGC Token provides the users with a secure
storage environment for encrypted digital assets, supports the encrypted currency
management of various blockchain underlying technologies, and provides a more
convenient payment experience. With the help of blockchain technology, the landing
ecosystem will continue to create a service platform in the field of full revenue for
customers.
MGC Token will launch online ATS Smart Financing Service, and issue its own encrypted
token on the MGC Token platform at the same time. As a reward, MGC will encourage
more users to promote the development of MGC Token, and make each participant to
become a sponsor of this platform. MGC Token will be the driving shares for all the
participants,MGC will act as a token for MGC token platform at the early stage, and can
achieve online and offline payment of landing scenes, then later link merchants from all
walks of life around the world to realize the value of token token. At the same time, MGC
tokens are constantly increasing in value, and continue to bring real returns to the owners
of MGC tokens. The future of encrypted currency is not only investment and trading, but
also ultimately serving consumers in all walks of life. This is an unprecedented change. We
believe that MGC Token will become an indispensable key presence in this link.
MGC Token has already started to take action. We use blockchain to pioneer a
combination of the hottest payment areas in the market and incorporate into the
advantages of MGC tokens. MGC Token serves as an intermediary platform for providing
the customers with the required consumer’s protection for online trade, and the
4

platform gathers traffic to provide millions of merchants with consumption group, we
hope to further optimize the advantages of encrypted currency, such as fast transaction,
low cost and cross-border transaction resistance, allowing the merchants to make
transaction with the growing holders of encrypted currency from all over the world. Our
goal is to create an integrated payment application interface (API) for the market and be
able to become the leader in the encryption payment industry, the content as mentioned
above make MGC Token turn into the future trend, it will not only launch a precedent of
encryption payment industry, but also build a one-station service for user’s asset
management.
However, our goal is much more than that. We believe that one of the key functions of
encrypted currency in the digital age is to promote transactions and to be widely
accepted as a non-friction and secure payment method. We believe that the current
payment platform lacks the necessary functions to promote the application and use of the
majority of merchants and consumers. Digital token is not only an asset of financial
investment, the issuance of blockchain token can flexibly provide funds for product
development team to create an innovative and practical platform. It will will be driven by
the growth of goods and services, and it can maintain the operation depending on the
revenue of fair expenses.
In the current blockchain technology, the processing capacity of blockchain is mainly
limited by the performance of consensus algorithm, and the performance of consensus
algorithm is also limited by the scale of system nodes and the processing capacity of
single node. Under the current technical level, it is very limited for the space of optimizing
and upgrading the performance for single block chain, and there are performance limits,
which seriously restricts the application of distributed ledger technology in large-scale,
high concurrency, low latency transaction business scenarios. Taking BTC as an example,
high transfer fees and extremely slow speed are major drawbacks. The slow transfer speed
is unbearable, and the high handling fees make small transactions inexpensive and
unfeasible. It can be predicted that with the rapid development of the digital economy,
the frequency and scale of future transactions will far beyond the current level. The
bottleneck of performance is one of the most important problems to be solved in
distributed ledger technology.
In the payment area, with the increase of the heat of digital currency and the application
of currency, the demand for payment has been increasing. Lightning network and thunder
network technology should be born. However, the design of lightning network and

5

thunder

network is complicated, the technology landing is difficult, the development

cycle is long, and the actual application time and effect of landing in the future are
unknown.
In 2018, with the upgrading of block chain technology and the rise of digital economy,
MGC Token provides a safe, efficient and simple storage environment for a variety of
digital assets, and introduces ATS digital assets financing services, as well as platform
support for construction of digital assets exchange, trading, digital assets payment and
settlement system,etc.
With the digital assets continuously accepted by the public and the huge increase in
demand, MGC Token will continue to update its technology and services iteratively, which
will officially unveil the prelude of digital assets 3.0 era after experiencing the tide of
digital assets 1.0 era and 2.0 era. MGC Token provides a secure storage environment for
digital assets with

multi-functional wallets and fast services

for multi-currency

management. MGC Token provides ATS smart financing service for digital assets, bringing
daily stable profits to the users, strategic planning of landing ecology, and circulation of
MGC token. MGC Token will become a multi-functional comprehensive service platform
for digital assets.
In the era of blockchain digital economy, all the tokens firstly require to produce the value
of internal circulation, and then the values produced by landing applications. MGC Token
combined with the value of digital circulation and landing application, will surely usher in
the next big trend ——the arrival of communication value + token economy. As the
platform token, MGC will be used as a barrier-free token on the MGC Token platform,
connect online and offline merchants in all walks of life and achieve landing application. It
not only helps the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, but also
leverages the Internet economy and promotes the development of real economy.
MGC Token, a digital asset comprehensive service platform that integrates digital asset
storage management, smart financing management and landing payment ecology, will
continue to develop, create and serve entire field of human life under the support of
underlying technology of blockchain.
Under such big background, the MGC Token platform initiated by AONE, UK, came into
being at the historic moment. Combining the most popular block chain technology in the
world with its

offline powerful background, it is devoted to change the current
6

environment of global payment. Digitalization of assets has become the trend of
development in the future. Traditional payment methods are incompatible with today's
high-speed information development. The transfer of cross-border takes several days to
confirm. The currencies must be converted into local legal currencies for outbound
tourism, and extreme non-transparency of transaction have all become a difficult problem
under the current global integration.
The introduction of MGC Token enables users to transfer remittances in a timely manner
worldwide, and the transfer for cross-countries and cross-borders can be realized by such
payment network. With the automatic conversion of exchange rate on the platform, the
confirmation of transaction can be completed in a few seconds without any transaction
cost. Moreover, the rise of MGC make it more convenient to consume during traveling
abroad, consumers can use MGC Token scanning to transfer money freely, while reducing
handling cost between consumers and merchants. The de-centralized payment of MGC
Token is a close combination of cash-free, card-free transaction and digital assets, and
creates an unlimited payment platform.
MGC Token is committed to serving the global payment scenario for portals through
blockchain technology innovation, and is actively expanding its global business with new
business models and value returns.
MGC Token has a strong R&D team of block chain technology, and has four experts from
the world's top blockchain field. The token will be issued by MGC Token called as (MGC
Coin, hereinafter referred to as “MGC”, “Token”). After issuance, it will not only run in
MGC Token's own system, but also be online and freely traded on the world's major
encrypted currency exchanges. At the same time, it will create the preferred online
landing ecological payment.

1 Market analysis and background introduction
1.1 Market environment
Since 2010, the transaction scale of the third-party payment market has maintained an
average annual growth rate of more than 50%. The mobile payment transaction scale in
2016 is 38.6 trillion yuan, and the third-party payment data is expected to reach 200
trillion yuan by the end of 2017. Capgemini released the "Global Payment Report 2017".
The global non-cash transaction volume increased by 11.2% in 2014-2015, which is the
fastest growth over the past decade, and fastest rate of increase is mainly driven by the
developing market. In 2015, non-cash transactions in developing countries grew by 21.6%,
while those in developed countries grew by only 6.8%. Among the top 10 countries with
the highest volume of non-cash transactions, China climbed to the third place, with 38.1
billion non-cash transactions in 2015.
Although digital payments are becoming more popular,cash remains the mainstream,
especially in the aspect of small amount of transaction. In addition to the scale of
transaction,the use of cash is closely related to age. According to the “Digitalization,
Trade and Development Report” issued by the U.N conference on Trade and
Development, the amount paid by credit card and debt card in 2014 accounts for more
than half of all payments in E-commerce industry. In China, Information Office of the State
Council held a press conference on the development of industrial telecommunications
industry in 2017 on January,30,2018, and the released data showed that Chinese Ecommerce, mobile payment, sharing economy led the world, especially the volume of
transaction by mobile payment was closer to 150 trillion RMB, which ranked the first place
in the world.
In addition, with the promotion of "block chain technology", asset digitization will become
an important topic in the future. Under the

blooming market environment of the

encrypted currency, encrypted currency is not widely used in the current offline trading
scenario. With the increasing popularity of the use and concept of encrypted currency, it is
believed that in the near future, encrypted currency will also be integrated into our daily
life and consumption.
What MGC Token wants to do is to create a new digital ecological chain of global
payment + currency storage. MGC Token will also gradually establish a global point-to-

8

point payment network to provide digital currency storage and other digital currency
exchange services; users can collect and pay through MGC Token without any fees, and
make the value currency MGC of global smart payment circulate. It will become the
mainstream intelligent P payment digital currency in the world, take block chain
technology as the core carrier, and landing token as the basic development strategy,
leading the new global payment model.

1.2 Opportunities and challenges of digital assets industry
Throughout the historical evolution of the development of human currency, from the
exchange between barters, to the shell, metal, paper money as currencies, and then due
to the development of market trade, electronic currency with bank cards as carrier began
to emerge. With the advent of the Internet and the development of E-commerce, PayPal,
Alipay and WeChat have come into being. When people are immersed in the convenient
enjoyment of online payment, the birth of block chain technology has broken the silence
again, and digital assets have arrived.
From the history of currency development, we can see clearly that in order to cope with
the increasing volume of transactions, our payment methods are constantly breaking the
limitations of time and space, human demand is endless, digitalization has become an
inevitable trend. Just like electronic money has made banks, Alipay and other service
providers, the rise of digital assets has also brought a lot of development opportunities,
such as providing a secure, simple and efficient storage environment for digital assets,
digital asset smart financing service, digital asset conversion, trading, digital assets
payment and settlement system construction, etc., and the digital asset industry urgently
needs to build a strong infrastructure.
However, at present, digital assets are still facing some related problems, such as storage
security, operation complexity, high handling fees and narrow channels for asset valueadded financing. The market vacancy in the digital assets industry is both a challenge and
an opportunity.

Innovation of Blockchain 3.0 era

1.3 Development history of blockchain
1.3.1 Blockchain 1.0-Bitcoin
The concept of BitCoin was originally proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. It is based
on the idea of Satoshi Nakamoto to to design and publish open source software and build
its P2P network. Point-to-point transmission means a decentralized payment system.
With the first batch of Bitcoin excavated by Satoshi Nakamoto, it marks the arrival of the
era of blockchain 1.0. The digital currency represented by Bitcoin and Litecoin has been
endowed with the function of currency. For the first time, the digital currency has been
linked with real things, making the digital currency a truly valuable currency. Block Chain
1.0 is mainly composed of digital currency and payment behavior. It mainly has the
function of de-centralized digital currency and payment platform and its goal is to decentralize.
What are the disadvantages and imperfections of block chain 1.0 represented by Bitcoin?
The size of Bitcoin 1M blocks leads to a slower and slower transfer speed when the
transaction frequency is getting higher and higher and people need more and more. This
problem can be solved by expansion, so Bitcoin cash came out later. Only satisfying the
transaction and payment function of digital currency makes the application not be widely
used in our daily life. The benefits to our daily life are very limited, but it also gives the
opportunity for technological iteration.

10

1.3.2 Blockchain 2.0-Smart contract
Blockchain 2.0 is the development and application of smart contract represented by
Ethereum and XRP in the financial sector, the smart contract can automate simple
transactions for the financial industry, it has the features of high efficiency and
transparency, which makes new changes in the financial industry. It can said that
Ethereum has set off the wave of Blockchain 2.0. The 2.0 era represented by Ethereum has
derived many blockchain application beyond the currency by adding smart contract
technology,i.e, the Ethereum has established a programmable and turing complete
blockchain. In simple words, it allows anyone to build and run decentralized applications
through blockchain technology. The smart contract technology of 2.0 era is more
convenient and smart to achieve the scenarios in the real life of users.
At this stage, due to the limitations of the scale of participation and the field to which the
application belongs, the elements of the Blockchain 2.0 era have the following
characteristics: mainly focusing on specific objects (such as the parties to the contract),
and the transactions are mainly based on specific assets (such as the ownership or other
interests of real estate, intellectual property), and the scope of transaction has relative
limitation, low frequency and narrow area.

1.3.3 Blockchain 3.0——Token economy
The digital economy of token will ultimately serves landing industries. Blockchain 3.0 era,
rise of token, “token economy” are the changes in the production relationship brought
about by the development of productive forces. The blockchain technology has moved
from the financial sector to the token economy and begun to land applications.
One of the value core of the block chain is Token, which is a kind of value certificate. The
token economy is the value carrier of the value internet. There are many kinds of value
carriers, such as currency type, application type and equity type. The greater the
contribution made in the system of token economy, the more the tokens will be obtained ;
The better the collaboration can be made, the higher the intrinsic value of the circulation
they have. By means of economic incentives, every person and role in the whole
ecological circle should participate in cooperation and maintenance spontaneously. As an
incentive medium for large-scale group collaboration, the token can greatly mobilize the
enthusiasm and creativity of community participants, fully stimulate the vitality of the
economy, and greatly promote economic growth.
11

Arrival of MGC token

1.3.4 Meaning of token
Digital rights and interests prove that the token must be a certificate of rights and
interests existing in digital form. It must represent a right, an inherent and intrinsic value.
Encrypted Token,i.e, the authenticity of the token, tamper-proof modification, privacy
protection and other capabilities are guaranteed by cryptography and computing power.
Each token is a right protected by cryptography, which is more reliable than the
protection provided by any law or authority. (Token) can be circulated, i.e, the token must
be written into the block, and with the maturity of the Internet distributed technology in
the 21st century, the token can be thoroughly circulated in the network. It can be verified,
traded and converted (token) at any time and anywhere. In fact, the token can realize the
proof of rights and interests, and all the proof of rights and interests of human society,
which can be represented by the token.

1.4 Token economy is the digital economy of innovative Internet
Token economy not only can promote value exchange, but also can strengthen the
supervision and management, it is a major reform of market economy. In essence, the
token economy redefines the market economy with future information infrastructure such
as cryptography and supercomputer opened by cross-border open source.n this way, the
most important thing in the future will be the token. Blockchain will be the best
technology to support the operation of the token. Blockchain provides the token with a
solid foundation of trust. Both of them have been forged together and become the
important foundation of the future digital economy. Since the birth of BTC, the first
12

encrypted digital currency of mankind, has achieved a qualitative leap, which is accepted
by the human economic world. At the same time, it allows us to see the future of the next
generation of Internet digital economy, i.e (Token). For example, at this stage, the Internet
wallet will store our legal currency assets in various bank accounts, and realize efficient
and convenient online storage and payment, as well as settlement, to support the storage
and transaction of various "Token", and the payment of personal digital assets smart
wallet will play a vital role in the next generation of Internet digital economy.

1.5 Main problems of market economy
Every year, consumption between consumers and merchants is expected to reach $22
trillion, with the wealth benefits of global economic integration and annual GDP growth.
Traditional payment market will face many problems and development bottlenecks.
Generally speaking, it can be observed that the traditional payment mode is extremely
inefficient and the transaction transparency is low.
Bottleneck1: The painful points in cross-border payment are the long period of arrival,
high cost and low transaction transparency. Take the third-party payment company as the
center, complete the accounting, settlement and liquidation in the payment process. The
arrival period is long. For example, the arrival period of cross-border payment is more
than three days, and the cost is high. For example, PayPal, the transaction fee rate of
common cross-border payment is 4.4%+0.3 US dollars, the withdrawn of cash is in China
and account transferred into by US dollars, 35 US dollars in a single transaction, and 1.2%
in RMB.
Bottleneck2: The pain points in financial sector of supply chain lies in the long financing
cycle and high cost. Focusing on the core enterprise system of the supply chain, it is
difficult for third-party credit agencies to identify the authenticity of various relevant
documents in the supply chain, resulting in long manual audits and high financing costs.
Bottleneck3: The pain points in the acceptance market lie in three risky issues.
Operational risk: Due to centralization of the system, once the central server fails, the
whole market will be paralyzed. Market risk: According to statistics, in 2016, there are
seven risk events involving more than hundreds of millions of dollars, involving many
banks; moral hazard: there are events such as "one ticket with more sales" and false
commercial bills of exchange in the market.

13

Bottleneck4: The business pain point in the asset securitization is that the underlying
assets can not be guaranteed true or false; many participants, low transparency of
operation links, low information asymmetry and other issues, which make it difficult to
control the risk.The pain points of data lies in the inefficiency of circulation among
participants, the large amount of manpower and material resources needed for fund
clearing and reconciliation among trading systems, the various channels of asset
repayment online and offline, the inability to monitor the real situation of assets, and the
trust of institutions in the transaction chain on the authenticity and accuracy of underlying
asset data after the formation of asset packages.

1.6 Mission and prospect of MGC Token
MGC Token's mission is to build the strongest and powerful infrastructure in the digital
asset industry, provide the best quality, safe, convenient and efficient services for digital
asset enthusiasts, popularize the application of block chain technology in all walks of life,

2 Introduction of MGC Token
MGC Token is a multi-functional payment wallet based on blockchain technology. It is
also a decentralized trading platform. It has zero handling fee without borders,
mainstream virtual money storage platform and electronic wallet scanning payment. It is a
multi-functional decentralized payment tool, which will facilitate the sharing and service
between global online payment merchants and consumers. MGC Token is a new form of
global payment based on blockchain and smart contract based on point-to-point network
technology.

2.1 Brief introduction of platform
MGC Token is a comprehensive service platform for digital assets, which integrates digital
assets one-stop secure storage management service, smart financing management and
payment ecology. As a comprehensive service platform for digital assets, MGC Token
provides a safe environment for millions of coins to store digital assets, and opens up
smart profit income at zero risk, bringing steady profits for millions of coins. After
experiencing the blockchain 1.0 and 2.0 era, the block chain will enter the 3.0 era, i.e, age
of token economy.The digital economy will eventually realize the intrinsic value of
transmission, circulation and landing applications. MGC Token lays a strong foundation
for the arrival of the token economy through the layout of the comprehensive service
platform of digital assets.

2.2 Ecosystem of MGC Token
As a comprehensive service platform for digital assets, MGC Token includes three
functional modules: ATS digital assets smart financing , smart financing treasury and the
payment ecosystem of token economy.

2.2.1 MGC smart mobile wallet
MGC smart mobile wallet can store different underlying technologies such as BTC, ETH,
DOGE, XRP, LTC, EOS, cross-chain Token, and realize one-stop storage and management
of multi-currency.With easy operation, hundreds times of anti-pressure tests and powerful
anti-theft technology, the security of users’ digital assets can be guaranteed at the
maximum.

2.2.2 Digital asset financing platform
MGC Token belongs to a new generation of digital asset wallet, which is different from the
Wallet 1.0 and 2.0 era. One of the highlights is the establishment of ATS smart financing
system on the premise of guaranteeing the security performance of user wallets. It is
invested and operated by BG-MF,U.K. It jointly creates the function of giving coins to
investors to open the smart financing system after depositing coins, so as to realize smart
and safe financing in the wallet. By the smart hedging trading system of automatic system,
the biggest profit point of MGC Token is risk-less arbitrage spreads with regards to the
coins given service of one-key quantization issued by smart financing person.
Automated trade system is used to automatically achieve the real-time multi-trading
platform brick-moving transactions and the unique global real-time high-frequency
hedging transactions to obtain spreads, achieve a stable monthly return and reward the
majority of the earnings to participants in the form of MGC.

business risk, a risk-free arbitrage strategy.Hedging transactions have their own natural
anti-risk nature. The only risk is the handling fee, but as long as the digital assets have
volatility and activity, whether rising or falling will earn instantaneous spreads between
spot and futures.
And the quantitative trading enabled by ATS smart financing system replaces the artificial
subjective judgment with advanced mathematical models, and uses computer technology
to select a variety of “high probability” events that can bring excess returns from the
vast historical data to formulate strategies, and can maximize risk reduction and achieve
stable returns.
Storing digital assets in MGC Token's smart wallet and launching ATS smart financing
function is equivalent to buying a money-making machine for free. Smart trading robot
will track and capture large data and efficient market analysis of major trading platforms
in real time, carry out smart arbitrage transactions in real time, and participate in dividend
distribution by the whole people.
MGC Token smart wallet has its own hematopoietic function. It maximizes the leverage of
digital assets with zero risk. At present, it only deals with the mainstream digital currency
in the world, not securities and futures. The R&D team has been developing for more than
a year, which is the most advanced system in the world and most in line with the trading
habits of the currency circle, based on absorbing the traditional high-frequency trading
and combining the trading characteristics of digital currency.

2.2.3 Security of storing digital asset
The development of MGC Token digital asset wallet is based on the underlying
decentralization technology of the blockchain, it is a secure and reliable trading platform,
and the user's digital assets and transaction records are written into the blockchain
distributed network ledger instead of the MGC Token on the server. Only the digital asset
holder of holding the private key can operate. In order to protect the security of the user's
assets, MGC Token allows users to manage their own digital assets, such as private keys.
Once the user's private key is acquired by others and is likely to change the password to
steal user assets, the MGC Token MGC wallet can be exported via a transaction password.
Users must manage their private key and transaction password.

19

2.3 Token value of MGC Token
MGC Token will create an online and offline ecosystem to build a decentralized business
ecosystem. By docking the value of digital assets and physical business, the MGC platform
token is used as barrier-free token on the platform with openness, transparency,
decentralization, and to build a global digital token settlement network, and perfectly
combine strong offline experience service and high efficient blockchain Internet finance.
The MGC platform token used as an incentive mechanism to stimulate users' enthusiasm
for consumption and promotion, promote economic growth, provide more efficient and
valuable smart services for users and merchants, and realize the transformation of block
chain network of commercial services.
MGC pass/token is used as the token economy of MGC Token platform, which allows
more people to participate in ecological construction in the area of block chain payment
and storage. It involves the construction of hundreds of industries, such as real estate
industry, jewelry industry, health care industry, tourism industry, media industry, real
estate industry, entertainment industry, e-commerce industry, automobile industry and
catering industry.
The development of token economy for MGC Token allows more people to participate in
the construction for all walks of life, achieving the development goals of industrial
integration,

cross-border

applications,

cross-border

payment,

and

cross-system

application.

2.4 Commercial innovation
During the commercial development, MGC Token will solve two problems at the same
time. Firstly, the merchants have low acceptance of encrypted currency. MGC Token will
cooperate with the current payment network, which will promote the future acceptance of
encrypted wallets by tens of millions of merchants.
Secondly, the instant settlement of the point of sale. Generally speaking, every transaction
needs to be written directly into the block chain, and the block chain consensus takes a
long time. MGC Token will optimize this process: it creates a channel between consumers
and MGC Token. Consumer transactions will be settled through the liquidity pool of MGC
Token, and merchants can receive payments immediately. After MGC accepted by the
20

merchants, the MGC system will automatically convert the local legal currency to cash, or
the merchant can withdraw the cash to the secondary market (exchange) by holding the
MGC, and gain profits through the value-added of the MGC.

2.5 Commercial ideology
MGC Token will lead the next generation of digital economy innovation, the technical
team of MGC Token will support a variety of encrypted digital asset secure storage and
efficient trading out of the smart wallet, decentralized digital asset trading platform and
smart financing system It will mean that the future integration of technology and
blockchain will promote the infinite possibilities of the development of the digital
economy era.

2.6 Commercial progress
MGC Token platform uses global advanced blockchain technology and is certified by
authoritative center. The speed of order processing is up to 1 million messages/sec. It can
be assured that this speed has exceeded hundreds or thousands of times that of most
systems in the industry. It can ensure that there will be no delay and stuck in processing.
The system has rich and successful application experience in other blockchain digital asset
trade, and can support smooth and stable operation when the number of online users
exceeds 30 million. MGC Token platform uses advanced multi-tier, multi-cluster system
architecture. The design of multi-tier architecture greatly improves the performance,
security, stability and expansibility of the system. The arrangement of functions and
version update do not require to be stopped to maximize the guarantee for the operating
experience of end users.

21

3 Infrastructure and systematic structure
3.1 Overall structure of MGC Token
It is divided into three layers, such as core layer, service layer and application layer. The
structural diagram is shown as below:

Connector cluster

Side chain technology

Multiple signature

Core layer: it is the part of blockchain which consists of blockchain nodes and message
network to achieve the broadcast of trade data, and written into the network of
blockchain by miner’s package trade. Among them, the technology of soft payment
channel is used to open the payment channel in advance and realize fast trade, and
provides data storage for IM service.
Service layer: This layer uses the MVC architecture for the service scenario to separate the
client and the B segment merchant services: the corresponding API interface is provided
for the wallet client; and the integrated SDK is provided for the B end merchant
application to facilitate the third-party docking call.For the IM part, this layer provides the
corresponding processing logic, which carries the interaction between the read and write
of the application layer IM and the data cluster of core layer.
22

Application layer: This layer provides distributed ledger application services to end users,
such as wallets for currency digital assets, transactions, third-party applications, and SDK
written transactions.

3.2 Overall structural design
Overall structure of MGC Token includes 5 levels:

Redis buffer

Client: This layer focuses on the mobile terminal, supports iOS/Android system, and
accesses the customer service system.
Client API: This layer uses the TCP protocol and HTTP protocol according to different
service types to provide the iOS/Android development SDK for mobile terminals. The
WebSocket interface is provided in H5 page.
Access layer: this layer mainly protect massive users’ connection, attack protection,
rectifies massive connections into a small number of TCP connections to communicate
with the logical layer.
Logic layer: this layer is incharge of realizing core logic of IM system, such as private chat,
announcement, and information,etc.

23

Storage layer: This layer is responsible for caching or storing IM system related data,
including user status, message data, file data, and so on.The data storage format uses
Protocol Buffer, database selects MoogoDB Protocol Buffer is a lightweight and efficient
structured data storage format, defines the message format in .proto, uses the protocol
buffer compiler, directly generates the target file, which is convenient for multi-end
synchronization, and the target files can be run between major platforms to solve crossplatform questions.
Protocol Buffer is like XML, but smaller, faster, simpler, and has better performance and
efficiency in parsing speed and space.The Protocol Buffer does not need to be parsed
before mapping, and the direct serialization deserialization directly corresponds to the
data class in the application.
MoogoDB can load hotspot data into memory, which has obvious advantages in large
data volume query efficiency.
MoogoDB uses BSON to store data. It has very good support for JSON format data. It is
convenient for platforms to dock with MoogoDB database. The load of fragmented cluster
has very good scalability and very good automatic failover.

24

4 Advantages of MGC Token core technology
4.1 Multiple encryption secure storage technology
MGC Token encrypts the hot wallet, separates the cold and hot ends, and stores many
cold wallets in many places to form a multi-location and multi-center encryption signature
scheme. At the same time, it uses multi-signal P2SH and financial privacy BIP32
technology to encrypt and transmit all data information. In addition, MGC Token has also
created multiple signature algorithms such as rate limit, address white webhooks, and
combined with financial process system and approval authorization system, which can not
only guarantee the security of digital assets in an all-round way, but also make the whole
process of coin charging and withdrawal more efficient and convenient.
The funds in MGC Token wallet are segregated, which are divided into user's wallet,
quantified wallet and commission wallet, which are managed separately, and the digital
assets stored by users are written into blocks. No one can hold or trade except private key
holders. Man-made risk control and automated risk management can control the
investment risk to the greatest extent. MGC Token is a wallet compatible with multicurrency decentralization. It uses SHA512-ZERO encryption technology and independent
private key + dynamic verification code to ensure data security for MGC Token network.
Since the successful development of MGC Token, it has been brewing for seven or eight
months. It has undergone hundreds of anti-pressure and anti-theft tests to maximize the
security of users' assets.

4.2 ATS world top high frequency and quantitative trading as well
as hedging technology
ATS financial products are jointly created by top financial institutions, asset management
teams and senior AI experts from all over the world. Storing digital assets in MGC Token
smart financing wallet and opening the function of smart financing

is equivalent to

getting a money-making machine to help you realize arbitrage. smart trading robots will
track and capture large data and efficient market analysis of major trading platforms in
real time, carry out intelligent arbitrage transactions in real time, and participate in
dividend distribution by all people.
ATS system identifies the price difference and volume of digital assets in each trading
25

platform, decides whether to carry out arbitrage task, and initiates arbitrage transaction at
the appropriate time.
ATS financing system can also capture the spread of digital assets in each trading
platform in real time, decide whether to carry out transactions, or currency transactions
and other arbitrage methods, which can make our entrusted digital assets completely free
from price fluctuations, and solve various drawbacks and risks of artificial arbitrage.

4.2.1 Working principle of smart arbitrage for Automated trade system
ATS High Frequency Quantitative Arbitrage System only needs 0.01 seconds to complete
the processing of transaction information.It is the highest level intelligent arbitrage
system at present. It runs faster and the AI system runs steadily.

4.2.2 Bricking arbitrage system of automated trade system
The price of each currency in each exchange is different, and the price across the region is
different. There are upper and lower price differences. It solves the problem of high risk of
manual bricking, slow operation speed, slow market refresh, and ATS innovative AI field to
realize automatic smart trading arbitrage system. One trading platform buys at a low price,
and another trading platform sells at a high price to earn a difference. This is called
arbitrage.The ats intelligent arbitrage system automatically recognizes the volume, activity
and spread of the world's major trading platforms. It will buy at a low price in the first
time, sell at a high price of a few tenths of a second on other platforms, and automatically
move 24 hours a day. Brick arbitrage, stable income, safe and reliable, market fluctuations,
up to 10% of the daily arbitrage gains.

4.2.3 Technical concept of smart arbitrage for automated trade system
During the development of algorithm, our prospect is to provide a coding block algorithm
pool based on storage database, allow many people join the algorithm community, and
provide self-learning sandbox for MGC Token users to test distributed algorithms and
develop MGC Token smart platform.
During realizing this vision, we must complete the early development work, run in MGC
Token through extensible block chain technology, and provide advanced high-frequency
automatic quantization transaction protocol to communicate between high-frequency
26

automatic quantization transaction and exchange. We will promote this idea to run and
flourish in the future, and make it possible for all MGC Token users as well as sharing the
research of all algorithms. In order to support many complex applications of smart
arbitrage, it is necessary to break through the limitations of program size and
programming language of virtual machine on blockchain. But for arbitrage application
platform, besides considering the importance of data value, it also needs to include the
developers of arbitrage application, platform resource providers (with a large number of
graphics card servers) and consumers who run arbitrage application. Ultimately, it is not
enough to define data objects on the blockchain. MGC Token divides the development
process and use of arbitrage applications into different roles, publishes them to block
chains, provides information dissemination channels and promotes the exchange of
resources, and forms an arbitrage collaborative development application platform. ATS
solves programming language constraints by using external virtual machines and
integrating open source Docker containers. The MGC Token integrated Docker container
scheme can be gradually improved with the progress of the open source project Docker.
Depending on the convention and publication of unified standard DockerIMG image files,
the application running environment of MGC Token can be unified and upgraded
independently. In DockerIMG image file, the environment that can integrate many
programming languages, including tenderflow and other complex arbitrage application
environments, makes it possible to trigger the running arbitrage on MGC Token node.
MGC Token stores the executable file data and resource data of the application outside
the block chain, and stores the description information (or label) of the application and
resource data on the block chain. It allows for larger data size and more complex
applications. MGC Token provides block links for deploying, extracting and querying
transaction records of application data resources on block chains. It defines rules for
asymmetric encryption and decryption to verify user identity. MGC Token provides
application providers with four roles: data providers, application providers, and operation
without knowing the underlying technology of block chains. Platform resource providers
and resource consumers. The first three roles all have different types of resources;
resource consumers are the people who use these resources. Consumers can be ordinary
users or companies that are developing arbitrage applications (requiring a lot of data for
machine learning). Expect to provide the data needed for arbitrage to obtain revenue.
Companies specializing in the development of arbitrage applications expect to rely on the
development of arbitrage applications to obtain revenue. With many graphics card servers,
companies with tensorflow and Caffe platforms operating environment expect to make

27

money by renting these platforms resources. Ordinary users, who have a certain amount
of digital money in hand, expect to have tools to help him carry bricks arbitrage. In market
analysis, the proposed price forecasting platform tool will use regression linear relation
projection RNN for market analysis. The whole idea is made up of a series of words and
word orders that encode a lot of information that helps to predict the market. Step 1 is to
map words to embedded words. Step 2 is to receive the sequence of vectors as input and
consider the order of vectors to generate the predicted RNN. From the embedding layer,
the new representation is passed to the LSTM cell. These additions will often connect to
the network, so we can include information about word sequences in the data.

4.3 Solution design of MGC Token
To meet the needs of users and developers, MGC will be designed as a high-performance
underlying operating system with Turing completeness, which supports multi-asset crosschain protocols and smart contracts. Its overall architecture is shown in the following
figure:

28

Structural diagram of cross-chain protocol

The design process is as follows:
1. Through the multi-chain wallet designed by MGC Token, users can import the wallet
where the extra-chain assets are ready for recharge (to prove the ownership of the assets).
The import process will be completely decentralized, and the user's private key will not be
recorded in this process.
2. Recharge the corresponding multi-signature managed wallet via the already imported
BTC, ETH or other supported wallet.
3. The super node on the MGC Token will listen to the refill transaction via a cross-chain
protocol and invoke the mapping asset contract.
4. After the invocation contract is successful and irreversible, the mapping asset contract
transfers the corresponding mapping asset to the user's MGC Token wallet.
5. Users can use these mapping assets to use MGC Token-based DAPP.
6. After use, the user can recharge the mapped assets back to the mapped assets account
29

and obtain the right to withdraw money from the off-chain assets.
7. When the privilege is met, the attestation node will initiate a proposal to withdraw the
coin. When more than 2/3 of the cross-chain nodes are signed, the out-of-chain asset will
return the address of the user's coin.
When designing cross-chain protocol plug-ins, transaction settlement will be affected due
to the differences in underlying performance and block time. For example, it takes nearly
an hour for BTC to get six blocks of confirmation. If users directly use DAPP based on BTC,
its efficiency will lag behind DAPP based on EOS (EOS blocking time is 0.5 seconds).
This is unacceptable for developers and users, so we introduce a multi-signature entrusted
wallet mechanism, which helps users lock off off-chain assets through cross-link plug-ins,
and distribute equivalent amount of mapping assets (such as DBTC, DETH) for MGC Token
wallet during the lock-in period. Based on the mapping assets of MGC Token, users will
use DAPP on the chain more conveniently, quickly and fairly.
DAPP developers can use the MGC Token smart contract protocol that supports multichain assets. In order to improve the system iteration efficiency, MGC Token uses a plugin organizational structure. On this basis, we have added a cross-chain plug-in to help
users based on MGC. DAPP is used with out-of-chain assets.

4.3.1 Support multi-chain asset recharge
Through the multi-chain wallet designed by MGC Token, users can import the wallet
where the extra-chain assets are ready for recharge (to prove the ownership of the assets).
The import process will be completely decentralized, and the user's private key will not be
recorded in this process.

4.3.2 Cross-chain consensus mechanism
How to maintain the security of these managed wallets? We have added a new dimension
to the high-performance DPOS+POS+POW consensus mechanism - the cross-chain node
proof mechanism.The cross-chain node is voted by all MGC holders, and the highestscoring cross-chain node will become the object of the multi-signing managed wallet.

4.3.3 To prevent evil cross-chain nodes, it is necessary to lock the equivalent
value of MGC
30

In order to ensure the stability of the system operation and maintenance, the cross-chain
node must receive the reward in stages after it completes the maintenance task.Thus,
there are three types of nodes on the MGC Token:
Super Node
The MGC holders of the whole network are elected through the DPOS consensus
mechanism. The super node provides log storage (disk), computing power, and
computational storage (CPU) and state storage (RAM) for the entire network. Each cycle
(about one minute) of the pass holder can vote on the super nodes.
Candidate Node
Candidate node refers to the node that participates in the super node election, including
the super node, the cross-chain validator and the node that is not selected as the super
node. The candidate nodes are always on standby and ready to be repaired when super or
cross-chain validator fail.
Cross-chain Validator
By maintaining the security of the multi-signature entrusted wallet and managing the
multi-signature entrusted account, we can ensure that the assets outside the chain
correspond to the wallet on the chain. How do the nodes of the underlying chain
cooperate in the specific logic of recharge and withdrawal?
The underlying chain monitors the process of recharging the assets outside the chain:
1.Users send a recharge transaction to the entrusted account;
2.When the node is in block state, the LSP program deployed on the node queries the
trusted block browser every 0.5 seconds for the transaction recharge record of the hosted
account, and caches it locally;
3.The LSP program queries the database on the node to determine whether the recharge
4.record has been initiated, and tells LSP whether the transaction was initiated;
If the transaction has been initiated, it is deleted from the local cache; if it has not been
initiated, the LSP program initiates a token transaction to the issuing contract.

31

Recharge process

The underlying chain verifies the legality of the request for a coin:
1.The user initiates mapping of the asset management contract to recharge the mapped
asset, and the BP receives the refill request through the listener;
2.The super node receives the user's request for withdrawing money (expressed as the
user reloads the mapped asset to the mapped asset management contract);
3.The super node detects the out-of-chain asset wallet bound by the user MGC Token
wallet according to the type of the user's coin transfer;
4.If the verification fails, the request for the withdrawal of the coin is discarded; if the
verification is successful, the request for the withdrawal of the coin is sent to the multisignature module (maintained by the cross-chain node), and the multi-signature module
initiates a real digital currency transaction for the chain, and is cross-chained. The node
multi-signs the coin transaction;
5.After the multi-signature is successful, the managed wallet transfers funds to the user to
recover their out-of-chain assets.

4.4 Technical frame of MGC
4.4.1 Technical panorama of MGC
The technical panorama of platform token MGC includes basic network layer, intermediate
protocol layer and application service layer.
The basic network layer of MGC technology panoramic consists of data layer and network
layer, in which the data layer includes the underlying data blocks and related data
encryption and time stamp technology; the network layer includes decentralized
networking mechanism, data dissemination mechanism and data validation mechanism.
Intermediate protocol layer consists of consensus layer, incentive layer and contract layer,
in which consensus layer mainly includes all kinds of consensus algorithms of network
nodes; incentive layer integrates economic factors into block chain technology system,
including distribution mechanism and distribution mechanism of economic incentives;
contract layer mainly includes scripts, algorithms and intelligent contracts, which are basic
for programmable characteristics of block chain.
As the most important link in the blockchain industrial chain, platform token MGC
application service layer includes various application scenarios and cases of block chain,
including programmable currency, programmable finance and programmable society. The
application layer is the underlying technology architecture of platform token MGC
33

application ecology. The open source programmable application layer provides technical
support for the establishment of global digital currency application ecology.

4.4.2 Open Source Agreement of MGC Token
The Creation Block used by Platform Token MGC is a new public chain based on the
blockchain of ETF Open Source Agreement. Users can conduct point-to-point currency
transactions and instant settlement, easily and conveniently convert trading assets
(traditional currency, electronic currency and other forms of assets), as simple as sending
mail, which greatly reduces risks and handling fees of cross-bank transfers, especially
international transfers in the accounting process.
Unlike the centralized network model, the computers in each node in the P2P network
have equal status, each node has the same network power, and there is no centralized
server.All nodes share part of the computing resources, software or information content
through a specific software agreement.The wallet combines P2P's unique open source
network technology to form one of the core technologies of the platform-certified MGC
technology architecture.

MGC Token P2P network model

34

Comparison between MGC agreement and the traditional bank swift wire transfer
protocol: a traditional bank swift transfer is subject to high fees and takes 3 to 5 days, and
MGC cross-border transfers can be reached instantly.
Comparison between MGC and Bitcoin: Based on MGC's function of exchange and
transaction, all users in the decentralized network can conduct point-to-point currency
transaction and instant settlement, while the Bitcoin block chain itself does not have
transaction function, and its transaction depends on the trading platform.

4.4.3 Non-symmetric encryption algorithm of MGC token
Non-symmetric encryption algorithm

refers to the encryption and decryption of data

storage and transmission using public and private key. The public key can be published
publicly for the sender to encrypt the information to be sent, and the private key can be
used for the receiver to decrypt the received encrypted content. Public-private key pairs
take a long time to compute and are mainly used to encrypt less data. The commonly
used asymmetric encryption algorithms are RSA and ECC. MGC uses asymmetrically
encrypted public-private key pairs to build trust between nodes.

4.4.4 Consensus of MGC Token
MGC follows the open source protocol, so there are similar important steps for
negotiating consistency between distributed nodes."Consensus" is the process by which
the entire network agrees on the same general ledger.
If everyone chooses a completely unrelated certifier, the network will not reach a
consensus, and the special version of the general ledger is the only correct general
ledger.But in reality, people's UNL lists are repeated, and this duplication leads to reliable
verifiers reaching the same negotiation.
Every reliable system user wants to negotiate with the system. Verifiers will choose the
way other validators believe in, because they also want to negotiate. Basically, all reliable
system users cooperate to ensure that the negotiation is achievable and maintainable. Of
course, it is easy to detect the consensus.
In consensus, each node evaluates proposals from a specific equal node, known as the
"selected verifier". When running together, the selected verifier represents a subset of
35

proposals that are trusted not to collude with deceptive nodes. The definition of "trust"
does not require that a single selected verifier be trusted. More precisely, the validators in
the selection hope that they will not collude to forge the data forwarded to the network.

(Verifiers propose transaction groups - at the beginning of consensus, nodes and different
transaction groups work. Multiple rounds of proposals determine which transactions are
applied to the general ledger and which transactions need to wait for a consensus later
on.)

Optional transactions not included in agreed recommendations remain unchanged. They
may be considered in the next round of consensus. (By consensus, the node agrees on the
transaction group - the node applies the agreed transaction group to the final verified
36

general ledger. No transactions in this group may be agreed in the next round).
Generally speaking, a trade that does not pass a consensus will succeed in the next
round.However, under certain circumstances, the transaction will not achieve a consensus
indefinitely.There is a situation where the network adds a base fee and is more expensive
than the transaction.If the future transaction fee becomes lower to some extent, the
transaction is likely to succeed.
MGC provides a way to prevent transactions from happening indefinitely, ensuring that
the trading process takes place in a timely manner.The application needs to include the
Last Ledger Sequence parameter for each transaction.This guarantees that the transaction
succeeds or fails in the specified general ledger serial number (or before), thereby limiting
the waiting time before the final transaction result is obtained.

37

5 Core strength of MGC Token
5.1 Faster payment
MGC Token transactions are automated, funds are immediately available, and payments
can be completed in a short time.

5.2 Lower payment cost
MGC Token does not belong to anyone, and the cost of payment is lower. Merchants who
receive payment through MGC Token can save a lot of intermediate fees.

5.3 Simpler foreign exchange
In the international trade between enterprises, individuals in transnational tourism, foreign
exchange is not required to pay other fees, more convenient and simpler.

5.4 Availability of financial service
As long as the Internet exists, more financial services will emerge in the payment
application scenario. Based on the decentralized MGC Token platform, it can serve
individuals or financial institutions more efficiently.

5.5 Strong interconnection of financial service
MGC Token makes trading between independent companies easier by creating a shared
currency agreement, reducing resistance in the financial system and increasing system
efficiency.

6 Introduction of MGC blockchain technology
6.1 What is MGC？
MGC is a digital asset in the chain as a digital currency connected to the MGC Token
platform; media and fuel with lightning transfer, asset trading and free payment have
long-term value support, and MGC will realize payment circulation in the world in the
future.Using blockchain technology to further realize the wider ecological application of
MGC.

6.2 Design concept of MGC
Blockchain technology is considered to be the most disruptive technological innovation
since the invention of the Internet. It relies on cryptography and Hash functions, game
theory and other applied mathematics basic theories, without the need for any third-party
centers on the Internet where trust cannot be established. Intervention can enable
participants to reach a consensus and solve the problem of reliable delivery of trust and
value at a very low cost.
Since Bitcoin, many blockchain projects have sprung up, many of which have
breakthrough innovations, or underlying agreements to innovate, or innovation at the
application level, such as Ethereum, Litecoin and so on.These blockchain projects are
experimentally relevant from across the industry.
MGC Token's blockchain design will comprehensively consider and integrate the
advantages of many projects, and make some pioneering explorations to lead the industry
to the next generation payment network of blockchain.
Core concept: Blockchain is designed to retain all of Bitcoin's core features, such as P2P
systems, decentralization, asymmetric passwords to ensure exclusive ownership of assets,
anonymity, borderless, global applications.The blockchain preserves the most valuable
part of the Bitcoin system, adhering to the nature of the trust network, enabling low-cost
value transmission.
Application concept: Blockchain development has entered the era of application
development. Everyone is trying to combine their work with blockchain and give full play
39

to the advantages of blockchain.Then there are many bottlenecks in the current
blockchain project. For example, bitcoin has become a core problem that hinders its
development. In order to adapt to large-scale applications, the blockchain conforms to
the development of the times and serves the application.
Feasibility: The ultimate goal of block chain is to build the next generation block chain
network, which mainly involves side chain technology, mixed mining, SPV verification, and
intelligent contracts. These technologies have been demonstrated by the virtual currency
community, such as side chain technology, which is considered as one of the most
important bitcoin upgrade protocols proposed in 2015. There are many individuals or
teams including Block stream. In the process of development, we believe that it will be put
into practical application soon. Hybrid mining is a mature technology in use. SPV is
demonstrated by Satoshi Nakamoto in his creation paper. Smart contract can be realized
by using Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) or Bitcoin built-in scripting system. Therefore,
these core technologies are feasible.
The MGC Token technical team adheres to the development philosophy of “No best,
Only better”, fully absorbs the advantages of other blockchain projects, and combines its
own innovations to implement practical solutions.
Ease of use: Now Bitcoin official client is becoming more and more difficult to use,
because the data volume is expanding, individual users have to abandon the official client,
which weakens the security of Bitcoin from the side, because users have to put the
currency on the central server such as trading platform for convenience. For Ethereum, it
is more difficult to use, not to mention the complex intelligent contract (need to be
familiar with EVM and Solidity and other high-level languages), even simple transactions
need to install complex clients to achieve, these difficulties are unintentionally pushing
users aside, MGC Token will effectively improve the convenience.
The blockchain will provide a variety of clients, in addition to the PC end wallet, the
mobile end wallet APP, and the web end, and can handle simple brain wallet mechanisms
as well as wallet backup and recovery mechanisms.Easy to use is the primary design
direction of the blockchain.
Compatibility: Bitcoin is the most successful and stable digital currency system at present.
Many of its design concepts have been proved to be feasible. Block chains attach great
importance to compatibility with Bitcoin network, such as utilizing UTXO model of Bitcoin,

40

address construction process, script system of Satoshi Nakamoto, etc.
The Technical development team of MGC Token will adhere to the "standing on the
shoulders of giants", combined with Bitcoin's existing core technology and theoretical
principles, to do extension technology development.

6.3 Advantage of using MGC Token payment
6.3.1 Optimize the financial credit information system and strengthen the
security of transaction payments.
MGC Token is built by using block chain technology. It has the advantages of improving
the security of payment system and tamper-proof. Firstly, in the process of transaction,
the transaction records submitted by consumers can be verified by the payment system.
According to the smart contract of block chain, the system achieves transactions and
generates payment instructions automatically. At the same time, the block center will
record the data of each link one by one, and update the transaction value synchronously
through the transaction data recorded by the block.
The user is thus able to obtain the equivalent financial security of the purchased item,
confirming the entire transaction and payment process in the blockchain payment mode,
and making the process truly transparent.This virtual digital currency method also
effectively prevents hacking and enables secure transactions.Blockchain technology
enhances the security, openness and transparency of users in the platform trading process.

6.3.2 More convenient payment and high efficient settlement
For MGC Token, the application of digital currency block chain technology to realize
payment greatly simplifies the complex payment process. (For example: different users
use multiple currencies for settlement, platform and user-to-user settlement, etc.). The
platform wallet supports the withdrawal and recharge of various digital currencies into the
platform wallet. It is implemented by centralization and decentralization, which improves
the security and takes into account the computing power of massive data.

6.3.3 Point-to-point transaction of MGC Token prevent payment risk
MGC Token technology realizes a point-to-point direct exchange, the core of which is the
41

information interaction of decentralized agents. MGC Token technology is to verify the
trust of ownership by digital signature. In fact, it is to solve the point-to-point trust
problem in the transaction process with algorithm. i.e, the integrity and authenticity of
transactions can be realized by encryption algorithm, and the compulsory automation of
trust execution can be realized by intelligent contracts, while the source of trust in the
process of value transfer can be realized by structural design. At the same time, credit
creation and trust building are accomplished in payment system by consensus-based
mathematical method.
Because any intermediate node can not delay the transaction or filtering, thus ensuring
the objectivity, authenticity and irreparable modification of the point-to-point transaction
information recorded in the shared ledger, thereby solving the payment risk caused by
the third party payment.

6.4 Innovative significance of MGC Token
Since its birth, MGC has not been a completely independent virtual currency without any
platform support. It has block chain technology as its strong backing. The real business
payment cooperation model can effectively promote the growth and development of
MGC.
The combination of MGC and block chains will create five first:
The first is to support the application payment system of merchants for virtual digital
currency.
The first is to focus on the client’s privacy and decentralized newly transaction model of
trading security.
The first is to achieve coin-to-coin transaction, which is linked with other tokens and can
be converted by blockchain digital currency.
The first is to realize a payment platform for conversion between blockchain digital
currency and legal currency.
The first is to connect the users with ATS smart financing system, drive market activity,
and launch the landing ecological plan.

6.5 MGC Token's value in the future payment field
With the aim of creating "simplified and easy-to-use global payment" and the mission of
"serving the world", we are committed to making MGC a globally free-flowing encrypted
42

digital asset and constructing a payment platform between online merchants and
consumers of MGC. Through the network of this platform, customers can realize real-time
point-to-point payment, transfer, and even various financial investments, without the
need for central organization and management, and support different countries to
exchange legal currency.
Future:With the completion of public chain construction, MGC Token globally launched
the recruitment of foundation partners,MGC estimates a market value of $60 billion.
Facing with business users, MGC Token provides commercial platform, MGC Token

7 Technology of MGC
7.1 Data format of MGC Token
All data in the MGC is stored in the form of "recursive length prefix encoding (PLP)", which
concatenates arrays of strings of arbitrary length and dimension into strings.

7.2 Innovative consensus mechanism of MGC Token
MGC Token's innovative consensus mechanism: a new mechanism using TPOS
(SuperProofofStake) + POW + DPOS. Compared with the traditional POS/POW/DPOS
mechanism, the system efficiency and transaction processing capability are greatly
improved, and the commercial level is improved. Based on the experience of digital
currency in the past years, a feature that is important for the workload proof function is
“ Memory is difficult"--The legal workload proves that it requires not only a lot of
calculations, but also a lot of memory.
Nowadays, there are two main functional categories of "memory difficulty" - scrypt and
prime coin mining, but neither of them is perfect; neither of them needs memory which
may be required by ideal memory difficulty function, and both of them will suffer timememory replacement attacks, in which attackers can complete legitimate workload
certificates at the expense of some computational efficiency at the expense of memory
size far below the algorithm requirements. Ming. Using an alternative algorithm called
"Dagger", a workload proof mechanism based on moderately connected acyclic graphs is
far from optimal, but it has much more memory difficulty than other existing algorithms.
Hash algorithm maps binary values of arbitrary length to shorter fixed length binary
values, which are called hash values. A hash value is a unique and extremely compact
numerical representation of a piece of data. If a paragraph is hashed and even if only one
letter of the paragraph is changed, subsequent hashes will produce different values. It is
computationally impossible to find two different inputs hashed into the same value, so
the hash value of the data can verify the integrity of the data.
Generally used for fast search and encryption algorithms, the string randomly generated
code is as follows:
#include<stdio.h>#include<stdlib.h>#include<string.h>#include<ctype.h>#include<
time.h>#defineSTRINGSIZE10#defineSTRINGCOUNT1000//If this function is constantly
44

called in a program's loop, it is ineffective to initialize the random number generator by
using the system's time function, but the execution speed of the program is too fast, and
the number of seconds returned by 1000 cycles may be the same time return
timestamp./*voidget_rand_str(chars[],intnum){
// Define a random generated string table char*str=
"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";inti,lstr;
lstr=strlen(str);//calculate the length of string
srand((unsignedint)time((time_t*)NULL));
//Use the system time to initialize the random number generator ]\ for(i=0;i<num-2;i++)
//Returns the corresponding string{s[i]=str[(rand()%lstr)];
}s[i++]='\n';s[i]='\0';printf("%s",s);}
*/
intmain(){FILE*fp1;
//Define a file stream pointer, used to open the read file chartext[10];
// Define an array of strings to store the characters read inti=0,j=0,lstr;
char*str="0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx
yz";lstr=strlen(str);
//calculate the length of string
fp1=fopen("d:\\test.txt","r+");
//Only read and write mode to open the file a.txt
//while(fgets(text,1024,fp1)!=NULL)
//Read the contents of the file pointed to by fp1 line by line to the text
srand((unsignedint)time((time_t*)NULL));
//Use the system time to initialize the random number generator
for(j=0;j<STRINGCOUNT;j++){ for(i=0;i<STRINGSIZE-2;i++)应的/should
//Returns the phase string by the specified size
{text[i]=str[(rand()%lstr)];}text[i++]='\n';text[i]='\0';fputs(text,fp1);
//Write the content to the file pointed to by
}fclose(fp1);
//Close the file a.txt, there must be closed when there is open
}

7.3 Smart contract technology of MGC Token
Many block chains are integrating a common scripting language to define all operations.
These designs eventually define the business logic processor as a virtual machine, and all
transactions are defined as scripts run by the virtual machine. This solution has a single
45

thread performance limit on real processors, and the problem is aggravated by forcing
everything to be executed through a virtual processor. A virtual processor will always be
slower than a real processor even if it uses JIT, but computing speed is not the only
problem with this "everything is a script" scheme. When transactions are defined at such a
low level, it means that static checking and encryption algorithm operations will still be
included in the business logic processing, which will also reduce the overall throughput.
A scripting engine should never ask for a request for an encryption algorithm signature
check, even if the request is implemented through a native mechanism.

7.4 Quick confirmation of transaction
MGC Token uses an efficient and adaptive consensus algorithm to ensure that consensus
is completed, i.e. transaction confirmation, and optimizes other links in the process of
transaction confirmation, such as signature algorithm and book storage method, to
achieve millisecond-level confirmation transactions.

7.5 Mass storage and high concurrency suppor
MGC supports multiple ways of local database storage, file system storage, and cloud
storage.Local storage implements hot and cold separation, database storage uses a subdatabase partitioning model, and cloud storage supports expansion according to cloud
clustering rules.

7.6 Reliable and consistent record storage
MGC Token ensures that service requests can not be tampered with during transmission
through asymmetrically encrypted digital signatures, and that data of each node can be
stored consistently by consensus mechanism. For the stored data records, self-checking
and quasi-real-time multi-node data checking are used to ensure that the stored data
records can not be modified. Self-verifiability of nodes: Block chain structure is used to
store data records, and the modification of some records will destroy the integrity of
block chain structure, so that data can be quickly checked out and recovered from other
nodes.
In addition, each accounting node of MGC Token has its own private key, and each block

46

contains the signature of the node's private key. The modification of the data in the block
can be verified by the signature. Multi-node quasi-real-time data validation: When the
private key of the node is stolen, malicious users have the possibility to modify all the data
in the book chain. MGC Token provides a quasi-real-time data comparison mechanism
between multiple nodes, which can detect the tampering of the account data of a node in
time.

7.7 User privacy and transaction confidentiality
User information and block chain addresses in MGC Token are isolated. The associated
user information cannot be obtained from the record storage of each node. User
information storage has multi-layer protection such as permission control, access
authentication, encrypted storage and so on. Users with high transaction confidentiality
can also choose the mechanism of transaction irrelevance. Each transaction of the same
user maps to different addresses on the block chain, thus ensuring that the relevance of
multiple transactions of a user can not be obtained on the transaction book.

7.8 Secure private key management system
In the private key management solution of MGC Token, the functions of private key safe
and user account entrustment are provided to ensure the security of private key. Private
key safes use user information to encrypt private keys and store them separately on many
different nodes. Under normal business processes, the key safes will not be accessed.
When the user password is lost, it can be retrieved through the authentication code. The
export private key can be verified by the transaction password. Be sure to save the private
key and the transaction password, because the user can only export the private key
47

through the transaction password, all entrusted account operations of MGC Token will be
independently recorded in the block chain, and there are strict frequency restrictions and
independent wind control strategy for the operation of entrusted account, which can
strictly control the operational risk of entrusted account.

48

8 Scene application of MGC Token
8.1 Global channel blockchain digital currency payment system
MGC Token realizes the global circulation of digital currency MGC. After receiving digital
asset MGC, merchants can exchange local legal currency online. With the increasing

for the new ecosystem.

8.2 Realization of OTC off-site guaranteed transaction based on
smart contract
MGC TokenAPP wallet can realize off-site guaranteed transactions based on smart
contracts, i.e, the two parties of the transaction will transfer the currency to the channel,
and the smart contract will guarantee and open the currency exchange channel, which will
be online for 7*24 hours without rest, and realize the second speed. For redemption, the
handling fee is almost zero.

8.3 Big ecosystem of MGC Token payment accessed by merchants
The merchants all over the world can easily access the SDK provided by MGC Token to
their websites and APPs, and they can accept the multinational payment from users all
over the world. The full-platform SDK allows merchants to minimize the time and
manpower of access payment. Users only need to pay for encrypted digital currency, they
can quickly purchase foreign goods. The services provided by MGC Token are real-time
and low-cost. The use of block chains as a capital channel can achieve real-time and
security. The merchants can manage all orders of these payment channels through the
merchant management background provided by MGC Token Commercial Platform.

8.4 Cross-regional payment solution
In traditional cross-border payment, there are many risks, such as high transfer fees, long
settlement period, slow arrival rate, limit of transfer amount, freezing of funds, etc. These
risks often bring unnecessary losses to business users. Cross-border payment is difficult to
49

break through in traditional financial system. MGC Token can provide a non-frictional,
real-time and efficient decentralized payment network. It is an effective tool to solve the
pain point of cross-border payment.

8.5 Building of global credit cornerstone and system construction
MGC Token can verify and de-trust data exchange between nodes by digital signature
technology. Meanwhile, it can guarantee the credit system of industry chain by traceability and accountability technology. MGC Token deploys intelligent contracts, contract
procedures are automatically executed, and both parties can not cheat. Only when the
contractual conditions are met will the process release or transfer funds, and MGC Token
will make its own contribution to creating a trusted market for global trade.

8.6 MGC Token+online and offline application
Based on the underlying application of block chain technology, there is a more free, faster
and safer open source system for block chain mall transactions, which supports the
combination of scenarios for public chains, application portfolio for public chains and
multi-currency conversion portfolio.

for recycling and destroy. Users can check and verify through the blockchain browser. The
MGC will enter the destroyed account, and the user can query the account information
through the blockchain browser. The process of destroy is transparent and transparent
until the total amount is 100 million MGC deadlines.
In the future, MGC Token will build a decentralized chain trading platform in August 2019.
The exchange of MGC Token will be created based on the MGC Coin Chain public chain.
MGC Coin Chain will be used to redeem or transfer different areas in the future. The
multi-asset created by the underlying technology of the blockchain, the project is mainly
to establish a decentralized organizational structure, integrate some of the business of the
MGC Token wallet, it will enable users to conduct point-to-point transactions directly on
the platform, instead of operating transactions through an institution, users keep their
own private keys, and users will gain full asset dominance in the exchange. From the
perspective of technology, we move closer to a decentralized network architecture.
After the exchange is launched, MGC will be used as fuel. Users use MGC to decentralize
the exchange to conduct transactions. Users who need to use MGC coins to participate in
the transaction on the MGC

trading platform, regardless of any crypto tokens traded.

13.7 Features and marketing mechanism of MGC token
MGC platform coin will take MGC Token wallet platform as a springboard. According to
the relationship between supply and demand, the price of MGC platform coin is mainly
due to the continuous increase of the base number of wallet users, and the demand will
continue to increase under the constant total amount of issuance. With the increasing
number of MGC Token users, large trading volume and high market activity, MGC
platform coin will have a good value trend. Our ideas are very clear. MGC platform coin
will also become the token of various ecological applications, and will no longer be
confined to the main network circulation.
1. The first stage of the MGC coin was generated on the Ethereum.
2. MGC Token will conduct an airdrop plan, and the airdrop will allocate rewards to the
user's MGC holdings.
3. MGC Token wallet will launch various DAPP applications online, and DAPP will use MGC
as a token.
4. MGC Token will create the offline landing ecology, and accelerate the application field
of MGC.
5. Promote the development of philanthropy by MGC Token and increase the
transparency of international public welfare.
6. MGC will be launched on several international exchanges to accelerate the circulation of
tokens in the secondary market.
7. Create a

exchange, support MGC for coin-to-coin transactions, and use MGC as a

platform fuel.
8. We are expected to use the 1 year or so to develop the MGC Coin Chain public chain.
9. After the completion of public chain research and development, MGC will become the
supply chain of various industries and will support applications in more fields.
Conclusion: Three core points of MGC platform token,transaction scenario upgrade,
ecological chain deployment, research and development online public chain.

13.8 Launching more circulation of exchange
The MGC will be put on more exchanges for secondary market circulation. Users can
transfer the tokens they hold to the secondary trading market for free trading. Initially, we
will launch several exchanges to increase market liquidity. We believe that MGC will have
market depth and transaction depth on these platforms, and we will also prefer exchanges
with market depth to go online.The MGC token will introduce more trading portals
through these trading platforms. Of course, these exchanges also add a good trust
endorsement to MGC, which plays a crucial role in the follow-up market performance of
MGC.
The following three important points will be take into consideration as priority:
1. Security issue: The centralized trading platform still operates in the way of traditional
financial institutions. It needs to be recharged and acted as an asset entrusted role. It is
easy to be hacked and cause user losses. We firstly consider the security of the trading
platform and social reputation.
2. Integrated liquidity of the platform: The trading platform is aimed at users'
restrictions and handling fees.It is not conducive to the circulation of MGC tokens, or MGC
tokens are blocked in the circulation of the platform.
3. Whether there is insider trading: the traditional exchange is subject to the centralized
system, the management data of the foreground and the background is different, and the
system data is updated differently, and whether the exchange uses information
asymmetry to manipulate the real-time price.

13.9 Plan of landing ecology
MGC is the token issued by MGC Token platform. We believe that the platform coin needs
more economic entities to support it. The expansibility of the platform coin determines
that MGC will endow various rights and interests and value. The landing ecology will be
more extensive, and then the landing ecology will become the value support point of
MGC Token coin. The trend and development of MGC Token coin will get more users'
favor and support. While the MGC Token wallet and the exchange on the shelf, even if we
build a

exchange and public chain in the future, will become the landing application of

MGC coins. These applications have huge profit points, which provide a guarantee for the
stable development of MGC coins, and at the same time, provide the possibility for the
holders of MGC tokens to obtain the rising value of their tokens. Using MGC Token as a
springboard for accumulative users to use MGC Token as a base. The upcoming MGC decentralized trading platform will build a solid foundation.
60

We will build a physical landing ecological plan based on the Commonwealth countries.
At present, we have reached consensus with some enterprises and need to further open
applications to the market.
The following is an introduction to the strategic cooperation of entity ecology:
1. MGC and NOVO become long-term partners and develop together.
2. MGC made cooperation with the MET1 group to provide real estate investment services
for MGC users.
3. MGC signed a successful contract with Sabah root bird house.
4. MGC made cooperation with Desaria Property Sdn Bhd.
5. MGC made cooperation with Far Eastern Group to provide to provide the users with
overseas property projects
6. MGC made cooperation with Jeweller Jade Stone on the online channel cooperation of
the Internet.
7. MGC made cooperation with TROP PLANTATON.

13.10 Plan of token economy
The platform token introduced by MGC Token will also serve as a medium for the token,
and we believe that the blockchain will ultimately serve the entity, and MGC coin is not
only a tool for motivation, we are also improving and optimizing a token economic
system. In the token system, we will fully provide the market with a high degree of
freedom.All users can issue token of rights and interests based on their own resources and
service capabilities. The issued token will run on the block chain. Users can verify, trace
and exchange MGC Token-based token at any time, which are more secure, credible and
reliable.
1. The token economy will be used for the asset pricing of MGC tokens for point-to-point
payment, exchange, and settlement. It will also be used for the circulation and
consumption of tokens landing ecology, and can also be used for incentives for MGC
Token users and certificates for the construction of financial institutions in the later period.
2. MGC Token will launch more online DAPP applications, use the distributed account
book and digital encryption technology of the blockchain to encrypt and distribute the
data of DAPP applications, and trace the source of each link.
3. MGC will be used as an online DAPP token, the intervention of MGC token can be
effectively introduced into the user, MGC will be used as a reward and promote market
benefits, thus achieving differentiated service and user experience, this way will apply to

61

the retail on the chain and DAPP applications of membership.
4. MGC token will also be used in distributed service contract DAPP application, which is
applicable to takeaway, household management and real estate intermediaries. Through
the digitization of service contract, users will use MGC coin for payment and settlement,
thus realizing the decentralized shared economic ecology with incentive mechanism and
token value-added.
5. With the application of DAPP game, MGC Token will open up more game applications
and build a reasonable token economic system. MGC Token will perfect the complex
interaction of game value, playing mechanism and token economy, and build a complete
token economic system in the field of block chain DAPP game.

62

14 Achieving the value of Token Economy
With the maturity and popularization of block chains and smart contracts, MGC Token will
build a new decentralized token economy and business ecosystem. With MGC Token
users as the center, the users who use MGC Token will build a global digital currency
token and settlement network in an all-round way. The overall development process of
the platform will be a combination of short-term construction and long-term
development. We will gradually improve the following strategic steps.

15.3 Introduction of BG-MF technical team
BG-MF INVESTMENTS GP LIMITED created the AONE blockchain expert research team in
2015 and marched into the world digital economy.
AONE technical team found that there were many disadvantages in traditional blockchains.
The processing ability of blockchains is limited by the performance of consensus
algorithm, the performance of consensus algorithm is limited by the size of system nodes
and the processing ability of single node, and the development space of traditional single
block chains is limited. As a result, many transactions with high frequency and low latency
can not be applied in business scenarios. In the future, with the rapid development of the
digital economy era, the transaction scale is far beyond the current level. Performance
bottleneck is one of the key bottlenecks in the area of block chain. AONE technical team
has made great breakthroughs in many technical fields such as side chain technology,
cross-chain technology, super node, etc. Therefore, AONE team has won a number of
technical innovation awards, technical research and development awards and landing
application award in the area of block chain.

16 Legal affairs and risk precautions
16.1 Legal framework
The foundation is based on the development of an independent legal entity. The
American Foundation will act as the regulator for promoting the operation of the MGC
Token platform. The Singapore Foundation will act as an important institution for
ecosystem construction.
The Foundation will conduct MGC exchanges in a manner consistent with all local laws
and regulations.Due to legal restrictions, MGC Token services may not be available in
certain countries.As an intangible commodity with practical use, MGC is neither a
securities nor a fixed financial instrument. The market acceptance will determine the
corresponding value of MGC.
The proceeds from trading are mainly used for technology development, marketing,
community building, financial auditing, business cooperation, other related appropriate
purpose and development of the MGC Token platform.
The MGC Token platform may be subject to inquiries and supervision by authorities
around the world.In order to meet and comply with local laws and regulations, MGC
Token may not be able to provide normal services in certain areas.

16.2 Risk precautions
Digital assets of investment blockchain are a kind of high-risk and high-return investment.
Every purchaser of MGC token needs to consider relevant risk factors before investing.
When these risk factors appear, they will seriously affect the value of MGC, and have a
significant negative impact on it.

16.2.1 Blockchain system risk
1. Risk of system: It refers to the possible changes in returns caused by the common
factors of the whole situation, which affect the returns of all securities in the same way.
For example, policy risk - at present, the regulatory policies of some countries for block
chain projects and financing by means of token sales are not clear, and there is a
71

possibility of loss of participants due to certain policy reasons. In market risk, if the overall
value of the digital asset market is overestimated, the investment risk will be increased,
and participants may expect the growth of passport sales projects to be too high, but this
is not the case. Some high expectations may not be met. At the same time, the risk of
system also includes a series of force majeure factors, including but not limited to natural
disasters, large-scale computer network failures worldwide, political instability and so on.
2. Uncertainty: Digital asset transactions, including MGC, are highly uncertain. Due to the
lack of strong supervision in the field of digital asset transactions, electronic token are at
risk of ups and downs and being manipulated by bankers. If individual participants are
inexperienced after entering the market, they may not be able to withstand asset shocks
and psychological pressures caused by market instability. Although academic experts and
official media give advice of cautious participation on a regular basis, there are no written
regulatory methods and provisions, so it is difficult to effectively avoid such risks.
3. Regulation risk: It is undeniable that in the foreseeable future, there will be regulatory
clauses to regulate the area of blockchains and electronic token.If regulators manage this
area, the token purchased during the period of sale may be affected, including, but not
limited to, fluctuations or limitations in price and marketability.
4. Team risk: The current blockchain technology field has many teams and projects, and
the competition is fierce. There is strong market competition and project operation
pressure.Whether the MGC Token project can break through in many excellent projects is
widely recognized. It is not only linked to its own team capabilities, vision planning, but
also to many competitors and even attacks in the market. There is a possibility of vicious
competition.
5. Risk within the team: MGC Token brings together a dynamic and powerful team of
talents, and attracts senior practitioners in the area of block chain, experts in the field of
payment, experienced technical developers and so on. As the pioneer role of the block
chain in Southeast Asia in the payment area, the stability and cohesion within the team
are crucial to the overall development of MGC Token. In the future development, the
possibility that MGC Token will be negatively affected as a whole due to the departure of
core personnel and the conflict within the team is not excluded.
6. Project co-ordination and marketing risk: The founding team of MGC Token will spare
no effort to achieve the development goals proposed in the white paper and extend the

72

growth space of the project. Because this white paper may be adjusted with the update of
project details, if the updated details of the project are not obtained in time by the token
sales participants, or if the public is not aware of the latest progress of the project, the
participants or the public are not aware of the project due to asymmetric information,
which affects the subsequent development of the project.
7. Project technical risk: First of all, the project is based on cryptographic algorithms, and
the rapid development of cryptography is bound to bring potential risks to be cracked.

16.2.2 Risk of blockchain software
1. Risk of transfer delay for blockchain: At present, most block chain networks in the
market will have a certain transfer delay, which is due to the need to confirm the
mechanism of block chain transfer. All investors in block chain should have a full
understanding of the corresponding situation. Delays in block chain transfer may result in
investors'inability to trade at the appropriate price, resulting in certain losses. This
potential risk needs to be fully understood by investors.
2. Risk of blockchain congestion: Most blockchains are prone to periodic congestion,
which can easily cause long delay or even loss of transactions. The occurrence of these
risk factors will have a certain impact on investors.
3. Leak of blockchain software：Blockchain token contracts, basic blockchain, application
software platforms may have technical vulnerabilities, which is also because block chain
technology is in the early stage of development, and some new technologies have not
been fully tested by the market. Some leaks may result in the risk of investors losing all
their tokens.

16.2.3 Security risk of use for users
Private key loss risk: MGC token is stored in the user's private wallet and the key is used
when accessing. If the user accidentally loses or leaks the wallet key, it may result in the
loss of access to the wallet or wallet token. This risk is irreversible, and the issuer of the
token will not be able to bear such risk.

16.2.4 Risk of related third-party platforms

73

There is a risk of closure of platforms or trading platforms that store MGC tokens, which
may lead to loss of tokens stored on the corresponding platforms by users. MGC issuer
will not be able to bear the corresponding losses. Secondly, technologies such as block
chains, distributed accounts, decentralization and disagreement with tampering support
the development of core business. MGC Token team can not fully guarantee the
technology landing. During the update and adjustment of project, the leaks may be found,
which can be remedied by issuing patches, but the impact of leaks can not be guaranteed.

16.2.5 Hacker attack and criminal risk
In terms of security, the amount of a single supporter is small, but the total number is
large, which also puts forward high requirements for the safety of the project. Electronic
token has the characteristics of anonymity and traceability. It is easy to be used by
criminals, or attacked by hackers, or may involve criminal acts such as illegal asset transfer.

16.2.6 Other current unknown risks
With the continuous development of blockchain technology and the industry as a whole,
MGC may face some unforeseen risks.Participants are required to fully understand the
team background, understand the overall framework and ideas of the project, make
reasonable adjustments to their vision, and participate in the token investment.
