Abstract
The EBCoin ecosystem will revolutionize the duty free/tourism tax refund market, currently
estimated to be valued at $60 billion a year. EBCoin will function as an ERC20 token, standardized on
the Ethereum blockchain and will be complemented by a complete eWallet solution. By using the
EBCoin platform, consumers will receive their refunds instantly and can use the proceeds as a digital
currency. With EBCoin, tax refunds will be transparent, resulting in greater efficiencies for tax
authorities. For retailers, EBCoin will significantly reduce the high costs associated with the
inefficient systems presently being used. It will also help promote higher spending by tourists at
participating duty-free retailers, where consumers will be able to present payment using their
EBCoin wallet as an optional payment method.
Our research has shown that up to $24 billion in sales tax refunds are unclaimed by travelers. This is
due to inefficiencies in the current systems, such as paper based processes associated with collecting
tax refunds at points of departure. In addition, the industry currently charges merchants processing
fees of up to 30% on the tax refund amount. This limits the effective use of sales tax refunds as an
incentive to expand the shopping habits of tourists at their travel destinations.
The EBCoin ecosystem consists of: consumer interfaces in the form of a mobile wallet application,
the EBCoin token as a new digital currency, ATM kiosks in global airports, and merchant interfaces
for accepting payments and participating in loyalty programs. The EBCoin token will act as a method
for accepting payments by participating retailers, as well as having the capacity to process loyalty
benefit program transactions. In turn, the ATM kiosks will support instant conversion to fiat or other
cryptocurrencies.
The EBCoin project is backed by KR Partners Co. Ltd (KRP), a Korean based payment services provider
established in 2006, specializing in tourism, travel and duty-free industries. KRP now has over 6,000
online and offline merchants in South Korea, China, Japan and Southeast Asia. Clients include
airlines, duty-free shops, department stores and hotels. EBCoin has an international Board of
Advisors, with deep domain experience in digital payments, financial technology services, tax
refunds and monetary systems.
Phase One of the EBCoin go-to-market strategy is to target the tourism corridors between China and
South Korea, as well as Japan and South Korea. In addition, EBCoin will also focus on key tourism
corridors for Chinese, Korean and Japanese tourists in Southeast Asia. Phase Two will expand to
target other key Asian tourist corridors, including Europe and Australia. Further, we have also
identified that there are tremendous opportunities in other duty-free hubs, such as Dubai and Abu
Dhabi. These and others will be included in future phases of our project development.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
Development of World Tourism Industry and Chinese Contributions
The global tourism industry has grown steadily over the past decade. This can be measured by the
number of overseas travelers worldwide. The travelers surpassed a billion for the first time in 2012,
it increased by 19% to 1.25 billion in 2016. Even though, there was a slight decrease (A 4% decline
from the previous year) in 2009 due to global economic recession, but after all year shows a
significant increase. According to The United Nations World Tourism Organization analyzed that
China (122 million, 2016), the United States, Germany and United Kingdom are the middle of cause
of traveler increase. Not only are the number of travelers, each countryâ€™s overseas spending on
travel the top-ranked in the world. Amongst of them, the country with the highest expenditure on
overseas tourism is China ($26 billion), which has grown as a big player. The statistics in China are
tantamount to the total expenditure on overseas of other nations, the United States, Germany and
United Kingdom. As can be seen in the several latest reports, Chinese is dominating large sections of
the consumption market in the world.

6

Regardless of the region and country, tourism industry is rapidly developing at the present day.
International tourism is a large part in terms of export earnings of the world after fuel and
chemicals. Unlike other sectors, the tourism industry does not require high technology or specialty.
With resources and utilizing environment, each country can create competitive advantage and
differentiated value in comparison to other nations. Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index in 2017
(World Economic Forum, 2017) shows that those components are an important measure for
improving tourism. Exactly 59 countries in America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East have included
from the top 100 list according to the report. Consequently, tourism industry has something special
that can be activated irrespective of economic power, GDP and geographical conditions. These days,
a numerous of people are expecting unusual experiences and new challenges, so there is a lot of
potential and vision in tourism industry.

The Status of Payment Industry in the International Tourism Market Ecosystem
As mentioned earlier, the tourism industry is developing all over the world, and the increase in the
number of overseas tourists is leading to consumption. As a result, each country enjoys economic
ripple effects.
Travelers exchange or withdraw their local currency for consumption and purchase locally, and they
buy items using the local currency or credit card. According to the tax refund system in each country,
the consumption tax is received in local currency or remitted to the home country after returning
home. The rest of local currency will be exchanged at the bank of their home country or the airport
before departure.
At this point, exchange of money between the local currency and the destination currency occurred.
Regardless of whether it is through commodity money or electronic settlement, payment should be
paid for it.
Many businesses are thriving in response to the currency demand of travelers. Foreign exchange
operators operate currency exchange counters at airports, downtown areas and hotels where
travelers frequently visit places, and they collect fees of around 3% as the fee for exchange.
Credit card companies provide local payment through VISA network. At this moment, they generate
additional revenues of approximately 3% from the payment amount. In addition to this, they gain a
3% of exchange fee when customers withdraw cash using ATM.
Most countries are operating a tax refund system that allows overseas travelers to reimburse their
domestic consumption tax, which amounts to 8-25% of the purchase price. Taxes refunded after
shopping are either received in local currency or remitted to their account. This allows the tax refund
companies take 20~30% of commission as a revenue.
7

It is apparent that financial commissions such as overseas service fees are set higher than general
transactions for travelers. That is because of the admission fee in an airport duty free shop, which is
the same with regard visitors as transient guests to make excessive profits.

Status and Problems of Tax Refund System
Tax refund means when a tourist buys a VAT inclusive product during their travel period, and returns
to his or her home without using it, they can get a certain amount of VAT from their purchased
products.
Currently, 34 countries are operating the regime, tax refund and among them, 28 nations are
belonging to the European Region. These include the United Kingdom, France and Italy, all of which
are the top of rank of tourism competitiveness index.

When purchasing goods, customers can get back the domestic tax not only in an airport or specific
area in the city but any shop in a local country. Thus, the tax refund system is a necessary system for
attracting tourists and increasing tourist consumption.

8

On this account, the number of Chinese tourists has exploded and the tourist markets of Asian
nations have also grown. These countries have been busy introducing a tax refund system.
There is a big difference in the refund rate because the system of taxation in each country is
dissimilar. In Europe, more than 20% of the surtax is applied in particular and there are many
expensive luxury goods, so the tax refund is very effective.
The size of the market for tax refund is forming a potential market of 60 billion USD (50 billion EUR)
and growing by 25% each year.

â–² Increase in tourism and luxury consumption due to emerging global consumers
- Asian middle class has grown sevenfold since the year of 2000; the number of millionaires in China
are expected to double between 2014-19 to 2.3 million.
- The average growth rate of Chinese tourists for tax free shopping in Europe is 16-20% per year, and
the rate of growth between 2009-14 and 2014-19 is expected to be 9-12% each year.
â–² The global tourism market is supported by increased affordability and expenditure per tourist,
particularly spending on luxury goods
- Over the past sixty years, tourism has undergone continuous expansion and diversification to
become one of the largest economic sectors across the world.
- Some travel disruptions, such as 9/11, SARS, ash cloud and global financial crisis transpired but
there was only minimal disruption and which made a quick recovery.
â–² Demand for global luxury goods continues to rise, driven by the spread of the middle class and
the polarization of prices.
â–² VAT contributes greatly to government budgets and more countries adopt VAT as a revenue
raising countermeasure.
9

The problem is that the procedure is complicated and cumbersome, which is causing great
inconvenience to travelers, even though the effect and demand for the refund are significant.
Especially in the travel season, when the demand for tourism is greatly increased, travelers must wait
a long time for customs checks and refund requests owing to the large crowds in airports for
departure. This bring on the pernicious effect in terms of the quality of travel.
Due to this inconvenience, it is known that only less than 40% of the VAT included in the refund will
be refunded to consumers.

In addition, the existing tax refund system is full of absurdity.
â–² Consumer discomfort from multiple stages of refund process
- Consumers must keep the purchase receipt at departure.
- The customs officer must confirm that the consumersâ€™ goods are carrying out at the customs
counter of the departure lounge.
- Refund application (including refund method registration) must be completed at the refund
counter.
- If consumers do not accept it in cash, it may take up to three months to send it to their account.
- 100% refund is impossible (30% is paid as refund service fee)
10

â–² Excessive costs for system operation

- Private refunding operators take over the operation of computerization and settlement services for
tax refund between merchants and the National Tax Administration.
- Pay a very large rent to the departure lounge to manage a refund window. Due to limited
opportunity to enter the airport for opening a business, a big portion of the business cost is paid as
the rent for operating the refund window through competition amongst refunding companies.
- Originally, tax refund aims tourism activation. However, a refund provider takes 30% of them as the
fee, which system goes against the original intent.
- The tax authorities have no way of confirming to tourists that they have finally received a tax
refund. If they audit this, it could cost a bundle of money.
â–² Criminal Behavior
- Due to the competition between tax refund providers, a large part of the refund fee is returned to
the merchants as the support fund for their marketing.
- If the merchants do not return some of the tax exempted by the government to increase sales to
secure additional profit, it may be regarded as a criminal act and they can be charged with tax
evasion.
- It is known that some tax refund companies do not send the tax refund amount to their customers
on purpose.

11

1.2. Vision
We have devised a cryptocurrency that will replace the demand for the local currency used by global
travelers.
Global travelers are dramatically increasing year by year, and the biggest contributor is Chinese
amongst of them.
It is well known that most Chinese tourists travel as group tours and they spend a lot of money on
shopping during the trip.
The top ten countries visited by Chinese travelers are all in Asia.
First of all, we plan to set up ATMs for currency exchange at each airport in Hong Kong, Japan, South
Korea and Thailand. Afterwards, we will provide payment and tax refund services to numerous
number of shopping centers, duty free shops and department stores.
Travelers will benefit from our cryptocurrency at merchants, travel agencies, airlines, airports and
duty-free shops under the supervision of KRP and GCMC. To use the cryptocurrency, they will install
our EBC wallet on their mobile phone.
Travelers receive drawback in EBCoin using our EBC Wallet and they receive shipping document
confirmation at an ATM in airports. At an ATM, the rest of money is exchanged in EBCoin.
EBCoin stored in the EBC Wallet can be exchanged in the EBC exchange at anytime, anywhere and
around departure.
Travelers can solve problems of many discomforts. Unnecessary procedures, such as having a receipt
and long wait times at a refund window will disappear without a trace. Because there is no need to
go through bank windows in airports to exchange their rest of the money. As a result, the quality of
travel will be vastly improved. 100% of the tax can be refunded immediately after confirmation of
export, because both tax refund companies and rent for airport windows are unnecessary. The
exchange fee is also exchanged using the cryptocurrency exchange on the online, so it can be used at
a much lower cost than the currency exchange in airports.
The tax authorities in the countries that operate a tax refund system can enhance the transparency
of the system. There is no cost to manage the system and no need to audit whether the tax is
properly refunded.
Finally, it is possible to maximize the effect of attracting tourists by increasing the tax exemption
benefits for the domestic visitors and improving their convenience. As global travelers use the tax
12

refund service via EBCoin, it is not difficult to expand the scope for use of EBCoin in many ways, such
as currency exchange and payment.
VISA is the payment method that handles the most cross border payment worldwide.

With the annual tax refund market worth approximately $60B, and the X-border payment market
grossing hundreds of billions of dollars every year, global tourists will be using EBCoin as their main
currency.

13

2. Market
2.1. Primary Market: Tax Refund
The tax Refund market is shaping the worldwide tourist market. It is a merit that this service for
travelers to be able to receive a refund of the consumption tax (15%). Especially in the European
region as a huge tourism market where the demand for luxury products is high. Recently, the rapid
growth of Chinese tourists has led to development in Asian tourism markets, including South Korea,
Japan and Thailand.
In order to receive the Tax Refund, every traveler must obtain a tax-free goods purchase history and
take confirmation of export at the customs authorities. To do this, the integrated computer system
will be integrated to provide confirmation of the recipient who receive refund and ex-post settling
up service after integrating data from taxpayer (Merchant), the National Tax Administration and
customs.

Tax Refund, based on cryptocurrency
Tax refund is a system that allows foreign tourists to receive the domestic indirect tax (VAT, special
consumption tax) only when the foreign tourists take out their goods purchased at the place
designated by the superintendent of a tax office in order to attract and secure foreign tourists.

14

The domestic tax refund is aimed at attracting foreign tourists. However, the procedure is
complicated and many people want to get a refund. But the problem is they cannot afford to wait
for a longer time to access this benefit before leaving the airport. For these reasons, travelers tend
to give up on refund tax. Also, the guidance provided for receiving a refund slip at the tax free shops,
which is the first in the refund process is too sloppy or inadequate.
The tax free shops provide a refund certificate and customer information to the refunding service
provider as a tax-refund affiliate. The refunding companies receive the VAT from duty free shops and
pay the money to the foreigner, deduct a portion of the fee and share the profit with merchants.
Unlike the purpose of the system, foreign tourists may give up on receiving refund or only receive
part of the refund, because of the complicated procedure.

The reason for this can be found in the following structure. When a foreign tourist refund tax
through the refund slips approved by the customs office, the refunding company is the nucleus of
the service procedure. They handle the business, which is refunding the VAT after deducting the fee,
for foreign tourists and tax free shops.

15

The EBCoin team is concerned about the structure of the actual amount of refund and the unfair fee
deductions. We are looking for ways to improve the complex procedures which are unnecessary just
like the agency business of tax refund companies. We will do this not only with the blockchain and
tokens. We also came up with the concept of a smart contract, which supports the transparent
structuring of tax refunds using the decentralized blockchain. The smart contract also includes the
exchange of transparent rights and duties. All tax refunds will be carried out under the conditions in
the smart contract, and foreign tourists who are due for a refund will be refunded; with the value of
the refund provided as a token.
Ultimately, our team decentralizes the existing centralized agency service, and refunds the fee that
occurred through the agency to the foreign tourists in full, so as to bring this system back to life.
Furthermore, we extend these systems and services to the global tax refund market.

16

2.2. Foreign Exchange
Usually, foreign tourists exchange their currency to the local currency of the country they intend to travel
to before or during departure. Some limitations in transportation of money also require that tourists
leave the bulk of their money at home, which increases the risk of loss due to the exchange rate when
the exchange is done later.
There are also some inconveniences when exchanging currency, due to the limitations of handling
currency and the time it takes to visit the banks.
â€» Banknote Exchange: 26 countries are available
â€» Coin Exchange: Only 8 countriesâ€™ currency is acceptable (the US Dollar, Japanese Yen, British
Pound, Euro, Swiss Franc, Australian Dollar and Hong Kong Dollar)
In the case of tax refund, travelers may keep EBCoin if they plan to revisit their travel destination in the
nearest future, or they if they choose not to patronize their local merchants due to the exorbitant
commission costs. In this case, they will need to simply make exchanges into their local currency through
an exchange market or currency exchange.

17

With EBCoin, we are trying to deal with difficulties of exchanging money in various countries. If
customers want to exchange their own currency before departure, they can simply exchange the
money at the KIOSK that is deployed at airports in each country.

It is possible to access kiosks through the EBCoin App. Starting with EBCoin, other primitive
currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum; and fiat currencies such as USD, YEN and WON are also
available for travelers to exchange and withdraw.

18

3. Cryptocurrency
The tax refund for foreign tourists depends on the refund service provider. The provider acts as an
agency for customs and merchants, and records the purchase history and passport information of
the tourists on a centralized server. A portion of the refund will be deducted as a commission fee for
foreign tourists in process of payment for refund. There are loss and missing risk in the manual
process of collecting paper receipts from merchants and registering them in computerized accounts.
The actual payment between the duty free shop and the refund service provider is also uncertain.
In the case of refund in advance, a credit card number may be stored for rebilling if it does not meet
the refund requirement, which has the problems in terms of sensitive and personal information
leakage.
Under this circumstance, we tried to solve the above problems by developing refundable coin with
characteristics of cryptocurrency.

3.1. Coin Design for Tax Refund
Limit of Bitcoin and Ethereum based ERC-20 Token
There are two ways to develop the coin for a tax refund, which are multi-signature technique of
Bitcoin or smart contract of Ethereum.
However, Bitcoin has several problems as follows.
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢

Small block size
It takes a long time to confirm
Fees are expensive
Turing incomplete script with limited opcode

It is therefore, not suitable for use in refund payments due to the block size and the delay in
confirming blocks. No one will wait for ten minutes to buy a cup of coffee. Similarly, when you
purchase expensive luxury goods or home appliances online, will you be willing to go through six
steps to confirm the purchase? Most people wouldnâ€™t.
As a multi-signature technique, Bitcoin protocol enables a low level of â€˜Smart Contractâ€™. For example,
you can create scripts that must be signed from two of the given three private keys to be approved.
19

These scripts can be useful for business accounts, security and the tax refund, but there are some
severe limits:
1. There is no loop command category, such as the words, â€˜whileâ€™ or â€˜forâ€™.
2. UTXO (Unspent Transaction Outputs) script is not good enough to control the amount of
withdrawal in detail, because the script restricted in terms of price fluctuations.
3. There are only two situations, which are â€˜spentâ€™ or â€˜unspentâ€™, so it is impossible to create
multiple contracts and is used for a one-time contract. Thus, there are limitations in terms
of extension and application to develop applications in various fields.
Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum discovered these limitations of Bitcoin, and then developed
the new cryptocurrency we all know as Ethereum. This cryptocurrency can be used in facilitating
payments. But not only as a payment method, but also in creating a wide range of DApp
(Decentralized Application) and smart contract as an open platform. The Ethereum platform is built
with a Turing-complete language (Serpent, Solidity, LLL, Mutal) that is functionally different from
Bitcoin.
Blockchain 1.0, which is a simple type like Bitcoin had ended, but the age of Blockchain 2.0 has
arrived and is available for actual use, especially in the financial sector. With Ethereum being at the
forefront of the revolution, this has opened the pathway to Blockchain 2.0 and we believe this
cryptocurrency is an appropriate platform for our token sale. After the token sale events, other new
tokens can be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges.
In Ethereum, smart contracts are conditionally coded and propagated to each node. The form is as
follows: 'If the foreign tourist meets the refund condition [condition 1], the duty free shop confirms
the approval from customs [condition 2] and transfers the token-type refund coin to the traveler's
wallet.
The Ethereum is an open platform that is interoperable and linked with decentralized applications
based on ERC20 standard protocol. It is not restricted to only one service, but has infinite potentials
for creating services.
Our team develops EBC (EBCoin) as an Ethereum based ERC20 token and we provide contract codes
for tax refunds in the smart contract using minimal intervention and without any third parties. Our
project is based on a DApp and our main targets are foreign tourists, duty free shops and customs.

3.2. EBCoin (Eximbay Coin)
To provide a solution for applying tax refund service on the blockchain is important.
20

We took a closer look at EBCoin with some problems and their corresponding solutions when we
designed the coin.
Our team checked over the necessary parts of Bitcoin and Ethereumâ€™s control algorithm and
implementation process for public / private blockchain service for a long time.
This led to the design of a refund coin, called EBC (Eximbay Coin), which had to be considered for
issuance, asset transfer, signature, user behaviors, mining, system configuration, coin management
and implementation.
We threw a difficult question to ourselves: Can EBCoin evolve from a simple refund coin to a more
extended service?
How should it be handled to apply to the global tax refund market? How should it be implemented
to raise consensus among various organizations?
Through countless trials and errors, EBCoin was designed as a smart contract based tax refund
service on the Ethereum blockchain. We reached a conclusion on a reasonable basis that the coin
must be based on ERC20 Token standard token technology, which is easy to develop, is fast and
compatible.
We have decided on the design and construction direction of EBCoin by examining the technical
constraints in some reviews and the technical features that we must implement. In consideration of
each countryâ€™s various refund targets and conditions, we have compiled the code defined in the
smart contract script code with a variety of functions. After converting it to a Byte Code, it has
become possible to write on the blockchain through a transaction, which was the point of contact as
well as the application distribution.

21

We had one question: How to identify and access smart contracts recorded on the blockchain? We
examined the structure of the contract, and when the transaction is recorded on the blockchain, the
block is created by the miner. This transaction is processed by the contract creation transaction and
returns the contract address of the generated contract in the contract address field of the
transaction receipt.
The contract address refers contents of the contract code we have defined. So how do we approach
the function of each defined contract code? In other words, how will we carry out the value and
refund conditions that foreign tourists receive the refund at duty free shops to return the result?
Access to functions can be handled as follows. When the contract function is executed in the
function signature area of the contract code, put the contract address in the â€˜toâ€™ part of the
transaction and the function address in the â€˜dataâ€™ part. It is a necessary procedure to include the
parameter values for operation in the payload. The function area will record the conditions for tax
refund on each country. The parameters include sales information, sales amount and sales date to
judge refund conditions, and the address necessary for the refund. In order to do this, processing for
functions must be implemented in advance.
So, how to implement the confirmation of export by customs and refund coin payment authority?
How to handle participation of public institutions and each nationâ€™s refund system in a smart
contract? How to supply initial liquidity coins to duty free shops? What will happen if the duty free
shops use the coin for other use other than refund? Is there any way to make the coin unusable?
The contract code can delegate the authority that makes transfers possible and can input the
administration authority, such as the transmission range and the control of the supply amount. To
create such a function, a central manager of the coin is required. It can be processed with a simple
account, and a contract can be issued with a democratic vote to issue a new token. It is also possible
to limit the influence of the token owner on each address.
Our team considered that the role of the EBC founder is very important to induce the participation
of each country. This process cannot be carried out exclusively, but must be controlled and
authorized by each participantâ€™s vote.
The EBC Foundation can determine the scope of the signerâ€™s authority and procedures for service
operations, which is similar to customs or duty free shops. The participant of a specific address who
has an authority can use function calls defined in smart contract code, which is available to provide
additional liquidity, collect coins from certain participants and obstruct coin usage.

22

How can participants with different authority access to the smart contract of Ethereum? Also, when
users learn about UI / UX, can they make them feel comfortable in comparison to existing
applications?
Like Bitcoin, An Ethereum node is needed to access the block. The blockchain engine means the
Ethereum node, such as â€˜gethâ€™, â€˜parityâ€™, and â€˜ethâ€™. Transaction processing or contract execution
related to the smart contract is recorded on the blockchain, and a function of the smart contract
recorded on the blockchain according to the message TX is called.
If tax free shops, customs and foreigners want to handle their respective duties through web or
native applications, the following functions are available.
Through the ABI (Application Binary Interface), we provide the function to access the smart
contracts in the application area. We will distribute the dApp based EBCoin APP via this functionality.
The EBCoin APP, created by JavaScript or Go and Java will access the blockchain by means of a
communication protocol, such as RPC for interaction between users and smart contracts, and will be
configured to communicate with the Ethereum node.
As a result, a step-by-step tax refund condition is created by the EBC founder in the smart contract
as the EBCoin contract name. Participants such as duty free shops, customs and foreigners are
23

composed of independent nodes through dApp, and these nodes are connected to each other in
multinational on the Ethereum network.

The implementation process is as above.
But lastly, why should a refund be made on the blockchain? What are the benefits?
The transfer of the refund coin is recorded on the open ledger of the blockchain as a transaction
history. This ensures that all procedures for tax refunds can be tracked transparently.
In cases where a refund service provider is acting as an intermediary refund tax to foreigners via
refund slips, the refund service company and duty free shop obtains and settles the commission.
This is limited to foreign tourists whose customs have been properly processed by requesting a
refund.
The feature is centralized through the monopoly of a small number of refund service providers, and
tourists receive refunds that are deducted from brokerage fee, which is unnecessary in the
consignment process.
The characteristics that are improved when the service is provided by the blockchain are as follows.

24

1. Decentralization: Transaction is available between duty free shops and foreign tourists
without the third parties, thereby reducing commissions.
2. Security: Hacking is not possible due to the nature of blockchain
3. Anonimity: No additional information appears in addition to the address due to the nature
of blockchain
4. Non-repudiation: Foreign tourists can transfer EBCoin as much as the refunded amount to
the address that they want to receive and confirm it on blockchain
5. Statelessness: The service can be used in many countries other than specific countries
The contract code of EBCoin for tax refund is recorded on blockchain to operate as follows.
â€» The source code for the contract will be written in solidity and released on the website,
githup in the future.

1. Obtain product sales information, including sales amount at a duty free shop and refundable
EBCoin address of foreign tourists. Sign up with the private key of the duty free shop for the amount
corresponding to the following conditions. Afterwards, EBCoin and goods sales information are
recorded in the data area and change the refund slip status to completion.
- Primary condition: Refund possibility (ex: If the total amount exceeds 26.95 USD, export the
purchased item within 3 months by Korean standards)

25

2. The customs office confirms the EBCoin refund address of foreign tourists, and determine
whether the goods are approved for export as they confirm the recipient for refund, item, period
and other conditions.
- Passport of foreign toursits, refund slips are can be maintained in the EBCoin App, which is
encrypted.
3. Sign the export using the customs private key.
4. EBCoin will be transferred to the refund address of foreign tourists. After that, the refund status
changed into completion status.
As an additional exception, if the duty free shops do not pay the refund amount by the due date
specified in the smart contract, it is impossible to check the related information on the ledger.
Foreign tourists can request their refund on the basis of this, and customs will execute the following
terms and conditions after confirming whether the goods can be exported according to the refund
conditions in the smart contract.
How will coins that are refunded by foreign tourists be used?
The EBCoin is developed according to standards and can be partly transferred to others. A tax refund
service is made available on the system and users can sell the coin through exchanges, exchange
value with other tokens and carry out P2P transactions. Foreign tourists can exchange EBCoin at
ATMs and currency exchanges in their own country or at the airport. They can also spend money at
EBCoin affiliated merchants.
We provide the functions of a multinational tax refund and facilitate payments, settlements and
exchanges as an intermediary using EBCoin on the blockchain. With our system, there will be no
intermediaries such as existing refund service providers, payment gateway companies and banks.
Services for travelersâ€™ tax refund, currency exchange and payment will be built into a decentralized
application in the form of an electronic wallet platform.
Customs and duty free shops will also participate in each node and maintain consistency as they
continuously keep each of the same data while staying in sync. Every account managed by customs
and duty free shops will be controlled by a private key, with the state of the contract accounts which
is controlled by codes being changed through the transaction.
The EBCoin which is designed with this process has the following advantages for tax refund.
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢

Operate transparently and easily change the regulations according to the refund system
Improved security
Privacy protection
Global serviceability
26

â€¢

Eliminate monopoly in terms of services and profits

In addition to preventing forgery and falsification due to the loss of the actual slip, it is convenient to
report the zero tax rate from duty free shops and they can efficiently manage documentary
evidences. Furthermore, tasks of customs are simplified, efficiency also improved and the time
customers waited for services is shortened simultaneously.
We have been providing several services, such as online/offline payments and dynamic currency
conversion based on credit card to foreign customers for more than 10 years. One of our important
services is the payment service based on messenger, application and barcode.
Through Bitcoin, the blockchain became well-known throughout the world and thereâ€™s been a
growing interest in the value of the blockchain. We will use EBCoin as the right medium to create
points with our merchants through the tax refund market, payment service and currency exchange.

4. Services
4.1. EBCoin Wallet
To make EBCoinâ€™s tax refund, payment and currency exchange functions easier, we will create and
distribute the EBCoin wallet in the form of an e-wallet.
This will make the wallet available as SDK for Android and iPhone, which is easy to use especially in
global shopping applications. If the user installs only an electronic wallet in the form of SDK, various
services such as remittance and electronic payment using EBCoin will be available.

In the case of tax refund, foreign tourist can preserve information to scan their passport. In order to
check the refund slip from the wallet, the acceptable refund method is only EBCoin.

28

1. Scan a passport

2. Confirm a Refund Slip

3. Refund EBCoin

The structure of customs: After scanning the purchase serial number of a wallet with the goods
information and signing in with the private key, the coin is refunded to the wallet of the designated
foreign tourists. For currency exchange, users can withdraw the rest of their money through KIOSK,
ATM or currency Exchanges at airports. They can also receive EBCoin by sending it to their wallet
address.

29

1. The address receiving exchanged amount

2. Confirm the result

All EBCoin received through refund and the exchange process can be used for value exchange and
payment among users through the App. In addition, the user can use the blockchain as a reliable
intermediary by recording transfer conditions in the smart contract according to the use of EBCoin.

30

The primary form of the App will include the function to distribute EBCoin through smart contract
codes immediately upon token sale participation. The distributed coin can be confirmed in the userâ€™s
balance.
The second form is equipped with a password wallet function, which will support the
Create/Import/Export functions for the private key. With this, a user can create passwords for
EBCoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Lastly, the third form utilizes both wallet and signature functions of the private key. It will be useful
for direct transaction of the EBCoin among users. Also, the function for electronic payments
between users and merchants using EBCoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin will be made available. Various
forms of DApp with the EBCoin SDK; including tax refund, payments and currency exchange
functions will be made available in several channels in each designated country.

31

4.2. Kiosk and ATM
In order to use EBCoin tax refund and exchange function conveniently, we would like to develop
Kiosks linked with the EBCoin wallet and deployed at airports or duty free shops.
Kiosks will be deployed to supplement the manpower for customs in order to handle limited
confirmation of exports. In addition, Kiosks will be required to apply export confirmation without
visiting the customs departure inspection center when the cost of purchased goods is less than the
predetermined refund amount.
In the case of the tax refund function, if passport information and refund documents are stored in
the EBCoin wallet, customers can proceed for confirmation of exports at customs. If the travelerâ€™s
passport or refund slip is not registered, then they can register the serial number barcode of their
passport and refund slip through Kioskâ€™s reader. This will be automatically synchronized with the
EBCoin Wallet.
The functionality for Charging or withdrawal of local currency with EBCoin is also provided. With the
DApp, it is possible to immediately deposit and withdraw EBCoin using the present exchange rate.
Since the Kiosk system and the EBCoin Wallet complement each other, the Kiosk will be used
effectively when the DApp is unable to access the network or needs extra features for local currency
withdrawal.

5. EBCoin Roadmaps
5.1. Direction of Business Model and Marketing
As a global payment gateway provider, we will require a large pool of merchants. We plan to recruit
affiliates and partners to accommodate new and existing merchants on the platform. This way, we
will remain competitive and the EBCoin will attract more online and offline business compared to
other cryptocurrencies. We are planning to provide a free platform for our affiliates and partners; to
support our coin and get paid. We will also provide features for attaining membership and saving
points on the EBCoin platform.
