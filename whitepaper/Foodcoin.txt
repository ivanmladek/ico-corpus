Abstract
Food, in one way or in another, is the basis for business the activity
of any person. Food production and sales are and will be growing as the
population grows. Production of reasonable and quality organic products is
a problem which becomes more relevant day after day. Small and mediumscale farmers are the producers of local natural food. According to FAO
(Food and Agriculture Organization), the world counts with over 500 million
farmers. The most of them are small producers.
However, the traditional business models which exist today led the
major food brands and agricultural corporations to push the small and
medium-scale producers and processors of agricultural products and
foodstuffs out from the local markets. The globalization mechanisms help
them to tighten their domination easily, using their own material and
immaterial resources, on the markets of countries with less developed
economies.
Long chains of agricultural products delivery used by transnational
corporations, have led to a decline in the consumption of local products.
That has led, in its turn, to a reduction of the number of small and mediumscale farms (data from the United States and Europe), increase of the
average age of farmers (over 58 years), thus lowering the competitiveness,
turning the heavily fragmented market of agricultural products and
foodstuffs producers into the market of large corporations and
intermediaries.
Therefore, as an example, even in the United States a farmer gets
only 16 cents for every dollar paid by the final buyer for the products he has
produced. 2 billion of people on Earth (mostly rural population) do not have
any access to the banking services and are excluded from the modern
economic processes.
We do not set ourselves the task to strive against the transnational
corporations, and we don’t oppose globalization. We believe that these are
all attributes of the current moment of the development of our civilization.
Any form of confrontation leads inevitably to the destruction and losses. But
we cannot ignore the economic, social and humanitarian expenses of the
existing models.
So, our platform will be put up to provide an equal access to a global
market of production and distribution of consumable goods for the large
and small producers and consumers of agricultural products and foodstuffs
together with the modern financial instruments. This might create a vast
market of organic food with fair prices.

What is FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM
(FCE)?
FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM (FCE) is a blockchain ecosystem,
architecturally designed to create a global marketplace of food and
agricultural products on the existing platform of 1000EcoFarms with the
opportunity to add other platforms. FCE will be based on Ethereum
technology as a universal trading platform for businesses dealing with food
broadly defined.
The FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM deals will take place with the use of
smart contracts, while the transactions will accept a proper cryptocurrency
named FoodCoin (FOOD).
A wide selection of tools, such as a proper “smart” wallet, a remote
user identification system, flexibly configurable smart contracts,
authentication of the origin of food and a proper crypto payment processor,
will let the business process participants related to food choose and
customize the essential platform parameters to reduce current expenses.
We believe that this wide selection of FCE instruments might be used by the
farmers, manufacturers of agricultural machinery and fertilizers, farm
product processors, food manufacturers, cafes and restaurants, food
delivery services, etc.
A significant potential may be in using FoodCoin Ecosystem in social
projects. Using a combination of 1000EcoFarms and FoodCoin as an
additional alternative social currency for supporting the local systems and
ensuring the local food and economic security, will revive the local smallscale food producers and push the local economies to develop. These tools
will be interesting to the public authorities and municipalities, where
decisions are controlled by the local communities.
FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM has the plans to support food and ag startups with the verified model, innovation content and the significant growth
potential using the platform of 1000EcoFarms and FCE blockchain. The
special crypto fund will be founded with this aim of view. The purpose of
fund will be an effective use of liquid money to build an integral ecosystem.
Another essential scope of using FoodCoin Ecosystem will be nonprofit and charity organizations. The 1000EcoFarms platform has launched
two charity projects: "Stop Hunger" and "Help A Farmer". Using the
blockchain technology will simplify the addressed charity at the global level,
and make these activities completely transparent.

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM is planning to collaborate with government
and non-government organizations in the integration of blockchain
technologies to solve actual global problems, such as famine relief, disaster
relief, climate fluctuation, support of small farmers, uncontrolled global
migration of agricultural population.
As a payment instrument, the platform will use its cryptocurrency –
FoodCoin (FOOD). All the parties of the transactions will freely exchange
FoodCoin for goods and services, buy and sell FoodCoin on exchange
markets.
To ensure the quick and organic launch of the platform, we will use
strong marketing and training instruments as well as the support of the
community developed by our project.

The Mission of FOODCOIN
ECOSYSTEM
The Mission of FCE as a business platform is to form a fully-featured
ecosystem, bringing together all economic agents (sellers, distributors,
buyers, banks, insurance and logistics companies, tax services, customs,
etc.) into a single blockchain platform.
Small consumers of agricultural products, such as coffee shops,
restaurants, grocery stores, gastro-boutiques, will have access to the global
market proposals directly from the manufacturers, for example, to the
coffee from a plantation in Kenya, cheese and chocolate
from a small manufacturer in Switzerland or wine from a small winery in
France.
Using FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM and smart contracts, major food
producers and distributors may substantially reduce their expenses on
search and identification of new agents and contractors, as well as signing
and management of new contracts. Our goal is to create a platform with
simple and clear instruments available for simple farmers and producers
who are not familiar with the world of blockchain technologies. We
understand that apart from the technological limitations of blockchainplatforms, which are going to be solved over time, there are conception
limitations of the common users, who are not ready (and don’t have to) to
key into the technology, and should have a wide and convenient set of
instruments to solve their everyday business tasks as the consumers. Based
on this we are going to build a platform focused on the customer’s needs.
Small farmers, as well as the large producers and distributors, will get
equal access to FCE, creating a comprehensive global competition
environment for producers of food and agricultural products. With
minimum skills, the users will be able to find customers and suppliers, using
the interactive map of 1000EcoFarms. The smart contracts can be signed
without involving lawyers, and there is no need to maintain logistics
departments to connect with logistics companies. Lots of intermediaries will
be excluded from the transactions, and this will provide significant cost
savings on signing and managing the contracts. It will allow businesses to
better compete with the companies which make deals in a traditional way
(through intermediaries or maintaining large teams of law, logistics, etc.).

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

2.1

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM –
Feedback Loop
FoodСoin Ecosystem is designed as a transparent and accessible
system with simple registration procedure and the opportunity to enter
one’s profile by a click. Transparency and accessibility of the platform are
important for the growth and development of ecosystem under the
conditions of new economy and form the basis of the project. Blockchain
technology does not require a climate of trust among the parties of the
transactions. It creates the environment that will guarantee protection
against fraud without any need to trust the other party. The focus on
internal security and feedback loop are of great importance in the
architecture of the platform to enhance the security of the transactions.
Every successful transaction that was first initiated within the system
and had a weak initial impulse (because of the lack of trust) get quite
another (larger impulse) and the tendency to be repeated if it has passed all
the stages and has been completed successfully. But at the re-initialization,
it will have more significant input impulse that will grow further while
moving to the completion. Thus a classic feedback loop put into practice
within the balanced ecosystem with sufficient selection of instruments will
be generated.

11

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

2.2

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM –
Network Economic Model
FoodCoin Ecosystem is a network economic model that consolidates
farmers, buyers of natural food, restaurants and grocery shops owners,
members of buying clubs, manufacturers and distributors, logistics and
transport companies, customs brokers, insurance companies, state
certification authorities as well as customs and tax authorities.
Operating procedures within the platform and instruments for their
execution such as payment instruments and identification systems are
made for every type of users.
Global marketplace will provide sellers, distributors and
manufacturers with the unlimited access to new markets, the opportunity
to work both in local and global markets, the instruments for strategic
market research and business development planning. Using them
manufacturers and sellers will get a chance to make up for a shortfall of
current assets thus becoming competitive market players alongside with
major manufacturers and networks.
Having become the members of the platform, buyers and sellers will
get direct access to each other including private communication using the
integrated messenger. Network economy model will produce synergies for
all members of the ecosystem using co-operation with each other in
feedback loop system.
Thus the buyers will get access to the unlimited range of the original,
high-quality and low-priced goods and the sellers will get the growing flow
of favorably disposed consumers.
Getting access to FoodCoin Ecosystem state and control
organizations will get a convenient tool for financial crimes enforcement
(tax avoidance, struggle against counterfeit, etc.).
Being a marketplace with a variety of essential and useful
instruments, FoodCoin Ecosystem provides cost minimization and access to
financing and global marketing. Its users will get a technological competitive
advantage, the grounds for business expansion and the opportunity to
meet competition in this field.

What is 1000EcoFarms?

1000Ecofarms agreed to become an early adopter of FoodCoin
Ecosystem because the tools created by the FoodCoin Ecosystem can be
useful for users of 1000Ecofarms. In turn, FoodCoin Ecosystem is interested
in 1000Ecofarms platform because it has the necessary infrastructure to
attract farmers and food producers, as well as the possibility to provide
them with convenient tools of FoodCoin Ecosystem. At the first stage,
1000Ecofarms platform has integrated the FoodCoin token as one of the
payment methods for buying and selling food and sending and receiving
donations for farmers.
1000EcoFarms is a global marketplace for B2B and B2C projects
on the natural food market.
The 1000EcoFarms project became the first global natural food
marketplace which enables its users to make and accept payments
for food with crypto currency.
The users of 1000EcoFarms have access to the instruments of direct
marketing and the opportunity to sign agreements online, to make and
accept various types of payment (by cash, credit cards, PayPal and crypto
currency).
1000EcoFarms offers its users unique services designed for business
models such as buying clubs, food coops, CSA and herd shares (for users
from the US). Users get access to the platform via browser, as well as mobile
devices.

Structure and functionality of
the FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM
The implementation of the FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM project involves
creating of several basic functions essential for the quick and low-cost
transfer of the main traditional types of economic interactions among
various blockchain platform users:
• database in a distributed ledger;
• own crypto currency – the FoodCoin (FOOD) *;
• multi-functional advanced crypto wallet – the Wallok **;
• own payment system – the DiPay (DP) ***;
• remote user verification – the DIGID ****;
• system for smart contracts multisign – the Smaco *****;
• product authentication – the Product Origin ID (PRORID)
******.
FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM will have a hierarchical and customizable
system for the data access (personal, corporate, as well as smart contracts
data, transactions, guarantees, etc.).
Each element of the FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM structure will represent
a tool, organically linked with the rest of the platform, but capable to
operate as an independent element.
More detailed information about each element of the structure will
be presented below.

17

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

5

Technology

Ethereum-based blockchain will be used as a technological solution
to build FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM. This technology was selected mainly
because it allows you to optimally combine a distributed database storage
system, smart contracts and remote user identification on the platform.
Technically, FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM will provide a peer-to-peer
network of associated nodes (for data processing and storage). Each node
stores a complete copy of the FCE blockchain. These nodes are provided in
the architecture both of a private and open blockchain structure to
maximize the protection against unauthorized data modification.
A private blockchain structure model formed within a corporate
entity will constitute a closed system and will be available only to users with
private keys.
This mechanism will have a flexible customizable hierarchical
structure allowing to include or exclude from the monitoring and
administration of the objects such as smart contracts, various departments,
and services within the company, as well as external parties, such as partner
banks, insurance and logistics companies, customs brokers, tax services,
etc.

The concept of development

The advantages of FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM concept consists in the
fact that our easily scalable platform does not imply confrontation with
traditional financial institutions, excluding the competition with them as the
cause of counteraction from their part. Instead, FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM will
offer banks a cooperation and a wide range of instruments to generate new
sources of income and profit channels.
Banks will be offered a key role in the work of FCE:

Bank

DIGID user verifier (as
one of the required
participants of the
verification consensus)

ESCROW
payments
warranter

Cryptocurrency
exchange exit
gateway

Smaco contracts (as
one of the required
participants of the
verification consensus)

To date, the banks have a reliable and a proven user identification
and verification system, both for legal bodies and individuals. For sure, the
banks which work with FCE customers will be ready to confirm the reliability
of data of their customers to make transactions. The loyalty to the
FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM on behalf of the banks will potentially generate a
flow of new fresh and active clients. In addition, the banks will be interested
in offering their new "digital" and "crypto" clients such services as the
warranter of escrow payments and an exit gateway to the cryptocurrency
exchange markets.
19

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

Potential for cooperation

7

Since a major part of FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM instruments refers to
the fintech sphere, its cooperation with traditional and online banks seems
to be obviously perspective for the development of the platform. Moreover,
telecommunication companies with their wide database of identified users,
legal, insurance and logistics companies, numerous services of trade
management on the local, national or international level, should be an
extensive basis for cooperation.
There are two key factors that will motivate future partnerships:
• quick integration into the realities of the new global digital
economy with new sources of income;
• the risk of exclusion from the trade transaction chain and
reduction of the customer base with global implementation of
the blockchain.

20

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

The scheme of FOODCOIN
ECOSYSTEM work

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM will be a balanced ecosystem providing a set
of instruments, initially created to work on 1000EcoFarms. Further on these
instruments will be used on other platforms as well through open sources
and API.
Smart contracts Smaco will be available as a library of standard and
optionally customizable contracts and will be in the middle of FCE. All the
users will be able to customize them easily to solve various problems (with
standard and optional features).
The users will interact within the platform using the Wallok
cryptowallets. Numerous partners who have got identification resources
(banks, mobile network operators, notaries, insurance companies, etc.) will
act as user verifiers and escrow payments warranters. DiPay payments
processor will conduct fiat and cryptocurrency transactions quickly and
easily.
Over time, the public fiscal bodies will automatically connect to the
smart contracts for online monitoring of the business activity, eliminating
potential fraud with taxes (customs duties, excise taxes, income taxes, etc.).
Thus, the State structures responsible for the effective collection of taxes
will be interested in transferring real deals to the blockchain platform.

Road map

Implementation of the FCE project will go through several stages:
1. Market research (August 2017)
This round is necessary to test the concept of FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM
among potential investors and to assess the level of perception of the
project.
2. Establishing an Office in Lucerne, Switzerland (November 2017)
Switzerland is one of the few jurisdictions loyal to blockchain projects.
Also, the economy of Switzerland is founded on three pillars: finance,
agriculture, high-tech production. Thus, the two directions out of the three
combine perfectly in our project. Therefore, Switzerland will be the starting
point of the European direction in the development of 1000EcoFams and
FCE.
3. Token Generation Event. Sale. 1-st stage (December 2017)
At this stage, first FoodCoin tokens will be issued.
FoodСoin smart contract in the Ethereum network is the first version
of our internal payment system. The next stage of development of our
internal payment system is to create a software independent in its work
from the infrastructure of the Ethereum (eg, Ethereum miners).Thus, we
shall be able to significantly extend the functionality of the payment system
and to bring it to a new level.
When upgrading to the new version of FoodCoin, users will be
provided with a range of tools for a voluntary transition from the old to the
new version of the software (export of tokens into coins). Export from the
old version to the new one will be available for the unlimited period of time,
but technical support will be limited in time
It is easy to imagine such a transition with the example of text
documents. There is a simple and old txt format that allows you to store
simple text data (this is the analogue of FoodCoin of the first version). But
you can open a text document in MS Word, add pictures and formatting,
and save to doc (the equivalent of FoodCoin version 2). After changing txt to
doc, you get a lot of new functions, but you will not be able to read your
documents in simple text editors, like a notepad.
There is no right to change the old coin with the new one, since
FoodCoin will have the sole discretion to decide if and when it will change
from the Ethereum blockchain to another system.
4. Development of internal multifunctional multisig wallet Wallok
(December 2018).
23

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

5. Launching of Smaco smart contracts for closed and open
blockchains with a flexible customizable hierarchy of access and
administration (May 2019).
6. Development of DIGID technology (remote user identification)
(December 2019)
7. PRORID – products and goods origin authentication system
(October 2020).
8. DiPay - development of internal payment processor system.
Launching of this tool will be able after receiving of all kind of
Authorisations. (May 2021)

FOODCOIN – the structure and
the model
FoodCoin (FOOD) is a cryptocurrency underlying the FoodCoin
ecosystem as the payment instrument within its blockchain. It should be
noted that at the Token Generation Event stage when the FoodCoin
blockchain is not available yet the ERC-20 tokens will be issued. Initial
followers and the FCE community members can purchase these tokens to
support the project and give it a chance to be executed.
FoodCoin token is issued to launch own internal payment and
financial FCE instruments and for full local and international activity on the
basis of various platforms such as 1000EcoFarms and the others.
The FoodCoin tokens will be issued in 2 stages, during the Token
Generation Event.
- The first stage of the TGE will include the market research and the
ERC-20 tokens initial distribution. Market research was
successfully carried out in August-September 2017 and revealed a
high interest in the project and concern around the world with the
problems of production and fair distribution of food.
- All tokens that were distributed at the first round of TGE will be
the basis for the calculation of the total amount of tokens and
later of the FoodCoin cryptocoins. All the ERC-20 tokens
distributed at the first round of TGE will make 9% of the total
amount of tokens (and later of full-value FoodCoin cryptocoins)
that will be issued by the FoodCoin blockchain.
- At the second round of TGE another 31% of the ERC-20 tokens
will be distributed according the current exchange rate. Thus, the
total amount of tokens distributed among the initial FCE followers
will be 40%. The second round of FCE will take place before
FoodCoin blockchain is ready for launch. It will be the same token
ERC-20 with the same functionality as on the first phase of theTGE.
During the TGE the rate of 1 FoodCoin will be:
1 FOOD = 0,0001 ETH
ERC-20 tokens will start to be freely accessed and exchanged on
specialized crypto-exchanges after the end of the 1st stage of TGE. Thus the
market price of the FoodCoin cryptocurrency will be established for the
moment of its appearance.

25

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

The rest 60% of the total amount of cryptocoins will be distributed as
follows:
10% - social projects
20% - ecosystem development
15% - founder
10% - miners after creating of FoodCoin blockchain
2,5% - advisory board
2,5% - team

The development fund will be a separate fund and its activity will be
determined by the problems of maintaining and developing an integrated
ecosystem.
The miners reward will consist of 2 elements. They include the issue
of FoodCoins in favor of the miners for the work done as well as the fee that
he transaction participants will voluntarily assign for the confirmation of
26

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

their transactions. Over time, when the amount of emission
intended for mining will be equal to 10% of the total volume of emissions,
the miners will no longer receive compensation from the FoodCoin
Ecosystem itself but will continue to receive a commission for confirmation
of transactions. The volume of emissions for the miners should ensure
sufficient time for the FoodCoin Ecosystem to reach operating conditions.
As soon as the issue becomes impossible the mining will be maintained by
the internal fees established and balanced by the participants themselves
within the ecosystem. Mining programs will be available and the mining
model will allow everybody to make confirmation of the transactions within
the chain thus excluding the possibility of the artificially inflating prices for
the confirmation of the transactions. The fee for the activity within the
blockchain will be determined by the market itself.
The Social projects fund will be developed in cooperation with various
specialized
government,
non-government
and
non-commercial
organizations dealing with the problems of fighting hunger, support of local
farmers, food and agro projects, climate change problems, etc. The
spending will be targeted and will be accompanied by information support
so that all members of the community and the owners of the FoodCoins can
evaluate the results of this activity.
The advisory board fund will be founded to attract high-quality
experts in blockchain field, IT, logistics, social policy, monetary policy,
investments and credit policy.
The team fund will be used to stimulate the project stuff and enlarge
their number.
FoodCoin is not a type of stock or any other security, and it should
not be considered as an investment instrument.
FoodCoin is an internal payment instrument to be used on
1000EcoFarms platform and other platforms. The main task of the
FoodCoin cryptocurrency is to ensure the seamless operation of FoodCoin
Ecosystem.
The cost and value of the FOOD can vary over time, both upward and
downward. The FOOD will be traded on various exchanges that will
determine the cost and rate value to other crypto and fiat currencies, in
accordance with the demand and proposal.
FoodСoin cannot and should not be purchased for purposes other
than those declared in the FCE program.
We warn that the potential risks of using FoodCoin as an investment
or speculative instrument fall completely with those who decide to use
FOOD for investment or speculation.

Economic model & user cases

FoodCoin is a decentralized blockchain platform that allows you to
organize money circulation, social and business processes between a large
number of independent economic agents without trust to a single center or
any member of the network.
The introduction of a community currency and a technical blockchain
infrastructure leads to the simplification of settlements and the automation
of processes, thus leading to the elimination of intermediaries that are
common for centralized systems. As a result, all members of the process
(members of the chain of production, supply and consumption of food)
receive a significant increase in efficiency and reduction of costs.
All the advantages and user-cases of the platform can be divided into
2 large categories - social and economic.
A social user-case is a way of using a platform that leads to an
additional value, the cost of which cannot be measured directly. However,
this value is essential for all (or most) parties to a transaction / process and
is of apparent interest.
For example, the trust in the product in the supply-chain, since there
is its tracking from production stage to sales, reducing routine work,
automation of processes that were likely to fail in a centralized system.
Providing work opportunities that were previously impossible, etc.
The economic user-case is a way of using the platform, which leads
to the mutual economic benefit of the target participants of the process.
This is reflected in the mutual reduction of costs for the transaction process,
as well as on the reduction of the cost of intermediaries in the price
structure of the goods.
For example, this is expressed in a decrease in the cost of goods for
the final customer, because there is no income of several intermediaries in
the structure of its price. At the same time, this situation is also profitable
for the manufacturer, since the elimination of intermediaries enables him
to increase his margin, which will allow him to further develop production
of goods while reducing the final cost to the consumer.
The humanitarian user-case is the result of using the platform that
leads to the solution of a significant humanitarian problem. Usually, this is
the result of the effective work to solve economic and social problems in a
particular territory. This is due to the fact that the nature of inequality is

30

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

usually found in the economic and political structure. Frequently, the
instability of the political system leads to a significant increase in the risks
of investment, investments do not come, so the standard of living is low,
there is no possibility to introduce modern farming methods and pay for
exits to product markets. All this leads to the fact that despite the fertile
land, excellent climate and production opportunities, the farmer does not
have the opportunity to sell his goods to the foreign market, or gives this
function to the intermediary who solves this issue. In this case, the products
are bought at a knockdown price and resold in rich jurisdictions much more
expensive. Thus, the consumer does not have the opportunity to buy quality
products at an adequate price, and the farmer cannot emerge from poverty.
And this is a vicious circle.
In this case, the decentralized system is the technical basis for
building transparent and predictable social and economic relations. The
most significant points are the following: independent monetary circulation,
the possibility of building automatically-executable contracts (smartcontracts), fixing obligations and reputation, building transparent supply
chains, transparent systems of support and distribution of funds.
It should be noted that the optimization of the supply chain is one of
the most important tasks in this system. There are two types of
intermediaries in these chains: intermediaries-parasites and intermediaries
that create real value added in the process of their work. As the first
category (parasites), we consider resellers and those who use the fact that
the farmer has no out-reach to the final consumer or distributor and add a
significant part of the price, without increasing the value of the product.
Intermediaries that add real value is the category of entities, which include
logistics companies, customs brokers, consignment warehouses, banks,
insurance companies. These intermediaries allow you to carry out the
necessary work, for example, qualitative delivery of cargo, its customs
clearance (in the current reality, it is necessary to formalize relations with
state bodies when crossing borders), and so on.
Let us consider the technical mechanics of the platform. Globally, you
can divide all the directions into the following:
1. Token FOOD as a technical unit (gas) for the platform and token
FOOD as a currency token and its circulation for mutual settlements of
economic agents on the platform.
2. The system of smart contracts (digital contracts). Apply of one or
more contracts to organize the supply chain in the B2B, B2C, P2P models.
3. The system of digital reputation of economic agents
4. The ability to register their own manufactured goods on the
blockchain (for use in paragraph 2).
5. The ability to create their own derivative currencies of local
communities on the FoodCoin blockchain
31

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

6. Possibility of flexible construction of additional user-cases of the
platform using the smart-contracts
Technical capabilities are just the foundation for social processes. Let
us consider the social processes on the platform (items are saved):
1. The independent currency of the community allows you to make
mutual settlements in a convenient format, without borders and obstacles.
Reliable fixing of payment and security.
2. The system of smart-contracts (digital contracts) allows you to
conduct a supply chain from the manufacturer to the final consumer or
distributor in the region transparently and with a minimum of complexities.
Only the intermediaries that create value are involved in the chain and their
services are clearly regulated by time and cost.
3. Digital reputation motivates users to conduct honest long-term
business and is a significant additional value in the market
4. An important aspect for the formation of supply chains and
identification by the farmer of his goods in digital form
5. Certain local communities can issue their own currency on the
basis of FOOD crypto currency for internal mutual settlements. This will
create an additional cost base, which, if necessary, can be used to support
the activities of the economy (you will find the example later)
It should be noted that all of the above-mentioned items contain
mainly a technical basis (and as a consequence, induce social processes)
that convert the opportunity to supply goods and eliminate unnecessary
intermediaries. In addition, marketplaces (one of them is 1000EcoFarms)
will be implemented, where buyers and sellers will be able to find each other
and further use all the technical and social benefits for mutual settlements.
Let us consider the general scheme of the economy of the platform:

32

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

Other currency

Exchange

User 4

User 1

User 3

User 2

User 5

The economy of the FoodCoin platform has a digital payment unit
FOOD. The number of FOOD is limited mathematically and is embedded in
the source code. The users interact within the system, transferring tokens
to each other. The platform has a closed economy and interacts with the
outside world through the exchange, where the FOOD rate to other
currencies and digital assets is determined. FOOD is the basic asset on the
platform. When the local currencies of the community of the platform users
are created, their circulation is carried out according to the same scheme,
with the exchange for FOOD on the internal decentralized exchange.
With reference to the fiat currencies of the outside world, the FOOD
token refers to a deflationary model because of the limited emission. The
value of the token depends on its demand for the community and, as a
consequence, the ratio of BUY / SELL orders on the exchange (the price of
the asset can only be determined in the transaction). Obviously, if the
system is in demand in the outside world, the FOOD token will be regularly
bought for fiat currencies or other crypto-currencies.
Closed condition is an important point of monetary circulation.
Closed condition means that the token will mostly apply for goods and
services within the platform, i.e. without selling it for another currency. For

33

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

example, a farmer who received FOOD in payment for the goods paid for
the work of his contractors and raw materials to produce his products in
FOOD tokens, and the producer of raw materials then bought something
else and so on:
Farmer 1

Consumer
payment in FOOD coins

FOOD coins BUY

FOOD coins

Raw materials
provider

FOOD coins SELL

Exchange

It is obvious that the goal is to create such a community on the
platform and such value from participation in the community so that the
duration of the token circulation (the number of transactions before
entering the exchange for sale) was the maximum. Then the price of the
token will be stable due to a decrease in the offer on the exchange; and in
the deflationary model, together with an increase in interest and new users
on the platform, it will lead to an increase in the price of the token in the
long term.
We have considered the simple turnover of the token on the platform.
Now let us consider a real case of selling a product by a farmer using supplychain technology to a consumer from another country (see the figure
below). The fulfillment of the terms of the smart-contract is checked at every
stage of the chain. The conduct of operational activities in the collaboration
with the mentioned intermediary structures through a smart-contract will
automate the process and make it transparent. In addition, delivery
monitoring is planned including the use of sensors T, pressure and others
on delivery to monitor compliance with the transport conditions of the
product. Using this system a farmer can essentially conduct a p2p or b2b

34

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

transaction when the remaining links in the chain work according to a given
algorithm with an understandable execution control.

It is obvious that the elemental case is a p2p sale by sending a private
parcel, however it limits the quantity of goods and narrows the conditions
of dispatch. Therefore, the case of full delivery of goods in the current reality
from a farmer from one country to another was considered. It is important
to note that the bank can act as a transaction verifier, and the services of
service providers (customs brokers, logistics companies) can be paid from
the funds deposited on the contract. Further, these organizations
(theoretically, in the presence of legislation) can exchange these tokens into
a fiat currency on the stock exchanges. In this approach, it is important that
it is possible to send a p2p delivery essentially, automating other
intermediate iterations, making this path simple in terms of routine and
transparent.
Using supply-chain on the platform allows not only to automate the
delivery process but also to identify the history of the product's origin:

35

FOODCOIN ECOSYSTEM

Bread

Flour

Wheat
Elevator

FOOD
Coins

Oil

Consumer

This scheme assumes that wheat, flour and butter were produced by
farmers with the identification of the product with the help of a blockchain
system. Thus, the consumer knows from what products this bread is baked
of, and (ideally) also the structure of the price of this bread.
Thus, as indicated above, the platform allows farmers, consumers
and other process participants to interact transparently and in the most
automated manner. This allows you to remove parasitic intermediaries and
reduce costs, reducing the final price of the product for the consumer and
increasing the margin for the farmer by optimizing the price structure.
Further, we should discuss the introduction by local regional farmers
associations of their local currencies and their place and the value created
in the FoodCoin ecosystem.
First of all, the creation of FoodCoin and other currencies on the
platform is aimed at creating a universal payment instrument in the
community. This payment instrument creates a capitalization of value (in
fact, a little new monetary base is created), which allows to reduce the deficit
of working capital. A significant problem in farms in developing countries is
the high cost of loans and the difficulty of obtaining them. Therefore, in the
future, it is logical to issue local currencies for many communities around
the world.

Thus, monetary circulation on the platform will be supplemented with
local currencies in the future. All such local currencies will support the
capitalization of the main asset - FOOD. Releasing their local currencies,
farmers' communities will be able to resolve liquidity shortages.
Thus, we have discussed the aspects of monetary circulation (the
deflationary model, the length of circulation before entering the exchange,
the model of the supply chain, the creation of local currencies).
Conclusion: The value of the platform is to eliminate numerous
intermediaries, optimize costs, build simple and transparent ways of
forming supply and payment chains. One of the important cases is the
possibility of creating their own currencies for local farmers' communities,
which can help to solve the problem of high cost of money and lack of
liquidity within one closed community or a set of such communities. Using
all solutions (economic, social and technical) together, it is possible to
achieve a completely new level of the agricultural products disposal and
farming activities by the mechanisms of adding value to the system. Value
is not taken anywhere, it is formed by the community itself through active
use of the payment instruments and technologies.

What is DIGID?

DIGID (Digital Identity Verification Platform) is a remote user
verification system built on a decentralized Ethereum-based blockchain
platform.
Full application of blockchain technology in the business
environment would be impossible without powerful and secure user
identification tools.
User identification will be voluntary, but at the same time, an
essential condition to participate in the platform in its business
implementation.
How is the user identified?
• The parties of a smart contract transaction can request a oneway or mutual verification to the other party of the transaction.
For this purpose, parties of a transaction exchange DIGID
username public keys (tokens). In order to get a full DIGID, the
user will have to obtain a confirmation of its profile from a third
party platform user.
• The user is identified only once and it remains so in the system
as a digital entry forever and can be requested automatically
during the verification request.

What is Smaco?

Smaco (Smart Contract) is a flexibly administered smart contract
with the function of multiple inputs and outputs. Smaco will have integrated
horizontal and vertical connections between the transaction parties.
A smart contract will be managed by one or more administrators. A
hierarchy with rights will be configured by an FCE user who created the
smart contract.
All administrators horizontally integrated into the current smart
contract will have the same rights and cannot be removed or restricted in
smart contract management rights after signing it.
Each administrator will be able to create a vertically integrated private
blockchain for personal service within the current smart contract. The
administrators will not have access to private blockchain of another
administrator.
Additional parties to the transaction can be invited by the
administrators on their own initiative or on the basis of consensus, and
become either parties or verifiers of the current smart contract.
An open library of standard Smaco contracts with an intuitive
interface for connecting additional options will be created.
Creating and maintaining Smaco contracts will not require programming
skills. Working with Smaco will be usable for everyone.

What is PRORID?

PRORID is products and goods origin authentication system.
Actually, PRORID will be a type of Ethereum-based smart contract.
An essential condition to prove the origin of the goods or product in
the PRORID system will consist in signing a smart contract by one or more
experts (public, commercial or private) with an undisputed authority in
matters of origin authentication of the goods that are the subject of an
agreement in the framework of the current Smaco contract.
If a smart contract includes a PRORID feature, the logistics company
will be obliged to accept the goods only after confirmation from the experts
on the current smart contract based on the consensus between the parties
of the contract.
PRORID integration with the electronic databases of public fiscal,
customs and supervisory authorities will significantly limit the circulation of
illegal, counterfeit and other illicit trafficking products and goods, thus
making a significant contribution to the fight against economic crimes.

Conclusion
This document set out a conceptual vision of the FCE ecosystem. This
concept is based on the understanding that the dynamic changes in the
mentality of consumers have an equally dynamic and often dramatic impact
on numerous markets. All the elements of sales chains are experiencing
discomfort from changes (from small farmers to large banks and insurance
companies). Creating and developing the 1000EcoFarms platform, we can
see how users' requests change. The consumers are no longer willing to
restrict themselves by the established frames which may now be called
obsolete. We see the solution in the use of new technologies and their
implementations.
Blockchain technology is certainly promising and is at a very early
stage of its development. We strive to create workable and comprehensive
solutions for personal and corporate use.
The decision to issue our own cryptocurrency in several steps should
demonstrate the relevance of this concept on the one hand, and to enable
to smooth out excessive volatility on the other, in case of high demand.
Creating and developing the FoodCoin ecosystem, comfortable and
useful for many purposes, we accelerate the beginning of a new era of
development of the food production and consumption market.
