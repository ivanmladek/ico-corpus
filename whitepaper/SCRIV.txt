INTRODUCTION TO SCRIV
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The SCRIV network can verify the existence of digital data at any point in time. This data is linked
with a publicly verifiable date and time (timestamp) to provide data assurance. This link can be
verified without the need for a centralized service or third-party authority. The data assurance
of the SCRIV Network allows users to verify data ownership and its originality.
1.2 TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVED
1.2.1 Hashing
Hashing is the process of submitting data to the input of a hashing algorithm which returns a
short hash identifier (that allows for the data to be uniquely distinguished) as output. This
output is called a "hash."
The hash is used to quickly distinguish datasets without having to compare the entire contents.
This single process of comparison occurs only once and is much faster than comparing every bit
of data. If the hashes are different, the data is not the same. If the hashes match, then, with a
probability of 99.99%, the data is the same.
The hashing algorithm meets the following criteria:



Matching data always returns the same unique hash.
Non-matching data sets return a unique hash for each set. However, this
condition is not always fulfilled completely. When a hash is assigned to
non-matching data, it is 99.99999% unique.

1.2.1 Proof-of-work
Also referred to as POW, the proof-of-work system is very effective at protecting the network
from abuse (i.e. DoS attack). With POW, complicated operations are solved on the client side,
and then easily and quickly verified on the server side. The primary benefit of POW is the
validation of the asymmetry of the time expenditure. "The network timestamps transactions by
hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot
be changed without redoing the proof-of-work." [1].
1.2.3 Masternodes
Typical blockchain nodes are servers which run on a decentralized P2P network. These nodes
allow peers to send and receive updates across the network. The nodes require the ability to
handle significant amounts of traffic and other resources and carry substantial cost with little
reward. It is for this reason that the number of Bitcoin nodes has decreased continuously. "Much
of the reason for the decrease of full nodes on the Bitcoin network, is the lack of incentive to run
one. Over time the cost of running a full node increases as the network gets used more, creating
more bandwidth and costing the operator more money." [2]
Masternodes solve this problem. "Masternodes are full nodes, just like in the Bitcoin network,
except they must provide a level of service to the network and have a bond of collateral to
participate. Collateral is never forfeit and is safe while the Masternode is operating. This allows
investors to provide a service to the network, earn interest on their investment and reduce the
volatility of the currency." [2]
1.2.4 IPFS Network
What is IPFS? IPFS is a distributed file system which synthesizes successful ideas from previous
peer-to-peer systems, including DHTs, BitTorrent, Git, and SFS. The contribution of IPFS is
simplifying, evolving, and connecting proven techniques into a single cohesive system, greater
than the sum of its parts. IPFS presents a new platform for writing and deploying applications

and a new system for distributing and versioning large data. IPFS could even evolve the web
itself.



SCRIV NETWORK

www.scriv.network

IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository.
In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with
content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon
which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS
combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying
namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other. [3]
IPFS is an ambitious vision of new decentralized Internet infrastructure, upon which many
different kinds of applications can be built. At the bare minimum, it can be used as a global,
mounted, versioned filesystem and namespace, or as the next generation file sharing system. At
its best, it could push the web to new horizons, where publishing valuable information does not
impose hosting it on the publisher but upon those interested, where users can trust the content
they receive without trusting the peers they receive it from, and where old but important files
do not go missing. IPFS looks forward to bringing us toward the Permanent Web. [3]
1.3 NETWORK STRUCTURE AND OPERATION
The SCRIV Network's operation algorithm is as follows (See fig. 1)
1. User load data to be verified (PDF, JPEG, ZIP) in the wallet.
2. SHA3 Hash is generated.
3. Wallet checks the SCRIV blockchain to determine if this is new data or if has it already been
established on the blockchain in the past.
- New Data -> Launch Data Assurance Process
1. User pays assurance fee [see Additional Rewards].
2. Data is saved to IPFS network (generation of
service data).

3. All required verification data is inserted into the
next block of the SCRIV blockchain.
- Previously Assured Data -> Launch Verification process
1. Search the SCRIV blockchain for the service data.
2. The algorithm returns IPFS address of the data.
Verified data can be accessed on the IPFS network through the SCRIV block explorer when the
necessary conditions are satisfied [see ‚ÄúPrivacy and anonymity‚Äù].

1.4 ADDITIONAL REWARDS
In addition to the rewards paid for block generation, miners and masternode operators receive
assurance fees. These fees are paid by the user. [see ‚ÄúNetwork structure and operation‚Äù]. The first
part of this reward is included in the next block and paid to the miner who found it. The second
part is distributed equally among all running masternodes.
This procedure greatly reduces inflation and ensures that the natural circulation of SCRIV will
occur.
1.5 PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY
All user-dependent SCRIV operations are available within the wallet. The SCRIV network
provides a fast and secure connection between the user, the blockchain, and the IPFS network.
Our blockchain is built upon the Dash source code, and all network transactions and file
transfers are secured with high-level encryption.
By default, public keys are private. However, a user can request to link his identity to his public
key. This requires that personal information is confirmed. Once this information has been
verified, the users public key will then be appropriately labeled.
By default, all verified data is encrypted before it is saved to the IPFS network. However, it is also
possible to save it as-is so that it will be publicly available.

2. USE CASES
The SCRIV network is open to everyone. From emergency operations to everyday use, from
large companies to educational institutions. It can be used by lawyers, copywriters, artists, etc.
Here are some potential use cases:
2.1. DEMONSTRATING DATA OWNERSHIP WITHOUT REVEALING ACTUAL DATA
This can be used to help protect content creators as well as retailers who sell digital goods. The
content creator can protect his content by assigning a unique identifier (hash) on the SCRIV
network which he can then give to authorized resellers. The customer can then be confident
that the reseller owns the rights to sell the content by checking the assigned hash on the SCRIV
network.
2.2 DOCUMENT TIMESTAMPING
This functionality can be used within the sphere of law where determining the originality of
data plays a significant role. The SCRIV network can verify that digital data (documents, photos,
videos, etc.) has not been altered or modified since being immutably registered and
timestamped on the SCRIV blockchain.
2.3 VERIFYING DOCUMENT INTEGRITY
The SCRIV network can be used to ensure the integrity of business documents and contracts.
When a document is registered on the SCRIV network it will be impossible for changes to be
made without the knowledge of both parties. If changes are made, the document will fail
validation.
2.4 PREVENTING UNWANTED DUPLICATION AND OVERWRITING
The usage of the SCRIV blockchain, in combination with the IPFS network, protects against
unwanted storage duplication and the overwriting of documents.

CONCLUSION



SCRIV NETWORK

www.scriv.network

The SCRIV network provides a state-of-the-art solution to the problems of human error and
the high-costs of data verification. It also provides a viable data verification process that spans
across a plethora of industries and provides long-needed innovation in the data storage,
real-time data verification, and protection of content authorship space.
The network is fast. It can process more than 100 data sets/second, extract their unique secure
cryptographic identifiers, build a cryptographic tree with all this data in real-time, and publish
the result to the SCRIV blockchain.
SCRIV also proves privacy. All the data sent to the network is encrypted with cryptographic
identifiers (hashes) before hitting the SCRIV blockchain. Since hashes are oneway cryptographic algorithms, users can prove that a determinate hash relates to their data, but no one
will ever be able to obtain that data by only having its hash.
SCRIV is an industry disrupting technology which eliminates the necessity of scriveners and
lawyers. The SCRIV blockchain performs these jobs with greater speed safety and cost-efficiency.
What will you be able to do with SCRIV?
