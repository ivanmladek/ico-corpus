Abstract
Beenest is the first decentralized home-sharing network built on top of a set of Bee Protocols
that connects hosts with guests without taking any commissions. The Beenest dApp and the
Bee Protocols are powered by the ERC-20 utility token called the BEE token. The Bee Protocols
are open Ethereum protocols that can power other future sharing economy dApps. These
protocols provide the Beenest network with three essential systems:
1. A secure payment system that allows two authenticated P2P entities to send and
receive money that gets held in Bee Tokens until after a successful exchange of services
between the two entities.
2. A decentralized arbitration system that resolves user disputes , providing positive
incentives to grow a network of genuine arbiters and negative incentives to deter
scammers.
3. A reputation system that couples a valid identity, which is obtained by a trusted digital
fingerprint protocol on the Ethereum blockchain, with a rating determined by
transparent, immutable review and scoring interchange between P2P entities (such as
guests and hosts).
This whitepaper expounds upon the Beenest platform and the Bee Protocols. We aim to offer
transparency into our token metrics and a future roadmap of development and expansion. We
will discuss how Beenest creates and preserves value for hosts, guests, arbiters, and
developers within a decentralized autonomous organization and how our decentralized model
offers distinct advantages over the predominant, centralized home sharing model.

Background
Bitcoin’s emergence in January 2009 created a paradigm shift encouraging decentralization
through the introduction of a global distributed open ledger. The concept behind Bitcoin
proved to many there was no longer a need for central banks, beginning the movement
towards “decentralization.” This movement was accelerated in 2015 with the launch of the
Ethereum Blockchain and the introduction of smart contracts, which enables any developer to
create a new genre of decentralized applications, commonly referred to as “dApps.” These
dApps use the power of the blockchain to allow for secure and trustless asset transfer within
the Ethereum network, eliminating the need for centralized middlemen from many business
models.
In Q4 2017, Bitcoin and Ethereum hit all-time highs (1 BTC surpassing $18,000 USD), pushing
the overall market capitalization of cryptocurrencies to hundreds of billions of dollars.
Cryptocurrency is becoming mainstream, enjoying an ever-increasing adoption rate from
investors worldwide.
Simultaneously, peer-to-peer sharing economy applications, typified by Uber and Airbnb, have
achieved meteoric success in the past few years. However, these platforms extract high
commission fees from their users in order to to run. Airbnb’s astronomic growth from $0 to
$31 billion is only enjoyed by a select few -- the founders and VCs. Without any interest in the
company, very little, if any, of the appreciation value goes back to the guests and hosts. These
are the same guests and hosts who form the backbone of this two-sided marketplace. At Bee
Token, we believe that these invaluable contributors, as first-class participants in the network,
deserve to be rewarded for the platform’s growth through increased utility value of their
tokens.
Thanks to Ethereum smart contracts, it is now possible to build a truly decentralized and
automated sharing economy platform. This will be done with no middlemen and thus 0%
commission, meanwhile sharing the wealth with the users in a two-sided marketplace.
Millennials and Generation X-ers who are investing heavily in cryptocurrencies are also
fueling the sharing economy, specifically the home sharing industry.
Given the growing acceptance of the sharing economy and increased usage of digital
currencies, Beenest’s launch comes at a growth inflection point for our target market.

Value Propositions
I. Aligning Incentives
In its current climate, the sharing economy is plagued with misaligned incentives with the most
common example being that as a company grows, the user base is left dissatisfied. A well
known example is that of Uber drivers. Intermediaries like Uber increasingly extract value from
users as their network grows. Drivers today earn far less compared with early years, yet costs
per rider have not significantly decreased. When market demand increases for a good or
service, network participants should benefit when new equilibrium prices are reached. Instead,
companies arbitrage these shifts to capitalize on value added by their community. The majority
of that value is captured by founders and venture capitalists, and shareholders are excessively
rewarded in the event of an IPO or acquisition. Though these earliest investors receive
handsome rewards, early drivers on the platform have only been met with decreased earnings
for the initial value they added to Uber.
Through decentralization, Beenest is able to
disrupt the currently available sharing
economy models. At the same time,
tokenization creates benefits for early
adopters and token holders, thereby aligning
user incentives toward further growth of the
Bee network. We can accelerate user
participation by giving everyone in the
network the opportunity to earn tokens
through referral programs and arbitration.
Additionally, Beenest corrects for market
saturation by continuously incentivizing
guests and hosts to contribute to the
network by utilizing the Bee Token.

Tokenization creates benefits for early adopters and token holders, thereby aligning user
incentives toward further growth of the Bee network.

II. Lower Transaction Fees
Centralized home sharing platforms rely on multiple intermediaries to conduct their
transactions. Each intermediary adds a cost that hosts and guests end up paying for. In these
centralized platforms, transaction fees can range from 10% to 22%, broken down as follows:
●
●
●

●

Platform Fees (3% - 15%) - ​Centralized home sharing platforms charge a commission
to use their platform, which is incurred by hosts and guests.
Financial Institutions Fees (3%) - ​Financial institutions such as Visa and Mastercard
charge flat fees for managing transactions.
Foreign Transaction Fees (3%) - ​A transaction usually requires different
denominations. As a result, foreign transaction fees are charged for transactions made
outside the country where the user credit/debit card was issued.
Currency Conversion Fees (1%) - ​Currency Conversion Fees are the result of the
Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC), a fee charged to see the transaction cost in your
preferred currency denomination. DCC rates tend to be worse than traditional rates,
but some platforms are known to charge the currency conversion fee unbeknownst to
the user.

Beenest simply charges 0% commissions to hosts and guests utilizing BEE, thanks to smart
contracts automating transactions that bypass commission-based platforms, financial
institutions, and currency denominations. As the Bee token is used for all transactions, there
are no foreign transaction fees or currency conversion fees, and all savings are passed back to
the hosts and guests holding the token.
Beenest charges 0% commissions to hosts and guests utilizing BEE, thanks to smart contracts
automating transactions that bypass commission-based platforms, financial institutions, and
currency denominations.
Beenest only takes a tiny cost for “gas” (a few cents per transaction), in addition to a nominal
insurance fee to help cover host liabilities. Beenest also welcomes newcomers into the
ecosystem by allowing the use of fiat but for a small commission:
●
●

1% commission for BTC, ETH (or other utility ERC20 tokens)
3.99% commission for fiat

This commission is charged for guests when they chose a pay-in method other than BEE, and
for hosts who prefer to get paid-out in other than BEE.

III. Increased Security & Trust
Beenest provides a seamless user experience based on trust and security through the
blockchain. By using its in-house Bee Token, the Beenest platform provides its hosts and
guests with privacy, security, and freedom.
In order to use Beenest, users have to first sign up and go through a basic KYC (know your
customer) process to ensure that users are real and authenticated. Beenest can seamlessly
integrate with 3rd party authentication platforms and correlates identities with a weighted
reputation score on the Bee reputation protocol.
Beenest handles updating the reputation scores in the protocol and pulls the scores whenever
needed, e.g. in the case of a conflict. Higher scores mean better credibility, and ranges are
bucketed as Lowest, Low, Neutral, High, Highest.
●
●

●

●

●

Lowest (0):​ ​the user signed up but didn’t provide a wallet address
○ will not allow users to host or book a place but can browse the website
Low (1-5): t​ he user authenticated by providing a wallet address along with basic KYC
authentication: name, email, address, birthday, ...
○ will allow users to book but not host
○ will drive up cancellation fees for hosts and guests with Low rep score
Neutral (6-10): i​ n addition to fulfilling Low requirements, the user uploaded a valid
proof of identification (US Driver's License, Passport, Home Ownership)
○ will allow users to book and host
High (11-20):​ in addition to fulfilling Neutral requirements, user has either booked or
hosted
○ will drive down security deposit price for guests
○ will drive down cancellation fee
Highest (21-100): ​in addition to fulfilling High requirements, user has given a review to
a host or guest
○ users can set lower cancellation fees/security deposits
○ users can bypass cancellation thresholds

Transparent Reviews
Reviews are meant to represent an honest critique of a user’s experience with a service or
product with the intention of informing a larger audience. However, the problem with all
centralized platforms is that these same platforms have the ability to modify and delete data at
will. Feedback credibility can become skewed with no paper trail while honest opinions can
sometimes be misrepresented.
In the class action lawsuit of B
​ oris Y. Levitt vs. Yelp! Inc1, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that Yelp! Inc. has the legal right to manipulate their data. Yelp! Inc. has set the legal
precedence of data manipulation which raises serious questions whether interactions with
centralized platforms can be truly genuine. There are also multiple precedences of modified
reviews concerning Airbnb.2
Beenest encourages guests and hosts to review each other after the checkout date. Reviews
are stored on the blockchain through the Bee reputation protocol and linked to the host/guest
identities. To ensure privacy and keep gas costs at a minimum, reviews are encrypted and
stored off-chain with only a hash of the review being posted on the blockchain. This ensures
immutability and prevents post-hoc modification of any review.
Before being posted, the reviews go through a filter that uses ML and pattern detection to flag
profanity or racist reviews. In those cases the reviews will not be posted, and the reviewer’s
reputation score gets a bump down. In extreme cases, the reviewer will get banned from
using Beenest.

Bee Protocols (P-A-R)
P​ayment-​Ar​ bitration-​Re
​ putation
While the Ethereum platform is still in its infancy, new second layer protocols are pushing it to
become more suitable for building complex sharing economy applications like Beenest. The
Bee Protocols will greatly benefit Ethereum by providing solutions for trustless decentralized
payments and the inherent problems of any network: conflicts and malicious users.
These protocols are designed so that existing centralized sharing economy applications like
Couchsurfing or Airbnb can hook into our protocols to tokenize their offerings if they choose -giving them access to a larger and untapped market of crypto-enthusiasts. These three
protocols can be remembered by the acronym “P-A-R”: Payment, Arbitration, and Reputation.
1. Payment Protocol​ - send and receive tokens held until fulfillment of service
2. Arbitration Protocol​ - solve disputes through trustless voting
3. Reputation Protocol​ - manage reputation scores for all P2P entities

The 3 Bee Protocols are mutually beneficial and thus follow Metcalfe’s Law. Metcalfe’s law
states that a network increases its value and utility as the number of shared nodes in the
network increases. Given that the P-A-R Protocols are meant to be used as a bundle, the value
of all the protocols increases quadratically with the number of dApps built on top of them, the
same way Ethereum value increases as the number of shared protocols increase.
Metcalfe’s Law:

V ∝ N²
●
●

V: Value/Utility of a network
N: Total # of dApps/users using 1 protocol

V = ∑ Vᵢ ∝ ( ∑ Nᵢ )²
●

Value of individual protocol = square sum of all dApps/users

Benefits of using the BEE P-A-R Protocols as a bundle:
●
●
●

Faster Development Cycle - C
​ ompanies will be able to increase efficiency and launch
products faster, pre-empting competition and increasing market share.
Reduced Integration Costs - ​By bundling our 3rd party integrations into our protocols,
developers reduce integration time while getting extensive functionality.
Faster Network Bootstrapping - ​Using the Bee Protocols means having access to
users, their payment history, arbitration history, and reputation scores across all dApps
built on the Ethereum platform. This helps companies determine who are the good
actors, overcoming the "cold start" problem when bootstrapping a new network.

The Bee P-A-R Protocols follow the best engineering practices that ensure they are generic,
cost efficient, and seamless:
●

●

●

Generic​ - The Bee protocols are designed to be useful and reusable in order to be
interpolated for further sharing economy and marketplace dApps such as rentals,
ridesharing, and e-commerce.
Cost Efficient​ - Protocols need to be cost efficient by optimizing the use of gas. In
addition, dApps should be given the option to utilize cheaper alternatives for expensive
on-chain transactions, by offloading heavy and complex computations to traditional
cloud-based solutions. This introduces centralization and is a reasonable stopgap
solution while looking for a long term scalable blockchain solution.
Seamless​ - We believe that early dApps need to be usable by the general population
through a seamless user experience that handles Ethereum’s current and future
limitations while masking the overall complexity of the blockchain.

All Bee code is public and open source to allow improvements, but also to define a set of best
practices to inspire a future generation of sharing economy dApps to emerge: a decentralized
Craigslist, eBay, Uber, and more that we haven’t dreamed of yet.

Beenest is built on top of the pillars of the Bee protocols and other existing second layer
Ethereum protocols. An early implementation of an Ethereum dApp must understand the
limitations of Ethereum so it properly switches between on-chain/off-chain use of the
blockchain.
In addition to the Bee Protocols, we are going to be partnering with other strategic protocols:
1. Conversions -​ Flexible pay-in and pay-out conversion between BEE, BTC, ETH, and fiat.
2. KYC & Identity -​ It’s important that all users of Beenest go through identity verification.
3. Marketplace -​ Integrating with strategic marketplace protocols would allow for
decentralized listings and bookings.
4. Auditing -​ All of our smart contracts and protocols will be audited by 3rd parties.

We now go into more details of each of the Bee P-A-R Protocols.

I. Payment
Payment lives at the core of the Bee Protocols and allows demand-entities to pay
supply-entities after the supply entity delivers the proper goods or services to the demand
entity, or after some predefined time in the future.
Beenest uses the Bee payment protocol to allow guests to pay hosts for bookings. Both guests
and hosts send Bee tokens to the payment smart contract. When the booking checkout date
passes, and no conflicts arise, the contract dispatches the tokens to the appropriate
addresses. In case of a conflict, the entire sum of tokens gets held in a third arbitration address
that the dApp provides. In case of cancellation after the determined cancellation cut-off time, a
fee will be moved from the canceling entity to the other entity.
If a host cancels a day before the booking, they lose their cancellation tokens, and the guest
takes them. This is unlike other platforms that do not pay the guests in case of cancellation. On
these platforms, this no-fault cancellation serves only to punish guests.
The payment contract keeps track of all the payments in progress (keyed by a payment ID), as
well as any payments that went to arbitration. Once the dispatch is done, the payment contract
will drop the in-progress payment. Similarly, it will drop the arbitration payments once the
arbitration protocol signals to the payment protocol that it is done.

II. Arbitration
Every system of payment that requires trust (i.e. exchange of physical goods and services)
needs a third party to mitigate misbehavior. The arbitration protocol acts as the hub for
dispute resolution. Participants stake BEE tokens to the arbitration protocol contract in order
to participate in the arbitration network. The stake amount is based on the current USD value
of BEE and corresponding absentee rates aimed at maintaining an arbiter absentee rate of
<5%.
Stakes from each participant ensures:
● A potential reward for arbiters that participate in arbitration. This will encourage an
active pool of arbiters to contribute to the arbitration system
● A punishment for arbiters who fail to render a timely decision
● Supply and demand entities do not request arbitration frivolously
Arbitration begins when a dispute arises and the payment contract sends its funds to
arbitration. Supply and demand entities must stake a flat arbitration fee to create an
arbitration contract.
Arbiters can signup on Beenest to join the arbiter pool by staking tokens to the arbitration
protocol. All arbiters have reputation scores that fluctuate based on decisions made. When a
dispute is initiated, a panel of at least 5 arbiters will be selected from the arbiter pool. The
likelihood that an individual arbiter is selected to join an arbitration panel is calculated using
the following formula:
(# of Bee Tokens staked by arbiter / total # of Bee Tokens staked by all arbiters) *
( (1 - arbiter appeals rate) / (1 - average arbiter appeals rate) )

●

Number of Bee Tokens staked by arbiter​: indicates the commitment level of arbiters
to ensure a timely decision. Higher numbers increase the probability of the arbiter to
be selected in arbitration cases, or conversely, determines the consequence if an
arbiter fails to render a decision.
These tokens are returned after arbitration is over. If an arbiter fails to make a timely
decision, the staked tokens will be sent to the Bee token reserve.

●

Arbiter appeals rate​: the rate in which the arbiter’s decision resulted in the
dissatisfaction of one or both parties. Beenest aims to provide a platform where both
parties have the opportunity to have their voices heard which renders a fairer decision.
The appeal rate ensures that arbiters who consistently provide inadequate decisions
are penalized and removed from the arbitration system. To account for arbiters that

have a lack of history on the platform, new arbiters are randomly selected for 10 cases
until a history is built to indicate the quality of their decisions.
Arbiters are not penalized for incorrect decisions. They only lose their stake if they fail to
render a decision within a time limit. Arbiters vote on a scale from 1-5 specifying the
percentage (corresponding to 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, respectively) of the disputed amount
the plaintiff should be paid. Once a decision is made, the contract gives an aggregate of the
majority voters’ reward offering to the winning party, and the rest goes to the losing party.
Either party will have a chance to appeal, halting payments and restarting the process, but will
have to stake a larger amount (at least 2x) to compensate arbiters and prevent frivolous appeal
by the losing party.
The final verdict will be the median dispute amount of the arbiter vote. In addition to an
amount, arbiters must leave feedback that leads to their decision. This is to ensure that the
plaintiff has a clear idea of the thought process that leads up to that decision. If enough
arbiters fail to provide an adequate decision leading up to their decision, the plaintiff will have
the right to appeal. If this happens the appeal rate for each arbiter that failed to render an
adequate decision will go up, hurting their chances to participate in future jurisdiction.
All parties are paid once the dispute is resolved. Participating arbiters are paid at a market rate
aimed at ensuring a timely allocation of arbiters (e.g. Uber surge pricing). . All arbiter’s stakes
then automatically re-enter the arbitration pool, and the arbiters’ once again become eligible to
judge a future dispute.

III. Reputation
The reputation protocol computes and maintains reputation scores of verified entities, globally
on the Ethereum blockchain. Any existing and upcoming sharing economy dApps can fetch the
reputation of any entity, with a short breakdown on how the score was calculated. As an
analogy, the reputation score is similar to credit score, and fetching the reputation score is
similar to a credit pull. Unlike credit scores, the reputation score is backed by transparent
algorithms defined in smart contracts and accessible to the masses.
A reputation score is an integer between 0 and 100, that number being the average of multiple
reputation scores. The protocol keeps track of reputation score for the entity, and is able to
continuously update that score in multiple marketplaces for multiple uses.
For example, Joe has a reputation score of 70 with the following breakdown:
● Score as a guest: 70
● Score as a host: 80
● Score as an arbiter: 60
● Score as a seller: 75
● Score as a buyer: 65

Beenest updates the reputation score based on how hosts and guests act on the platform.
Good hosts with high reviews and no cancellations have higher scores than those with lower
reviews and many cancellations. In addition to the score, Beenest also adds a hash of the
review provided for guest and host entities as explanation whenever the reputation score is
updated. For example, a host getting a 5-star review gets a bump in their reputation score.
Beenest can use the reputation score later on to determine the order by which listings display
in search results, i.e. hosts with highest reputation scores can have their rental bumped to the
top of the search results
In addition to hosts/guests, the Bee arbitration protocol also updates reputation score of
arbiters.

Cryptoeconomics
The Bee token is used within the Bee network to incentivize good behavior and punish
malicious behavior. This creates network effects by aligning token holders’ goals and attracting
early adopters through referrals. Token holders also have decentralized governance over the
protocols, allowing for continuous deployments of backward-compatible improvements to the
ecosystem.

Token Holders Incentives
The following stakeholders (hosts & property managers, guests, arbiters, and 3rd party
developers) in the Bee ecosystem are incentivized to use BEE for the following reasons:

I. Hosts & Property Managers
●

Increased Revenue:
○ Payment Protocol - H
​ osts and property managers profit more per booking on
Beenest as opposed to Airbnb which averages ~20% commission. On average, a
host getting booked for 5 nights at $200/night will end up earning $1000 on
Beenest compared to $800 on Airbnb. This can result in up to $15,000 of
missed earning per year.

II. Guests
●

Increased Value:
○ Network Effects - ​As more guests use the platform, the increased transaction
volume creates network effects thus naturally increasing the value and

●

●

usefulness of the Beenest platform. This will benefit the guests by enabling them
to book more properties using the same amount of utility tokens.
Decreased Costs:
○ Payment Protocol - B
​ ecause hosts and property managers will not be charged
commission fees, they will be able to decrease rates per night for guests while
achieving similar profit margins. Guests will benefit by experiencing lower costs
while traveling.
○ Reputation Protocol - ​If guests have better reputation scores, they do not
require a high security deposit.
Time Savings:
○ Arbitration Protocol - G
​ uests will no longer have to wait long periods of time
for their canceled bookings to be refunded to them. With our arbitration
protocol, refunds are guaranteed to be processed in a timely manner.

III. Arbiters
●

Increased Value:
○ Arbitration Protocol - A
​ rbiters can acquire extra tokens by participating in
arbitration cases; the more Bee tokens staked, the greater the expected return.

IV. Third Party Developers
●

●

●

Increased Revenue:
○ Protocols​ - Teams can quickly build applications around the sharing economy
using Bee Protocols and gain greater market share than competitors who would
spend more time developing their product from scratch.
Decreased Costs:
○ Protocols ​- Teams do not need to hire solidity / Ethereum developers who will
have to write smart contracts (Ethereum developers on average are paid 1.5X
more than regular full-stack developers)
Time Savings:
○ Protocols ​- Do not need to create and audit smart contracts from scratch and
worry about the security of smart contracts.

In addition, Beenest plans to implement a referral program to incentivize user acquisition of
hosts, guests, and arbiters. Users referring hosts who post a listing that results in a booking will
receive BEE tokens.

Token Value
As the number of users (guests, hosts, 3rd party devs, arbiters) increases so does the
transaction volume, which increases the amount of staked tokens in the protocols. This means
the number of Bee tokens in circulation (not staked in the protocols) goes down with user
adoption, which decreases the total supply.
1. Number of Payments:​ throughout any booking on our platform, a certain amount of
Bee tokens (booking cost, security deposit, cancellation fees) is held in the payment
protocol until the checkout date.
2. Number of Arbitration Cases:​ arbiters stake more tokens to be picked more often
for judging by the arbitration protocol.
3. Reputation Score Compensation:​ users with poor or no reputation can build trust
with other users by staking tokens on their transactions.
4. Sponsored Listings​: we’ll allow hosts with high reputation to promote their listings for
a fee in BEE.

V(token) ∝ ( ∑ N(users) )²

Why Tokenize
The Bee Token acts as fuel for the 3 Bee Protocols. These protocols benefit from a distributed
database, where rules for governing participants are not uniform and rules for transactions
don’t change frequently.
Creating an in-house Bee Token that interacts with the Beenest platform allows the network to
have aligned goals and incentives, prepares a platform to be agnostic to a singular
cryptocurrency or digital token, and allows better management of the side chain.
1. Aligned Goals and Incentives - U
​ sing ETH directly would align participants in the
Ethereum network on the value of smart contracts, rather than the value of a sharing
economy, which we achieve by having BEE.
2. Platform Agnostic - B
​ eenest believes in the potential of blockchain technology and
cryptocurrency. By creating the Bee Token, Beenest is created on an infrastructure that
allows it to be flexible in the future of cryptocurrency or digital tokens whether that

means the continuing growth of Ethereum or an introduction of the latest
cryptocurrency.
3. Side Chain Management - ​Sidechaining is a mechanism that allows tokens from one
blockchain to be securely used within a completely separate blockchain but moved
back to the original chain if necessary.
Due to the changing economics of cryptocurrency, side chain allows a better economic
management of our platform. Bee Token can focus on providing greater value to its
participants in terms of user experience rather than the changing nature of a
cryptocurrency.

Summary
In summary, the Bee Token takes advantage of the changing behaviors of millennials and the
recent popularity of cryptocurrencies and also the inherent misalignment of incentives that
existing centralized sharing economies create. Our three protocols, the “​P-A-R​” protocols
(​P​ayment, ​Ar​ bitration, and ​R​eputation protocols) used in tandem will help dApps and 3rd
parties to increase revenues, decrease costs, and save time. All in all, the Bee Token seeks to
eliminate inefficiencies through the power of smart contracts, which enables organizations to
operate with a completely new business model that distributes value to all supporters in a
more equitable fashion.

E. User Acquisition Strategy
1. Official Cryptocurrency Housing Sponsor

Beenest’s initial market segment is the cryptocommunity. We will target conferences and
events targeting this demographic by sponsoring and engaging in post-conference networking.
This is a quick way to bootstrap our initial network and capitalize on brand recognition as the
main home sharing platform on the blockchain.
2. Referral Program
Positive word-of-mouth is the lowest cost and most effective way to generate brand
awareness, new leads, and immediate sales.
Beenest plans to implement a referral program to incentivize user acquisition of both hosts
and guests. Users referring hosts who post a listing that results in a booking will receive BEE
tokens. Likewise, users referring guests that result in a booking will also receive BEE tokens.
3. Ambassador Program
Ambassadors are liaisons between a company and the community. They serve as the voice
representing the vision of Bee Token.
Communities are becoming increasingly interested in blockchain technology and smart
contracts. Beenest plans to onboard Beenest Ambassadors who are excited about the
potential of a decentralized home-sharing platform. By promoting events, organizing
hackathons, and volunteering for campaigns, we believe that the ambassador program will be
pivotal in order to grow our developer’s community.
Beenest Ambassadors handle:
- Planning and hosting Bee/Crypto events/meetups
- Developing marketing and outreach programs
- Collecting feedback and sharing ideas to further promote the Bee Protocols and
possible use-case applications
In addition, Beenest Ambassadors are able to obtain tokens through their contributions that
further incentivizes them to promote the company and its platform. Lastly, with the rollout of a
referral program, Beenest sees the potential of creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop that
generates more users and awareness for the company and its platform.

F. Market Growth
As of 2017, the short-term housing
market only consists of centralized
home sharing platforms lead by Airbnb,
HomeAway, and etc. Most operate

under a similar business model with slight nuances such as country of focus, target audience,
or rental time frame. Based upon market research and product fit, the Beenest’s most
comparable direct competitor is Airbnb.
Global short-term rentals are properties that are either currently available or will be available
to host and rent to travellers and tourists. The global short-term rental market is projected to
grow at a CAGR of 7% from approximately $147B in 2017 to $207B in 2022.
Applicable short-term rentals are properties that are either currently used or will be used to
host and rent to travellers and tourists.
All such rental properties are what make
up the Airbnb ecosystem.
Based on publicly available Airbnb data,
we modeled out the growth of the
applicable short-term rental market and
expect this market to grow from
approximately $25B in 2017 to $82B in
2022.

G. Conflict Resolution Use
Cases
Case 1: Without Arbitration
● Upon the conclusion of a stay, guests and hosts have the ability to communicate
between each other. If there is a dispute they can discuss and agree upon a resolution
sensible to both parties.
● An option that allows the transfer of partial or all of the security deposit is available to
resolve any issues
○ Guest will have the option to release part or all of the rental amount to the Host
○ Host will have the option to release part or all of the security deposit to the
Guest
○ When both parties have stated the amounts to be released from the payment
protocol, they must both confirm the agreement for funds to be released.
● Upon the conclusion of the Smart Contract, the dispute is closed and the option to
review is available for both parties

Case 2: With Arbitration
● Within a 1 week window (or a reasonable timeframe), either party has the ability to file a
dispute and escalate to arbitration
● To present a valid and strong case, the escalating party must include the following:
○ Description of unpleasant/wrongful experience
○ Evidence to support claim (pictures, videos, ...)
○ Cost of Arbitration
● The other party has 3 days to present their case
● The amount in contention is the collective sum of the security deposit between the
Host and the Guest.
● Upon the conclusion of a dispute, the losing party has a 72 hour window to appeal, but
must stake a larger amount of tokens
Case 3: Extreme Cases
Extreme cases of damage are rare, nevertheless, Beenest promotes the peace of mind and
well-being of hosts to ensure a seamless and pleasant experience. In extreme cases, hosts
should go through arbitration, then file a claim with Beenest for damages in excess of the
security amount providing the following documents:
a. A police report
b. Personal liability insurance
c. Any additional description, pictures, …
In which case, Beenest will have a specialized team of conflict resolution experts to ensure the
conclusion of a dispute.

H. Protocol Specs
Payment
We define the following payment structure that holds all the above information:
Name

Type

Description

paymentHash

bytes32 [Required] A Keccak256 hash of all present fields. Uniquely
identifies 1 payment.

supplyEntityAddress

address [Required] Address that the supply entity will send/receive
tokens from/to.

demandEntityAddress

address [Required] Address that the demand entity will send/receive
tokens from/to.

arbitrationAddress

address [Required] The address to move all the tokens corresponding to
the transaction for arbitration, in case of a dispute.

cost

uint256 [Required] The cost of the good or service in BEE tokens
(multiplied by 10^18).

securityDeposit

uint256 [Optional] Applies mostly for services. If a security deposit is
not needed, default to 0. Otherwise specify the number of tokens
to be held as a deposit until the dispatch time, or a dispute.

demandCancellationFee

uint256 [Optional] Number of BEE tokens to be deducted from the demand
address, and added to the supply address in case of cancellation
before the provided cancellation time.

demandCancelByTimeInS

uint256 [Optional] Cut-off time (POSIX time in seconds) for free
cancellations. If the demand entity cancels after this time,
they will be charged the provided cancellation fee.

supplyCancellationFee

uint256 [Optional] Number of BEE tokens to be deducted from the supply
address, and added to the demand address in case of cancellation
before the provided cancellation time.

supplyCancelByTimeInS

uint256 [Optional] Cut-off time (POSIX time in seconds) for free
cancellations. If the supply entity cancels after this time,
they will be charged the provided cancellation fee.

paymentDispatchTimeInS uint256 [Recommended] The future time (POSIX time in seconds) in which
the contract dispatches the tokens to the supply entity, and
returns any deposits/fees. Instantaneous dispatch time is highly
discouraged.

Interface
Function

Description

initPayment

Bootstraps a new payment with the data from the Payment structure above.
Adds a new mapping from paymentHash to amount of tokens to be held.

cancelPayment

To be called when either the supply entity or the demand entity decides to
cancel payment.

pay

To be called by both supply and demand entities to pay the contract. All
tokens sent are held until the dispatch time, or a dispute arises.

disputePayment

To be called in case of a conflict. Moves the inProgress payment to
inArbitration, and moves all the tokens into the provided arbitration
account.

getPaymentStatus

Returns the status of the payment. Something along the lines of:
PENDING_DISPATCH_TIME, PENDING_PAYMENT, IN_ARBITRATION, COMPLETED.

Beenest workflow
1. When a booking is initiated from the Beenest web app, the Beenest dApp initializes the
payment, passing all the following fields in:
a. The addresses of host, guest and arbitration account
b. The total booking cost for all the nights
c. Security deposits and cancellation fees
d. The dispatch time is going to be the checkout time + 72 hours (to leave time for
hosts to check for any issues)
2. Beenest then waits until the guest and the host send the tokens from the addresses
they initialized above:
a. Guest pays all the booking fees + security deposit + cancellation fee + insurance

b. Host pays the cancellation fee
3. The payment contract checks to see that the required amount has been met, and
updates the status of the payment to PENDING_DISPATCH_TIME
a. In case of a dispute: the payment contract transfer all the tokens to an
arbitration account
b. In case the dispatch time is hit (guest checkout time + 72 hours), the hosts and
guests get paid
i.
Guest gets back security deposit + cancellation fee
ii.
Host gets booking amount + cancellation fee

Arbitration
The following is the struct for arbiter:
Name

Type

Description

arbiterAddress

address Arbiter’s address.

stakedAmount

bytes32 The amount that the arbiter wishes to stake.

marketplace

address Contract address of whitelisted marketplace. Required to update
specific marketplace reputation. (Also useful to select for
specific types of arbitration)

reputationScore

bytes32 The reputation score (specific score for arbitration).

appealsRate

bytes32 Percentage of judgements repealed (0-100).

Interface
Function

Description

raiseDispute

Triggered by someone using Bee payment protocol.

stake

Potential arbiters stake tokens for the chance to participate in
arbitration.

vote

Arbiters vote on a 1-5 scale in favor of plaintiff.

appeal

Restarts the process and adds changes state.

appearInCourt

Arbiters chosen for a particular dispute will need to respond within a
specified timeframe, or will lose their stake.

Beenest workflow
1. Upon completion of a payment contract, if either party is unhappy with their rental
agreement, all funds from the payment contract are sent to arbitration. Beenest dApp
will handle interfacing with both the payment and arbitration protocols.

2. One or both parties must then stake a flat arbitration fee in order to pay arbiters to
judge the dispute. Again Beenest handles interfacing with the arbitration protocol.
3. Once arbiters are chosen, the guest and host must submit their claims and evidence.
4. Arbiters then make a decision and the dispute amount is allocated based off an
aggregate of the majority decision.
5. Guests and hosts have another chance to challenge the dispute, but are required to
re-stake tokens to pay arbiters. Then the workflow follows 2-4 above.
6. All parties are paid after arbitration is finalized.

Reputation
Interface
Function

Description

updateReputationScore

Takes an address for a smart contract specifying an algorithm to compute a
new score, and generates a new global reputation score as a weighted
average of the existing scores/algorithms.

pullReputationScore

Returns the reputation score (an integer between 0 and 100), with a short
breakdown of how it was computed.

Beenest workflow
1. Beenest has a few signals that fire when the reputation needs to be bumped up or
down. For instance reputation changes whenever the user provides personal
information, books a place, creates a listing, gets reviewed (good or bad) or gives
reviews (good or bad). For each of these signals Beenest will send a message to the
reputation protocol to update the score.
2. Beenest also would do a periodic reputation score pull to allow users to do certain
functions like adding a new listing, or sending a big payment. As reputation score
shouldn’t significantly change overnight, Beenest will cache the score daily.
