1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CanYa is an open ecosystem of decentralised
applications (CANApps) for peer to peer
services, built using core infrastructure and
connected and powered by a single
decentralised autonomous organisation - the
CanYaDAO. Each CANApp exists in the
ecosystem for the sole purpose of driving value,
such that the whole is greater than the sum of
its parts. Ultimately it is envisaged that any
third party can apply for funding from the
CanYaDAO, build a CANApp easily and quickly
using ready-made Core infrastructure, and
deploy the CANApp globally using the DAO as
an on-demand scalable operational and
support backend. Each CANApp will maintain
an internal budget to pay for maintenance and
on-going development, and the best CANApps
will prosper.
CANApps cover all aspects of marketplaces
and will initially be funded and built by the
CanYa team. Core infrastructure to build the
e co s y s t e m i s a s t a c k o f o p e n - s o u r ce
frameworks, templates and contracts and
called CanYaCore, allowing any developer to
easily create a CANApp and attach it to the
ecosystem. Core infrastructure includes the
hedged escrow, payments, identity
management and skill attestation.
Most importantly, the CANApp will be serviced
by the CanYaDAO, where not only is initial

Page 4 of 25

funding available, but the CANApp can access
a highly-scalable business and support
backend. CANApps can split up areas of
management, maintenance and governance
into micro-tasks, and submit them to the
CanYaDAO. The CanYaDAO will handle the
completion of tasks by funding them and
allowing anyone in the DAO to complete the
tasks. As the CanYaDAO is permissionless
(anyone can join), the CanYaDAO incorporates
game-theory mechanics and the necessary
crypto-economics to ensure task completion
to a required standard with adequate
prioritisation, as well as the correct governance
and bad-actor management.
The CanYaCoin (CAN) powers the platform’s
payment system, enabling a decentralised,
trustless and hedged escrow service, a bridge
between fiat and a variety of cryptocurrencies,
and a powerful rewards system to encourage
network effects. The CAN token is also the
token that powers the CanYaDAO and provides
value to incentivise a decentralised taskforce to
support the CANApps.
Th e fi n a l o u t co m e i s a n a u t o n o m o u s
ecosystem that is self-funded, self-sustaining,
and caters for a global permissionless user
base of digital nomads, freelancers and
marketplace users.

2. KEY COMPONENTS
2.1.

OVERVIEW

The CanYa ecosystem has three key components; CANApps, CanYaDAO and CanYaCore, an opensource collection of key infrastructure needed to power the ecosystem. CANApps are discrete
decentralised applications built using web3 technologies and target key niches and verticals in the
global peer to peer services industry. Examples are CANServices for digital service marketplace and
CANTask for local services. The CanYaDAO forms the scalable and decentralised support,
maintenance and governance backend to each CANApp. Finally the CanYaCore components are
used as the fundamental building blocks of the ecosystem, such as the escrow, identity
management and support tasking components.
The following is an overview:

Page 5 of 25

canya.com

The Decentralised Serviceplace for the World

2.2. COMPETITIVE ECOSYSTEM
Each CANApp is “seeded” in funding by the CanYaDAO and has an internal budget that pays for
development and maintenance through the CanYaDAO micro-tasks. Each CANApp must have a
monetisation strategy that attempts to fill up the internal budget as it is depleted. Various
monetisation strategies will be available.
A third-party may seed and build a CANApp, and they are entitled to pay themselves from the
internal budget. They also may apply for crowdfunding by submitting a CANApp idea, and if it is
popular, it will achieve crowd support. Once funded, the third party will be paid through the
internal budget.
A key fundamental is that each CANApp is competitive and has to provide on-going value addition
to the ecosystem, else their internal budgets deplete and they terminate. In this way, each CANApp
is incentivised to create value and achieve product-market-fit, and if they do their internal budgets
will continue to fund support and on-going development. Each CANApp attempts to increase its
own budget by having its own revenue source.
This methodology mimics thriving ecosystems such as forests and coral reefs, where the strongest,
smartest organisms survive. By reducing the time it takes to deploy a CANApp (re-useable code),
the cost of maintaining a CANApp (micro-tasks from the CanYaDAO), and increasing the number of
people who can deploy a CANApp (open-source code and frameworks), it is envisaged that there
will be hundreds, if not thousands of CANApps deployed into the ecosystem. Most may not survive,
but those that do will be supported and backed by the wealth of knowledge and experience from
the entire ecosystem and will be stronger than any equivalent centralised version.

The CanYa ecosystem has a single currency: the CanYaCoin. The CAN token is an ERC-20 compliant
token with the following characteristics.

The following is the purpose of the token:
(1) A consumptive use token for providers to access premium features in the ecosystem.
(2) A token to reward users who participate in the DAO, contributed to them when they perform
certain activities in the DAO.
(3) A medium of value exchange allowing providers to invoice their services in CAN tokens across
CANApps.
(4) A store of value, allowing providers to retain payments in the CanYa wallet.

4.1. CANAPPS LITE
CANApps Lite are lightweight decentralised applications that perform a specific task, but have low
dependency on the ecosystem and can be used by anyone. They are positioned to share the
benefits of decentralised technologies with the wider community by having very low barriers of
entry.
They augment the CanYa ecosystem by demonstrating utility of the CAN token as well as being a
funnel for new CanYa members; “come for the tool, stay for the ecosystem”. All CANApps are free to
use, but are monetised by either being freemium or connecting to the CANAds network. In this way
they continue to increase their own internal budget by presenting value and cycling revenue
through the ecosystem.
Some of the technologies used by CANApps Lite are Web3 injection, IPFS for storage and Ethereum
for verification and authentication. Where the CAN Token is involved, Bancor integration is provided
to a seamless conversion into the CAN token from all supported tokens.
For an engaging interaction, CANApps Lite may also feature CANHelp, a chat-bot serving helpful
tips as well as having a direct connection with the CanYaDAO for 24/7 live chat with a DAO support
member. Payment for CANHelp will come from the internal budget for the CANApp.

4.2. CANAPPS
CANApps are all characterised by being two-sided marketplaces that serve different aspects of the
global peer to peer service industry. The first party makes a listing, whilst the second party desires to
engage with the first party on the terms of the listing. There is an escrowed value transfer, which
allows parties to leverage each other to achieve their desired outcomes.
Each CANApp requires deep integration with the CanYaDAO in splitting up maintenance and
governance tasks. The CanYaDAO may curate listings, offer the CANHelp app for support ticketing
as well as providing dispute resolution services.
CANApps also require deep integration with the host of CanYaCore infrastructure, such as the
escrow, fee service and trustless payments.
CANApps attempt to increase their own internal budget by cycling revenue through the ecosystem.
Valuable and effective CANApps will grow and be developed, whilst CANApps that never achieve
product-market-fit will be terminated. Once the Core infrastructure is built, the cost of building and
maintaining a new CANApp is substantially low, allowing hundreds, if not thousands, of CANApps
to be built and supported.
The following are examples of CANApps being planned and developed:

5. CANYADAO
5.1.

OVERVIEW

The CanYaDAO is the most crucial part of the ecosystem, serving as a treasury, maintenance body
and governance board. The CanYaDAO will allow all CANApps to be scalable from a business logic
and support backend, allowing any CANApp developer to connect global, 24/7 support to their
CANApp. This removes the burden of funding marketing, operations, and support teams, letting the
developer instead focus on building a great user experience for their CANApp.
The CanYaDAO has three Tiers: Agent, Admin and Core. Agents can be anyone who stake the
minimum of CAN tokens required for DAO entry and perform basic tasks in the DAO. Admins
govern Agents, and perform higher level tasks in the DAO with wider consequences. As such, they
require a higher stake, longer DAO experience and a threshold of reputation earned in the DAO.
This ensures that all Admins have socially proved their alignment and commitment to the
ecosystem.
Core is the final tier and is initially fulfilled by the CanYa Team. As the CanYaDAO matures, Admins
may request to join the Core Tier by staking a much higher amount. This allows the CanYa Team to
transition to a point where the CanYaDAO is governed and operated by DAO members - and
achieves decentralisation.
Anyone at any time can leave the DAO and reclaim their stake. The stake is held to prevent rogue
actors inside the DAO and incentivise long term alignment. Agents and Admins earn off tasks in the
DAO, with the payouts for Admin tasks a lot higher than Agent tasks.

The following is a number of tasks that are facilitated by the DAO. Each task has a tier-level, as well
as the correct incentivisation mechanics. Tasks can even be prioritised by increasing the payout
behind the task, such as support tickets that haven’t been answered.
Each task has the correct quality assurance and crypto-economics to ensure that quality is high,
bad actors are penalised and contains in-built randomness to remove biases.

5.2. FUNDING
Each CANApp has clear and transparent funding mechanics to incentivise sustainable growth.
1.

Seed Funding. A list of proposed CANApp ideas is shown. Each CANApp has a funding goal to
be met, decided upon by the DAO. Anyone can donate to an escrow to fund the CANApp,
including the DAO itself. Anyone can nominate to build the CANApp, including the DAO. Once
the CANApp is funded and has a nominated developer, the escrowed CAN is released in
milestones.

2. Feature Bounties. A list of proposed features is also shown on each CANApp. Each feature has a
funding goal, decided upon by the DAO. Anyone can donate to a feature bounty to prioritise
development. As the code is open-source anyone can work on feature bounties and submit
them to earn the bounty.
3. Ongoing Revenue. All CANApps will be extremely cost-effective to maintain, with very low
server costs, no third-party licensing required and instant access to a global operational and
support backend from the DAO. After seed-funding is exhausted, each CANApp will need to
drive revenue back to their internal budget to pay for feature bounties and for CanYaDAO
engagement. The more revenue is driven back, the more feature bounties can be funded,
further driving growth.

3.1.

SCALABILITY

Launching and scaling an existing marketplace app has four key problems preventing scalability.
CanYa can solve all of these simultaneously with the components listed above.
1.

Technology. With the existing technology of 2018, scaling an app globally is trivial with services
such as load-balancers, firebase hosting and CDNs. CanYa’s challenge is to build scalable dApp
technology, but will use off-chain until on-chain can match performance.

2. Marketing. Attaining widespread adoption requires viral marketing efforts to grow initial userbase adoption. CANApps can exploit referral based marketing paid for from the DAO in CAN
tokens to economically incentivise adoption without requiring VC funding.
3. Operational Support. All marketplace apps require operational support in helping user onboarding, support tickets, curation and dispute resolution. Normally operational staff need to be
hired, on-boarded and trained to handle the operations of each marketplace. This is the biggest
hamstring to fast global growth. CanYa counters this with the CanYaDAO - a 24/7, global, multilingual and on-demand operational and support backend to any CANApp. By marrying
cryptoeconomics with a permissionless ecosystem the burden of maintaining providing
operational support becomes trivial.
4. Ongoing Development. Traditional apps require full-time developers to maintain and
implement a feature roadmap. Often they ship features that aren’t needed, and due to salaried
or contracted engagement, rarely have aligned incentive structures with the performance of the
features they ship. CanYa will do away with this by being open-source and having a novel perapp funding mechanism with Feature Bounties, assigning funds where growth is sustainable.

The Decentralised Serviceplace for the World

5. CORE INFRASTRUCTURE
5.1.

OVERVIEW

CanYaCore is a set of infrastructure that is built by the CanYa Team to be used across all CANApps.
Once CanYaCore is built and matured, developing a new CANApp will become trivial. Developers
will simply integrate their desired components, adopt the CanYa Style Guide and Templates,
connect their CANApp to the CanYaDAO and launch.
All CanYaCore components will be open-sourced and continually developed. CanYa has on-going
relationships with other projects to contribute actively to the Core Infrastructure. Third-party
infrastructure may come with a small tax to pay for the use of infrastructure, such as decentralised
databases or compute. In this case CanYa will seamlessly handle the payment of fees by converting
from CAN to the third-party token using trustless continuous liquidity such as Bancor.
Some of the core components are also serviced by the CanYaDAO for curation and crowd-sourced
verification. In these cases, the fees from these services are paid for by the CANApp’s internal
budget. All other core infrastructure is free and has no fees.

5.2. CANYA STYLE GUIDE
The CanYa Style Guide is a set of web and mobile based templates and assets that conform to the
current CanYa ecosystem style and identity and allow developers to quickly add the necessary style
components to CANApps. This allows them to rapidly prototype and build new CANApps to a high
user interface design standard set by Core.

CANID & CANWALLET

CANid is an integrated wallet, identity and skill management services powered by decentralised
technologies. A user provisions a new HD wallet, verifies their details and perform an optional onetime KYC. KYC is performed through a licensed third party, who will be the Oracle to update the
profile as “KYC’d”. Reaching KYC’d verification is necessary for high value-transactions.
Users can also choose to submit skills which are crowd-verified from the DAO and saved to their
profile. In this case they submit a claim they make about a skill as well as some form of proof:
“I am a javascript developer” & proof of being a javascript developer
“I am a public speaker” & proof of being a public speaker
“I am a gardener” & proof of being a gardener

Random DAO Members are then incentivised to make judgements on the claim and proof. Upper
and lower Schelling fences of 20% are trimmed off (to remove outliers) and the median 20% is
rewarded. The final verification of the skill is the average of the median. This ensures that the skill is
crowd-verified and cannot be influenced. By removing and not rewarding any vote outside of the
median donkey-voters are not rewarded, and waste their own time.

5.4. CANHELP
CANHelp is a special service that incorporates a chat-bot utility as well as support from the
CanYaDAO for 24-7 live chat and support ticketing. Users simply see a Crisp or Intercom style chat
bubble on the button right of each CANApp, which connects them with CANHelp. A chat-bot
serves typical questions, pre-loaded with content created by the CANApp developer, and
maintained by the CANHelp. If the chat-bot cannot answer questions, or is skipped, the user is
connected directly to an DAO Agent who can chat and offer support. At the conclusion of the
interaction, the user can rate the DAO Agent, which contributes to their reputation score. Queries
that cannot immediately be answered are ticketed and tagged for follow-up by agents. Other
Agents can see historical questions to quickly offer relevant advice. The user is identified simply by
their wallet address or other anonymous tags, such as session ID. If the user provides an email,
follow-up advice can be provided through email contact, sent from the DAO by the DAO agent.
The CANApp developer creates small on-boarding training sessions so that DAO Agents are
specifically trained to serve help for that CANApp. The DAO maintains permissions for qualified
DAO Agents, but ultimately anyone can participate. As incoming tickets arrive for a CANApp, they
are priced and shown to Agents. If any tickets are left unattended, the pricing behind them
increase, incentivising more agents to respond. If a CANApp is serving a lot of support tickets, then
the relative reward behind them will increase, incentivising more agents to on-board to that
CANApp.
CANHelp presents scalable on-demand help and customer support for each CANApp. Each
CANApp will pay for help from its own internal budget. In this way, growth of each CANApp is
always sustainable.

5.5. CANADS
CANAds is a simple monetisation strategy for CANApps Lite; which may not have other forms of
revenue, but have to provide value to the ecosystem. Each CANApp nominates ad banner space,
and a CANAds dashboard allows third-parties to purchase ad space. Ad space is priced depending
on existing demand and transparent traffic metrics. Publishers pre-pay the ad space and submit
copy to the CanYaDAO for approval. Once approved, the payment is deducted and ad shown for
the duration of the time purchased.
If copy is subsequently rejected by the CanYaDAO (ads are reported for misuse, objectionable or
scam content) then they are removed and the ad space is made available again.
Payment is made by CANPay.

CANAds can also be shown on third party websites. In this case, revenue paid out is 99%, with 1%
being retained and sent to the Asset Contract. This is a far higher share than any other competing
ad platform.

5.6. CANANALYTICS
CANAnalytics is a simple and anonymous analytics suite for CANApps developers to transparently
show traffic, user behaviour and usage to allow optimisation. CANAnalytics is also employed by
CANAds to allow fair pricing of ad space.

5.7.

CANPAY

CANPay is a seamless payment module that allows users to pay in any token, crypto or fiat currency
they want. The underlying exchange is performed by Shapeshift, Bancor and Kyber integration. Fiat
conversions are handled by CoinBase, Changelly or Bancor.
The incoming currency is converted to CAN and sent to the CANEscrow.

5.8. CANCHAT & CANCALL
CANChat and CANCall are peer-peer messaging and video/voice calling frameworks that work
inside the CanYa ecosystem to allow seamless communications between users.
CANChat and CANCall are both securely end-end encrypted, however have the additional feature
in that encryption keys are shared with authorised agents from the DAO to review communications
in the case of a dispute. In this case, users are adequately informed and have to opt-in to share. The
DAO agent can review comms between parties in order to come to a fair decision on the dispute.

5.9. CANESCROW
CANEscrow is a smart contract that holds secured cryptocurrency for the intended recipient.
Incoming currency is first converted to CAN, before being held in escrow. The escrow is coupled
with a hedge, that seeks to maintain the value of the escrow, regardless of the price of the token.
The hedge is a Bancor Array Token that connects with a basket of Ethereum stablecoins, such as
the Digix gold token and the DAI USD token. This will create an internal pool in order to provide
collateral to hedge the amount of cryptocurrency sent to the smart contract. Bancor technology
will provide the price oracle for the CAN token.
The outcome is that the value of the invoice is stable, despite fluctuations in price. Intended
recipients will be paid a fixed value, but not a fixed amount of CAN tokens.

Escrowed Value Decreases

Escrowed CAN increases.

The hedge is funded by a proportion of the CanYa Team’s crypto assets, DAO revenue funding and
external grants from foundations.
An example of the process:
• The hedge contract is funded by CanYa, the DAO and related foundations with a nominal
$100,000.
• A client books a provider for $1000 and sends crypto to the escrow contract. The escrow already
has $9,000 in other escrowed payments, bringing a total of $10,000 in escrowed value.
• The provider completes the job and sends the $1000 invoice. The client releases the payment. The
escrow honours the $1000 payment by sending an adjusted amount of CAN tokens, guided by
the Bancor price oracle. The following will happen on a transaction basis:
• The value of CAN token has reduced by 10%. In this case, the hedge value is $100,000 whilst
the escrow value is now $8000 with a realised deficit of $100 ( $100 of escrow was used to make
up the loss in the $1000 invoice). The hedge automatically market buys $100 into the escrow
contract using a Bancor Relay Token. This has two consequences:
• The realised deficit of $100 is covered.
• A market buy causes a stabilising price movement to prevent further volatility.

The Decentralised Serviceplace for the World
• The value of CAN token has increased by 10%. In this case, the hedge value is $100,000 whilst
the escrow value is now $10,000 with a realised gain of $100 ( The over-valued invoice left $100
spare in the escrow). The escrow retains the spare CAN to cover future over-exposed invoices.

Real World Assessment
The following basic assessment of how the CANEscrow would work using historical data shows that
due to different invoice maturity dates, a growing escrow and a small amount of upside pressure
results in the hedge never being used. Of course a large black swan event may require the hedge to
cover exposure, but importantly the hedge is only covering invoices that mature with a deficit and
only the deficit.

5.10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
The CANEscrow holds the payment but allows both parties to take recourse against each other and
encourages them to negotiate. The user seeks to achieve value-satisfaction, whilst the provider
seeks to earn value.
In the event the negotiations between parties is fruitless, either party can request arbitration from
CanYaDAO. When both parties agree to arbitration, the encryption keys to private peer-peer
CANChat are shared and all job logs are opened up to view by the arbitrator. This allows the
arbitrator to seek clarity on the job and determine an outcome.

5.11. ASSET CONTRACT
All forms of CanYa revenue will be collected and sent to an Asset Contract. The Asset Contract will
accumulate the crypto and split them in accordance with the publicly-viewable proportions in the
smart contract. 30% will be sent to the CANApp that they originated from, 30% will be sent to the
CanYaDAO, 30% will be burnt, and 10% will be sent to the Charity Pool.
As the Asset Contract sends an amount of tokens to the Rewards Pool, which is unlocked and
recycled back to the users as rewards, and increases the circulating supply and liquidity in the
market. Consequently, the token value would decrease if nothing else was done due to inflation. To
offset the increase in supply, an equivalent amount of tokens needs to be burnt, which is why the
Asset Contract contains a burn function.
Please note, CanYa as an entity does not perform any action to burn tokens; rather users on the
platform cause the tokens to be burnt by way of the Asset Contract. The burning of tokens is
dependent on user-behaviour in order to maintain the integrity of the CanYaCoins.

Charity Pool
CanYa as an organisation believe in the pay-it-forward concept, and as such, will be maintaining a
pool of tokens to be gifted to selected charities, drawn as a 10% payout from the Asset Contract.

6. CONCLUSION
CanYa is an open ecosystem with CANApps (decentralised apps build on CanYa technology), the
CanYaDAO (an organisation that powers the CanYa ecosystem) and CanYaCore, a set of
infrastructure to help any developer build a CANApp quickly and easily. Each CANApp functions as
a discrete organism in the ecosystem, with its own budget and revenue streams. The best CANApps
are supported, developed and grow sustainably fast.
The end result is a rapidly growing decentralised and autonomous ecosystem for peer to peer
services.
