History
Previous to our eﬀorts, the X16R (random) algorithm was launched on the Ravencoin
network in late 2018. This new algorithm provided an innovative method of ASIC
resistance. Since our new algorithm is building on the Ravencoin team's work, it's
important to first understand how it works.
X16R used algorithms from X15, added SHA512, and then randomized the order by
referencing the last sixteen digits of the previous block hash.

Given the last sixteen digits of a previous block hash:

X16R would complete a single hash cycle in the order below.

4 keccak, f sha512, 0 blake, d shabal,
a echo, 5 skein, 2 groestl, 0 blake,
7 cubehash, 2 groestl, c fugue, 9 simd,
9 simd, 4 keccak, 9 simd, 2 groestle
We notice that groestl and simd both repeat three times, weighting the hashrate
and power consumption during this block 37% towards the characteristics of these
two algorithms.
In practice, a GPU miner on the X16R algorithm that normally demands 600W will
fluctuate between ~450W and ~800W, changing every block. The hashrate will similarly
fluctuate, making it diﬃcult to tune a mining rig for eﬃciency or productivity.
These power spikes reduce power-supply eﬃciency and lifespan. Our new algorithm,
X16S, aims to solve these problems.

Introducing X16S (shuﬄe)
The X16S (shuﬄe) algorithm uses the last sixteen digits of the previous block hash to
reorder a list containing all sixteen algorithms. It employs the same individual
algorithms found in X16R.
Given the last sixteen digits of a previous block hash:

4f0da52072c99492
X16S shuﬄes a list by using the value of each digit found within the last sixteen digits
of the previous block hash to reference an index within a list containing all algorithms.

0123456789abcdef
4012356789abcdef
f4012356789abcde
f4012356789abcde
. . .
0325a1c8f4679bde
2035a1c8f4679bde

The final order would then be:

2 groestl, 0 blake, 3 jh, 5 skein,
a echo, 1 bmw, c fugue, 8 shavite,
f sha512, 4 keccak, 6 luffa, 7 cubehash,
9 simd, b hamsi, d shabal, e whirlpool
X16S randomizes the order based on the previous block hash, but no algorithms are
repeated or omitted. This provides all the benefits of X16R while vastly improving the
hashrate and power consistency. This makes it much better for small miners, further
promoting decentralization.
Pigeoncoin is the proof-of-concept network for the X16S algorithm. We thank the
Ravencoin team for their hard work and hope that our eﬀorts are useful to them.
