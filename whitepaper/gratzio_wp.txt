Overview
What is Gratzio?
Gratzio is a global decentralized marketplace powered by Stellar blockchain that offers
its users an ability to order and perform on-demand person-to-person services and
favors.

What is Gratzio dApp?
Gratzio dApp is a decentralized application that provides access to Gratzio marketplace.
Gratzio dApp will be available via iOS store, Android Google Play as well as via regular
browser with Internet access.

What is Gratz token?
Payments for services within Gratzio marketplace are facilitated through Gratz utility
token that is based on Stellar consensus protocol. Users can perform services for other
users in order to earn Gratz tokens using Gratzio dApp. Additionally, users can purchase
or convert Gratz tokens into other cryptocurrencies and local fiat money through built-in
exchange on Gratzio platform or by utilizing third-party crypto exchanges.

What is Gratzio DAO
Gratzio is planning to transition to Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that
will be governed by its users by Q4 2020

5

What services Gratzio can be used for?

Gratzio fills the gap in demand for non-standard services. Below are the examples of
Requests for Favors (RFF) that users can place and fulfill with Gratzio marketplace:

Gratzio,​ bring me a dozen roses to my exact location within 15 min
Gratzio,​ hold a free parking for me at City Center
Gratzio,​ jumpstart my car battery
Gratzio,​ drive me home in my car
Gratzio,​ mow my lawn
Gratzio,​ walk my dog
Gratzio,​ I’m fishing. Bring me six pack of Corona beer to my location
Gratzio,​ shovel my grandma’s driveway before 10AM

This list is not complete and users requests are only limited by their imagination and local
laws. The platform can be also used to move funds across the borders quickly and
extremely cheap with transaction speeds of 2-5 seconds and transaction fees of only
$0.05 per transaction.

6

Gratzio Decentralized Application (dApp)
We designed the dApp with maximum simplicity, adding a little gamification on top. The
user interface is pretty self-explanatory.

7

There are two main modes in the app - one is for requesting a favors (“I need a favor”
and another is for doing favors (“I am Gratzio”).

Mode 1: “I need a favor”
In order to request a favor user clicks on the “I need a favor” menu and prompted to
enter the address manually or pin the location on the map.
In the following menu user enters a description of what should be done and selects the
amount of Grat tokens that he/she is willing to pay for the service. There are no preset
services or prices, so user is completely free to describe the required service and choose
his own price.
After submitting the required information - new tag with selected amount of gratitude on
top will appear on the map for others to see.

Tender feature
In order to give users the power to choose providers we implemented the “Tender”
feature. This feature is turned off by default, so the first provider who accepts the
request will be automatically chosen by the system. If more than one provider
responds at the same time the system will choose the one with higher reputation.
If user turns Tender feature on - the Requester is able to choose manually among the
providers who responded to the request.
The Tender feature is turned off by default for favors with small rewards and could be
turned on by user while describing the amount of reward. The feature turns on
automatically when rewards amount reaches certain threshold ( threshold depends on
local market)

Once the provider is chosen there is an option to communicate with provider via in-app
features like messages or calls to discuss the details if needed.

8

At this point the given amount of Gratz are transferred into the temporary escrow wallet
which will hold the funds until the task is done and Requester approves the job.
There is an ability to watch the progress of the job in real time by filming it on the
providers cellphone (if possible and feature is requested).
After the completion of the task requester reviews the results and if satisfied presses the
button to accept the job and prompted to rate the quality of services.

Mode 2: “I am Gratzio”
Those users who wish to earn tokens select “I am
Gratzio” from the main menu and browse the requests on
the map or select from the list of nearby requests. There
is an ability to filter requests by the amount of reward or
search favors by keyword.
Once suitable favor request is selected, provider accepts
the task and notification is being sent to the favor
requester. Upon accepting the provider, both
participants have the ability to communicate with
each-other via in-app messages or voice call in order to
settle the details of the deal if it is necessary.
After reaching the consensus provider begins the work
on the task while recording the progress if such feature
was requested. Upon finishing the favor provider marks
the job done and waits for requester approval.
After the job is approved provider is rewarded with
discussed amount of Grat tokens transferred into his
personal wallet and being prompted to rate the
requester.

9

Notifications
Service providers will be able to subscribe to notifications based on chosen keywords
or amount of Grat tokens reward within the given radius from their location. The push
notifications on cellphone will immediately inform service providers about ongoing
favor requests nearby.

Disputes Arbitration
We provided in-app communication features in order to encourage users to settle any
disputes which may arise from the deal by themselves. In case users can’t reach the
consensus they have the option to request the arbitration from the platform for 10%
non-refundable fee.
Depending on the case and the amount of Grat tokens involved the system will reach out
to unrelated to the deal local participants who have highest rating and history of the
similar jobs in their portfolio. Those users will be offered to arbitrage the deal in question
as a jurors. Jurors will be rewarded with the 10% fee for their review of materials (history,
testimonies, timeline, pictures, videos, etc) and resolving the case.

Secure Wallet
As an additional feature the in-app wallet will have an internal exchange. Users will be
able to exchange Gratz tokens into other cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, XLM and
local fiat (subject to local licensing) inside their wallets.

Rating mechanism
Gratzio will employ the standard 5 star rating for both favor requesters and providers. In
order to vet new and unfamiliar to the platform service providers their ability to pick tasks
will be limited by certain reward prices until their rating will reach particular threshold that
will depend on the local markets.

10

Implementation
The implementation of Gratzio platform will be facilitated in two major phases.

Phase 1. Platform launch.
In order to successfully launch the project and attract substantial attention the core team
will hold a token sale to raise funds necessary to finish the development and promote the
platform. After the ICO we will launch the platform for the web and than make it available
on native iOS and Android platforms.
The initial version of the Gratzio dApp will be semi-decentralized. The payment and the
rating layers will be built on the blockchain and the dApp itself will have centralized
structure with traditional servers in place.
Additionally, during the phase 1, we are going to beta-launch the system for our users
voting to lay down the functionality for the future transition to Decentralized Autonomous
Organization.

Phase 2. DAO Transition
After the maturity of Gratzio dApp to version 1.0, the initial team are going to start the
transition to fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
To achieve complete decentralization the platform will be migrated to Decentralized
Virtual Machines Blockchain that is provided by our partners from Siegfried.
At this stage the initial team will steadily shift the control over the platform to its users,
maturing the user voting system and providing necessary mechanisms for users to
govern the organization in a true democratic and decentralized way. We plan to finish the
transition to Decentralized Autonomous Organization by the end of 2020.

Token
All payments within the Gratzio platform are powered by Gratz utility token based on a
Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). Gratz tokens can be acquired in three different ways:
1. Earned by offering services on the platform
2. Purchased in the Gratzio dApp
3. Purchased on third party crypto exchanges

Why Stellar blockchain?
There are several key reasons why we chose to build Gratzio platform on Stellar
Consensus Protocol apart from more “traditional” Etherium in terms of being a go-to
platform for ICO launches.
Transactions speed
The first is ​speed​. Stellar is way more faster than Ethereum. Given the fact that
cryptocurrency prices are very volatile, being able to make transactions quickly is crucial
for traders of cryptocurrencies. The average settlement time for Stellar transactions is
two to five seconds. For Ethereum, it is 3.5 minutes. This gives Stellar a tremendous
advantage over Ethereum.
Transaction costs
Stellar is also ​cheaper​. In fact, to make 100,000 transactions with Stellar, it only costs one
cent. This is largely because Stellar as a built-in exchange, and therefore no fees are
required to be paid to third party exchanges for transactions. Ethereum transactions are
significantly more expensive.
Built-in exchange
The fact that Stellar has its own​ built-in exchange​ which is extremely fast and incredibly
cheap means that Gratz tokens do not need 3rd party exchange approval and will be
available for exchange right after the main sale event.

13

Less vulnerable to security breaches
Another advantage over Ethereum - is ​higher security​. Ethereum offers the
“Turing-complete smart contracts.” These contracts allow businesses to set up a wide
variety of smart contracts which can be very complicated and therefore have more
potential vulnerabilities than Stellar’s contracts.
Less prone to DDoS and Sybil attacks
Since Stellar operates as a nonprofit organization The nominal fee, referred to as a base
fee, associated with each operation in a transaction only associated as a deterrent:
Though nominal, it discourages users with malicious intentions from flooding the network
with transactions (otherwise known as a DDoS attacks) and Sybil attacks. The base fee is
currently set to .00001 XLM—a fraction of a fraction of a penny. No one profits from the
base fee. The ledger collects the fees and redistributes them in the process of inflation.
And the last, but not least is the fact that The Stellar Consensus Protocol provides a
system to reach consensus without relying on a closed system that records transactions.
Therefore, Stellar doesn’t rely on Proof of Work (PoW) nor Proof of Stake (PoS) to secure
its blockchain. Instead the network relies on a ​Byzantine agreement system​.

Gradual User Acquisition Program
To expand the platform’s user base and evenly spread tokens we allocated 20% of the
total token supply or 200 million Gratz to the Gradual User Acquisition Program (GUAP).
This program will include airdrops, bounties, referral program, sign-up bonuses and
unique to Gratzio platform marketing technique we called Token Drops. We estimate the
program itself will attract at least 1,5-2 milion of new registered users within six month of
operation.

Sign-up bonus
In order to attract new users and persuade them to start using Gratzio platform we are
going to fund new accounts of users who downloads and installs Gratzio dApp on their
smartphone with a 100 Gratz sign-up bonus.

18

Sign-up bonus will be distributed to the first 1,000,000 registered users with unique cell
phone numbers.
As an additional protection measure from withdrawals of a bare sign-up bonus the
minimum amount of tokens available for exchange or withdrawal will be set to 1000
Gratz. This way, the sign-up bonus will be only available for spend on requesting favors
inside Gratzio platform.

Airdrops
As a necessary initial measure to raise awareness about Gratzio platform and spread the
tokens inside crypto community we will airdrop 40 million Gratz to users in exchange for
promoting Gratzio on social networks. The airdrop will run in 20 phases affecting 10,000
users per phase. The total number of users estimated to be attracted through airdrops is
200,000.

Token drops
To add some gamification to the process after the launch of the platform Gratzio will
perform the Token Drops of 20 million gratz. Spreading small amounts of the tokens on
the map for users to collect Pokemon-style. The tokens will be spread proportionally in
the areas with our existing token holders to jumpstart the nearby communities of Gratzio
associates who will do favors for our token holders later.

Bounty
To kick-start the platform we are going to offer 20 million gratz as a bounty to users who
will do favors for the benefit of the platform. Users will be asked to write articles or even
perform some offline tasks like paint nearby walls with Gratzio logo. Just kidding. But
everything is possible.

19

Referral program
To stimulate our existing users to share their experiences of Gratzio with their friends we
allocated a 20 million gratz into referral program. Registered users will be able to earn
gratz by referring their friends to Gratzio with affiliate links and graphic materials we
provide.
