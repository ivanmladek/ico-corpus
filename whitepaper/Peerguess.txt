“Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion”
W. Edwards Deming

White Paper
Version v2.0

Preface
peerguess is a cryptocurrency price ticker application where

users may also guess future prices to earn gems; learn about
community tendencies and reach sophisticated data.
We thought that it would be easier for our audience to perceive our
project through a simple and concise set of Q & A framings rather than
reading a long and boring narrative. In the following sections, you will
find the unique functionality and features of peerguess, our innovative
solution to track, predict and analyze cryptocurrency based on
gamification principles, which we believe will attract a huge mass
appeal.
We also believe that the audience of our project
is the entire cryptocurrency community and
therefore, we think that every member of the
community, either a newbie investor or a
seasoned miner should consider reading this
White Paper.

What is the story behind the idea?
Almost everyone in the cryptocurrency world checks the price of the
currencies through an application, usually Coin Ticker, Blockfolio or
similar. While none of these applications provide accurate information
on what to invest, they merely allow to track the market status or your
portfolio value.
We also know that almost everyone in the community (whether a
crypto trader, a miner, a small investor or a big whale) spends endless
time, experience, and even luck to look up for investment hints and
clues from resources such as blogs, twitter, slack communities, troll
boxes and coinmarketcap.com.
We thought about one solution to kill two birds with one stone, we
thought about peerguess.

What is peerguess?
peerguess is a free application to track cryptocurrencies from

various exchanges, create portfolio and alerts, designed to function
applications like Coin Ticker, Blockfolio and/or crypto projects like
CoinDash, DetectorToken, and Trackr. To become a game changer in
the cryptocurrency world, peerguess is designed with gamification
experience. We decided to add gamification principles to the watcher
and portfolio management applications, in which you can guess the
next 24h value of a specific cryptocurrency using the Gems provided
or purchased.
From individuals to an ecosystem, the power of the peerguess
platform comes from creating a whole that is larger than the sum of
its parts. While users play with Gems and make guesses, these guesses
will create a community thought, and as an output, you will be able to
see what the community thinks about Bitcoin’s (or any other altcoin)
value in the next 24 hours. As a result, the predictions of your own
portfolio along with the whole cryptocurrency world will be visible to
you.

What are the unique features of
peerguess?
We believe that, in short time, all cryptocurrency ticker and portfolio
applications will be replaced by peerguess as it provides not just the
common features all cryptocurrency followers have been looking for,
but also a game to play even if you don’t currently own any
cryptocurrency.
As some of you know and as explained in sections below, it’s not
possible to introduce tokens as a payment
method in AppStore. Therefore, we have
created “Gems”, which you will be able to
convert them to ERC20 type GUESS Tokens
over Ethereum platform. You will start with
Gems given and you will either buy from the inapp purchase or convert GUESS tokens to
Gems.
The gaming section will be simple at heart. You
will set the amount of Gem you want to play
with and you will click Up or Down buttons. For
example, if the price for one Ethereum is $261
now, you will try to guess if it will be lower or
higher than $261 after 24 hours. Playing the
game, will also allow all users to train with Gems,
and compare their predictions with the realworld data.
From that point forward, our platform will
analyze the Gem play data to provide sophisticated results, reports
and opportunities to make profit.

We have created four different modules by complexity:
〉

Cumulative Guess Analytics (CGA) will serve as the general opinion
of the community. For example, you will see that 75% of peerguess
users believe that BTC/USD will decrease in the next 24h.

〉

Recommendation Engine (RE) will:
›

Display a list of cryptocurrencies for users who predict both a
cryptocurrency and another currency (like e-commerce
recommendations).

›

Recommend currencies based on your prediction history and
your segmentation.

〉

Auto-Trade (AT) will use the historical
success rates and many other indicators
to create triggers and parameters from
the application and make trades on your
chosen exchange/platform.

ñ

Stigmergic Quantitative Data (SQD)
will be based on Positive and Negative
Guesses made, which can be filtered by
Country, Time Zone, Language and
many more data fields to assist you to
understand the different dynamics on
cryptocurrency world.

How will we use the Gems?
All new users are provided 100 Gems at start and are
predicting the cryptocurrencies’ future value in the next 24
hours by using the provided markets’ average value. The
predictions can be made with 1 to 10 Gems, which will be
doubled for an accurate prediction at the end of the 24
hours.
Every 24 hours, we check the Gem balance and we deposit
10 Gems as a gift for the users with a zero Gem balance.
Also, In-App purchase is available to buy more gems.
The web version of the application will allow all users to
convert Gems to GUESS tokens, which will transform the
Gems earned in the game to a real-life value.

The GUESS tokens will be
provided from our liquidation reserves.
By limiting the Gems between a
minimum of 1 and maximum of 10
within a 24-hour interval, we will
ensure to prevent large payouts at
early stages.
For the later stages, we are planning to
raise the limits as high as possible,
including short-term and long-term
guesses and lower/higher multiplier
options.

How will you implement tokens in the
mobile world, what is your plan?
Due to restrictions imposed by Apple, it is currently not possible to
introduce a currency that could be bought outside of the In-App
Purchase system, nor it is possible to sell a feature or alike through
something other than the In-App Purchase system. In other words,
especially on the Apple side, we can’t enable people to play with the
tokens. Whereas we also know that if the application is cross platform,
and the version you have does not promote the other one, Apple is not
interested in users buying the Gems from somewhere else.
In short, we will have an In-App Purchase system for Apple and Google
side, but we will also have Web, Facebook and other platforms in
which we will introduce systems to convert Gems to Tokens and buy
Gems with Tokens with super high discounts of more than 50%.

How will you get more people in?
As mentioned in many sections, we have four main features in the
peerguess platform; which are Cumulative Guess Analytics, Recommendation Engine, Auto-Trade and Stigmergic Quantitative Data.
We know that for accurate results, we will need a large population of
daily active users, and we need them to become a part of the decisionmaking process in our search to a basic question: “Will Bitcoin increase
or decrease in the next 24 hours?”. To facilitate this answer, we are
bringing some of the gamification principles into the project and add
Gems and Tokens to the system.
By following the gamification principles, we know that, in time, many
users will enjoy competing with friends, family and with each other,
and competition will attract more users via word of mouth
advertisement. We are also dedicating a large budget for a targeted
segment marketing to acquire innovators and early adopters.

What will you do to make data more
reliable?
The idea of collective intelligence follows the idea of collective
wisdom, which simply says “many heads are in general better than
one”. Our unique data engine will collect data, analyze and report to
form “Consensus Clustering”.
The idea of collective intelligence can be traced back to Aristotle and
the philosophers of antiquity. One theoretical basis for collective
wisdom can be derived from Condorcet’s Jury Theorem.
Condorcet's jury theorem is a political science theorem about the
relative probability of a given group of individuals arriving at a correct
decision. The assumptions of the simplest version of the theorem are
that a group wishes to reach a decision by majority vote. One of the
two outcomes of the vote is correct, and each voter has an
independent probability 𝑝 of voting for the correct decision. The
theorem asks how many voters we should include in the group.

Assuming that we raise necessary funds to get FX licensing.

Condorcet's jury theorem calculates the probability, 𝑃𝑁 , that a jury
gives the correct answer, given:
𝑁 = the number of jurors
𝑝 = the probability of an individual juror being right
𝑚 = the number of jurors required for a majority
Condorcet’s jury theorem in its simplest form has the following
formula based around the cumulative binomial distribution:
𝑁

𝑁!
𝑖
𝑁−𝑖
. (𝑝) (1 − 𝑝)
(𝑁 − 𝑖)! 𝑖!

𝑃𝑁 = ' (
𝑖=𝑚

Condorcet’s jury theorem assumes that all jurors are independent and
with the same probability of being right. Condorcet’s jury theorem
could be applied to our case as guessing theory, given the assumption

peerguess
COLLABORATIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY TICKER

that there is a correct guess. When this is done, jurors are replaced
with guessers.

The graph on the left shows 𝑃𝑁 versus N, with 𝑝 fixed at 0.51 and 𝑚
chosen to be

1
2

+ 1. The dashed line is horizontal at 0.51. Once the

electorate size gets large enough, as long as people are right more
often than they are wrong, the probability for the correct voting
outcome is greater than an individual’s probability of being right.
The graph on the right shows 𝑃𝑁 versus p, with N fixed at 51 and m
fixed at 26. The dashed line is where 𝑃𝑁 = 𝑝. The graph shows that
for a sufficiently large enough electorate, if 𝑝 ≥ 0.5 then 𝑃𝑁 ≥ 𝑝 and if
𝑝 ≤ 0.5 then 𝑝 ≤ 𝑃𝑁 .
The graphs suggest that when an electorate is large enough, and
individuals in that electorate are right more often than they are
wrong, elections would act as a “truth tracker” which in our case would
mean that if we have enough population to guess the currencies’ in the
next 24h, our platform will provide the best predictions possible to use
with our Recommendation Engine, Auto-Trade and Stigmergic
Quantitative Data modules.
We will be also using the theories and principles from Smarm
Intelligence and Stigmergy, which is a consensus social network
mechanism of indirect coordination through the environment (our
application) between agents or actions (Gems and guessing). The
principle states that the trace left in the environment by an action

peerguess
COLLABORATIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY TICKER

10

stimulates the performance of the next action, by the same or a
different agent. Consequently, subsequent actions tend to reinforce
and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of
coherent, apparently systematic activity. This is also where the
blockchain architectures obtain their power from, and where we will
get our power from.
Derived from the Jury Theorem, the Swarm Intelligence and the
Stigmergy; we will be largely relying our back end, our data engine on
Unanimous AI project, created by MIT. There are numerous reports
and results about the project, which can be found on their website but
let’s dig one example as a point of reference;
Experts at the New York Times made predictions for the 2015
Academy Awards. These experts possessed far deeper knowledge
than the novice members of the study. Still, the New York Times only
showed a 55% success rate. Whereas a group of 7 novices, functioning
as a social swarm, made predictions that surpassed industry experts,
with 73%. Although not conclusive, this result suggests that social
swarming may provide a means of achieving expert-level insights from
groups of non-experts.
Our application will be even more than that as we will be creating a
melting pot of novices and experts trying to guess the future.
Meanwhile, they will create swarm intelligence, and at some point, the
end result of these guesses will create a consensus and thus a robust
and reliable engine to serve all who have access rights.

GUESS Token Structure
GUESS tokens are Ethereum based ERC20 tokens at its simple form.
The total supply of GUESS token is non-re-issuable 200,000,000 of
which 6,000,000 is bought during the ICO period and 2,000,000 is
distributed as bounty rewards.
The funds raised during the ICO is invested in the further development
of the project, as well as paying the marketing and maintenance costs
for the infrastructure.

What are the privileges of holding
GUESS tokens?
ñ

You can buy Gems with more than 50%
off AppStore price (depending on
actual GUESS token market value).

ñ

Every

Sunday

morning,

we

will

distribute 100 Gems to all holders of
the GUESS tokens for each $10 worth
of GUESS tokens they kept for 7 days.
For example, a token holder with 1,000
GUESS tokens with GUESS/USD =
$0.05. The holder will receive 500 free
Gems on Sunday morning.

What is your Road Map?
We believe that our potential for next phase developments are
tremendous. For clear reasons, we prefer not to uncover excessive
details for now. We would like to emphasize that we want to actively
contribute to the cryptocurrency world and we consider it as a part of
our mission to promote the decentralized thinking. Therefore, our
Road Map is subject to minor changes along the way and there might
be more features and ideas not mentioned here.

Glossary of Terms
ICO: An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) used by startups to bypass the
rigorous and regulated capital-raising process required by venture
capitalists or banks. In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the
cryptocurrency is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for
legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, but usually for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin: A digital currency created in 2009. It follows the ideas set out
in a white paper by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true
identity has yet to be verified. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower
transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is
operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued
currencies.
Altcoin: Alternative cryptocurrencies launched after the success of
Bitcoin. Generally, they project themselves as better substitutes to
Bitcoin.
Cryptocurrency: A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography
for security. A defining feature of a cryptocurrency, and arguably its
most endearing allure, is its organic nature; it is not issued by any
central authority, rendering it theoretically immune to government
interference or manipulation.
Blockchain: A type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangeable,
digitally recorded data in packages called blocks (rather like collating
them on to a single sheet of paper). Each block is then ‘chained’ to the
next block, using a cryptographic signature. This allows block chains to
be used like a ledger, which can be shared and accessed by anyone
with the appropriate permissions.
Stigmergy: The process by which the results of an insect's activity act
as a stimulus to further activity.
Stigmergic: Of or pertaining to stigmergy.
