Abstract
The DIM Ecosystem (DIM-E) is a cryptonized ecosystem that is built on the NEM blockchain. The DIM-E offers multiple products and services such as DIMCOIN, DIM Currencies, DIM Cryptocurrencies, DIM TOKEN, HYBSE, IBIN, DIM X, DEPOTWALLET, DIM
Explorer, DIMWALLET and DIMPAY. The DIM-E is a solution to the inefficiencies of the
traditional systems. The traditional systems have problems such as high fees, red tapes
and multiple intermediaries. As a result, a peer-to-peer and low-cost cryptonized platform is necessary to provide an alternative to traditional systems.

Risk Disclaimer: Use of cryptocurrencies involves risk of loss and may not be suitable
for every user. The valuation of the DIM may fluctuate and, as a result, participants may
lose more than the original amounts with which they purchased the DIM. Before using
cryptocurrencies, one should carefully consider one’s objectives, level of experience
and risk appetite. Negligent or improper use of blockchain based services may result
in loss.

Introduction

Introduction
DIM (Data Interchange Module) offers cryptocurrencies (DIMCOIN, DIM Currencies
and DIM Cryptocurrencies) that give their users access to a new cryptonized ecosystem built on blockchain technology. The DIM-E offer decentralized and cryptonized
products and services. Cryptonization is the process of dematerializing products and
services into the blockchain. The ecosystem uses the Internet of Things (IoT) together
with blockchain technology. IoT is the interconnection of computing devices through
the internet for the purpose of sending and receiving data. Traditional systems generally use IoT on its own. The fusion of IoT and blockchain by the DIM-E leads to reduced
transactional costs, intermediaries and an increase in efficiency. Traditional systems
have too many brokerage intermediaries increasing the cost of transactions and some
of these costs have dedicated intermediaries. The DIM-E is a multi-service ecosystem
that participants can utilize peer-to-peer (P2P) without limitations. In the DIM-E participants are in full control of their transactional accounts and wallets are made accessible with payments instantly made and confirmed. Before understanding the DIM-E,
potential participants must understand cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in
general.

Cryptocurrencies & Blockchain

Cryptocurrencies & Blockchain
The introduction of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamato created the cryptocurrency market
and also introduced a new technology called blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are digital
coins or tokens built on a blockchain technology governed by decentralized ledger
systems with enhanced securities. Cryptocurrencies use cryptography and shared public ledgers (blockchain) which make these digital coins secure, traceable and in many
cases anonymous. Cryptography is the science that enables users to store sensitive
information and transmit that information using mathematics to encrypt and decrypt.
Cryptography and blockchain are also the foundations for the creation, mining, and
harvesting of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized in nature, meaning
that there is no central point of concentration, therefore increasing their desirability for
security conscious users. Decentralization reduces the roles of intermediaries, leading
to reduced transaction costs. This also eliminates the necessity to be backed by central
authorities such as banks, governments and similar institutions. Banks control the flow
of finance within geographical regions and they act as individuals within the global
financial ecosystem. On decentralized platforms, the users are the entities that control
the flow of finances, data, etc. Individual users operate as a collective within the decentralized platforms.
Blockchain technology allows for transactions to be done with complete accuracy because it is a fusion of computer P2P technology, cryptography and database systems.
Cryptography is utilized for encrypting messages on the ledger, but more significantly,
it is used for signing off transactions by users and to prove the authenticity of transactions. With cryptography, blockchain does not require supplementary security
solutions to protect the authenticity of transactions. The fusion of the aforementioned
technologies lead to a ledger system that is immutable and irreversible, meaning that
transactions cannot be tampered after they have been signed and transferred . Transactions become final and there is no double-spending. Blockchain‘s decentralized and
P2P nature means that the ledger eliminates a need for a data-centre and DRC (Disaster Recovery Centre) that houses core systems. The end result is that the ledger will
always be up and running. Blockchain as a technology was popularized by digital coins
such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. There are various blockchains in the cryptocurrency
market such as; NEM, Stellar, NEO and various others. The DIM and the DIM-E are built
on the NEM blockchain.

DIM Ecosystem Whitepaper
NEM Blockchain

NEM Blockchain
The NEM blockchain is underpinned by the consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Importance (POI). The POI is similar to Proof-of-Stake (POS), but the main difference is
that it integrates behavior that is trusted to be positive for the entire economy, while
POS derives importance from the user‘s account balance. POS underpins Peercoin.
POI also has an advantage over Proof-of-Work (POW), another popular system. POW
underpins Bitcoin. POI does not require large scale computing resources for maintaining the blockchain. The NEM network emphasizes security and trust-less computing.
The blockchain is run by a network of nodes operating together, in a P2P configuration.
The nodes record and verify transactions that are transmitted on the network. At block
time (periodic intervals), these transactions are grouped together. The transactions
then go through a hashing process that connects them to previous blocks. The network has anonymous users and transaction fees are paid using XEM. XEM is a native
cryptocurrency for the NEM network and it is used to pay for transaction fees. The
NEM blockchain is the basis for the DIM and DIM-E, but the DIM Foundation oversees
them both.

DIM Foundation
The DIM Foundation is a non-profit organization that is responsible for the marketing,
public relations, customer care and oversight of the DIM (DIMCOIN, DIM Currencies,
DIM Cryptocurrencies and future DIM denominated coins). The DIM Cryptocurrencies
are discussed in the DIM X section. DIM X is a cryptocurrency converting platform.
Some of the profits received by the foundation will be utilized to further improve the
DIM in order to increase the core value of the DIM-E. The DIM Foundation is registered
in Singapore but regional DIM Foundations can be created if there are enough ambassadors and promoters in one region. The regional DIM Foundation will be responsible
for:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Collecting donations from that particular region
Creating events for the DIM Ecosystem and attending blockchain events
Run campaigns for the DIM Foundation
Recruit businesses into the DIM Ecosystem
Becoming a central meeting point for ambassadors and promoters
Getting businesses listed on the Hybrid Stock Exchange (HYBSE)

DIM Ecosystem

DIM Ecosystem
DIM provides access to a cryptonized ecosystem called the DIM-E (DIM Ecosystem).
DIMCOIN was the first coin to offer entrance into the DIM-E. The DIM-E offers services
such as cryptonization, cryptonized-equities, cryptonized-equity exchange trading,
cryptonized-equity trading management, cryptocurrency exchanges, e-commerce,
inter-business transactions, business solutions, software for conducting business, and
cryptonized commodity trading and management. The DIM-E endeavors to encourage
the use of cryptocurrencies by both individuals and institutions, thus paving the way
for them to enter the crypto-data market. The crypto-data market is a market where
information, tradable items and services are exchanged on the blockchain. Within the
ecosystem, equities are valued and exchanged using DIM Currencies.
In traditional systems, some third parties control finances and assets. These parties
operate in secrecy and the levels of transparency are minimal. The ecosystem places
the participants in complete control of their finances and equities. Participants can
transact with each other across the globe straight from their computers and hand-held
devices. Through blockchain, the levels of transparency in the DIM-E are unmatched
compared with traditional systems. In the DIM-E, the participants are in control of their
accounts. Only the participants have access to their accounts on DEPOTWALLET, the
wallet is a blockchain storage and it allows participants to manage and trade all kinds
of cryptocurrencies and cryptonized-equities in the ecosystem. Participants can even
loan finances amongst each other directly. Contribution to the development of the
ecosystem by participants is through the suggestion and voting processes.
Usage of the DIM-E increases convenience for participants. This is achieved through
DIMCOIN, DIM Currencies, DIM Cryptocurrencies, DIM TOKEN, Hybrid Stock Exchange
(HYBSE), DIM X, DEPOTWALLET, DIMPAY and other services that will be introduced in
the future. Potential participants can be part of the DIM-E through using DIMCOIN, DIM
Currencies, DEPOTWALLET, DIMPAY, HYBSE, HYBSE white label software, crypto-fiat
exchange software and by creating a DIM Foundation office in their region.

DIMCOIN

DIMCOIN
DIMCOIN is a new offering in the cryptocurrency market. It is the first time that a cryptocurrency is also a gateway to a complete cryptonized ecosystem. DIMCOIN is a speculative digital coin that is built upon the NEM blockchain, making the coins low-cost
and transparent. They have high confirmation speeds and they are available worldwide.
DIMCOIN has a quantity commitment of 9 billion coins. The coins are available in cryptocurrency exchange platforms and are traded P2P. The price of DIMCOIN is determined by market forces and cryptocurrency exchange mechanisms. DIMCOIN is available
in fractional amounts. There are levies charged for transacting DIMCOIN in the DIM-E
and for general use. The levies form part of the DIM TOKEN payouts. The DIM TOKEN
payouts are rewards given to DIM TOKEN holders who have 50 DIM TOKENS or more.

DIM Currencies
DIM Currencies are a medium of exchange in the DIM-E. They are not pegged to fiat
currencies in terms of their value and they have their own values in precious metals
and cryptocurrencies. DIM Currencies are not legal tender but they are the official data
interchange modules of the DIM-E. The objective of DIM Currencies is to bring the best
qualities of currencies on the blockchain for cryptonized-equity, all kinds of commerce and trade. DIM Currencies allow the crypto-community to understand the price of
products and services within the DIM-E. There will be various DIM Currencies available.
More information on DIM Currencies will be made available in the DIM X whitepaper.

DIM TOKEN
The DIM TOKENS were made available to the public through the DIMCOIN Initial Coin
Offering (ICO). An ICO is crowdfunding initiative to raise funds for blockchain based
projects. There are only 10 million DIM TOKENS. The 50+ DIM TOKEN holders get
rewarded with a percentage of fees accrued from within the DIM-E including through
DIMPAY. DIMPAY is payment system available in the DIM-E. The rewards are distributed
by DIM Payout which is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). DAO is an
entity that is run through rules encoded as computer programs. The fees are charged
when the DIM (DIMCOIN, DIM Currencies, DIM Cryptocurrencies & future DIM denominated coins) and other DIM cryptonized-equities are transferred within the DIM-E as
displayed in the table below. These rewards will be conducted on a quarterly basis to
the 50+ DIM TOKEN holders.

The majority of the collected fees (40%) will go to the HYBSE. DIM TOKEN holders
with 50 or more tokens will receive 30% of the net fees collected according the percentage of DIM TOKENS in their wallet addresses. The remaining 30% is the Government Cooperation Funds that are fees collected for future cooperation with government agencies. For cryptocurrencies and blockchain based products to be truly
mainstream, there has to be government cooperation. Governments and blockchain
based operations can have a symbiotic relationship. The Government Cooperation
Funds will have collected fees and they will be preserved for future cooperation with
government agencies such as tax authorities and future government frameworks such
as possible future transaction taxes.

HYBSE

HYBSE
The traditional equity systems are defined by red-tape, excessive fees and long waiting periods before trading can commence. They are also overwhelmed with too many
intermediaries such as brokerage firms, clearing houses and share registrars. Too many
intermediaries increase costs and decrease efficiency. The Hybrid Stock Exchange
(HYBSE) is a NEM blockchain based platform that eliminates the aforementioned
hurdles, allowing participants to conduct business on a secure and efficient platform.
The HYBSE is an online equity exchange that offers small and medium enterprises
(SME) a platform to seek and access international capital. It is an online cryptonized
trading floor where buyers and sellers meet directly for exchange purposes. Users can
trade cryptonized cryptocurrencies, equities and commodities. The programming of
the HYBSE fused blockchain technology after the decision to conduct trading using
cryptocurrencies.
The platform is a hybdrid-blockchain platform since traditional equity is cryptonized
in order to be traded. Trading on the platform is P2P in nature, eliminating the need
for too many external intermediaries. The HYBSE accepts dual listing of businesses
that have approval from local authorities within their jurisdiction. Businesses will need
to verify with local authorities in their jurisdiction for possible additional requirements
before listing on the HYBSE.
The DIM Currencies are recognized and permitted as a medium of exchange on the
platform. Users can obtain DIM Currencies from DIM X in order to trade. Issuers will
have their equities cryptonized by the HYBSE before they are listed on the platform.
Before cryptonized-equities are listed on the HYBSE, they are required to have an
International Blockshare Identification Number (IBIN). IBIN is an identification number
for cryptonized-equities on the blockchain. Participants will have their cryptonized
instruments deposited into their DEPOTWALLET accounts, thereafter allowing them to
trade. More information will be made available when the HYBSE whitepaper is released.

DIM Ecosystem Whitepaper
IBIN

IBIN
The International Blockshare Identification Number (IBIN), is an identification number
for equities that seek to be listed on blockchain based exchanges. Before the cryptonized-equities can be listed they need an IBIN, which is the blockchain equivalent of International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). ISIN is an identification number that
is utilized to identify financial assets such as securities in traditional systems. IBIN consist of 13 alphanumeric characters that are unique to the respective cryptonized-equity,
cryptonized-exchange traded commodities and other cryptonized products.
The IBIN structure consists of a two-letter code, nine-digit numeric identifier and a
single check-digit number together with a blockshare identifier. The two-letter code
identifies the issuer’s country of origin. The middle section, nine-digit numeric identifier, is the International Blockshare Identification Number that identifies the cryptonized-equity. The single check-digit plus the blockshare identifier are for security and
blockchain identification purposes. Every IBIN ends with the letter B to indicate that it
is equity traded on the blockchain.
Similar to ISIN, IBIN is not a ticker that identifies equity on exchanges. Ticker symbols
representing the same cryptonized-equity can be different depending on where they
are traded. IBIN is the only shared denominator that identifies cryptonized-equity
and traded blockchain offerings. The ticker symbols are placed after the IBIN number.
For example, Vision, a graphic design company, is registered in Japan and it is listed
on Y-Exchange and S-Exchange. Both are crypto- equity exchanges. Vision’s ticker
symbol on Y-Exchange is VS1. Vision’s ticket symbol on S-Exchange is VS2. Vision will
be identified as JP1234567890B VS1 on Blockchain Y-Exchange and it will be identified as JP1234567890B VS2 on S-Exchange. IBIN is the only shared denominator that
identifies cryptonized-equity and traded blockchain offerings on different blockchain
exchanges. IBIN does not issue ticker symbols, ticker symbols are issued by the exchanges.
An IBIN cannot be issued twice. This is due to the process of random production. IBIN
is randomly and uniquely generated, so the same numbers cannot be reproduced twice. More information on IBIN can be found in the IBIN whitepaper (ibin.io).

DIM X

DIM X
Cryptocurrency exchanges are digital platforms that permit users (buyers and sellers)
to trade cryptocurrencies against various other cryptocurrencies and in the near future
fiat currencies. Exchanges offer different trade pairing options depending on the type
of exchange. Their pairing options include buying cryptocurrencies with other cryptocurrencies, buying cryptocurrencies purely with fiat currencies and buying cryptocurrencies with both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. There’s a niche market of
converting existing cryptocurrencies into coins built on one blockchain that has been
left untouched. This is a niche market that DIM X aims to pioneer.
DIM X is a cryptocurrency converting platform, the platform converts different cryptocurrencies into Data Interchange Modules (DIM) Cryptocurrencies. DIM X is a project
that was born from the problem of high fees and slow confirmation speeds that are
prevalent with other cryptocurrencies and blockchains. The second problem is the numerous coins on the market. There are over one thousand coins available in the market
and most of them have their own individual wallets. This creates a burden of having
multiple wallets and multiple passwords. The solution to these problems is to duplicate the various cryptocurrencies on a single blockchain, one that has low fees and high
confirmation speeds. The duplicated cryptocurrencies will be able to be transacted at
high speeds and in large quantities without the worries of different transaction fees
and multiple logins to various wallets.
The converted cryptocurrencies will be duplicates (mosaics) on the NEM blockchain.
DIM X is the bridge that introduces the different cryptocurrencies onto one blockchain.
The use of one blockchain creates convenience for users and holders of different cryptocurrencies. This is due to their cryptocurrencies being located and transacted on one
blockchain. DIM X will initially only convert Bitcoin and Ethereum into DIM Cryptocurrencies such as DIM BTC and DIM ETH. The values of the converted DIM BTC and DIM
ETH will be linked to market prices of the actual Bitcoin and Ethereum coins. Additional coins will made available for conversion through DIM X per request by the DIM-E
community. More information will be provided when the DIM X whitepaper is released.

DEPOTWALLET

DEPOTWALLET
DEPOTWALLET is a blockchain wallet that permits participants to buy, sell, manage
and hold DIM and cryptonized-equities. DIM and cryptonized-equities can be globally
accessed via computers and hand-held devices. Participants can create an account and
they will receive a private key and a wallet file (.wlt). The private key, .wlt file and password they create will give participants access to the wallet. The wallet has an interface
that is user-friendly and simple to operate. Users do not need to have a bank account
to set-up a DEPOTWALLET account and the set-up is free of charge.
The interface allows participants to connect and communicate with nodes on the NEM
blockchain. The information that is displayed on DEPOTWALLET is information that is
received from the nodes. The wallet is secure by design, has a decentralized consensus
and can be backed up. The DEPOTWALLET addresses are base-32 encoded. Participants must have a DEPOTWALLET to receive their DIM, cryptonized-equities and to
conduct business in the DIM-E. The wallet has innovative online banking encryption
standards.
The wallet can be utilized for personal use through private accounts. Simultaneously, it
can be used for large scale business purposes via multisignature (multisig) accounts.
DEPOTWALLET is more than just a wallet, it is also a blockchain explorer for the DIM-E
based on NEM technology. Being a blockchain explorer, participants can view transactions. For more detailed transaction details, DEPOTWALLET participants can use the
DIM Explorer (dimexplorer.io). The DIM Explorer reveals transaction details from every
DEPOTWALLET address. The DIM Explorer preserves the privacy of DEPOTWALLET
participants, the explorer does not reveal passwords and other security related details.
The use of DEPOTWALLET and DIM Explorer create a transparent ecosystem.

18

DIM Ecosystem Whitepaper
DEPOTWALLET

DEPOTWALLET
Private Account
When participants complete the registration process, their default account will be a
private account. Private accounts utilize public and private keys for encryption and
decryption. A participant‘s public key is available for everyone to see in the DIM-E and
NEM blockchain. That public key is used to encrypt information meant for that particular participant and only that particular participant can decrypt the information using
a private key . If participants forget their passwords or lose their.wlt files, they can use
to private key to access DEPOTWALLET. If the participant loses the private key, the
encrypted information including the DIMCOIN and the cryptonized-equities will remain
inaccessible and thus LOST to the participant. The user must ensure the safety of the
private key by making copies of them and storing them in secure places. DEPOTWALLET‘s management does not keep copies of private keys and passwords in cold data
storage.

Multisignature Account
Private accounts can be converted into multisignature (multisig) accounts . Multisig
accounts are demanding on the network and thus generally have higher fees associated with them compared to private accounts. The details of the co-signatories must
be provided during the creation of, or conversion to multisig accounts. The number of
co-signatories is capped at 32 co-signatories. The addition or removal of co-signatories
to or from accounts require the approval of all existing co-signatories to co-sign and
approve the adjustments. The participant being removed does not need to co-sign during the removal process. Multisig accounts are best suited for accounts with numerous
participants or with large sums of DIMCOIN, DIM Currencies, DIM Cryptocurrencies or
cryptonized-equities. These accounts are best suited for corporations, non-governmental organizations or other similar sized entities. Multisig accounts are safer due to the
requirement of a number of signatures before transactions are authenticated. Co-signatories have 24 hours to co-sign a transaction from its inception before it becomes
void.

Transactions & Nodes
When a new transaction is created, it is delivered to a node. A node is a server on a
decentralized network that is run by users of the NEM blockchain. When a node receives a new transaction, it places the transaction into its unconfirmed transactions cache.
The node then broadcasts the validated transaction to other nodes on the network .
Unconfirmed transactions reflected on the dashboard as unconfirmed and amounts do
not reflect on the balance, only after they have been validated will they reflect. Nodes
receive harvesting (mining) fees for validating transactions on the wallet.

DIMPAY

DIMPAY
DIMPAY is a global payment system that is fast, cost-effective and fully secure. DIMPAY aims to disrupt the traditional peer-to-peer (P2P), business-to-business (B2B),
business-to-consumer (B2C) and consumer-to-business (C2B) payment systems by
offering low fees, transparency, instantaneous and a decentralized platform. The use
of DIMPAY will eliminate payment errors and inefficiencies that occur with brick and
mortar merchants. This will be achieved by scanning a Quick Response (QR) code from
their mobile devices instead of using cashiers. QR codes are two-dimensional codes
that “were invented as an advancement of the common one dimensional barcodes” .
As mobile devices continue to increase with popularity, the adoption of QR codes and
mobile payments have the potential to increase. The QR code will be the foundation
for P2P, B2B and B2C experience using DIMPAY. The use of the QR code will eliminate
the need for numerous participants such as cashiers in the payment process. The elimination of numerous participants will lead to decreased costs and increased efficiency
and savings for both consumers and merchants.
DIMPAY is a creation of the DIMPAY Foundation and it comprises of DEPOTWALLET,
DIMPAY and DIMWALLET. The applications are interconnected and their functions supplement each other.

offer full support to the DIMPAY Foundation as a pilot project. DIMPAY will operate
independently within the DIM-E. The DIM Foundation has permitted the development
of DIMPAY to be outsourced exclusively to the DIMPAY Foundation. This is to ensure
that the DIM-E is decentralized, not just at the foundational blockchain level but the
operational level too.

initially be the same in terms of user interface, functions and features. The main difference is that the user interfaces will be themed differently. In time, both applications
will evolve to be unique as participants of both applications recommend improvements. The applications will receive similar significant updates such as security features
and performance upgrades. Their functional updates will be different.

DIMWALLET, participants will be able to trade and manage cryptonized-equities on
the go. DIMPAY is for commercial use. Participants will be able “to make payments ‘any
time, anywhere’, becoming less dependent on the need to carry cash which in turn
could reduce the risk of theft”. Merchants will be able to receive payments for products
and services. They will also be able to generate invoices.

Dispute Resolution

Consumer & Merchant
Dispute Resolution
If a sale does not proceed in a manner that participants were anticipating, they can
enter into a Dispute Resolution Dialogue (DRD). The DRD is a bipartisan (two-way)
private chat between the consumer and the merchant. If the consumer is the aggrieved
party, they can initiate the dialogue with the relevant merchant. If the merchant is the
aggrieved party, the merchant can initiate the dialogue. The participants engage with
each other to find a possible resolution.
If a resolution cannot be found, one or both parties can choose to escalate the matter
into the Dispute Resolution Negotiations (DRN). A DRN is a tripartite (three-way) dialogue that involves a DIMPAY Foundation Ambassador from their respective country.
The ambassador will also act herein as the arbitrator. The merchants will be directed to
refund the consumer in case the Ambassador finds against their case.
If the Ambassador cannot resolve the disagreement, the matter can be escalated to
the DIMPAY Foundation. The DIMPAY Foundation will view the matter and try to assist
by offering an opinion on the dispute. If one or both participants are still not satisfied,
the matter can be escalated to the DIMPAY Foundation members. The DIMPAY Foundation members will then vote on the opinions received from the DIMPAY Foundation
and offer their opinions. If one or both participants do not accept the opinions and assistance from the DIMPAY Foundation members, they can submit the matter to a local
competent court in their jurisdiction in order to resolve the dispute.

Dispute Resolution Negotiations (DRN)
The consumer and merchant enter into three-way negotiations with an
impartial DIM Foundation Ambassador.
If the Ambassador finds* in favour of the consumer, the consumer gets a refund. If the Ambassador finds* in favour of the merchant, the merchant gets
to keep the funds.
*The findings by the Ambassador are only opinions on the dispute

DIMPAY Foundation offers an opinion on the dispute
DIMPAY Foundation members vote on the opinions received from the
DIMPAY Foundation and offer their opinions

If one or both parties do not accept the opinions from the DIMPAY
Foundation members, they can submit the matter to the court

Why use DIMPAY

Why use DIMPAY?
DIMPAY does not intend to disrupt the manner in which participants process payments. DIMPAY intends to cryptonize and digitize payment processes in order to have
cashless transactions. DIMPAY uses blockchain to cryptonize the payment process that
is familiar to participants. The familiar payment process for consumers involves paying
for an item using the local currency, such as the Euro or Indian Rupee. The traditional payment process for merchants is receiving payment for their inventory using a
local currency. Local currencies make their accounting easier to manage. Making the
payment process easier is possible through the use of DIM Currencies. The use of DIM
Currencies simplifies the process of purchasing using cryptocurrencies. DIM Currencies
allow the merchant to do invoices using the figures they are familiar with.
