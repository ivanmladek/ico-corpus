Summary
Alice acquires a treasure map drawn by pirate
Jack Sparrow. Understanding that some pirates
may be untrustworthy, Alice digs up the treasure
and moves it to a different chest in another
location. She copies the map and updates it with a
new ‘X marks the spot’, crossing out the previous
one and discarding the old map. Alice loses her
new map to Bob in a game of chance. Bob,
suspecting that Alice may have kept a copy of the
map, moves the treasure, makes a copy of the map
himself and updates it with a new ‘X’, again
discarding the original. He later uses the new map
as payment for Catherine. In such fashion, the map

and the location of the treasure change hands
many times over. However, if care is taken when
passing each map on, then there is no evidence
for the identity of any of the previous owners. The
only thing we know for sure is that the treasure and
the first map once belonged to Jack Sparrow.
Teleport uses packages called telepods to send all
the information required to make a transaction to
the desired recipient, over a secure connection
outside of the blockchain. Telepods are cloned by
the recipient to prevent double spending, and sent
to the next recipient when desired – or else
emptied onto a previously-used account on the
blockchain again. The contents of the telepod are
therefore recorded on the blockchain at the point of
cloning. However, if a completely new address is
used every time, there is no way to know who has
held the telepod over the course of its lifespan. The
only thing that may conceivably be inferred is the
original creator of the telepod.

Part I
Current approaches and limitations to

privacy
Introduction
Bitcoin has been a hugely successful
implementation of peer-to-peer cash. The use of
proof-of-work and blockchain technology allows
users to establish consensus and prove ownership
with no centralised authority, enabling fast, secure
and almost free transfer of money over the internet
for the first time.
However, the transparency with which this system
necessarily operates is a double-edged sword. On
the one hand, it prevents fraud: everyone on the
network can see the contents of any address and
whether a new transaction is consistent with the
existing blockchain, the shared ledger of previous
transactions. But this transparency also means that
privacy is almost impossible.
There are several ways in which privacy may be
compromised. Three of the chief means in which
blockchain analysis can be used include:
1) Transaction linkage
Although each map bears only one current
location for the treasure, ‘X’, evidence for every
previous location is preserved. The discarded maps

show incrementally more disused marks, so that by
studying previous maps a perfect history can be
constructed of where the treasure has been buried
for each successive owner. In itself, this may pose
no problem, especially if there is no other
information to identify the owner. However, as
soon as additional details are included on the map
– such as locations for other hoards of treasure,
frequented taverns, and so on – then deductions
may start to be made about who they are.
Although Bitcoin payments are often described as
anonymous, they are really pseudonymous: the
identity of the owner of a given address may not be
known, but there is a permanent record of every
transaction into and out of every account.
Nakamoto’s original paper acknowledges this:
‘The traditional banking model achieves a level
of privacy by limiting access to information to
the parties involved and the trusted third party.
The necessity to announce all transactions
publicly precludes this method... The public
can see that someone is sending an amount to
someone else, but without information linking
the transaction to anyone.’
[Image: tx linkage]

Every bitcoin transaction is traceable back to the
block from which it was mined, as well as to every
other address with which transactions have
occurred. Moreover, this information may be
linked to individuals through various means, as
described below.
2) Fingerprinting
Intending to transition from a life upon the high
seas to one as an honourable businessman,
Bootstrap Bill makes it known that he wants to use
his savings of 197 gold coins to purchase a large
amount of jute. The East India Trading Company
recognises this move as a threat to their monopoly
on the jute trade. Although the sale goes ahead in
secret, the Company knows the going price for
jute, 4.63 gold coins per metric bushel. They
therefore know that Bill has probably purchased in
the region of 43 metric bushels of jute. Spies are
instructed to look through merchants’ accounts for
the previous week for such an amount, in the hope
of tracking Bill and stopping him from selling his
goods.
Every transaction is time-stamped, and the entire
blockchain can be viewed by anyone. If Alice is
known to have made a transaction to Bob around a

certain time, and there is only one transaction
recorded during the relevant period, then clearly
the sending address belongs to Alice and the
recipient’s address belongs to Bob. Even if a large
number of transactions occur in that interval, it
may be possible to build up a picture over time
based on statistical probabilities. This approach,
called Transaction Fingerprinting, has successfully
been used to identify owners of specific addresses:
‘First, we developed a system for scraping
bitcoin addresses from public forums. Second,
we include a mechanism for matching users to
transactions using incomplete transaction
information. For example, suppose we hear
Bob say to Alice: “I sent you $100 in bitcoins
yesterday at noon”; though we don’t know the
exact time of the transaction (since “at noon”
could easily mean 11:50 or 12:10) or the exact
amount in bitcoins (exchange rates fluctuate
significantly), we can generate candidate
transaction matches and associated matching
probabilities.’
3) Mantissa attack
Realising that the East India Trading Company
know of his plan and will be monitoring the seas to

eliminate the competition, Bootstrap Bill decides
to sell the jute in three different locations.
Meanwhile, the Company’s spies have discovered
Bill’s purchase in the ledgers of a wealthy
merchant, learning that he bought 41.94 metric
bushels of jute. Bill sells his jute in batches of 20,
15 and 6.94 metric bushels. Round number
consignments are frequently traded and prompt no
questions. Unfortunately, the spies are alerted by
the distinctive amount after the decimal point for
the last sale, so the Company is able to determine
where he sold it and therefore his most recent
location.
Any amount of money can be sent with Bitcoin,
and since the exchange value is floating and dollarequivalent sums are often transacted, these
amounts may not be round numbers – leading to a
very specific mantissa or significand (the numbers
after the decimal point). If an unusual amount is
noticed – either because of its large size, or
because it appears to be an otherwise arbitrary
number – then a link may be made, since the odds
of this being a coincidence are minimal. If Alice
sends Bob 3.14159265 bitcoins then the
blockchain can easily be scanned and any accounts
transacting that amount tagged. Even if there are

several addresses sending the relevant amount,
some statistical correlations can be made.
‘Order books for Bitcoin exchanges are
typically available to support trading tools. As
orders are often placed in Bitcoin values
converted from other currencies, they have a
precise decimal value with eight significant
digits. It may be possible to find transactions
with corresponding amounts and thus map
public-keys and transactions to the exchanges.’
Using a combination of these approaches, it is
entirely possible to track payments through the
blockchain and trace them to individuals. This
ultimately makes Bitcoin ‘more traceable than
cash... you have to go to great lengths to cover
your tracks.’

Current solutions
There are a number of cryptocurrencies that offer
privacy features by mitigating against such attacks
in different ways, with varying degrees of success.
None is entirely satisfactory – either because the
level of anonymity gained is limited, in theory or
in practice, and/or because the solutions raise other
issues with regards to the long-term viability of the
cryptocurrency.

While no technical solution can solve all aspects of
the problem, especially against a determined
attacker with almost unlimited resources, there are
methods than can be used to protect the privacy of
cryptocurrency users.
It seems counterintuitive that it could be possible
both to enjoy the benefits of a publicly and
permanently available blockchain, and to maintain
the privacy of its users. However, this does indeed
become possible to a significant degree with the
use of certain processes and advanced
mathematical techniques.
Mixing
A hoard of 143 gold coins is liberated from a chest
belonging to Captain Crunch. Should the thief be
intercepted with the gold in his possession, his
crime will be known. To disguise the theft, the
culprit deposits sets of 1, 10 and 100 coins with a
series of trusted pirate acquaintances, to be
recovered at a later time in a series of arbitrary
amounts. Since the stolen coins are mixed with
other coins in the chests, it is very difficult to prove
which coins really belong to Captain Crunch –
even if they could be traced to these locations. As
an aside, it is worth remembering that there is

limited honour among pirates, so the thief may find
he has been double-crossed when he tries to
reclaim his loot.

DarkcoinWhitepaper.pdf"https://www.darkcoin.io/
downloads/DarkcoinWhitepaper.pdf p. 3]
Mixing services combine coins from many
different sources before sending them back to their
original owners (usually for a fee), with the
intention of obscuring where the funds originated.
In their simplest form, mixers are operated by
individuals and users are simply required to trust
them to return their funds. This is particularly
unsatisfactory since they are often operated
anonymously.
More sophisticated forms of mixing have been
automated and incorporated into the protocols of
different cryptocurrencies. For example, Darkcoin
uses an implementation of CoinJoin called
DarkSend. This optional facility collects together
inputs of the same size (denominations in powers
of 10 are used – 1 DRK, 10 DRK, 100 DRK and so
on) into a DarkSend Pool. Coins are mixed within
the DarkSend Pool and are returned to their owners

in a series of different amounts. The DarkSend
Pool is operated by a master node elected from its
participants.
Ring signatures
Most treasure chests can only be opened with a
single key, carefully guarded by the owner.
However, it is known that a particular treasure
chest can be opened by several people: using the
key owned by the Flying Dutchman; a skeleton key
belonging to Hector Barbossa; the ancient tool
possessed by Guybrush Threepwood; or the
toothpick belonging to the Dread Pirate Roberts.
When the treasure chest is opened, there is no way
of telling which of these four keys has been used.
Image: ring signature representation
A second approach to obscuring the identity of the
sender is to sign the transaction using one of a
number of possible keys. This is made possible by
the development of ring signatures, of which
CryptoNote (also employed by Monero and several
other cryptocurrencies) is the best-known
implementation.

Ring signature is a more sophisticated scheme,
which in fact may demand several different
public keys for verification. In the case of ring
signature, we have a group of individuals, each
with their own secret and public key. The
statement proved by ring signatures is that the
signer of a given message is a member of the
group. The main distinction with the ordinary
digital signature schemes is that the signer
needs a single secret key, but a verifier cannot
establish the exact identity of the signer.
Therefore, if you encounter a ring signature
with the public keys of Alice, Bob and Carol,
you can only claim that one of these individuals
was the signer but you will not be able to
pinpoint him or her.

Drawbacks and vulnerabilities
As stated above, none of the existing solutions are
truly satisfactory, though for different reasons.
Coin mixing solutions are effective in some
circumstances but are relatively trivial to
deanonymise at the level discussed in this paper,
where privacy centres around transactions between
single users. Increases in computer power may

render past mixing routinely transparent in the
future. To compound matters, large quantities of
coins are hard to anonymise quickly, unless there
are similarly large sums with which to mix them.
Ring signatures are substantially more powerful,
since each transaction provides only statistical
correlations. Assuming each transaction has 10
possible parties involved, with any length of
chaining the power of statistical linkage quickly
reduces to the level of background noise. Coins
based on CryptoNote may (like DarkSend) also
minimise the problem of a Mantissa attack by
splitting all of the transactions into power-of-10
outputs (for example, 1.23 RingCoins would be
treated as 1 RC + 0.2 RC + 0.03 RC). Thus a
transaction is obscured, though some weak
correlations are still possible.
Centralisation and money flow
The centralisation inherent in most mixing services
represents a clear vulnerability. Where trust in an
individual is required, this constitutes an
unacceptable solution for most users. Additionally,
‘[DarkSend] Masternodes can be controlled and
thus the controller of the Masternode can learn
about a certain transaction, if they were

inclined to. There is a negative incentive to
own many masternodes through their high price
(so if a government agency wanted to own all
masternodes that would escalate the cost of
owning the nodes to a very high price) but this
in itself does not prevent the mapping of the
network to a certain degree. The next versions
of DarkSend aim to improve on this aspect in
particular.’
Mixing using protocols such as CoinJoin
‘obfuscates money flows, and not account
balances’, meaning that information on and off the
blockchain can still be analysed to build up a
picture of accounts usage and owner identity.
Blockchain bloat
Ring signatures typically offer a superior degree of
privacy over mixing solutions. Unfortunately, one
of the major issues with cryptocurrencies that
derive their privacy from ring signatures is
blockchain bloat. Bitcoin blocks may contain
several hundred transactions within a package of
200-400 Kb. Monero block sizes regularly exceed
10Kb and often 20Kb but contain just a handful of
transactions. At the beginning of August 2014,
Bitcoin’s blockchain was around 20 Gb. (Most of

the increase occurred in the last two years, which
account for over 90 percent of Bitcoin’s 43 million
total transactions and 313,000 blocks at that time.)
By contrast, Monero’s blockchain stood at around
2 Gb after just three months and 170,000
transactions: an order-of-magnitude difference.
These and other issues were noted by one
reviewer:
‘There are some critical problems with
CryptoNote. The size of the the entire project is
just enormous. Key sizes are double the usual
size. Unspent transaction output sets and key
image sets both grow in an uncontrolled way.
Most troubling is the centralization point of
allowing an anonymous person on the internet
choosing all of our elliptic curve constants
without explaining himself.’
It is rightly acknowledged that ‘CryptoNote is
absolutely spectacular’ and the advances it offers
groundbreaking. Nevertheless, unless addressed,
the blockchain bloat associated with the use of
ring signatures is likely to limit widespread
adoption of the cryptocurrencies based on them.

Part II
Teleport: a new approach
Teleport is a different approach to privacy that
seeks to use one of the very features of
cryptocurrency networks that limit anonymity
under normal circumstances: transaction linkage.
Teleport occurs off the blockchain but is verified
using the blockchain, utilising the benefits of a
public record without suffering its drawbacks.
Teleport uses ‘telepods’ – packages of information
containing everything required to make a
transaction – to transfer funds securely and outside
of the blockchain to the intended recipient. The
recipient may or may not choose to remove the
funds from ‘hyperspace’ at this point, depending
on whether they trust the sender (in most cases,
they will not; however, the eventuality that trust
exists or that sender and recipient are the same
person must be considered).
Key to Teleport is that users are sending the
capability of making a transaction to their
recipient, not actually making a transaction to the

recipient.
Similar to the example of the pirate’s treasure map,
an illustration can be made by analogy with
Bitcoin paper wallets. These can be printed out and
mailed to another person, who sweeps the balance
into a new address that has never been used to stop
the first owner from spending it. They then print a
new paper wallet. The balance of an account may
change hands many hundreds of times in this way.
The only evidence on the blockchain is a series
of anonymous addresses, with just one incoming
and one outgoing transaction each, leading back
only to the first owner.
In the original Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi
Nakamoto anticipated the privacy issues that a
public and transparent blockchain would raise, and
suggested using a unique address for every
transaction as a solution:
‘As an additional firewall, a new key pair
should be used for each transaction to keep
them from being linked to a common owner.
Some linking is still unavoidable with multiinput transactions, which necessarily reveal that
their inputs were owned by the same owner.
The risk is that if the owner of a key is

revealed, linking could reveal other transactions
that belonged to the same owner.’
However, even if every user avoided compromise
through transaction linkage by following this as
best practice, transactions could still be traced
through other means, including Fingerprinting
and Mantissa correlations. Teleport dramatically
reduces exposure to all of these.

redemption time mitigates Fingerprinting

Before describing Teleport in more detail, it is
necessary to summarise the conditions and
infrastructure within which transactions of
telepods should occur, and what this enables.

Prerequisites for privacy
Captain Morgan recognises that although the
system of using maps to carry value rather than
handing over treasure itself is effective, the
participants could potentially be identified if they

were seen together or if a trail could later be
reconstructed from one to the other. Not wishing to
be compromised in any way, he adopts a complex
but highly effective strategy of disguising himself
as a barmaid, using backstreets rather than main
thoroughfares to get to the rendezvous point, and
only travelling at night.
The public record of the blockchain is the primary
threat to users’ anonymity under normal
circumstances. Clearly, if transaction information
is being sent off-blockchain, then communication
between users must be kept private if overall
anonymity is to be maintained. In the case of
BitcoinDark (BTCD), which uses the measures
described below, the necessary features are built
into the client to enable the full benefits of
Teleport. Teleport will also enable the
anonymisation of other cryptocurrencies, for a
minimal transaction fee.
The most basic privacy required by users is the
ability to keep their IP address from being
discovered. Any efforts to ensure the privacy of
cryptocurrency transactions can be rendered
useless by allowing third parties to trace this. For
example, if a private cryptocurrency payment is
sent to an online store but the user’s IP address is

visible, all payments received around that time are
probabilistically linked to that computer.
Information gleaned from the shipping address and
any other personal details submitted can quickly be
pieced together to discover the customer’s identity.
PrivacyServers
Captain Morgan refines his secret messaging plan
by enlisting the help of a community of like-minded
pirates to act as couriers for different sections of
the journey. Each one passes the message to the
next, until the final one gives it to the recipient and
records delivery to satisfy Captain Morgan’s
rigorous accounting procedures. To ensure that
none of the couriers is compromised, each one
only receives instructions on where the next
courier is located when he is given the message.
Couriers have no idea of the identity or movements
of previous or subsequent couriers in the chain.
The solution to the problem of information leakage
is the privacyServer. Any user can run their own
privacyServer simply by running a VPS, so there is
no need to trust any third party other than the VPS
provider.
The privacyServer is only able to see who a given
user is in contact with, since all communication

other than the initial setup and intentionally public
information is fully encrypted using Daniel
Bernstein’s Networking and Cryptography library
(NaCl). A session-based keypair is generated at the
beginning of every session, so even in the event of
any single key being compromised, exposure is
time-limited. Additionally, all communications are
time-stamped and tokenised to provide verification
that an account is not being spoofed.
Using onion routing, the encrypted packet sent to
the privacyServer only has the address of the
destination and the encrypted data. The
privacyServer sends the encrypted data to the
destination. (Currently this information leakage is
deemed to be minor; however, in order to address
this an additional onion layer will be added, so that
a random privacyServer will be chosen to be the
destination that the user’s privacyServer sees. Thus
even the user’s own privacyServer cannot glean
any useful information. This protects against
breaches at the level of the VPS provider.)
Graphic:
"xxx".() indicates the contents of () are only
decodable by "xxx". [] indicates a data packet

[user’s privacyServer.([jump privacyServer.
([actual destination.(encrypted data)]))]
Anyone monitoring internet traffic will only see
that a user has sent a packet to their privacyServer.
If the user’s privacyServer has been infiltrated, it
will be known that they are sending via the jump
privacyServer, which was chosen at random. This
randomly-selected jump privacyServer will have to
be compromised even to find out the final recipient
to whom the package was ultimately addressed. As
a rule, the encrypted data is also tokenised so that
the final recipient can be confident that whoever
sent the message at least had access to the sender’s
account password.
Broadcasting
Rather proud of his courier network, which he
knows will satisfy the vast majority of treasure
movers’ requirements, Captain Morgan
nevertheless wishes to develop a premium service
that offers still higher levels of privacy for his
corporate clients. Understanding that an
organisation with unlimited resources (such as the
East India Trading Company) could theoretically
infiltrate part of his network and learn some

information about his business dealings, he hits
upon a new idea. Instead of passing the map from
one courier to the next in person, he will arrange
to have each one simply display a version of the
message in a public place such as the market, for
anyone to see. So long as he can write it in a form
that only the intended courier will understand,
there will be no trail at all between any of them.
Indeed, if he is careful, no one else will even know
what they are looking at...
Once effective privacyServers exist, point-to-point
secure communication is possible. This is a
prerequisite for secure implementation of Teleport.
There are remote possibilities in which some path
information is obtainable, so for the most secure
communications, a broadcast path will be used.
This simply takes the form of:
[Graphic]
[broadcast.(encrypted data)]
In this instance, there is no stated destination
address. Although it may seem contradictory to
broadcast a message to the entire network to

maintain privacy, by sending it to everybody the
same amount of information is leaked as sending it
to nobody, since everybody is treated the same.
In addition to the destination address the public
key of the sender is also sent. This allows the
receiver to decode the encrypted packet. If this
public key is the same as the public key broadcast,
then it is the same as announcing who the
communication is from; therefore a second keypair
is used for these broadcasts. This can be a one-time
keypair in each instance. In order to be able to
encrypt the packet in the first place, the
destination’s public key needs to be known.
However, this public key can simply be broadcast
in plaintext.
The encrypted data is broadcast using this public
key. All of the nodes will try to decode all of the
broadcast packets, but only the intended recipient
will be able to decode it successfully: everyone
receives the packet but to everyone except the
intended receiver the contents are meaningless.
Multi-signature capability
One final refinement affords Captain Morgan
maximum peace of mind that his messages will not
be intercepted. Whereas previously he has sent

copies of the full map, albeit indirectly, he decides
to copy the map several times, cut it into pieces
and use his marketplace system to give them all to
members of his courier network. To complicate
matters further, a proportion of the couriers in the
chain are instructed to destroy their pieces of the
map rather than to pass them on. The final
recipient will slowly be able to piece together the
map from fragments delivered at random, but
anyone observing or any spy in the network will
never know the whole picture.
Additional security measures can be established
against an attacker that is able to log all the packets
between nodes and infiltrate some privacy servers.
To this aim, an ‘M of N’ approach to receiving a
packet is suggested.
At the point of transmitting a telepod, each one is
split into N pieces and sent to N random recipients,
with a random number M of these forwarding to
the final destination. This incorporates aspects of
another onion layer, but with M of N ability a
statistical retransmit will create additional
obstacles for correlation.
Image: 6-of-8 representation for reconstructing

data
For example, if M = 6 and N = 16 (that is, each
telepod is split into 16 pieces and 6 are required by
the recipient), and each receiving node has a 50
percent retransmit chance, then on average 8 parts
will get through, which is enough for the receiver
to reconstruct the message. In the event that not
enough pieces arrive, a confirmation packet is not
sent back to the original sender, who will then
retransmit. This return path can also be M-of-N
split sent to minimise the correlations that are
possible. The BitcoinDark implementation
explored below will allow values of M and N up to
254.
If a significant percentage of nodes are
participating in retransmission, then when a node
initiates a Teleport, doubt is necessarily created as
to whether it is a retransmit or the start of a
Teleport. (This requires the introduction of random
delays between receipt and rebroadcast.)
A separate use case for the M-of-N approach is to
be able to create distributed cold storage of
telepods. One part can be placed in encrypted
online storage, another on an offline medium such

as a USB drive. With a 2-of-3 approach, the final
part cannot be used without one of these other
pieces. One application would be for donations to
be split among a group of N people, M of whom
would need to produce their telepods for the funds
to become available.
(Note: the ‘multisignature’ capability used by
BitcoinDark is actually an implementation of
Shamir’s Secret Sharing, though this has the same
effect of requiring some or all parts of a packet of
information to be combined to reconstruct the
data.)
By selecting different levels of privacy, different
levels of onion routing and broadcasting can be
chosen. Maximum privacy is unnecessary for nonsensitive matters, especially since the more privacy
is required, the longer the transaction will take to
complete.

Overview of the BitcoinDark
implementation of Teleport
Once the infrastructure of a secure network
provided by the privacyServers is in place,
Teleport becomes possible. BitcoinDark uses an
implementation of the Teleport idea to enable

trustless private transactions.
Teleport transmits funds via telepods by
transporters. All the information needed to spend
funds is included in the telepod and sent via the
encrypted network to the destination. Note that this
is not the same as making a transaction itself: the
recipient can choose if and when to execute the
contents of the telepod. Only at this point is the
transaction made from the sender’s to the
recipient’s address – though in most cases this will
happen immediately to avoid double spending.
Each telepod uses a newly-created address for the
sole purposes of the teleport. Funds are sent from a
transporter account – the originator of any given
set of telepods, who will remain on public record –
to standard-denomination telepods, which execute
transactions of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 coins, and so on.
Image: Standard-denomination pods travelling to
new owner, being recombined, and sent on to new
ones
Off-blockchain transfers
Captain Ironhook has a treasure-transfer outfit. He

hides treasure in various locations and prepares
numerous maps, ready to give to customers, but
leaves them to age and yellow in his office. So long
as he does not need to spend the treasure himself,
there is no disadvantage to this approach. Quite
the opposite, since older maps are likely to raise
less suspicion than new ones, on which the ink is
still drying.
At this point, there is no activity on the blockchain.
The telepod is in ‘hyperspace’, outside of the
blockchain. The funds within it have not yet been
spent, and so they remain in the issuing
transporter’s account. If the recipient trusts the
sender to not double spend, these telepods can
simply remain in storage – the longer the better.
Under normal circumstances this will not be the
case. However, there may be conditions when this
occurs, either where there is a transaction between
trusted parties, or where the sender and recipient
are the same person.
The normal case will be that the recipient
immediately clones the telepods. This involves
executing the transaction held within them, so that
the sender cannot double spend, and creating a
new telepod using the funds released. After cloning
is completed, the recipient can credit the sender

with carrying out proper payment.
Because the address to which the telepod has been
sent has never been used before, and will never be
used again after the telepod has been passed on, it
is still considered to be in hyperspace. There is no
interaction with an address that can be linked to
other addresses through the blockchain, save for
the originating transporter account.
Image: complex web of addresses, with onedimensional clone line from telepod originator
No blockchain bloating occurs: there has just been
a single ordinary spend transaction. And, whilst the
blockchain records the fact that the telepod has
been cloned, there is no information available – on
or off the blockchain – about who carried out the
cloning. Save for the transporter account that
created the initial telepods, all telepods are clones
of prior telepods, with no transaction history of
their own outside of that line. The contents of a
telepod are identical to the one that existed before
it, with the same amount of funds being passed on
to the new clone. (Over time, transaction fees will
reduce the amounts in the telepods, but this can be

ignored for now.) The address of the first telepod is
known, though if this account itself was a fresh
account funded via semi-obsfucated sources such
as an exchange, then even the identity of the
original creator can be in doubt.
Example
Alice creates a new telepod (TP). She sends this
telepod to Bob, who immediately clones it (TP’)
and sends it to Catherine, who also clones it (TP’’).
On the blockchain, it is evident that the unspent
outputs for TP were used to create TP’, which was
then used to create TP’’. This only traces back to
Alice, since the addresses TP’ and TP’’ have never
been used before, and are only used once to clone
the next generation of telepod. So long as the
telepod is not spent in the normal way, in a
correlatable transaction, the only thing the
blockchain shows is that somebody – maybe even
Alice herself – cloned TP and TP’.
The telepods are cloned and passed around to
conduct commerce in private. Only the immediate
sender and recipient know about each other, and
even that can be prevented by using onion or
broadcast routing. This enables totally anonymous

donations, by means of a telepod sent via
broadcast using a one-time throwaway public key
and sending address.
Privacy gains
The East India Trading Company keeps a record of
every transaction it makes in its ledgers, protected
from unwanted readers by a sophisticated code.
Captain Pugwash uses a similarly complex code,
but instead of recording transactions between
people like the Company, he prefers to use his
system of maps and leave the question of creating
an identity for the new owner to decide. Even if his
code is broken at some point in the future, there
will be nothing to track that leads back to them,
unless they want it to.
Although mixing and ring signatures provide a
significant degree of anonymity, they are both
vulnerable to advances in computing that would
render them worthless. In the case of ring
signatures, there is doubt as to who is sending
coins due to R different signatures being possible.
With real-world usage of R=10, this gives results
of 10 percent → 1 percent → 0.1 percent for each
generation. However, all these transactions remain

on the blockchain, and so if at any point in the
future the encryption is cracked (which may be
possible with advances in quantum computing),
then a ring signature blockchain will become as
transparent as Bitcoin’s blockchain is now.
Let us assume that the attacker has somehow
detected that an account is using Teleport. With
proper use of privacyServers, this information
should be very difficult to determine, and so this is
an extreme scenario. Nevertheless, this case
assumes that a user is known to have cloned a
number of telepods during some specific period of
time.
There are two concealing factors here. One is the
total number of telepods cloned during this
interval. Whilst Teleport remains its infancy, this
number could well be smaller than 10, and thus
provides less privacy than ring signatures in this
respect. However, as the corresponding network
grows, ring signature solutions will suffer from
extreme blockchain bloat, and so the protection
offered is relatively fixed: a ring signature with 10
keys is viable, whereas one with 100 or 1,000 is
not. Conversely, though, as Teleport usage grows,
the privacy level automatically increases at the
same rate. 1,000 clones in the given interval means

a 1/1,000 chance of being identified correctly.
To receive a telepod, somebody must have sent it.
On the sender’s side, the situation is even more
favourable. The possible senders to be analysed are
all possible prior recipients from the time the
specific telepod was cloned. In order to gain more
privacy, telepods simply need to be stored for a
longer period of time. If the receive side is at 1/10
probability and a telepod is stored for 100 times
the reception window being used, the
correlatability of the sender is 1/(10 * 100).
Similar to the situation on the receiving side, the
more Teleports that occur, the greater the privacy –
all without any blockchain bloat.
In the case that the encryption for Teleporting is
broken by advances in quantum computing, there
is far better long-term protection than any system
that records everything on the blockchain. Since
the Teleporting is carried out off blockchain, there
is no permanent record to be analysed: what
happens in Teleporting, stays in Teleporting.
Funding transactions
Every time a map changes hands, the treasure must
be moved to a different location determined by the
new owner for safekeeping. The only way to

achieve this is by hiring a cart to carry it.
Therefore every time treasure is moved, it logically
follows that a cart must have been acquired for the
purpose. By following this line of inquiry with
local (and usually cooperative) cart providers, it
may well be possible to establish the identity of the
customer. Thus the necessity of carrying out a
small transaction threatens to compromise the
secrecy of the whole undertaking. Since providing
facilities to move treasure and create new maps in
secret is fundamental to the health of the pirate
economy, it is deemed prudent to make a set of
carts available for general use at no cost to the
users.
In the overview above, transaction fees were
ignored for the sake of simplicity. In a real-world
implementation, though, these fees significantly
complicate matters. Of course, each telepod could
pay the fees out of its own balance every time it
was cloned, the minor loss being the minimal price
that the new owner pays for privacy.
However, this would necessarily mean that the
telepods no longer had the same values, destroying
the advantages of creating standard-denomination
pods (resistance to Mantissa analysis). Information
would be leaked, which could lead to

compromised identity. This means each telepod
needs a small additional input to offset the
transaction fee and keep its value constant. Since
this transaction fee input must come from
somewhere, it risks contaminating the entire
telepod and leaving a trail back to the owner or
another party in the system.
Finding a clean source of change is critical. This
source is called a minipod. Minipods could be
created in several ways.
One approach is to simply wait for a (smalldenomination) telepod to arrive, and then use this
as the minipod. One small telepod can be kept in
hyperspace by the owner, and used to fund all
other telepods required for the foreseeable future
(since transaction fees are typically very small as
an overall proportion of the funds being
transferred).
Image: faucet payment and main account
combining for transaction to next owner
Arguably a better solution is to have a minipod
faucet that sends out pre-made and pre-aged
minipods on request, via the encrypted network.

Ideally, large numbers of minipods will be created
in the same block so they all look the same. Let us
assume that this mechanism is available. Now,
when the transaction fee is replaced when cloning
a telepod, it will link back to the original creator of
the telepod line, and to the faucet (which is itself a
telepod issuer).
Telepod volume
One-Eyed Willie keeps most of his treasure in cold
storage, safe behind a complex series of traps and
puzzles in his favourite cave. For satisfying the
needs of day-to-day trading, he requires a number
of maps ready to go. As well as ensuring a ready
supply of unit hoards (consisting of a single gold
coin) buried and ready to go, he maintains a
running total of larger-denomination chests and
maps. Once he has passed a map on, he always
destroys any old copies, just in case they fall into
the hands of the East India Trading Company or a
gang of enterprising pre-teens.
Since it makes sense to create as many telepods as
are needed but no more (due to the costs involved
in tying up funds), there needs to be a mechanism
for satisfying a given level of requests for Teleport
in the most efficient manner. Suppose that the

demand is for X coins, delivered in batches of
standard-denomination pods.
We can assume an uncontaminated minipod will
always be available from the faucet, since this is
cheap to arrange, so the problem reduces to finding
the best set of available telepods to fulfil the total
required. The older the clone date, the more
protection exists. However, a simple ‘first fit’
method will not work so well, as there is also the
issue of matching the total amount X with the right
denominations. However a simplified approach
provides a good starting point.
Take the first N telepods, such that the total value
of these N telepods >= X, but sum of N-1 < X. It is
good practice to prevent telepod sets that have not
aged enough from being used, and this can be
passed in as a parameter. Using this parameter (or
a default), we will also have a list of potential
replacement telepods that are a little younger than
the initial set, but still older than specified. Ideally,
the selected telepods would exactly match X with
the least number of telepods used, in order to
reduce the number of packets that need to be sent.
There may be a deterministic algorithm to solve
this perfectly, but with the expected number of
telepods and speed of the average CPU, this is a

simple problem for a genetic algorithm to find the
fittest set. Using a genetic approach also allows
flexibility in the criteria for the selection set.
Different users may have different requirements.
Assuming these requirements have been met, we
have the set of selected telepods that now need to
be sent to the recipient. In the event there is not an
exact match for X, issues arise regarding where to
send the change without resulting in
contamination. To sidestep this issue, in addition to
the minipod faucet that will patch transaction fees,
the system also requires a supply of telepods that
are of the lowest denomination supported by
Teleport. Since standard recommended
denominations include 1 and 5, no user will ever
require more than 4 of these unit pods. (It makes
sense for transporter accounts to store a larger
number based on likely estimations of demand,
since then more than one Teleport order can be
fulfilled without waiting for more telepods to age.)
There should therefore always be an exact match
between the order sum X and the total value of the
telepods. They can then be sent to the recipient, to
await confirmation of successful cloning. In order
to minimise timing attacks, the acceptance
procedure should be randomly spread out over a

set amount of time. Again, a user-specifiable
parameter with some reasonable minimum
requirement is a practical approach. The recipient
can also immediately acknowledge receipt of all
telepods without cloning, in the case that the
sender is trusted not to double spend. While this is
not realistic for arm’s-length transactions, for
transfers internal to a single organisation it avoids
needless cloning and the expenses and loss of
ageing that creates. If a user is creating telepods
for their own purposes and later use, again there is
no risk of lost funds.
Upon receipt of acceptance, the sender deletes the
telepods. This is a potential (edge case)
information leak if the sender prevents deletion,
but it can never raise the possibility that an
untrusted sender will double spend. It is also in the
interest of the sender to delete the telepods, as the
sender’s privacy is at risk (again, in extreme cases)
as long as these files remain on their system.
Receiving telepods
Roger the Cabin Boy has received his monthly pay
in the form of a set of standard-denomination
treasure maps, delivered over the course of the last
week by the pirates’ courier network. Broadly

trusting his employer, Captain Pugwash, he has a
choice about when to move the treasure and copy
the maps, and does not have to do this all at once.
He decides to wait until Saturday to recover some
of the treasure, since many other people will have
just been paid and will be engaged in digging. The
more people are active at any one time, the less his
own activities will raise the suspicions of the East
India Tea Company.
The final part of the telepod transaction process is
reception. As the telepods arrive, they are
processed according to the stated trust level and
user parameters. In the case of a trusted sender, the
telepods are verified to contain proper unspent
outputs on the blockchain and acceptance is given.
(A higher-level packet that describes the entire set
can be used to identify any packets lost in transit
and to make the accounting simpler, though this is
not required for the proof-of-concept to work.)
In the expected event of an arm’s-length sender,
the recipient should immediately clone each
telepod, thus preventing double spend by the
sender. Of course, in the event the sender does
double spend, then the recipient simply rejects the
payment, or pro-rates the amount double spent.
Thus a double spend is an inconvenience but poses

no threat of fraud.
The cloning process involves taking the unspent
amount in the telepod, adding the transaction fee
equivalent from the minipod, and sending the
funds to a newly-generated telepod address. After
the cloning process is completed, the telepods
begin aging and can become part of outbound
teleports when a satisfactory age threshold is
reached.
The issue arises of when to clone each telepod
received in the set. To simplify the processing
logic, it is recommended to await the arrival of all
telepods, as specified in the summary packet. This
allows a retransmission process to complete before
proceeding to the cloning stage. The problem with
cloning all the telepods at the same time is that this
results in a much easier target to correlate,
especially if the total amount is substantial. In
addition to a general minimum time to wait before
cloning takes place, there need to be provisions for
processing larger amounts. Ideally, the total
amount being processed by the entire network
would be used to determine the recommended
duration of the cloning process. Instead of
specifying an arbitrary time limit, a privacy level
can be chosen such that all telepods are part of a

large enough global set. The reception side is far
more critical than the sending side, due to the
significantly smaller timeframe over which this
needs to occur. This may result in delays early on
in the implementation of Teleport.
As the overall Teleport activity increases, these
undesirable delays will be dramatically reduced, or
even eliminated totally: Teleport works better and
faster the more overall activity there is.
Leaving hyperspace
Roger the Cabin Boy has won a number of maps in
a game of chance. The problem arises that
although the maps have changed hands
anonymously dozens of times in that form, when he
actually needs to spend the treasure in the chests
he risks creating a link that could be followed back
to him. The simple answer is that all of the maps
were originally created by the legendary pirate,
Jack Sparrow, and can be traced back to him.
(Since Jack knew this all along, this is of no
consequence to him.) So Roger can return the
maps to Jack Sparrow in return for regular
payment in whatever currency he prefers, and
there will never be any evidence that Roger has
dealt in the maps at all.

This system describes the creation and continued
use of telepods within hyperspace, or within a set
of transactions that have no further relationship
with the blockchain and addresses that can be
identified by their associations – either other
addresses to which they are linked, or other
information available through external means.
For some privacy-oriented activities, the telepods
will continue circulating in hyperspace and will
never have to rejoin the main (monitored)
blockchain. This would provide the optimum
circumstances for using Teleport.
There will naturally be cases where users want to
cash out telepods so that they can spend the funds
within them, outside the Teleport ecosystem. This
represents a significant vulnerability. Just as the
original creation of a telepod is traceable to the
address that first created it, so the address to which
the telepod is cashed out for general use will also
be visible.
Fortunately, there are effective ways to circumvent
this problem. Some users will be content to move
funds directly into their day-to-day accounts,
especially if the transactions are obfuscated by
other means (use of mixers, for example, is not

precluded by Teleport). However, for the highest
levels of privacy, the following methods are
recommended:
Anonymous bank card. Through a partnership
with cryptocurrency payment processor Coinomat,
BTCD balances can be withdrawn to a bank card.
When funds are sent to the linked deposit address,
they appear on the card’s cash balance. This can
then be used for online purchases and even ATM
withdrawals. If the cards are delivered by mail
then there is a potential risk; the ideal solution to
this is purchase for cash. This telepod → fiat exit
path offers a total anonymous ecosystem for
cryptocurrencies.
Blockchain withdrawals via the originating
account. In many cases, owners will want to
‘withdraw’ the contents of their telepods to the
blockchain, in order to use the funds as normal –
purchasing goods online directly with the
cryptocurrency, converting to other currencies via
exchanges, and so on. Since this represents a
second point of vulnerability (the first being the
original telepod creator), it makes sense to
combine the two. Thus anyone wishing to cash out
their telepods may do so via the original issuer. To
the outside observer, the line of transactions simply

follows a loop from the originator back to the
originator, via an unspecified number of clone
addresses:

Conclusion
Captain Kidd has devised a cipher with which to
record the location of his treasure. Whilst adequate
for the limited threat posed by his own circle of
acquaintances, after the treacherous business with
William Legrand he decides that extra precautions

would be wise. Kidd uses his cipher to encode the
location of his replacement treasure chest, and
then buries these instructions in a second location,
marked on a treasure map in the established
fashion – thereby cumulatively gaining the benefits
of both forms of secrecy.
Teleport offers robust anonymity for
cryptocurrency users – initially BitcoinDark users,
though the protocol will allow other
cryptocurrencies to be anonymised through the
BTCD system for only minimal transaction fees.
Teleport’s exceptional level of privacy is achieved
not by mathematically superior encryption or more
sophisticated mixing processes, but by enabling
transaction information to be sent outside of the
blockchain within a complete ecosystem designed
for privacy from the ground up.
It is anticipated that BitcoinDark will naturally
compete with other cryptocurrencies offering
anonymity features, including Darkcoin and
Monero, which use variations of mixing and ring
signatures respectively. Whilst no solution can ever
be perfect, the addition of a wholly different
approach to the current cryptocurrency landscape
must be welcomed. The CryptoNote white paper
points out that the currency is not considered a full

replacement for Bitcoin, but that there are
advantages to having competing currencies: these
are the circumstances under which innovation and
improvement occur.
Bitcoin’s immense network effect means that there
is little chance in the medium term of another
cryptocurrency unseating it. As the established
digital currency for internet commerce, it makes no
sense for users to switch to another form of
cryptocurrency without good reason – though for
private transactions they may choose another
currency. Nevertheless, Teleport’s versatility as a
complete system rather than as an cryptocurrencyspecific algorithm mean that in those
circumstances where privacy is required by Bitcoin
or another ‘transparent’ cryptocurrency, this
eventuality is also covered by using BTCD
through a third-party service.
There is also nothing to stop existing privacyoriented cryptocurrencies from adding Teleport to
their approach, either before or after native
measures are taken. This layered use of anonymity
protocols will provide exceptionally strong privacy
for the most sensitive applications.
