OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Scope of the ICOBox Project
ICOBox is a unique product which allows to drastically lower the cost of conducting ICOs
through automating and introducing templates and models in all three essential ICO components:
•

Technology solution

•

Legal solution

•

Marketing solution

ICOBox aims to stabilize the ICO market through mass ICO campaign production which
will facilitate its decentralization and diversification.
ICOBox occupies a unique market niche because it is the first company positioned on both
sides of the market – that of a party conducting ICOs, since ICOBox offers professional ICO
solutions, and a token holder, because the company also buys tokens of other ICOs.
Although the ICOBox solution lowers the costs of conducting ICOs, it also allows to conduct them at a high professional level. Nobody knows the product better than the team
which developed it. Engaging full-time external ICO experts requires significant time investment to let them learn the product, and, consequently, a significant expense. The services offered by such agencies are quite expensive, and because of their duration there is
a months-long waiting list for conducting ICOs.
ICO could be conducted by the project team, but developing a book building platform
from scratch, writing a smart contract, developing the legal concept, amassing the information on marketing channels and resources will take the project team, which is usually
not well-versed in these areas, a very long time.
ICOBox is an SaaS (software as a service) product in which all standard ICO elements
are automated and simplified, and although the project team is directly involved in the
launching of the offering, the entire ICO process is directed by experts in each of the respective ICO component fields. Such format produces the shortest project launch time
and the lowest cost, and the customers no longer need to wait for an external agency to
take on their project.

ICOS Concept
Many projects seeking to conduct an ICO are promising but underfunded. For them, paying even the low price tag of 50 BTC is a struggle. These companies would benefit from the
ICOBox’s launch of its ICOS token.
The essence of the project is to raise funds by selling ICOS tokens. All net proceeds from
the ICOS token offering will be directed to cover the cost of ICOBox services to help promising projects selected by the vote of ICOS token holders to conduct their ICOs (see Section
“Project Selection Mechanism” for details). Funds to cover the cost of ICOBox services are
allocated based on the standard pricing of ICOBox services (see Section “Scope of the ICOBox Project”). The project seeking to receive ICOBox’s services via this arrangement can
apply to receive any one, two or all three ICOBox’s solutions.
To ensure the spending transparency, ICOBox will open to all ICOS token holders real-time
access to ICO statistics about the number of ICOs completed, the number of ICOs in progress (with a projected timeline), and the amount of funds spent.
Each project which will conduct its ICO using ICOBox tools paid for with the funds raised
through the ICOS token sale will give a set number of its tokens to ICOS platform, where
ICOS token holders will be able to exchange their ICOS tokens for the tokens of new ICO
projects of their choice. The number of tokens a project will have to allocate to ICOS token
holders depends on the range of ICOBox services required for conducting its ICO.

Essentially, the number of tokens the new ICO projects will place on ICOBox’s platform
will have to be equal in value to 4.8 times the price of ICOBox’ services rendered.
The number of tokens is calculated at the rate of exchange in effect at the start of presale
of the relevant ICO.

TOKEN HOLDERS’ GOALS WHICH ICOS HELPS ACCOMPLISH:
•

Purchase of quality ICO project tokens, ensured by a 2-step process: screening by ICOBox’s experts and selection by the vote of ICOS token holders;

•

Purchase of tokens with a unique discount and an opportunity to have a say in the
project before it launches its ICO;

•

Purchase of tokens at any stage: presale, book building, and even after the end of its
ICO provided the tokens are still available on the ICOS platform; the tokens exchange
rate remains unchanged regardless of the token’s market value. Even if the project’s
token sale ended, the exchange of ICOS tokens to new ICO project’s tokens occurs at
the rate effective on the first date of sales of new ICO project’s tokens.

The goals of the ICO project which ICOS helps accomplish:
•

Holding an ICO with the guidance of ICOBox’s experienced team without a prepayment
(payment only with future tokens);

•

Minimization of costs at all stages prior to the end of an ICO;

•

An opportunity to receive recommendations directly from the future token holders
(see Section “Project Selection Mechanism” for details).

10

ICOS Token
EACH TOKEN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING RIGHTS TO ITS HOLDER:

1. Right to vote.
Each token grants its holder one vote which may be used at token holder’s discretion to
select new projects for ICOs (see Section “Project Selection Mechanism” details). The more
tokens one has the more votes one can cast. Only whole ICOS tokens grant votes - if a token holder owns a fraction of ICOS token, such fractional ICOS token does not grant any
voting rights. A token holder may award all his votes to one project or spread them among
several projects.

2. Right to comment.
Each token holder is entitled to comment on projects which applied for an ICO through
ICOS platform. All token holders may comment on any number of projects regardless of
the number of their tokens and the projects they chose to vote for.

3. Right to exchange their ICOS tokens for new ICO projects’ tokens.
When a new project launches its presale, a set amount of its tokens is placed on ICOS
platform where ICOS token holders may exchange their ICOS tokens for such new ICO
project’s tokens1 . The more ICOS tokens their holders exchange the less ICOS tokens and
votes they retain. The exchange rate is fixed at the end of ICOS sale and does not vary
from project to project or from day to day of any ongoing new ICO (see Section “Mechanism for exchanging ICOS tokens for new ICO projects’ tokens” for details).
To be used for voting, commenting, or exchange, ICOS tokens must remain in the token
holder’s account at ICOS platform 2.

1 See Section “ICOS Concept” for details.
2 Most ICOS tokens in the token holders’ accounts at ICOS platform are physically stored in Ethereum cold storage, for
security reasons, with a small number of tokens in hot storage, for quick access.

11

ICOS platform
ICOS platform will be launched on icos.icobox.io website and will start gathering new projects’ applications for ICOs before the end of ICOBox’s sale of ICOS tokens1 . After the
completion of book building the following functional interfaces will be activated in token
holders’ accounts:
•

Voting (selection of projects for conducting an ICO paid for with the funds raised
through the ICO of ICOS tokens);

•

Exchange (the list of all completed ICOs specifying the number of tokens placed on the
ICOS platform which are available for exchange);

•

Dashboard listing all token holder’s tokens and offering the options of viewing statistics, sending and receiving tokens.

1 See Section “Projected Timeline” for details.

12

Project Selection Mechanism
All ICO applications received by ICOBox from the projects which are unable to pay for the
ICOBox services will be screened by ICOBox experts to determine if they meet the following criteria:
•

Compliance with the application format;

•

Economic viability;

•

Unique offer;

•

Team (visionary, team members’ competence and potential).

All screened applications that met the above criteria will be posted on ICOS platform,
where ICOS token holders will weekly vote for the best projects which should be awarded
the funding to pay for ICOBox services to conduct their own ICOs.
Each ICOS token holder owns the number of votes equal to the number of ICOS tokens he
owns. Based on the voting results, the following number of projects which received the
most votes will be selected:
•

Q4 2017: 10 projects per week

•

Q1 2018: 15 projects per week

•

Q2 2018 and so on: 20 projects per week

Overall, a total of about 800 ICOs is intended to be conducted in the first year of ICOBox’s
existence (to compare, Kickstarter.com conducted over 120,000 successful campaigns in
8 years; the platform currently has an average of 4,500 ongoing campaigns.
More details at https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats?ref=footer).
The number of projects presented for screening and selection is determined by the number of received applications and the ICOBox’s capacity. If ICOBox’s capacity grows faster
than expected, the weekly number of selected projects may also be increased. The voting
is held as long as the funds raised through the ICOS ICO are available.
Any ICOS token holder, regardless of whether he participates in the voting, may comment
on ICO applications on the ICOS website. This way, project teams can receive feedback
from their potential token holders and modify their projects accordingly. If the project
failed to be selected through the ICOS token holder community’s vote it can revise the
project to reflect the received recommendations and apply again.

Mechanism for exchanging ICOS tokens
for new ICO projects’ tokens
Exchange value of each ICOS token is 0.04 BTC, which means that every ICOS token can be
exchanged for the relevant number of the new projects’ tokens placed on ICOS platform
and worth 0.04 BTC at presale prices.
At their standard price of 0.01 BTC, ICOS tokens are exchangeable for other projects’ tokens at an average rate of 1:4 in value. Essentially, this means that on average ICOS token
holders get new projects’ tokens at a 75% discount.
Consequently, the purchasing power of funds spent on the ICOS token relative to the new
projects’ tokens varies slightly depending on the price at which each token holder bought
his or her ICOS tokens. The individual purchasing power for funds spent on each ICOS token can be calculated at the end of ICOS token sale using the following formula:

See examples below:

77%

In our first example an ICOS token holder John exchanged his ICOS tokens bought for 1
BTC for the tokens of new projects worth 4.2 BTC, thereby obtaining tokens worth 4.2
times that of the funds he originally spent to buy ICOS tokens. For Jane this coefficient is
3.8. Essentially it means that John bought the tokens of new ICO projects with a discount
of 76%, and Jane got a discount of 74%.
In our second example the purchasing power of John and Jane’s funds spent on their ICOS
tokens is 4 and 4.4, respectively. The discount for new ICOs’ tokens was 75% for John and
77% for Jane.
Therefore, the higher the average price paid for ICOS token at ICOS token sale by all buyers and the lower the price paid for ICOS token by a specific buyer, the higher the purchasing power of funds spent on ICOS tokens and the higher the discount for new ICO projects’
tokens this buyer receives.
Each ICOS token may be exchanged for the relevant number of tokens of one project or
an assortment of tokens of several projects.
About 50-100 applications are expected to be presented for the token holders’ review
and voting per week. If less than 50 applications have been presented, the voting may be
postponed until the following week. If more than 100 applications have been presented,
the surplus applications are carried over to the following week.
New project’s tokens are placed on ICOS platform at the start of the project’s token presale. ICOS tokens can be exchanged for any of the presented new ICO project’s tokens at
any time, but during the first 24 hours of their placement on ICOS platform the tokens are
distributed/exchanged among all interested ICOS tokens holders only in proportion to a
number of tokens they requested to exchange.
If within the first 24 hours more than 240 BTC worth of exchange requests are received,
the requests will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. If this amount is not reached, the requests
will be met in their desired amount. The remainder of the tokens left after the distribution
over the first 24 hours will be distributed based on a free market principle. If there are
more exchange requests received than could be reasonably divided – for instance, a token
priced at 1 BTC cannot be divided, but more than 240 exchange requests were received, –
the tokens will be distributed in the order the requests were received.
17

Conclusion of ICOS program.
Termination of ICOS platform operations
Due to the limited number of ICOS tokens to be issued, and based on the established
mechanism of the ICOS platform operations, over time it is possible that the majority of
ICOS tokens purchased during the ICO will be exchanged for tokens of other projects or
burned.
It is also possible that at some point in time the number of projects interested in conducting their ICOs may drop for various reasons, such as market oversaturation, regulatory
changes, etc.
In such cases, if and when the number of ICOS tokens burned reaches 300,000 (which
equals 50% of all issued ICOS tokens) or more, ICOS program reserves the right to notify
ICOS token holders of the completion of ICOS program and offer them the last opportunity to exchange ICOS tokens for the remaining tokens of other projects available on ICOS
platform. ICOS token holders will be notified of the specific timeframe within which they
will be able to exchange their ICOS tokens.
After the expiration of the established exchange period, the storage of ICOS tokens or tokens of other projects on ICOS platform will be subject to a monthly fee as defined below.
The monthly fee will be charged to the ICOS platform users’ accounts on the 1st day of
every month for the preceding month and will be deducted in ICOS tokens or tokens of
other projects stored in the users’ accounts at the rate at which tokens of other projects
were exchanged for ICOS tokens.
The monthly fee for the 1st month after the end of the exchange period shall be equal to
0.1 ICOS or its equivalent in tokens of other projects stored in the users’ accounts at the
rate at which tokens of these other projects’ tokens were originally exchanged for ICOS tokens. The monthly fee may be collected in one or several kinds of tokens, at a random rate
chosen by the system automatically. The monthly fee for the 2nd and subsequent months
shall be equal to 100 ICOS or its equivalent in tokens of other projects stored in the users’
accounts at the rate at which tokens of other projects were originally exchanged for ICOS
tokens, with the combination of tokens collected determined by the system at random.
If the amount of ICOS tokens or tokens of other projects in a user’s account is less than the
monthly fee amount, the remaining balance will be deducted as a fee for the preceding
month and the user will cease to have access to the platform.
Effective March 1, 2019, ICOS platform users will be strongly recommended to visit the
platform monthly to read any important updates which may be posted on the website.

18

Summary
This arrangement allows prospective ICO projects to conduct their own ICO paying with
their future tokens, and do it at high quality and efficiency (starting at 2 weeks from the
date of application to the date of PR campaign start, due to standardization and automation of processes). ICOS token holders can receive tokens of quality projects they selected
at an average discount of 75%. The market gets hundreds of great projects screened by
the ICOBox experts, selected by ICOS token holders and implemented by the new ICO
projects using ICOBox’s tools and guidance.

19

ICOS SMART CONTRACT
ICOS is an Ethereum token. It complies with and extends ERC-20 - a de facto standard and
widely used token API. ICOS Smart Contract guarantees:
1. Transparency
1.1. Balance. The information on the number of tokens held by any user is public.
1.2. Transfers. All information on transfers is public and can be traced back in time.
2. Ownership
2.1. Scope. Only Ethereum users and contracts can be token holders.
2.2. Uniqueness. Each token belongs to one user-owner. There are no shared tokens.
2.3. Right to transfer. A token can be transferred to another user only by the direct
command of its owner or by the command of the receiver directly authorized by
the owner. No token transfer may be initiated by another user.
3. Token Supply
3.1. Single issuance. Tokens are issued only once, at the time of deployment.
3.2. Supply. The token supply is set at the time of deployment.
3.3. Destruction. Every user can destroy (burn) some or all of his tokens, which are
then deducted from the total supply.
4. Contract Management
4.1. Replacement. The contract owner can relinquish the ownership in favor of any
other Ethereum user or contract.
4.2. Blockade. The contract owner can stop or resume token transfers between token holders at any time.
5. Miscellaneous
5.1. Recovery. Any call to the contract which results in an error does not change the
users’ tokens or Ether balance, except for the gas spent on the transaction.
5.2. Safe Approval. The token contract supports two approve() functions: a 2-parameter approve() (the ERC-20 standard) and a 3-parameter approve (), which
guarantees that spender gets new allowance only if current allowance equals
presumed allowance. It is recommended to use the 3-parameter approve for all
approve() calls taking the presumed allowance as the second input.

20

UNCERTAINTY PROVISIONS
The ICOS Smart Contract does not guarantee the following:
1. User validity. Details: an Ethereum address with positive token balance may not correspond to any actual user or a private key, as it can be a result of a mistake. Tokens
transferred to such users will likely be lost.
2. Zero Ether balance. Details: the contract prohibits most, but not all means by which
Ether could be sent to it by users who are not contract owners.
3. Complete registry. Details: The contract does not provide a list of all token holders.
However, it is guaranteed that every token holder is either the contract creator or a
token recipient in the Transfer() event. The list of token holders can be obtained by
checking all these events or by exploring the contract storage using blockchain explorers.

21

Tokens can be purchased with BTC, ETH, LTC, Dash, Zcash, ETC, or USD (wire transfer) at
tokensale.icobox.io. Transfers can be made from any BTC, ETH, LTC, Dash, Zcash or ETC
wallet1. For transfers of 1,000 USD and over, a wire transfer option is available.
Token buyers must register at tokensale.icobox.io, entering and confirming their email address. After the registration, users gain access to their personal accounts at tokensale.icobox.io where they will have separate wallets for BTC, ETH, LTC, Dash, Zcash, ETC, or USD.
In their accounts users can choose the desired number of ICOS tokens and transfer the
required payment amount in one of the accepted cryptocurrencies or generate an invoice
for a wire transfer.
Once the payment is received, funds will appear in the corresponding wallet in the user’s
account and may be used for purchasing ICOS tokens. Until the token purchase is made, the
funds may be withdrawn from the account at tokensale.icobox.io at any moment by sending a request to support@icobox.io. Tokens are purchased at the price in effect at the time
of purchasing, not at the price in effect at the time when funds have been sent or received
by the platform. When buying tokens with currency other than BTC, the exchange rate is
fixed at the time of token purchase.
Accounts at tokensale.icobox.io will be accessible several days before the start of the ICOS
token sale. Users will be able to sign up and make transfers to their ICOS accounts, but will
not have the option to buy ICOS tokens with deposited funds until the start of the ICOS
token presale.To take part in the public presale, a buyer will need to purchase at least the
specified minimum number of ICOS tokens (10,000 or 1,000 ICOS tokens, depending on the
date and time of purchase). The general ICOS token sale has no minimum entrance threshold, except for the minimum transfer amount specified by the relevant blockchain or bank
used by the buyer.
After the token purchase is complete, the information about ICOS tokens credited to the
ICOS buyers should appear in their accounts at tokensale.icobox.io immediately.
After the ICOS token sale is over, a personal account will be automatically generated at
icos.icobox.io for every ICOS token holder. ICOS tokens will be issued and transferred to
these accounts. Once this step is complete, ICOS token holders may at any time transfer
their ICOS tokens to any third-party ETH wallet supporting ERC-20 standard. However, ICOS
tokens must remain in their accounts at icos.icobox.io if ICOS token holders wish to participate in voting, comment on projects, or exchange them to new ICO projects’ tokens.
All proceeds from the ICOBox’s ICOS token sale will be deposited in escrow where they will
be kept in BTC. Original payments made in other currencies will be converted to BTC and
also deposited in escrow.

1 ICOBox does not charge any processing fees. Processing time and fees are determined by the payment processor.
Token holders are responsible for paying all processing fees and financial charges imposed by the payment processor in
connection with the payment, including withdrawals from the account at tokensale.icobox.io.

23

The funds will be released from escrow to ICOBox in step with the fulfillment of ICOBox’
obligations to ICOS token holders in the following order:
•

50% of the amount for each new ICO project to be released at the time when the project is chosen by token holders’ vote; and

•

50% of the amount to be released at the time when tokens of the new ICO project are
placed on ICOS platform 2.

Once ICOS token sale ends, no further deposits to the accounts at tokensale.icobox.io will
be permitted. Decisions on how to handle the funds received after the end of the ICOS token sale will be made based on the transfer date and time. Only transfers sent out before
the end of the ICOS token sale will be accepted; the rest will be returned to sender in the
original form of payment minus transfer fees and bank charges. Accepted funds and all
other funds remaining in users’ personal accounts at tokensale.icobox.io will be converted
to ICOS tokens automatically at the purchase price in effect at the end of the ICOS token
sale. For funds in currencies other than BTC, the exchange rate will be fixed at the time of
conversion. Users who wish to withdraw their funds from their accounts must contact the
support team at support@icobox.io no later than 12:00 PM PDT on September 15, 2017 to
avoid automatic conversion. At 12:00 PM PDT on September 22, 2017, ICOS tokens will be
issued to participants and deposited in their accounts on icos.icobox.io. If a payment is received after 12:00 PM PDT on September 21, 2017, such payment will be returned to sender
minus transfer fees and bank charges even if it was sent before the end of ICOS token sale.
For every 100 ICOS tokens sold through the ICOBox’s ICO 20 additional tokens will be issued
for distribution to partners, advisors, bounty participants, and the team members. Since
ICOBox team gets an incentive in the form of ICOS tokens, a standard bonus in the form of
discount for a set number of new projects’ tokens is not required.

2 If a selected project fails to complete its ICO, and its tokens are not placed on the ICOS platform, ICOBox will retain the
50% prepayment but will forfeit the remaining 50% of the payment. If a selected project revises its plans and cancels its
ICO after ICOBox received the prepayment but before it commenced its work, ICOBox will send back the prepayment
amount to the escrow. If a selected project fails to complete its ICO after its tokens have been placed on the ICOS platform,
ICOBox will retain the full payment; and ICOS tokens exchanged by their holders for the respective cancelled new project’s
tokens will revert to their holders.

PROJECTED TIMELINE
•

April: start of the ICOBox project development

•

July 1, 2017: ICOBox project launch;

•

August 9, 2017: public ICOS presale start;

•

August 15, 2017 – September 15, 20017: general sale of ICOS tokens;

•

August 15, 2017: collection of applications start

•

September 1, 2017: ICO application platform launch

•

September 22, 2017: ICOS token issue

•

October 2, 2017: first voting, selection of 10 projects for new ICOs

The project end date depends on the amount of funds raised through the ICO of ICOS tokens. All net proceeds from the sale of ICOS tokens will go towards providing the ICOBox
tools to promising crowdselling projects chosen by ICOS token holders by voting. This arrangement will continue while the funds raised through ICOS sale last.
If the remaining funds cannot be divided by the ICOBox’s exchange rates, ICObox’s services
for the last ICO project will be provided at a discounted price. For example, if the amount of
remaining funds is 45 BTC, the last ICO project will receive a full package of ICOBox’ services
at a discount of 5 BTC. Even if the amount of the remaining funds is minimal, ICOS token
holders may still vote to choose a project which needs a full ICOBox services package. For
example, if the amount of remaining funds is 1 BTC, ICOS token holders may still choose an
ICO project which needs 1, 2 or all 3 solutions offered by ICOBox.
Consequently, there is no minimum amount of funds to be raised: if the amount of funds
raised is less than the cost of the full ICOBox service package (50 BTC) or less than even one
separate ICOBox solution (25 BTC) for one ICO project, the funds will be allocated based on
the “last ICO” principle.

PROJECTED TIMELINE
The purchase of tokens involves a high degree of risk, including but not limited to the risks
described below. Before acquiring ICOS tokens, it is recommended that each participant
carefully weighs all the information and risks detailed in this White Paper, and, specifically,
the following risk factors.
A. Dependence on computer infrastructure
ICOBox’s dependence on functioning software applications, computer hardware and the Internet implies that ICOBox can offer no assurances that a system failure would not adversely affect the use of the sale participants’ ICOS tokens. Despite ICOBox’s implementation of
all reasonable network security measures, its processing center servers are vulnerable to
computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other disruptions of a similar nature.
Computer viruses, break-ins or other disruptions caused by third parties may result in interruption, delay or suspension of services, which would limit the use of the ICOS tokens.
B. Smart contract limitations
Smart contract technology is still in its early stages of development, and its application is of
experimental nature. This may carry significant operational, technological, regulatory, reputational and financial risks. Consequently, although the audit conducted by independent
third party increases the level of security, reliability, and accuracy, this audit cannot serve
as any form of warranty, including any expressed or implied warranty that the ICOS Smart
Contract is fit for purpose or that it contains no flaws, vulnerabilities or issues which could
cause technical problems or the complete loss of ICOS tokens.
C. Regulatory risks
Blockchain technology, including but not limited to the issue of tokens, may be a new concept in some jurisdictions, which may then apply existing laws or introduce new regulations
regarding Blockchain technology-based applications, and such regulations may conflict with
the current ICOS smart contract setup and ICOS token concept. This may result in the need
to make substantial modifications to the ICOS smart contract, including but not limited to
its termination, the loss of ICOS tokens, and the suspension or termination of all ICOS token
functions.
D. Taxes
ICOS token holders may be required to pay taxes associated with the transactions contemplated herein, whether in the United States or in their home countries. It will be a sole responsibility of ICOS token holders to comply with the tax laws of the United States and other
jurisdictions applicable to them and pay all relevant taxes.
E. Force Majeure
ICOBox’s performance may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to force majeure circumstances. For the purposes of this White Paper, force majeure shall mean extraordinary
events and circumstances which could not be prevented by ICOBox and shall include: acts

26

of nature, wars, armed conflicts, mass civil disorders, industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts,
slowdowns, prolonged shortage or other failures of energy supplies or communication service, acts of municipal, state or federal governmental agencies, other circumstances beyond
ICOBox’s control, which were not in existence at the time of White Paper release. If such
circumstances occur prior to the issue of ICOS tokens and ICOBox is unable to issue ICOS
tokens within one month from the projected date, the escrow agent may issue a refund at
the request of the ICOS token purchasers. The refund will be issued in the original amount
and form of payment to the same digital wallet or bank account where the funds were
transferred from.
F. Disclosure of information
Personal information received from ICOS token holders, the information about the number
of tokens owned, the wallet addresses used, and any other relevant information may be
disclosed to law enforcement, government officials, and other third parties when ICOBox is
required to disclose such information by law, subpoena, or court order. ICOBox shall at no
time be held responsible for such information disclosure.
G. Value of ICOS token
Once purchased, the value of ICOS token may significantly fluctuate due to various reasons.
ICOBox does not guarantee any specific value of the ICOS token over any specific period of
time. ICOBox shall not be held responsible for any change in the value of ICOS token.
H. Number of submissions by ICO projects
ICOBox does not guarantee any number of ICO projects’ applications submitted through its
platform and/or available for voting. ICOBox has control over neither the number of projects
applying for an ICO nor over their quality. The expected number of submissions is based
on the number of inquiries received by ICOBox to date and ICOBox’s market forecasts. The
number of submissions and the number of projects presented for voting may vary and may
not reach the expected volume, which may ultimately affect the expected length of the project and the ICOS token holders’ ability to exchange their tokens for the new ICO projects’
tokens at the anticipated rate and discount.
I. Number of new ICO projects’ tokens available for exchange
The number of new ICO projects’ tokens available for exchange for ICOS tokens may vary
due to multiple factors such as the amount of funds received by ICOBox through the sale of
its ICOS tokens, the total number of ICOS tokens sold, market conditions, legal regulations,
and other risks. ICOBox does not guarantee any specific number of new projects’ tokens
available for exchange for an ICOS token at any given time.
J. Incomplete ICO
ICOBox offers only technology, marketing, and legal tools to projects seeking to conduct
their own ICOs. ICOBox has no control over the actions of the projects’ teams. ICOBox will
provide its tools to any project selected by the ICOS token holders. However, ICOBox shall
not be responsible for the completion or success of any ICO if such failure resulted from
the actions of the projects’ teams or third parties. Existence of projects which received paid
services but failed to issue its tokens may negatively impact ICOS token exchange rate.

27

K. Bitcoin volatility
ICOBox’s services are priced in bitcoins. However, certain services included in ICOBox service package are paid for by ICOBox in USD (for instance, marketing traffic). The bitcoin exchange rate volatility may impact the company’s ability to provide services at the indicated
prices.
Assumptions with respect to the foregoing involve, among other things, judgments about
the future economic, competitive and market conditions and business decisions, most of
which are beyond the control of the ICOBox team and therefore difficult or impossible to
accurately predict. Although the ICOBox team believes that its assumptions underlying its
forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of these may prove to be inaccurate. As a
result, the ICOBox team can offer no assurances that the forward-looking statements contained in this White Paper will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties
inherent in the forward-looking statements contained herein, the inclusion of such information may not be interpreted as a warranty on the part of ICOBox or any other entity that the
objectives and plans of the ICOBox project will be successfully achieved.
Please note that the ICOBox project may be subject to other risks not foreseen by its team
at this time.
