AidCoin Whitepaper
v. 04

AidCoin is the ERC20 token that aims to become the preferred method to donate
transparently through the Ethereum blockchain and to access the ecosystem of
services provided by the AIDChain platform. The adoption of cryptocurrencies will
impact the way we donate in the future and AidCoin is poised to play a leading
role in this new era of fundraising.
AIDChain is a platform that provides an ecosystem of services through an easy-touse interface, connecting the non-profit community while allowing full transparency and traceability of donations. AIDChain’s services include an internal exchange to convert major cryptocurrencies into AidCoin, a built-in wallet to store
and donate easily, an explorer to track donations transparently, tools to connect
donors with all the actors involved in the non-profit sector and templates of smart
contracts to run fundraising campaigns.
Additionally, AIDPay is a payment gateway/embeddable widget that allows charities registered on the AidChain platform to accept donations in different cryptocurrencies directly on their website which are then instantly converted into AidCoin. This is to allow charities to simply manage all donations received within a
single wallet while providing transparency and traceability through AidCoin.
The AIDChain platform and AidCoin token are conceived and developed by CharityStars, a well-established, VC-backed charity fundraising company. Since its inception, CharityStars’ team of 25 professionals has worked with 500+ charities including Unicef, Save the Children and WWF. CharityStars’ core competency is the
ability to forge high-level partnerships between charities, celebrities and high-profile corporations. Unlike other projects looking to tokenize the non-profit sector,
CharityStars has developed an ecosystem of charities, donors, celebrity donors
and gala events which will be key to facilitate the immediate use of the token.
CharityStars will also be the first external fundraising platform to accept payments
in AidCoin and will utilize the token internally to incentivize adoption. Over 40,000
bidders within the CharityStars community will be required to purchase and keep
AidCoin tokens in order to participate in the most exclusive auctions.
The ICO placement and the KYC and AML process will be assisted by Bitcoin Suisse,
a Swiss-based financial provider specialized in crypto-asset who already successfully held more than 20 ICOs, raising more than $500 million.

The non-profit sector today is worth an estimated $2 trillion worldwide, yet headlines in recent times have seen the sector stumble between corruption scandals,
gross inefficiencies, false expenses and misuse of funds such as the $187 million
misappropriation to cancer charities by James T. Reynolds. Recent high-profile
scandals include donors of the Helpers Community Inc. raising concerns regarding
the misuse of donations and the Trump Foundation admitting to self-dealing. In
other cases, donors are mystified at the lack of results, like in the case of the Red
Cross’ failure to enable recovery in Haiti despite receiving $500 million in donations
following the 2010 earthquake.
The continuous decline in trust on the part of potential donors is justifiable: according to Essential Research 35% of US citizens have little or no trust in charitable institutions. Similarly, in the UK, figures are not promising, with trust in charities falling
from 6.7 out of 10 in 2014 to 5.7 in 2015, with 33% of those polled explaining that
the primary reason for their reduction in donations stemmed from the impact of
recent scandals on charities’ reputations. Naturally, the consequences of donations
decreasing is alarming; in the US, 52% of charities are not adequately funded and
cannot match the distressing increase in demand for their services.
Unsurprisingly, donor’s trust in charities has been declining1 steadily. In a 2015 poll,
more than a third of those interviewed did not trust charities and nonprofits2.
Donors are demanding more accountability and charities, with forerunners such as
Kiva and GiveDirectly, are looking at how to be more transparent and accountable.

There are several methodologies organizations use to provide transparency to
their donors.
• Self-reporting: On websites and in annual reports, agencies report on their
progress and where donations are flowing. In many crowdfunded projects,
the crowdfunding recipient is also executing the project, and they report
from the field.

•

Recipient reporting: Recipients of the aid report their own progress. This is
most prominent on websites where organizations allow donors to give to a
specific person, cause or project.

•

Third-party reporting: Organizations such as GuideStar, Charity Navigator
and the Wise Giving Alliance provide oversight for charities, giving them a
ranking for their performance. However, the resources of these reports are
limited to public reporting from the charities.

www.AidCoin.co

In most cases, donors do not have a single place to see how their money is being
used and need to trust the information they are provided with. The information is
fragmented and is often difficult to compare with information from other organizations.

ΛIDCOIN

Given recent scandals, it is understandable that society has grown skeptical towards the non-profit sector. However, there is a solution that has the potential to
transform the industry. Blockchain-powered smart contracts and the adoption of
cryptocurrencies is providing transparency, enabling efficiency and cutting costs.
• Lower costs: With traditional donations, money goes through various middlemen, such as government agencies and financial institutions, and fees
(approximately 3%) are charged by credit or debit card as well as by clearing
houses. Blockchain donations are executed directly, reaching the charity instantaneously and at a fraction of the cost.
•

Efficiency: Thanks to the distributed ledger technology, blockchain donors
can track how their cryptocurrency is being used by charities. No record on
the blockchain, in fact, can be erased, thereby providing traceable accountability showing the exact flow of any coin in the ecosystem. Nonprofits too
can use the blockchain to manage resources, reduce overheads, streamline
their supply chain, and waste fewer resources.

•

Transparency: If certain KPIs or other predetermined conditions aren’t fulfilled, smart contracts allow donors to receive their donations back or to
redirect them towards more deserving or pressing causes. In 2010, the Red
Cross raised $500 million USD to build 130,000 homes in Haiti, however
only six homes were built, this would have been a prime use case for the
transparent technology.

•

Tax Deduction: Although formal guidance still isn’t available, the IRS treats
virtual currencies as noncash assets and, therefore, eligible to be treated as
long-term capital gain property. Moreover, while for traditional donations
over $5,000 USD, a qualified appraisal is required, blockchain donations are
exempt as they are transparently and publicly traded.

In order to provide increased transparency and traceability of donations, charities
could greatly benefit from blockchain technology. Although the benefits of transparency and the potential of cryptocurrency is clear, nonprofits are poorly positioned to embark on new blockchain-led technology initiatives, since they are focused on their core business: helping the recipients of charity donations. However,
when they are introduced to new technology which doesn’t require them to invest
in IT development, charities see the tremendous benefits it provides.

4

www.AidCoin.co

The benefits of applying the distributed ledger technology to the non-profit sector
are numerous as highlighted above. Donors will have more trust in the sector and,
consequently, will be more willing to donate.

ΛIDCOIN

To stimulate transparency and traceability in the non-profit sector, we have devised AidCoin, an ERC20 token that aims to become the preferred method to donate transparently through the Ethereum blockchain and to access the AIDChain
platform. The adoption of cryptocurrencies will impact the way we donate in the
future and AidCoin is poised to play a leading role in this new era of fundraising.

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), or blockchain technology provides a shared
ledger which is immutable and allows for full transparency. Records on the blockchain cannot be erased, so when used for cryptocurrency, blockchain technology
provides traceable accountability showing the exact flow of any coin in the ecosystem. This tamper resistant system has clear use in the non-profit area: when
someone donates a token, they can see exactly how it was used throughout its
lifecycle.
The following are the types of transparency that can be designed for charitable
organizations:
• Tracking the actual use of funds, from the time money is donated up until its
conversion into local fiat currencies.
•

Verification of the identity of the recipients and reporting on the blockchain
of their funds use.

•

Tracking of administrative costs of nonprofits.

•

Ensuring money earmarked for specific projects actually gets to those specific projects.

•

Comparison of the effectiveness of a euro spent in one charity versus a different charity.

•

Tracking of the investment policies of charities with the money they hold.

•

Reduction in transaction costs of money transfer through cryptocurrency rather than financial intermediaries. This becomes especially relevant when
dealing with organization that operate in developing countries, where transfer fees for remittances can be as high as 20%3

The room for improvement and the unchartered territories of blockchain opportunities are vast. Even those skeptical of the hype and speculation behind many cryptocurrency investments, Barbas and Zuckerman concedes that cryptocurrencies
3

https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/12/remittances

www.AidCoin.co

can push forward the conversation about financial inclusion in many promising
ways.
The issues plaguing charities worldwide are innumerable and cannot be countered
by relying on traditional methods. Nor can we afford to maintain the status quo or
harbor doubts about the impact new technologies can actually bring.

ΛIDCOIN

Wars, climate change, natural disasters, immigration, and the erosion of the welfare
state render the services provided by non-profits ever more in demand by billions
worldwide. The solution is, for once, simple and close at hand – the widespread
adoption of blockchain technology by charities and donors alike, which will in time
re-sow the seeds of trust, to the benefit of worthwhile charitable endeavors and
the most vulnerable in our society.

The AidCoin project is conceived and developed by CharityStars, a well-established, VC-backed charity fundraising company. Since its inception, CharityStars’
team of 25 professionals has worked with 500+ charities including Unicef, Save the
Children and WWF. CharityStars’ core competency is the ability to forge high-level
partnerships between charities, celebrities and high-profile corporations.
Unlike other projects looking to tokenize the nonprofit sector, CharityStars has developed an ecosystem of charities, donors, celebrity donors and gala events which
will be key to facilitate the immediate use of the tokens – indeed, such ecosystem
is already up and running. CharityStars, therefore, has the capabilities and resources to fulfil the blockchain promise to the nonprofit world.
CharityStars will also be the first external fundraising platform to accept payments
in AidCoin and will utilize the token internally to incentivize adoption. Over 40,000
bidders within the CharityStars community will be required to purchase and keep
AidCoin tokens in order to participate in the most exclusive auctions. ICO supporters will be able to immediately use the AidCoin token on CharityStars to participate
in the five hundred monthly high-profile auctions featuring celebrities, artists and
luxury brands.

AIDChain is a platform based on the Ethereum blockchain and powered by the
AidCoin tokens.
The platform provides an ecosystem of services through an easy-to-use interface,
connecting the non-profit community while allowing full transparency and traceability of donations. Donors, charities, causes, projects and many more will benefit
from the services provided by the AIDChain platform.

ΛIDCOIN

To simplify the donation process and increase AidCoin adoption, AIDChain will integrate several services in one single platform including an internal exchange to
convert major cryptocurrencies into AidCoin, a built-in wallet to store and donate
easily, an explorer to track donations transparently and templates of smart contracts to run fundraising campaigns.

To create an account on the AIDChain platform, charities and causes must register
and get verified in order to receive donations. Matching a unique public address
to a specific charity or cause allows to track the donations and check how funds
are used.
Charities and causes once registered and verified, will be able to share several
information with donors (for example general info, official address, donations received, use of funds and updates on projects) through a public profile. AIDChain
will also provide a private dashboard to manage all information and actions, view
donations received and transactions made on chain, upload off-chain receipts,
manage personal info and connect with other users.

7

www.AidCoin.co

Donors can register anonymously or with different levels of their personal data
choosing the preferred privacy settings. They can access their private dashboard
to manage personal data, view info related to charitable donations and request
receipts for tax deduction purposes.

AIDChain will allow donors to convert major cryptocurrencies into AidCoin at the
current exchange rate, while the built-in wallet will allow every registered user to
easily manage and store AidCoin tokens without using external services.

ΛIDCOIN

Donors will be able to convert major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Dash and ERC20 tokens into AidCoin with the aim to add an increasing number of cryptocurrencies and also fiat currencies in the future.
The team is also developing AIDPay, a payment gateway/embeddable widget that
allows charities registered on the AIDChain platform to accept donations in different cryptocurrencies directly on their website and mobile application which are
then instantly converted into AidCoin. This is to allow charities to simply manage
all donations received within a single wallet and providing transparency and traceability through AidCoin.
Since AIDChain ensures that a public address and other data (depending on the
jurisdiction) corresponds to a registered charity, the platform is able to provide a
compliant tax deductible receipt both for donations made directly through AIDChain and through AIDPay.

The AIDChain platform connects directly to the Ethereum blockchain to track AidCoin transactions, ensuring full transparency on the use of the donated funds and
providing relevant information such as donation amount, timestamp, donor and
recipient address and name (if public). The team will be developing an advanced
tracking system called Donation Tracking System (DTS). For example, thanks to the
“send and notify” option embedded in the platform wallet, donors will be able to
receive notifications for every step of the donation flow.
The combination of AidCoin and AIDChain ensures a solid and simple solution to
the transparency problem in the non-profit sector. However, traceability of the entire donation flow will depend on the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.
In the meanwhile, AidChain will be able to track donations even after AidCoin is
converted into fiat currencies thanks to the integration with the charity’s bank

8

www.AidCoin.co

APIs4. AidCoin will collaborate with companies such as TrueLayer in order to connect to the bank data, verify accounts, and access transactions in real-time, providing a clear picture of how charities are spending the funds received in AidCoin.

ΛIDCOIN

Through the AIDChain platform charities will also be able to manually input offchain data on the Ethereum blockchain. For example, if a charity states that the
money received is going to be used for medical supplies, said charity will be
prompted to upload the receipts for the supplies and shipping within the
timeframe stipulated, and everything will be recorded on-chain.
Thanks to the AIDChain platform and AIDPay, the information automatically or manually recorded on the blockchain will be immutable, tamper-proof and publicly accessible through an open explorer, increasing the level of transparency and allowing public auditing besides AIDChain platform users.

In the near future, we foresee the implementation of an ERC721-based system in
order to increase the accuracy of our Donation Tracking System (DTS). Indeed, using this new Ethereum token standard, which guarantee the existence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum Blockchain, we will introduce a NFT-based
structure into the AIDChain Platform. This new structure will be powered by AIDGift
an ERC721 non-fungible token directly backed and connected to AidCoin, that will
provide a stronger tracking tool to AIDChain donors and charities.
Timing and phases of implementation will be evaluated as the AIDChain platform
evolves.

Pursuant to PSD2 law, European banks will be required to adopt publicly available APIs starting from January 2018 until the end of the
year. The Payment Services Directive (PSD, 2007/64/EC) is an EU Directive, administered by the European Commission to regulate payment services and payment service providers throughout the European Union.

Traceability and transparency are just one part of the team’s vision. Creating a vibrant and engaged community is equally important for the future success of the
non-profit sector.
AIDChain will help donors to connect with all the actors involved in the non-profit
sector, providing them with tools to facilitate new types of collaborations.

ΛIDCOIN

Donors will be able to search, discover and review charities, causes and projects
on a single platform, while charities will be able to publish regular updates, create
and send direct marketing campaigns, request feedbacks and share volunteering
opportunities.

Smart contracts being computer protocols designed to facilitate, verify, or enforce
the negotiation or performance of a specific set of rules are ideal to facilitate charities’ fundraising. The Ethereum blockchain specifically allows the registration and
execution of smart contracts in a secure and decentralized way.
Implementing smart contracts in the non-profit sector adds a layer of security and
effectiveness to donations, allowing the transfer of funds only to expected recipients and if specific conditions are met.
AIDChain will provide charities with templates of smart contracts that can be easily
customisable with the click of a button depending on each campaign’s requirements.
For example, a fundraising campaign may be deemed successful only if at least
50% of the funds needed are raised. If this condition is not met, the smart contract
will return the donations to the donors. Similarly, a smart contract can keep the
donation in an escrow account until independent validators confirm that the charity
has delivered the promised project.
We believe that smart contracts will play a central role in revolutionizing the noprofit sector. Donors will be more incentivized to donate to the non-profit and
fundraising organizations that are part of the AIDChain ecosystem, since in addition
to public transparency they will also have the certainty that funds are used only
upon fulfilment of set conditions and contingencies.

11

www.AidCoin.co

Unlike other projects looking to tokenize the non-profit sector, CharityStars has
already developed an ecosystem of charities, donors, celebrities and events that
will be key to increase the adoption of the AIDChain platform. Through established
relationships, CharityStars will be instrumental in signing up the first charities to
AIDChain.

ΛIDCOIN

Also, CharityStars will be the first external fundraising platform to accept AidCoin.
Some benefits to incentivize the community to use AidCoin tokens are:
• Discounted price: auctions paid in AidCoin will benefit from a 5% discount
on the hammer final price. As the platform’s average ticket is $500, this results in a big incentive to donors to use the tokens as a medium of exchange.
•

Membership club auctions: to participate to these special auctions, users
will need to stake AidCoin on their wallet. The amount of tokens required
will change based on the auction’s nature and price. This will enable certain
users to bid on some of the most amazing once-in-a-lifetime experiences we
have ever hosted on our platform.

As the adoption of the platform grows and the tracking system gets further developed, AIDChain will aim at attracting corporate users to the platform by leveraging
well established CSR programs for which the ability to provide transparency and
accountability is key. As of today, 64% of CEOs have declared that CSR is a core
part of their business and no longer a standalone program. While CSR has been
proven to create value for both businesses and society, the amount raised by companies and the destination of the funds is not transparent.

12

www.AidCoin.co

By adopting AIDChain and AidCoin, businesses will be able to create corporate
gifts, rewards for employees, and CSR campaigns which will be fully trackable.
Through AIDChain, companies will have accurate reporting of the charities and
causes that are closest to the hearts of their employees, allowing them to improve
their employee relations as well as affect outcomes in the areas that their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs want to impact.

ΛIDCOIN

The AidCoin team (through CharityStars) has worked with many corporations, including Hugo Boss, Citroen, Yamaha Racing, Armani, IWC and Peugeot, proving
itself as a preferred destination for CSR activities. For example, CharityStars partnered with the 13th largest European Bank, Unicredit, to create a private whitelabel
solution for a private art auction exclusive for their employees. More than 850 artworks were successfully sold.
Following these initial phases, the AIDChain team will target the onboarding of
other fundraising platforms including crowdfunding platforms, sponsorships for
athletic events and community fundraising platforms. All of these fundraising platforms stand to benefit from integrating with the AIDChain platform and using the
AidCoin tokens because they can provide accountability of the funds collected as
well as utilize the marketing tools that are built into the platform. Furthermore, as
charities in the ecosystem begin to prefer this way of funding, fundraising platforms
will be compelled to adopt it as a standard.

In order to deliver a viable business model for the long term, we establish AidCoin
to be a pay-per-use rail for getting onto the AIDChain platform or for using services

16

www.AidCoin.co

available. According to our long-term view, we foresee two different economic
models for AIDChain which, while ensuring price fluctuations, will aim at stabilising
the price over the long term to avoid triple digit price swings in short timeframes.

Below we describe the model to ensure the AidCoin long term sustainability.
It is based on the fees we expect to earn from different services that will be available through the AIDChain platform, including:
1. “Exchange” fees: % of each amount sent through AIDPay;

ΛIDCOIN

2. “Send and notify” fees: fixed amount for notifications;
3. “Smart contract template”: % of total donations raised through the contract or fixed fee.

Future cash flows, obtained through these services fees, will guarantee the selfsustainability of the AIDChain platform.

The other economic model is a staking-model based on the amount of AidCoin
which AIDChain users have to own for a certain timespan in order to access specific
tiers of services offered by the platform. Tiers will differ for charities and donors
and will be composed of different services provided through our platform.

www.AidCoin.co

ΛIDCOIN

Specifically, by requiring our users to own fixed amounts of AidCoin, we aim at
minimizing the action of the supply curve as well as increasing and stabilizing the
long-term value of AidCoin.

In order to ensure that charities are incentivized to only change AidCoin to FIAT or
other cryptos when needed, we will provide a system or a combination of systems
which aim to reduce the volatility of AidCoin.
The AidCoin value will be hedged against volatility thanks to our reserves system
managed by AidPool through a specific algorithm which allows the AidPool to directly operate on the supply and demand curves of AidCoin. For example, we
could offer an official exchange rate whereby anyone can buy AidCoin at the official
rate but only registered charities can sell at that rate. This might be done through
services built within the AidChain platform.
The stabilisation algorithm, monitoring core variables directly connected to the
AidCoin open market price action, calculates the price difference between supply
and demand and operates in order to counteract this dynamic.

CharityStars founder Francesco Nazari Fusetti is a serial entrepreneur who has
proven his tenacity through the numerous ventures he has built from the ground
up. At just 20 years old, Francesco launched his first venture, ScuolaZoo. Originally
a blog for Italian students to share humorous contents, ScuolaZoo has grown into
a $12M social network and tour operator for students in Italy, with 3M followers on
Instagram and Facebook, employing 70 people in its Milan headquarters.
Francesco’s next light-bulb moment came unexpectedly when he learned that
someone had decided to donate $3M for a lunch with Warren Buffet. Seeing a way
to monetize this further for the greater good, he enlisted two cofounders Manuela
Ravalli and Domenico Gravagno and invested his savings to fund a beta project
around celebrities and the charities they loved, launching the first batch of auctions
in June 2013. By the end of that year, CharityStars had 20 charities on board,
reached $75K total gross sales and caught the eye of the press which resulted in
features in more than 1,000 articles in the Italian and international press.
CharityStars specialized by auctioning unique experiences (VIP backstage tickets,
dinners with celebrities and top CEOs, etc.) and rare collectibles (jerseys worn by
athletes, signed music memorabilia, luxury limited edition watches, artworks, etc).
This affordable fundraising tool is a win-win-win for: - (1) charities, which gain with
an effective channel to increase donations and achieve public awareness, (2)
brands and celebrities, who can improve their visibility while doing good, and (3)
bidders looking for original items and unique experiences.
By 2016, CharityStars was holding high-exposure auctions drawing high-ticket
prices, including power-lunches with the founder of Candy Crush (sold for

Warhol ($32,000), and a Barcelona soccer shirt signed by Lionel Messi ($13,000).
2016 marked the introduction of a series of innovations including a website redesign, the launch of prize draw technology, the iOS and Android app restyling, and
the adaptation of the company’s business model to embrace private users such as
artists and private collectors who auction their works and memorabilia.
In 2016, CharityStars secured a $2.4M Series A round from notable investors including 360 Capital Partners and renowned entrepreneur and Shark Tank regular, Fabio

CharityStars covers its own costs by collecting a 20% success fee on the amount
raised through the online bid, while the rest goes towards the cause. CharityStars’
fee goes towards platform development, online marketing, managing payment
flows, sourcing and delivery of items, and event organization. At the center of the
company’s success is its ability to provide its clients with a global audience and
multiple fundraising channels all in one place. This has translated into an impressive
client list comprised of big names such as WWF (joined the platform in 2013),
Make-A-Wish (2014) and Save the Children (2013). Approximately 80% of these clients have signed exclusivity agreements, essentially electing CharityStars as their
preferred fundraising platform and setting high entry barriers for other service providers.

With so many ICOs on the market today, many of them in the area of charity and
giving, one thing is clear: tokens are going to be an integral part of how we give
to charity in the future. One thing isn’t clear: who will be the leader in the world of
nonprofit charity tokens?

The main reason that AidCoin has a tremendous advantage over every other coin
offering in this area is that we have an established, proven team that has been in
this field for many years.

In order to fund the development of the AidCoin ecosystem, 100,000,000 ERC20
tokens (onwards called AidCoin tokens, or AidCoin) will be created on the
Ethereum blockchain and they will be sold to the public. AidCoin is a token that
will allow the User to access the service provided by the AIDChain platform.

ΛIDCOIN

The AidCoin token does not have the legal qualification of a security since it does
not give any rights to dividends or interests. The sale of AidCoin tokens is final and
non-refundable. AidCoin tokens are not shares and do not give any right to participate in the general meeting of CharityStars. AidCoin tokens cannot have a performance or a particular value outside the AIDChain Platform. AidCoin tokens shall
therefore not be used or purchased for speculative or investment purposes. The
purchaser of AidCoin tokens is aware that the Federal Act on Stock Exchanges and
Securities Trading law and the Financial Market Infrastructure Act, which ensure
that investors are sold investments that include all the proper disclosures and are
subject to regulatory scrutiny for the investors' protection, are not applicable.
Anyone purchasing AidCoin tokens expressly acknowledges and represents that
she/he has carefully reviewed this white paper and fully understands the risks,
costs and benefits associated with the purchase of AidCoin.
The purchaser of AidCoin tokens undertakes that she/he understands and has significant experience of cryptocurrencies, blockchain systems and services, and that
she/he fully understands the risks associated with the crowdsale as well as the
mechanism related to the use of cryptocurrencies (incl. storage).
CharityStars shall not be responsible for any loss of AidCoin tokens or situations
making it impossible to access AidCoin tokens, which may result from any actions
or omissions of the user or any person undertaking to acquire AidCoin tokens as
well as in case of hacker attacks.
Acquiring AidCoin tokens and storing them involves various risks, in particular the
risk that CharityStars may not be able to launch its operations and develop its
blockchain and provide the services promised. Therefore, and prior to acquiring
AidCoin tokens any user should carefully consider the risks, costs and benefits of
acquiring AidCoin tokens in the context of the crowdsale and, if necessary, obtain
any independent advice in this regard. Any interested person who is not in the
position to accept or to understand the risks associated with the activity (incl. the
risks related to the non-development of the AidCoin platform) or any other risks as

indicated in the Terms & Conditions of the crowdsale should not acquire AidCoin
tokens.

This white paper shall not and cannot be considered as an invitation to enter into
an investment. It does not constitute or relate in any way nor should it be considered as an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. The white paper does not include nor contain any information or indication that might be considered as a recommendation or that might be used to base any investment decision. This document does not constitute an offer or an invitation to sell shares, securities or rights
belonging to CharityStars or any related or associated company. The AidCoin tokens are just a utility token which can be used only on the AIDChain platform and
is not intended to be used as an investment.
The offering of AidCoin tokens on a trading platform is done in order to allow the
use of the AIDChain platform and not for speculative purposes. The offering of AidCoin tokens on a trading platform is not changing the legal qualification of the token, which remains a simple means for the use of the AIDChain platform and is not
a security.
CharityStars is not to be considered as advisor in any legal, tax or financial matters.
Any information in the white paper is given for general information purpose only,
and CharityStars does not provide any warranty as to the accuracy and completeness of this information. Given the lack of crypto-token qualifications in most countries, each buyer is strongly advised to carry out a legal and tax analysis concerning
the purchase and ownership of AidCoin according to their nationality and place of
residence.
CharityStars today is not a financial intermediary according to Swiss Law and is not
required to obtain any authorization for Anti Money Laundering purpose. This qualification may change in the case of AidCoin offering services which are to be considered as qualifying as financial intermediation activity. In this case, the use of AidCoin services may require the positive conclusion of a AML/KYC identification process.
Acquiring AidCoin tokens shall not grant any right or influence over AidCoin’s organization. AidCoin confer no direct or indirect right to CharityStars’ capital or income, nor do they confer any governance right within CharityStars. An AidCoin is
not proof of ownership or a right of control. It does not grant the controlling individual any asset or share in CharityStars, or in the CharityStars network. An AidCoin
does not grant any right to participate in control over CharityStars’ management
or decision-making set-up, or over the CharityStars network and governance to the
Purchasers.

Regulatory authorities are carefully scrutinizing businesses and operations associated with cryptocurrencies in the world. In that respect, regulatory measures, investigations or actions may impact CharityStars’ business and even limit or prevent
it from developing its operations in the future. Any person undertaking to acquire
AidCoin tokens must be aware that the CharityStars business model, the white paper or terms and conditions may change or need to be modified because of new
regulatory and compliance requirements from any applicable laws in any jurisdictions. In such a case, purchasers and anyone undertaking to acquire AidCoin tokens
acknowledge and understand that neither CharityStars nor any of its affiliates shall
be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or damage caused by such changes.
CharityStars will do its utmost to launch its operations and develop the AIDChain platform. Anyone undertaking to acquire AidCoin tokens acknowledges and
understands that CharityStars does not provide any guarantee that it will manage
to achieve it. On concluding the Commercial Operation, these tokens will be issued
by a technical process referred to as a «Blockchain». This is an open source IT protocol over which the Company has no rights or liability in terms of its development
and operation. The token distribution mechanism will be controlled by a Smart
Contract; this involves a computer program that can be executed on the Ethereum
network or on a blockchain network that is compatible with Smart Contract programming language. They acknowledge and understand, therefore, that CharityStars (incl. its bodies and employees) assumes no liability or responsibility for
any loss or damage that would result from or relate to the incapacity to use AidCoin
tokens, except in case of intentional misconduct or gross negligence.
AidCoin is based on the Ethereum protocol. Therefore, any malfunction, unplanned
function or unexpected operation of the Ethereum protocol may cause the CharityStars network or AidCoin to malfunction or operate in a way that is not expected.
Ether, the native Ethereum Protocol account unit, may itself lose value in a similar
way to AidCoin, and also in other ways.
