This order is being issued pursuant to Rule 65(c), including late notice. The purpose of the Order to Show Cause is to provide CNG additional time to address its compliance with ICA and Rule 145.

Investors can hold their tokens even after an NFT has been lost or stolen while maintaining their current income streams but not before.\n",

By investing in NFTs, investors can utilize their wealth to quickly adjust to changes in the price of the asset, thereby diversifying their investment and gaining a bonus on their investment as well as pay outs on their investment. For example, if an investment in a NFT is almost always spent on an ICO or exchange themselves, they are essentially returning a portion of their capital portion towards an investor. This is extra earning and protection from risk. It is ideal if an investment in NFTs is used to create a product that generates revenue.
