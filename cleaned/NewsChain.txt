dissemination ecosystem. its goal establish network that uses blockchain technology use decentralized consensus methods contribute pricing and equity returns content production. producers, content investors and content consumers all have reasonable incentives and rewards. advertisers can also achieve accurate marketing the platform. the original design news chain (propaganda chain) construct set reasonable content flow advertising value evaluation and income distribution mechanism, and build value network based user content evaluation. regardless text, video, image, audio, even live broadcast content-based content platforms (including, not limited websites, apps, and other forms expression), the use communication chains can used construct content incentive platform corresponding the theme. between the platforms, the content evaluated using unified content evaluation algorithm, the value the traffic evaluated using effective traffic algorithm, and the advertisement provided accurate marketing algorithm. the content produced content producers, content investors, content communicators, and platforms. constructors, advertisers, etc. will all rely the ecology the dissemination chain obtain appropriate and reasonable returns based content, traffic value, and precision marketing. therefore, news chain (propagation chain) combines social networks, artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchains seamlessly. will surely enable content-based eco-blockchains based social networks create content producers and content consumers. content communicators and advertising investors share the economic ecology mutual benefit. design concept industry background and starting the engine the past few years, active users, creators and communicators high-quality content, facebook, twitter, reddit, weibo, zhihu, today's headlines and other social networks and ugc (user generated content, user-generated content) the platform brought massive traffic and tens billions dollars profits. however, users these production content not have complete control over the content they create, nor they enjoy the full benefits. taking today's headline example, the headline currently has more than million active users per day. the headline user wrote more than million articles and million responses, and the value d-round financing exceeded us$ billion. however, most the headline value creators, high-quality content producers and traffic generating readers, have not received much reward addition gaining respect. high-quality content often overwhelmed large number poor articles. all this makes difficult for original high-quality content producers maintain sufficient creative momentum. news chain (propagation chain) uses the value transmission protocol over networks utilize the characteristics blockchain decentralization, tamper-proof, and transparent disclosure build global network data content value ecosystem. the dissemination chain based well-developed modern information network. establishes trust model under decentralized system through blockchains, enabling content producers, content communicators, and other community builders the community communication networks follow continue develop reasonable return. development direction news chain (distribution chain) builds fair and equitable content production, contribution evaluation, advertisement placement, and equity allocation based stable and secure graphene engine through the innovation network data content evaluation system and community participant equity allocation system. content ecological network. addition, news chain (spreading chain) enables third-party platforms and developers develop multiple content-based and traffic-based applications based news chain promote news chain (propagation) providing efficient and secure sdk. chain) the healthy development community ecology. the same time, order promote and build communities, news chain (communication chain) will provide early-stage builders with various assistance. news (newton token) the only circulation medium the news chain (communication chain) network. the revenues content producers, content distributors, advertisement placement and revenue, and community ecology builders must circulated through newt (news token). the same time, the medium and long-term planning news chain (propaganda chain), third-party platforms and developers are allowed issue system tokens that meet specific innovative applications based newt (news token). ultimately, newt will become the sum the price all humanity's spreadable knowledge. all the valuable data and traffic all humanity will spread throughout the world through the communication chain. the dissemination chain will become the carrier the world's value provable data and traffic. network ecology. mission and vision news chain (community chain) committed building global content community ecosystem through the combination content ecology, advertising delivery platforms, and blockchain. uses the efficient combination graphene engine and content flow create content producers and content. the trusted underlying ecosystem communicators, advertisers, and community ecobuilders. producers content: content uploaded content producers (including articles, comments articles, and flat roads for reviews) are not rewarded themselves. the user required comment, browse, like, and forward the content provided the user, and these actions will increase the interest the content, thereby allowing the content author obtain token reward. this mechanism ensures the validity the content. content communicators: content communicators, through the evaluation content values (browsing, commenting, praising, forwarding, etc.), systematically define and analyze their behavior and reward communicators valuable content with tokens. through this mechanism, the value content can promoted the one hand, and content producers can receive corresponding token rewards promote the creation more valuable content. the other hand, through the token incentive mechanism, content communicators are encouraged spread value and complete information. the transition from internet value internet. specifically, the registered users the official app the dissemination chain can obtain more rewards sharing forwarding the valuable content data the official app other platforms such wechat, qq, weibo, etc., thereby attracting more users register and use. the official app the dissemination chain will further promote the continuous improvement and development the value chain content the communication chain. advertisers: advertisers want serve ads and can purchase tokens the exchange. the dissemination chain does not provide unified advertising access system. advertising access provided separately based the official app other application the propagation chain. however, advertisers need use newt currency regardless where they place their ads. community eco-builders: news chain (spreading chain) encourages participants who contribute community building and development through token-based rewards (such community promotion ambassadors, witness nodes, etc.). short, our mission help and motivate everyone share content and innovate knowledge. all participants the dissemination chain (including but not limited producers innovative knowledge, value-based content disseminators, readers) will receive corresponding newt awards. making news chain the most accurate and wide-ranging certification economy for the transmission valuable data and traffic value worldwide. ecosystem ecological participants overview participants the news chain ecosystem: content producers, content investors, content communicators,

thiis obtain one-time ncome and subsequent share procceeds. conteent com mmunicator news chain (dissemination chain) first established social media platform with general information distribution its theme through content reward and reward mechanism, and gradually completed the content distribution mechanism for social networks, and finally realized high-level content community ecology for content distribution services. specifically, the users the official app the dissemination chain can forward the content the terminal other platforms (including but not limited wechat, qq, weibo, facebook, and medium) through the forwarding interface, and the forwarded content determined valid. forwarders will receive corresponding token rewards. through this mechanism, users are continuously attracted the dissemination chain ecosystem and gradually become the world's largest blockchain-based traffic dissemination ecosystem. the same time, news chain (propaganda chain) uses effective traffic verification mechanism prevent malicious brush traffic; effective amount algorithm used evaluate the value traffic, and accurate marketing algorithm used provide effective advertising for advertisements. advertisers obtain digital currency through the trading market, purchase traffic, and place advertisements. through variety communication links app and newt (news token) balance and encourage all parties form the most effective digital content market. ordinary users ordinary users authorize the platform through the wallet supported news chain (propagation chain), and can authorize the platform agent use its authentication authority. the authority can used perform cross-site login, single sign-on, content rating, posting content, comments, etc. operation, because this restricted privilege, impossible perform key operations the user's main wallet, and assets cannot transferred. the same time, the platform cannot obtain user keys, ensuring the security user assets and ensuring the openness the system. ordinary users can also revoke authorization any time. paid users since the outbreak the media wave, data content has completely entered the era excess, and users need other agencies help them obtain high-quality content more quickly, even the user needs pay certain fee also reasonable. the same time, traditional content weakened advertising and soft papers the free mode, and new mechanisms are required break the status quo. the great success the payment model represented the "new york times" gave spotlight the content payment. the dissemination chain, paying users can directly use newt pay content providers ensure timely access interesting and valuable data content. advertisers the advertising system can enhance newt (news token) liquidity and increase platform revenue. key component the entire ecosystem. the general online advertisements are "pay per space", well various billing models such "cpc", "cpm", "cpa" and on. considering that pay-per-click and pay-per-view types ads are often subject click/pageview fraud, and need introduce mechanisms such oracles used blockchain system, the early stages development, the news chain advertising platform does not intend introduce and develop this type billing model. instead, will introduce billing model that pays slot duration. news chain advertising content also integral part the content the chain. the dissemination chain provides unified advertising platform the chain and sells advertisements for the platform that are paid terms length time according advertising positions and are paid for downloads. this system, the advertising location options and costs that each platform can provide will displayed, and the performance these platforms the blockchain and historical data (such income, quantity content, etc.) will displayed for users' reference. the user can directly pay the token for purchase, and the witness can review the advertisement and can then advertise. witnesses are third-party witnesses and are generated community voting. matching ads and content achieved two ways: advertiser manual matching auto association matching community content review the data content traffic ecology, the content review system crucial link, and the data content display the dissemination chain must comply with relevant national laws and regulations. for example, mainland china, necessary abide the relevant provisions local network supervision laws, cultural departments, and public security departments. therefore, the use community-based content review system the content review the dissemination chain enables the content stored and disseminated the chain have healthy social orientation, value orientation, and aesthetic orientation. the propagation chain provides set community-based auditing interfaces for each connected application website. allows developers implement content review and content filtering services this interface. this set community-based auditing interface not only supports the review and editing professional content the access users, but also supports community users vote out newt that not suitable for the content and obtain community rewards through voting rules set the access users. this community-based auditing interface has been included the news chain development api. all developers participating news chain are welcome update and improve it. official app and api thee schematic diagram off the officiall app architecture ass follows: new chain (propagation chain) pprovides decentralize content aand traffic

communication can not only price the content, but also can price the assets that are similar the content based their intrinsic value. the dissemination chain platform provides users with the property issuing assets establish business models for specific service projects. user-issued assets refer customized tokens registered the spread chain platform, whereby the token users can hold and trade with each other, and comply with the rules set the issuer. the issuer can publicly name, explain, issue user tokens, and add custom specifications tokens. the same time, the long-term planning the dissemination chain, thirdparty value targets (such shopping vouchers, rebates for sales activities, etc.) can distributed through the chain distribution. different value providers conduct asset distribution and transactions through the dissemination chain. third party news chain may purchase newt asset for collateral lending, and compliance with the news chain assets issuance agreement, may issue relevant digital assets required. these digital assets can freely traded under the news chain framework. for details the channels and methods joining, see the description the news chain content ecosystem and foundation. propagation chain system the propagation chain comes with system (smart recommendation algorithm). the based deep learning algorithm. can create portraits based user behavior, predict the content interest the user, match the content the chain end, and push content for the user. the same time, the can also cooperate with the advertising system help advertisers associate content and advertisements with the best price/performance ratio. the content the dissemination chain becomes more and more abundant, the can also learn depth, integrate content the chain, and produce new content based ai, enriching and expanding knowledge human knowledge. platform architecture blockchain architecture technical architecture news chain uses graphene engine. mong them,

the block, without the consuumption pow mining hardware electricityy, thus redu ucing the cosst system operation, the userr's use cost (procedure fee) has alsso been greaatly reduced high securiity: the ulti-signaturee graphen adopts weighted mode. different privvate keys aree assigned different weeights. case wherre individuaal private keeys are lost, long the total weight other private keys reaches the set initial value, assets can guaranteed. not lost high capacity: graphene places key data such user balance/asset attributes into memory and establishes index that can quickly searched, maximizing the speed data processing, and thus increasing the capacity each block. high speed: confirm speed blocks, high concurrency, high efficiency, suitable for commercial use maturity and stability: commercial applications require stable and mature system, any unstable factors are potential risks the uplink information the propagation chain includes content, users, and relationships. the specific examples are follows: consensus mechanism the dissemination chain adopts the dpos mechanism. the chinese name called the share authorization verification mechanism (also known the trustee mechanism). its principle let every person holding coin vote, and thus generate certain number representatives, can understand super node mining pool, and these super nodes have exactly the same rights. from certain perspective, dpos somewhat like parliamentary system people's congress system. delegates cannot perform their duties (when they are not able generate blocks) they will delisted and the network will elect new super nodes replace them. token production and circulation total control coinage news chain generates total billion newt (news token). the principle controlling the total amount tokens grow with the growth the dissemination content, taking into account the currency system, and eventually reach fixed total amount. the total amount tokens consists two parts. the first part the token predigging part. the second part the token production part, which the increment generated the annual dpos mechanism. with the continuous development the community, the data content the dissemination chain network will continue grow. therefore, after the increment generated the dpos mechanism completed, the additional issuance newt will decided the communication chain

income and expenses. when eco-participants earn news token, the news token their wallet will increase; when eco-participants spend news token, the news token their wallet will decrease. the income includes the following aspects: system rewards obtained content producers through the production valuable content systematic rewards obtained content communicators through the transmission value content witness node and miner reward community builder awards others news token expenditure includes the following aspects: advertiser traffic purchase content consumers purchase paid content payment processing fee transactions small products and services and their assets content investment daily consumption such rewards and sticking others coin repurchases the communication chain management foundation will decide whether not make token repurchase based the market situation and extensively solicit the situation the communication chain ecological community. the dissemination chain official app promises that the foundation needs it, will use its profit each year repurchase tokens from the market. after the repurchase completed, these tokens will managed the foundation. ecological incentive mechanism news (news token) the only circulation medium the entire community ecosystem. the eco-reward system establishes community eco-reward mechanism through the platform's original pop (proof participation) algorithm, which specifically used for token rewards from community contributors. the number news tokens the first-year reward pool accounted for the total number new tokens issued. afteer that, oof the newss tokens wiill enter the pool each year for total years. settleement tim thhe disseminnation chain each eco-pplayer's con ntribution vaalue rewardd needs fix xed

distriibute the tok kens the day's comm munity incen ntive pool. the calculaation metthod foollows: user rating: thhe design the dissem mination chaain app, thee users registered thee terminal will ddivided intoo different leevels accordding diffeerent types effectivee behavior. the speccific principples are follows: thhere are three main cattegories eeffective user behavior: content crreators, conttent forw warders, andd content reeaders. levels the same user can dividded into creaator level, forwarder leevel and reader leveel accordingg the abov principlees under the same conditions, the higher the level users' contribution the system ecology is, the higher the system reward will be. content creators: the official app terminal the dissemination chain provides registered users with knowledge and content innovation capabilities, and adopts community content evaluation system. when the user's data supported and recognized the community, the system will give him corresponding rewards, and the more premium content will receive more token rewards. the user can praise, click, and comment the content. the weights the three behaviors are and respectively. the user's weight divided into levels. each level has corresponding weight. the user likes, clicks comment defined as: the effective value single content defined as: vck the total value all articles during the billing period the content creator's token reward among them, the total number token pool tokens, and assigned the creators. note: the design the dissemination chain, the content posting and commenting have exactly the same community contribution. content forwarder: the registered users the terminal can share the valuable content other platforms (wechat, qq, weibo, facebook, etc.) through the forwarding function the chain's official app. when the system determines that valid forwarding, the system will reward newt. the content forwarder's reward rules are described follows: the effective forwarding contribution value single content defined as: where the user's forwarding level, the content user's creator level the total effective contribution value all content defined as: the newt rewards that users receive for effective forwarding content are: among them, the total number token pool tokens, and assigned the creators. valid forwarding for the user's cycle. note: the propagation chain ecology encourages the forwarding content generated high-level content creators. the higher the corresponding level creators for effective forwarding content, the more newt incentives the content forwarder will receive. end user reading the registered users the official app side the dissemination chain can obtain the tokens the system rewards reading the content they are interested in, that is, the registered users can read the token rewards. the system will reward newt when the reading behavior registered users the terminal determined valid reading the system. the value single valid reading contribution for users registered the terminal defined as: where the user's reading level, the content user's creator level the effective total contribution value all readers during the billing period defined as: the newt award for single user during the billing period is: among them, the total number token pools for the reward pool, and the ratio for readers. valid readings for the user cycle. note: the propagation chain ecology encourages the reading content generated high-level content creators, and the higher the corresponding level creators for effective reading content, the more newt incentives the content reader will receive. new user registration order allow the newly registered users obtain relatively good user experience, the system gives each newly registered valid user newt awards. course, new users must pass valid content verification recognized real users obtain these rewards. the newt these incentives comes from the part the marketing chain reserved after pre-excavation. the award deadline and the number awards are determined the communication chain management foundation. mentoring relationship rewards order promote and build the community ecosystem the dissemination chain, the system will award user tokens for new user registration. for example, when user recommends user register, the master and user obtains the system's token reward because user b's registration. valid content certification mechanism the community ecosystem adopts the original povc (proof valid cotent) use big data analysis methods mathematically model user postings, user reviews, etc., and filter out valueless content data form news chain (propagation chain). community network content producers and content consumers have mutually beneficial sharing economy model. for the vector space model, the similarity calculation approach calculate the cosine similarity between vectors. the similarity between users and documents can defined follows: sim specifically, for content certification system that uses probabilistic model, defined as: )(ni log where the weight the item the number filtered texts, the number related texts that the user has identified, the number texts that contain items and the number texts that contain items the related text. for the vector space model, the following feedback model used: among them, new template, old template, vector representation related text, vector representation unrelated text, related text number, unrelated text number, weighting factor, and the contribution rate positive and negative feedback. the same time, the content the dissemination chain was introduced into the community review system ensure the spread popular values. the same time, order meet the requirements relevant national and local laws and regulations, the dissemination chain adopts the big data analysis engine manual audit dual review system ensure the validity and legitimacy the dissemination chain data. effective traffic certification mechanism the community ecosystem uses the original povt (proof valid traffic) use the artificial intelligence traffic analysis platform perform traffic cleaning and filtering. the one hand, can save the bandwidth resources the entire community network, and the same time deliver targeted advertisements for promote strong development the community provide strong support. the propagation chain network dynamically changing, and the user's behavior the network will change due the changing environment the network. the malicious user's network behavior the network will more and more away from the normal user's behavior over time. therefore, building model, make weighted analysis the user's behavior the day and the day before, which makes the historical data user behavior become the key factor that determines whether the traffic abnormal not. among them, the user the model analysis value the time the observation value the time and the weighted constant control the proportion the data the model. the outgoing and incoming rates normal user traffic have the following relationships and characteristics: rout rin vout vin the malicious user host network port data flow rate has the following characteristics: rout rin vout vin wherein, rin rout the rate which the port information flows, vin vout the rate change the rate per unit time, and constant used for threshold determination. the same time, each user assigned fixed bandwidth, and the bandwidth obtained different user levels will different. the user's behavior, including like, click, send articles, write comments, forward articles, and read will consume certain amount bandwidth, thus avoiding the plight the infinite loop the machine. the same time, each user's bandwidth being consumed the same time, will continue recover over time, thus ensuring that normal users can like, click, send articles, write comments, forward articles and other operations, improve the user experience. anti-cheating mechanism the anti-cheating mechanism used prevent brushing. specifically, the anticheating mechanism mainly used prevent malicious users from illegally acquiring tokens after simulating user operations through the robot. once the spread chain foundation determines that there malicious user who commits cheating, will permanently cancel the account and withdraw newt from its account. mobile phone number registration each official communication chain app needs registered through valid phone number. that is, the user must fill valid phone number when new registration, and can correctly receive and send the authentication code the mobile phone sent the system become part the community. weighted real-time evaluation system the weights the ecological participants the dissemination chain are important value attributes the users, which are closely related the system rewards generated users' posts, comments, and likes. the system will adjust its weight according the user's different behaviors real time that system participants can receive corresponding community rewards real time. face verification the propagation chain will introduce the face verification mechanism. once suspicious cheating found, the client will automatically pop the face verification interface and ask the user perform face verification. products and operations the app and website the participating parties the dissemination chain have integrated variety data content (information data, novels, short videos, shared wifi, etc.), and will gradually integrate other types data (transaction data, product pricing, event rebates). etc) build the communication chain benchmark for global content data traffic. order achieve the above objectives, the communication chain needs very professional landing products, landing services, and landing operations. these products and their services consist the following components: communication chain autonomous community the communications chain community maintained the communications chain foundation and consists several components. the dissemination chain strives become the best autonomous community the blockchain system: foundation operation newt the only approved official value transmission medium for the dissemination chain, and all distribution, issuance, destruction and repurchase newt are under the responsibility the communication chain management foundation. the communication chain foundation registered non-profit organization singapore and mainly responsible for the development the ecological community the chain communication. the same time, under the public concern and supervision the entire community, trusted third party, provides reasonable and impartial advice for the long-term development the news chain community. addition, the communication chain foundation, public interest organization, pays attention poverty alleviation, public utilities, and disaster relief the world, and actively participates the maintenance and development the global public trust system. activities the foundation, and will the agenda http: ne.wson the release. chains transmission foundations relevant regulatory bodies

the dissemination chain supports small asset transactions. the communication chain believes that this small amount assets comes from the behavior and attention each independent individual the outside world the process communication and communication. the newt the communication chain both currency expression this transmission value. newt based dpos. order better maintain the value newt and reinforce the asset properties the process content dissemination, the dissemination chain sets mechanism for anchoring the pow computing power currency eth through operation. the communication chain foundation will responsible for the operation this mechanism. asset purchase and anchorage the specific asset purchase and anchoring process follows: the spread chain foundation will take part newt's cooperation with major eth mines. mine users these mines use legal currency purchase eth calculations. the mining site selected part the miners eth users who intend cooperate. when the mine settled with these users, does not use eth for final settlement, but uses newt for settlement. these newts are provided the spread chain foundation the market trading eth currency into newt. order ensure that this mechanism operational, the spread chain foundation will, necessary, take part hold share the ethereum mine force the computational price relationship between eth and newt. market equilibrium transaction prices the price newt token determined the market. the participation all parties the chain communication buy and sell newt exchanges will eventually result market equilibrium which create near-perfect nash equilibrium for all deliverables and their services. encourage more people use newt for trading the spread chain foundation will help more third party developers asset issuers use newt for asset distribution and trading. for example, the communications chain foundation helping some users vending machines use newt recharge and purchase goods shenzhen, china; helping some micro- merchants chengdu, china replace their points system with more liquid newt. short, believe that content and content-appropriate goods and services can traded using newt, and newt type dissemination digital currency will more widely accepted the general public. official app: product introduction com mmunication chain offiicial app hhttp:// ne.wss focuseed providding mobilee end-users with secure

official launch the communication chain, the relevant applications the entire communication chain will receive million users and thus become global the largest number users the blockchain. investment value and market competition investment value the blockchain will surely lead the paradigmatic revolution economics. news chain (community chain), through the combination blockchain and content ecology, finds industry pain points, innovative financial models, and brings investors great returns. the content and service distribution market huge market. blockchain application with high frequency and wide audience. today's headline market value billion dollars using blockchain for value reconstruction, thoroughly subverting the content market, and establishing ecosystem that participants can benefit from effective content and effective traffic are transformed into digital assets for trading winding up. this blockchain application with extremely strong floorto-floor performance. competitors today's headlines today's headline china's most active content distribution application. the company's valuation has exceeded us$ billion. however, today's headline typical centralized application. all users' data the hands their company. today's headline uses this data the chips earn profits from advertisers. the end result that users generate traffic and users browse advertisements. however, users not receive any revenue. advertisers invest costs, but they can not avoid data fraud, traffic fraud and other drawbacks. news chain (propaganda chain) makes use the characteristics blockchains realize the return benefits users who create value for traffic. advertisers can directly deliver advertisements users without paying fees any intermediaries. the benefits watching advertisements are directly returned. give audiences ads while avoiding data fraud and traffic fraud. steemit steemit content community based blockchain technology that can provide benefits users and content creators. its tokens are rated weiss, wellknown authoritative rating agency (only digital currencies have this rating). the end this article, steemit's tokens have been worth $.. however, steemit only provides web version, and there smart recommendation algorithm actively push personalized content for users. result, all content mixed together. users need spend lot time searching for content that they are interested in, and steemit does not have serving system. cannot fully realize the value its platform. news chain (propagation chain), mobile app, naturally has larger user group, and uses its own algorithm actively push content that interest users, saving users lot time. addition, the advertising system provides advertisers with high-quality distribution channels and promotes the circulation newt within the system make more valuable. competitive strategy from media social media mentioned earlier, the communication chain not only stores content, users, and advertisements, but also precipitates user relationships, which provides the possibility for the development decentralized social network. users publish content, post comments, reply comments, like points the propagation chain ecology, and can follow their favorite authors, thereby forming interaction, and ultimately precipitated author-fan relationship. roadmap privatte equ uity soolution
