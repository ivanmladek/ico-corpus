intelligence, the internet things, blockchain, etc.), two important trends have been widely agreed: community: due the rapid spread the internet, large proportion the world's population, especially young people representing the future, are spending more and more time digital world. the same time, based different hobbies social backgrounds, many new social organizations have been formed, which call online communities, with sizes from several people millions. bitcoin was born from the community and evolved breed blockchain. and internet giants such facebook and tencent are also outcomes this big trend, well series recent new public companies around the community economy, such overstock, pdd, laix, yunji, etc. data: data has become core productivity. using the data, they controlled, google and facebook keep growing their quarterly advertising revenues rate not only monopolizing internet advertising, but also seriously eroding the market share the traditional advertising industry. moreover, prospect the future, the world's latest technologies like artificial intelligence are all relying heavily data, and thus data will only become even more and more important. this context, some new conflicts are beginning emerge: who can build and manage the community the future? does the future belong the small elite teams, teams with kol resources? should enable all good ideas and independent voices work with the communities much more easily? who will master, manage and leverage data the future? who should enjoy the value data? how can achieve fair value exchange between data producers and data consumers? these new emerging conflicts have seriously hindered the development, breakthrough and dissemination our new science and technology. for example, artificial intelligence has been very hot recent years, but the lack data becoming bottleneck for many individual researchers, institutions, university labs. today our data complete central monopoly: everyone the world could produce lot data every day, but they are all the hands big organizations. the result monopoly that technology development seriously hindered (like the slowdown deep learning recently years) and the well-being knowledge the world limited. the use blockchain technology allows knowledge and data recorded, transmitted and used more transparently and fairly. but unfortunately, blockchain limited only small number people. according the report huobi the number global bitcoin wallet addresses about million, and the number ethereum wallet addresses sbout million. the actual number blockchain adopters may only around million, who are almost all distributed among the communities chat ims and make less than the total population the world. jarvis+ focused community services and going build decentralized platform for social economies, which will address these conflicts the end. ensure the implementation and adoption, jarvis+ designed work two continuous stages: platform tools and services for blockchain and community economy simply introduction, this stage jarvis+ is: assistant for the blockchain communities, greatly reducing the community's creation, dissemination, growth, and management workloads, enabling each project individual embrace the great future the community economy; artificial intelligence (ai) natural language processing (nlp) knowledge graph (knowledge graph vault), easy use, complicated configuration, with the continuous use users, jarvis+ will become more and more accurate, more and more understand everyone and organization; important infrastructure blockchain communities, any community can leverage jarvis+ provide users with variety services any self-developed app natural language (e.g. voice, text); this stage, jarvis+ will work extensively with the blockchain communities and other internet projects which leverage community economy. will make jarvis+ partner with many projects possible and become standard configuration for social economy, jarvis+ could bring rich intelligent services and the best community roi. decentralized platform for community data and economy. based the community penetration and impact the previous stage, jarvis+ will begin provide services community members (individuals). this stage, jarvis+ will be: personal assistants for community users cross-communities cross-platforms. redefine the way users and blockchain interact that everyone can use natural language use blockchain technology and open economy any mainstream community software/app. the wonderful thing that this stage, user does not need "download" "install" jarvis+, jarvis+ already his/her community and already knows his/her interests and preferences. user can access and use jarvis+ any time when he/she has the need willing have try. decentralized community data platform. jarvis+'s bot technology can seamlessly embedded all major social platforms, jarvis+ can collect social data for users from their favorite software/apps (instead reinventing new social platform) and create decentralized social data platform directly from the "old world", allowing users own and manage the knowledge and data they have created; decentralized economy platform. data productivity and data can bring huge economic value. this economy platform will help users create more value for their knowledge and data. are not willing use the words "data market" "data mart" here, but rather "economy platform" because "sell data" may one the ways which user personal data can monetized but will never the healthiest. believe that the future the biggest gain that users receive from personal data will come from the "data economy", that is, the basis ensuring user privacy and ownership, users can authorize data party obtain services targeted his/her requirements without useless "bling-bling" features, get offers with affordable prices, and enjoy huge price cuts the service providers can also reduce lot user acquisition cost just examining the data and find out the suitable target users. believe this will ultimately achieve win-win situation for everyone the economy. the jarvis+ team formed mainly the and big data technology experts from world-class companies, like microsoft, the german institute for deep learning, alibaba, tencent and cisco, and has the interactive design experts from famous game companies. jarvis+'s name derives part from iron man's assistant j.a.r.v.i.s (jarvis): the film, the interaction between iron man and jarvis based natural language exactly what the team has been working for many years; the sign represents the project's value: "upgrade" and "connect." june cnbc reported that mastercard will invest heavily new projects: let people pay natural language via voice (https://www.cnbc.com////mastercard-looks-to-partnerwith- google-amazon-voice-assistants-for-payments.html). both the mastercard and jarvis+ have taken note the important opportunities and future trends natural language life (payment), but unlike mastercard's starting point manufacturing industry barriers and serving only their own interests, jarvis+ will serve the decentralized blockchain community. and hope achieve the following visions: intelligent, natural language processing (nlp) infused, which based artificial intelligence and deep learning, integrating intelligent translation and knowledge graph. able accurately understand user intent, respond timely and accurate manner, break through language barriers, and pursue the ultimate and natural user experience. diverse, which means freedom, which enables users freely choose social channels, languages and platforms the trading, minimizing restrictions and barriers trade. another meaning equality, the future, with more organizations and people joining the community, together with the rules development sustainable community, and the guidance community operations based the equality, that communities can evolve and sustainable development democratic, means the threshold low. everyone can freely choose their familiar social channels and create smart contract through natural language for doing fair, orderly and barrier-free trading. perpetual, decentralization through both the technology and operation sides, pursuiting the continuous and endless platform operation. the ultimate goal totally completes the decentralization from the infrastructure, operation model, the organization management. through technology and rules get rid the platform dependency these specific people and organizations, that empowers the community autonomy (dao) run forever. chapter background and mission background encouraging innovation bring more equitable society the driving force for sustained development human society. present, human society began enter the early stage intelligent economy, also known artificial intelligence and the internet era, whether company, even country can strong heavily relies its scientific and technical intensity and intelligent ability. yet the development and evolution artificial intelligence heavily dependent data, and whoever owns the data has the power form monopoly. today's internet platforms, internet leading enterprises, such the famous flag and bat, controlling most the user traffic and have large amount user data. which definitely has promoted the rapid development internet technology past years and made the big data technology used widely. the other hand, large internet enterprises can use the large amount user data and user traffic carry out detailed image analysis user behavior, using artificial intelligence methods variety application scenarios design and develop the value-maximized products and services, therefore attract and win more users and thereby defeat competitors. this has created facto internet monopoly. thus, the data owners are not the creators data, but are the world's giants, including: apple, google, amazon, facebook, microsoft, tencent, alibaba, and few others., whose combined market value nearly trillion u.s. dollars, twice times the gdp. because the internet breaks the geographical boundaries and allows information circulate easily and quickly, everyone logical the internet. however, due the serious delay the internet the standardized management information, these giants can become into the monopoly user traffic, data and knowledge. monopoly allow giants maximize benefits over the long term and create the digital divides that allow the value traffic and data flow through their own controlled systems, killing the threatening innovation the cradle. breaking the monopoly, that everyone can free innovation, and human society enjoys the great well-being brought about economic intelligence. community and community economy, consensus-driven form organization, breaking through the monopoly ecology form new ecology that breaks monopoly and rebuilds ecosystem for innovation. community economy based people's same needs and interests, with the investment certain amount time form people-centric new economic. the beginning the community economy, the management capacity the community formed self-motions low, the size and impact its economy far from that the existing internet economy. but because the community economy essentially allows producers and consumers work together, through common experience and sense, which enable users become the driving force for the best experience iteration the whole process. the community, natural language the most basic and natural way for people interact with each other. the multidimensional information composed human natural language the cornerstone social and human economic progress, data the original carrier information, individuals and organizations are the source data creation, the community effective form organization disseminate and generalize knowledge data, and more importantly, knowledge and data are the basic fuels needed the future economic intelligence process. mission the mission the project jarvis+ empower everyone and organizations the world, that users can masters their own data and knowledge, and can shared, exchanged and used fairly and equally order accelerate the development science and technology and bring universal well-being society, using the interaction natural languages embrace blockchain and the intelligent economy. when knowledge and data are fully respected and circulated, everyone can freely exchange value, then the giant bondage and inequality will eliminated eventually. everyone and every organization are free have more knowledge and data, which contribute artificial intelligence more intelligent and make the internet more dynamic and more inclusive. achieve this mission, the project jarvis+ will combine artificial intelligence and blockchain technology organically, easily embedded into the community and adopted into any scenario, revolutionizing existing patterns and experiences knowledge and data usage. there are two stages achieve this mission. the first stage, jarvis+ will intelligent tool and service platform help everyone and every organization serve the user community and allow knowledge and data precipitated and accumulated; the second stage, jarvis+ will provide decentralized economy platform that directly connects with users and allows knowledge and data have aggregation effect, serving intelligent economy. scenario the operation and growth blockchain communities any blockchain technology born the community, growing the community, and ultimately returns the community. the operation the community has thus become the biggest pain point for many pure technology blockchain teams: the one hand, takes lot time and effort get into community operations, which affects the development projects; the other hand, community management not something that many teams are good at. any negligence the service may eventually affect the project's acceptance the community. jarvis+'s conversation engine can support any social platform, any mainstream application, blockchain team just set some rules based jarvis+, early training personalized jarvis+ ai, you can quickly let lot community service work jarvis+ complete the team can spend more time focusing the progress and landing the project. the operation and growth sto community similar native blockchain projects, sto projects also need win community support achieve the ultimate success. most sto project come from the traditional industry the internet, and does not have the blockchain background, project starter owner won't have enough investments into community operation. the jarvis+ community assistants, and the toolchains for community growth and management, can definitely help these traditional projects embrace the blockchain economy more effectively. intelligent perception community engagement members the community come from all over the world, they are engaged together some discussions, and initiated new topics across diversified interests, even there are several topics ongoing for discussion the same time the community. thus, large amount data being generated, and records the multi-dimensional information about the community, such as: members' online length and activity, the hottest topics over period time, whether sensitive information appears the discussion, and variety time-long dimensions (day, month, etc.) data analysis. jarvis+, infused capabilities, combining big data analytics, and integrating business risk-control models, you can gain insight into the information the data the project community, which turn enables community operations intelligent for deep perception the community. gamification experience activating community members the community have the will interact more with other members understand the community, reach out the community, and increase trust the community; addition, members need gain the belonging the community, with recognition among members. through gamification, you can quickly remove the strangeness the community, find likeminded groups, enrich the dissemination project information. jarvis+ provides gameplay capabilities that can customize game contents, support ways for both single playing and group playing, and increase community activity. the transaction cryptocurrency and digital asset the blockchain technology accelerates the development crypto currency, the process encrypting digital currency transactions, the biggest challenge for new traders the high barriers entry, the need for considerable learning capabilities, professional knowledge, and the ability operate tools, making significant number new digital currency investors. very long period time, are still placing orders through friends around us; even for mature traders, due the variety crypto currencies and the differences rules each exchange, sometimes necessary use multiple applications, multiple trading platforms, and multiple instruments complete transactions between two cryptocurrency pairs; after the transaction completed and successful, because the blockchain takes time synchronize, the transaction results cannot obtained real time. anxious traders can only check the latest transaction status for certain period confirm the transaction successful. the jarvis+ platform provides the ability use voice dialogs user interface, which can easily and quickly integrated into the social platforms and mainstream applications that traders are most familiar with. traders only need use the human nature their own familiar language communication, can not only query the price cryptocurrency, also issue cryptocurrency transactions, access the transaction progress and results. blockchain infusing internet communities with the population smart devices, the community has become the core the internet. for example, facebook, wechat, and telegram have become the core applications for mobile internet all regions. members the community can participate community exchanges and discussions through cell phones computers anytime, anywhere. the community will also organize various offline communication activities from time time, such various sports events, life events, etc., and will also travel various star teams and individuals. therefore, the founders and operators the community can use the consensus mechanism based smart contracts make the economy within the community more prosperous. this already clear future direction. the jarvis+ platform can the integration within the internet community and provide the most natural interaction and transaction experience. for example, members the community can publish tasks any time through speech text, seek help, establish cooperation, and trade goods services. get some rewards. each member can use the natural language approach inquire about the types tasks currently cares about and wants trade, query the most motivating tasks, and then complete the task execution and transaction through natural language chapter overview jarvis+ platform architecture the infrastructure layer the jarvis+ platform the below. infrastructure "jarvis+ network" the jarvis+ architecture the "infrastructure" module, which will based the public cloud and public blockchain. the initial phase will deployed the microsoft public cloud azure and neo public chain platforms. our business expands and needs increase, will adopt 'multi-cloud multi-chain' approach support, maximize availability and stability, and pursue our vision "perpetual" from the infrastructure layer. the perpetual connector the infrastructure layer innovation jarvis+. through container technology, jarvis+ business logic can abstracted and run various operating systems, keeping the jarvis+ platform running forever. the same time, built the container service (jars) that supports automatic packing, self-healing, horizontal expansion, service discovery and load balancing, automatic roll-out and rollback, confidentiality and configuration management, storage business processes, etc., enabling creation and configuration. easier manage clusters that are preconfigured run containerized environments. turn, enterprise-class functions and security mechanisms public cloud platforms can fully utilized, and portability can still ensured, and blockchain-based public cloud services such storj can further supported the future. after containerization, the underlying services the x-contract platform are all microservices and can choose the appropriate development language database according their own business characteristics; only need install the runtime environment related the service; little dependence the deployment environment, microservice deployment failure will not affect other runtime services; the interface not adjusted, the basic will not affect other microservices, adding test, interface testing, low degree automation, small release regression, small scale automation services (test). jarvis+ container service will used schedule smart contract running environment, computing resources and smart contract running instances for micro-service, containerization and distributed smart contract running nodes ensure that the smart contract runs orderly, efficient and safe environment. the orchestration engine and corresponding monitoring means exist, the smart contract running instances can guaranteed restart any fatal assets time when the contract running. designed for multi-clouds running the x-contract platform optimizes the architecture for the critical abstractions the region (region) and available zone (az, availability zone) the infrastructure layer the public cloud platform. region: region the abstract ability public cloud platform provide services end users region. was designed primarily reduce network latency for services the cloud reach end users; comply with data and business service regulations different regions. available zone (az, availability zone): availability zone infrastructure area that physically isolated from each other, with networks, power, and other supplies isolated from each other. can simply understood the smallest unit cloud infrastructure availability assurance. availability zones are completely independent each other and not affect each other. important note that availability zone also abstraction, and not equivalent the data center (or physical room) being composed multiple data centers describe. general, single region for public cloud platform includes multiple availability zones make easier for users deploy their business across the availability zones achieve high available architecture, thereby ensuring constant flow services and business. cloud infrastructure providers guarantee that availability completely independent each other across multiple availability zones within each region (but there guarantee that there will service outages each availability zone). course, for user services run smoothly after deployment multiple availability zones, public cloud platforms guarantee very short network latency (typically less than ms) between multiple availability zones within region. this really limits the availability availability zones requiring that the physical distance between different availability zones within region not too long. can seen, availability zones are the basis for public cloud platforms with high availability and are designed serve the core cloud services. running decentralized jarvis+'s infrastructure layer consumes lot energy achieve "micro-services", "containerization", and support for variety cloud services architecture, essence, achieve "decentralized and sustainable operation." jarvis+ will running dapp and focus the application scenarios and business landing, serve the ecosystem public chains. the future, once the dapp proven and stable both business model and technology architecture, then jarvis+ will implement its own public chainbased dpos consensus, and grow our partners into the token economy. jarvis+ does not rely any particular cloud service operating environment. all computing storage resources required are provided super nodes. super nodes are elected according the dpos protocol. about jarvis+'s male/token design, please see chapter for details. the smart contract jarvis+ also uses blockchain its storage. the stream bytes after the smart contract serialized will stored the blockchain for perpetual storage. for single smart contract, each evolved version smart contract can published the blockchain. the decentralized smart contract running node, the smart contract data backed each other and the execution results are mutually verified. this not only guarantees the validity and correctness the data when the smart contract accesses the trusted data source, but also can realize the multi-instantiation the smart contract and ensure the permanence the smart contract. engine from top-down, the second layer jarvis+ architecture 'ai engine' layer, which responsible for converting the business and trading intents, expressed natural language the process human-machine interaction, into the smart contract the blockchains. the same time, the combination vision, speech recognition and other artificial intelligence technology supports the authentication, kyc, and other works ensure the compliance and security, while maximizing the experience user care. artificial intelligence and neural networks are not new concept. neural networks originated the the and neural network algorithms made many major breakthroughs. what was different from then was that today's computer scientists hold two super weapons their hands: extremely powerful computing power and huge amounts data, paving the way for neural networks, cambrian bioburden that can called deep learning. are still the early stages artificial intelligence-driven conversation platform, and objectively speaking, some the issues that find insurmountable today may resolved the coming years. are quickly demonstrating the world that users will able interact with artificial intelligence assistants for long-term and complex interactions. they can not only understand what the user wants say, but also understand the user's preferences and tailor the corresponding experience activities for the user. from technical point view, jarvis+ uses the industry's most advanced deep learning technology solve the application problems artificial intelligence, including natural language understanding, machine translation, knowledge graph, face recognition, speech recognition, and on. the overall structure follows: the analysis context language the essential characteristic that distinguishes human beings from other animals. all creatures, only human beings can speak natural language. all kinds human intelligence are closely related language. human logical thinking the form language, and the clear majority human knowledge recorded and passed down the form language and words. therefore, also important, even core part artificial intelligence. communicating with computers natural language long-standing pursuit. because has obvious practical significance, also has important theoretical significance: people can use the computer their most accustomed language, without having spend lot time and energy learn all kinds computer languages which are not very natural and habit, and people can learn more about human's language ability and intelligent mechanism. semantic perception and analysis also based industry-leading neural network technology, which divided into two parts: intention recognition and named entity recognition(ner) intention recognition one the basic mechanisms chatbots the use text classifiers for intent recognition. intent recognition actual the classification the user's sentences into the corresponding intent categories. give simple example, trader wants change neo gas, then this the preparation trading intentions. for example, trader wants check the price neo, then this intention query the currency price. there are three ways classifying text today: pattern matching, traditional algorithms, and neural networks. while the algorithm that uses traditional algorithms, known multinomial naive bayes, surprisingly effective, has three basic drawbacks: the output multinomial naive bayes algorithms score rather than probability. would prefer get probability ignore predictions below certain threshold. multinomial naive bayes algorithms can only learn from the classified samples, but also important learn from the negative sample samples. non-balanced training data will result number multinomial naive bayes classifier value distortion, forcing the algorithm different categories data sets adjust the size the score. we'll use layers neurons hidden layer) and "bag words" approach organizing our training data. english processing, the model uses ntlk for natural language processing. first you need reliably cut the sentence into words (tokenize) and stem extraction (stem), where each word converted lowercase, and the stem extracted. stem extraction can help the machine understand that have and having are the same. our training data transformed into "bag words" for each sentence. each training statement transformed into array only and and the member's ordinal corresponds the position the word the corpus. neural networks are also learning from the words that not match the thesaurus. the resulting text classifier can handle large amount intent and suitable for classifying limited large amounts training data. also easy add one more new intents the model. named entity recognition(ner) named entity recognition (ner) classic problem natural language processing and used wide variety applications, such identifying names sentence, place names, product names from e-commerce searches, drug names, etc. named entity recognition now used extract parameters from user input, such entering want trade neos for gas", which currency buy, and which currency sell. the traditionally accepted better processing algorithm conditional random field (crf). discriminating probability model. random field. often used label analyze sequence data, such natural language text biological sequences. simply put, used ner predict the label each word given series characteristics. the following figure: can regarded the corresponding characteristic each word sentence, and can regarded the label the corresponding word. the labels here are the currency type, the number coins and on. usually will take the characteristics the lexical, there are other tags and on, these characteristics need based different scenes artificial extraction, such the extraction human name feature often possible see the first word crf, etc. because traditional crfs rely heavily human-extracted features, the model depends largely feature extraction. currently x-contract uses the latest neural network technology help extract features, and bidirectional cyclic neural network (bi-rnn) condition random field (crf) currently used. bi-rnn can learn the corresponding characteristic function according the input training data, and crf uses these characteristic functions obtain the corresponding structure. the architecture below: the implementation the engine layer will iterative process. the same time, will start with specific transactional business scenarios, such cryptocurrency exchange the financial sector and internet community incentives. this way, the context can focused, and the uncontrollability context understanding brought the open chat can avoided, thereby enhancing the actual experience the user specific scenario. maintain fairness and openness, the jarvis+ platform will open its interface, allowing relevant third-party engines access back-end services, such exchange engines, game engines, and engines, while continuing evolve support more various business capabilities. knowledge graph the jarvis+ engine module, there also very important sub-module the knowledge graph (the "knowledge" module the architecture). the knowledge graph essentially semantic network, graph-based data structure consisting nodes and edges. the knowledge graph, each node represents "entity" that exists the real world, and each edge "relationship" between the entity and the entity. the knowledge graph the most efficient representation the relationship. layman's terms, the knowledge graph the ability link together all different kinds information network. the knowledge graph was first proposed google and divided into schema layer (concept) data layer (example). composed rdf triples the schema layer can also called ontology. the most basic ontology includes concept, concept level, attribute, attribute value type, relationship, relational domain concept set, and relational domain concept set. present, the establishment the knowledge graph usually adopts the combination topdown and bottom-up. the top-down approach pre-build the ontology through the ontology editor. the map pattern defines the domain, category (type), and topic (topic, entity). each field has number categories, each category contains multiple themes and associated with multiple attributes relations (properties), these attributes relations belong the category the subject need include properties and relationships. bottom-up way through all sorts extracting technology, especially through search and web log table extract found categories, attributes, and relationships, and the high degree confidence model merge into the knowledge graph. that extract relationships. the top-down approach helpful for extracting new instances and ensuring the quality extraction. the bottom-up approach can find new patterns. knowledge merging essential when knowledge acquired from multiple sources. consider issues such entity disambiguation (qiaodan), co-meaning digestion, etc. based large number user dialogue inputs and massive amounts internet data, the running process jarvis+ development process for building intelligent knowledge graph the blockchain investment domain. through opening data sources related users and then extracting the user's tags allows jarvis+ integrate the relevant information into structured knowledge graph, and the user service for the feature tagging will become more and more accurate. the conversation platform that jarvis+ wants build not limited natural language. the jarvis+ robot will have knowledge graph with blockchain world that can identify and advise users jarvis+ dialogues and transactions, which can enabled the broader scenarios such anti-fraud, smart search, intelligent question and answer, smart marketing, etc. channel app the channel and application level, the x-contract platform can integrated into any user channel, including facebook, skype, slack, mail, wechat, weibo, website pages, cryptocurrency wallet, etc., and even the enterprise applications. based these channels, buyers, sellers and service providers can conduct business across channels finance, games, retail, etc. well they can develop and grow their own ecosystem, which enabling them unleash business momentum. fact, wechat and facebook messenger have become absolute monopolies the applications different regions. the huge user base and social requirements all make the future messaging applications full imagination, and bot type robot) will become catalyst for the expansion messaging applications. whether platform china, government service singapore, british voice-based personal assistant, chat bots are taking over everything. the next generation user interfaces will not built quasi-physical designs confusing menus but will based the simplest conversations. from slack wechat, from kik facebook messenger, from telegram amazon alexa, chat bots are becoming the main interactive interface between humans and machines. jarvis+ uses the bot service connect various platforms, enabling users different platforms communicate and exchange with each other. whether skype wechat, you can use jarvis+'s services communicate and trade natural language. new smart contract created telegram can found and consumed facebook messenger. jarvis+ builds bot adapter connect various mainstream platforms, realize completely decentralized world, and achieve explosive development through massive user base. the decentralized smart economy established this will break the giant's monopoly advantage, and any giant will not able block the existence jarvis+ and ensure the continuous operation the service. language boundary genesis mentions the origins human multilingualism, and the complexity human languages becoming constraint the development the internet and the global economy. according ethnologue, there are now languages spoken around the world, but only about them are internet pages. even the official languages some countries, such hindi and swahili, are rarely included the internet. translation particularly important order facilitate communication between regions and enable people from all regions the world participate the smart digital economy built x-contract, which currently supports more than languages, covers global gdp, and enables cross-border, language-free dialogue and transactions. traditional translation algorithms are based smt technology, which has stagnated since performance improvements the mid-s and not particularly effective for chineseenglish translation. x-contract now uses industry-leading neural network (lstm) -based translation, which has led decade improved translation quality. neural network translation fundamentally performed differently from traditional smt translation. using neural network model, translation takes into account complete sentences, while smt technology considers only few words context. therefore, neural network translation will produce results that are more fluent and close human translation. based neural network-based training, each word encoded along -dimensional vector (a) indicate its unique characteristics, targeting specific language pairs (e.g. english and chinese). using language pairs for training, neural networks will customize what these dimensions should be. they can train simple concepts such gender (female, male, neutral), politeness level (slang, casual, written formal, etc.), type words well any derivative data nouns. the steps the neural network translation run follows: each word more specifically -dimensional vector represents it, passes through the first layer "neurons" and encodes -dimensional vector (b) representing the range other words the context sentence. once all words have been encoded these -dimensional vectors, the process repeated several times, each layer finely tunes the expression the word within the dimensional window only the translation attention layer (the software algorithm) will use this final output matrix and previously translated words determine which words from the source sentence should followed the final output matrix. will also use these calculations remove unnecessary words from the target language. the decoder (translation) layer converts the selected word (or more specifically the dimensional vector representing the complete sentence the word) its most appropriate target language equivalent. this output layer (c) then feeds back the attention layer calculate the next word that the source sentence should translate. shown above, the context-aware -dimensional model "the" encodesthenoun (house) french feminine word (la maison). this translates "the" appropriately "la" rather than "le" (singular, male) "les" (plural) when reaches the decoder (translation) level. note that the algorithm will also compute based previously translated (such "the" the image above), the next step the translation the word should the subject ("house") rather than adjective ("blue"). this can done because the system has learned the order words these sentences when converting english and french. the adjective "big" rather than adjective color, should not reversed ("the great house" "la grande maison"). the final translation result based neural network algorithm most cases more fluent and closer human translation than that based smt. believe that cross-border, language-free communication will contribute the prosperity jarvis+'s smart economy. with the increase platform ecosystem partners and continuous precipitation data, there will more business opportunities the platform, such searchbased recommendation-based advertising systems, credit collection systems, and investment and financial management. so, jarvis+ business platform based completely new experience, fully distributed, and diversified business philosophy. compared with the traditional platform, more revolutionary and open. open platform jarvis+ provides open, complete and secure open platform help ecosystem blockchain solution developers, exchanges and platforms, industry solution providers, channel and application developers, community partners, and more quickly integrate the ability transact conversations smart contracts across public blockchains. jarvis+ provides tools, documentation, and code samples, and all the code runs the cloud, ensuring services run demand, anytime, anywhere, and forever. the capabilities the jarvis+ open platform include: multi-factor login, authentication, kyc and authorization nlp-based smart contract query, establishment and transaction smart contract triggering, conversion and execution cross blockchains cooperative channels and applications self-service access third-party engine tools and community access rich business scenarios and voting mechanism templates decentralized marketplace the top layer the architecture the data consumer the jarvis+ economic system, and the data consumer pays the jar get the capabilities and solutions the jarvis+ network. jarvis+ will build decentralized marketplace break the monopoly and build more equitable world. everyone (both individuals and organizations) financially motivated provide personal and professional data. know more about sharing sensitive data (expenditure, health information) when know that this data can secure and secure (through decentralization and secure computing). compared with those mastered gafa, time goes by, the market will accumulate more and more data, and the quality the data will higher and higher. based this data, machine learning experts are motivated compete, and the best performing models will receive disproportionate returns. the data provider (ordinary user) and the data processing party will receive the jar reward. decentralized data the ai-centric world, users always provide their own private data, behavioral data, etc. large companies for free. want enable users control all their data, their own hands, ensure that any data provided individuals and companies stored and processed completely private manner, and when large companies use the data, they need the data provider provides the jar pay. jarvis+ uses the encryption economy motivate users participate the provision and generation integrated data. the jarvis+ network, the security and motivation all data provider data guaranteed. decentralized model the user's metadata invaluable low value most cases. only the marking becomes training data input into the model. training model high-value product. the previous model was mainly provided jarvis+, the main service provider that helps users (sellers) process data, become community solutions, and sell companies (buyers). later, jarvis+ inspires more third parties through jars become service providers competing this market provide the best machine learning model, while the entire system operates self-reinforcing network, attracting more and more participants and creating getting better and better ai. many third parties can process data into variety labeled data, variety models, and even solutions variety industries. decentralized computing many recent great advancements have been driven the massive increase computing power, which both result better utilization existing hardware and the development new high-performance hardware specifically for ai. the main computing power the early stage was mainly provided jarvis+. later, jar was used inspire more third parties become service providers, providing computing power help train the data the jarvis+ network into model. creating decentralized economy, jarvis+ achieves the tokenization the artificial intelligence economy, that everyone can enjoy the value the artificial intelligence economy. chapter building apps jarvis+ platform based the infrastructure jarvis+ platform, series exciting blockchain innovations can built. these applications may developed ecosystem partners the jarvis+ team itself. due space limitations, the following list only some innovative applications examples. the conversion various smart contracts smart contract agreement that can automate tasks that would otherwise require manual effort. the benefits smart contract are: reduced manual intervention the execution the agreement, automatic execution the trader's undertaking, exemption from third-party intervention, precise execution conditions, and predictable execution results. contract conversion set commitments made the trader, that is, the rights and obligations agreed the contract participant are translated into numerical process that the computer can recognize and execute. smart contract conversation jarvis+ conversion refers the use the natural language the trader understand the trader's claims through semantic recognition, translate the trader's claims into intelligent contract execution scripts, and ultimately convert the smart contract execution scripts into byte streams that the computer can recognize and execute and store blockchain. there are three key components smart contract: the transactional input, the performance condition, and the transactional output. trader input refers the transactional demand, the assets the transacting party, and the performance condition expected the transacting party. trader's assets are those that can manipulated the smart contract. these assets will temporarily kept the smart contract the account. the expected performance conditions the trader will translated into the execution script the smart contract. jarvis+ understands the trader's desired trading conditions through semantic recognition and converts the trader's expected trading conditions into computer-recognized scripting language for the execution the smart contract through the smart contract generation engine. the performance conditions, which are converted from the desired trading conditions entered the trading party, are precise and precise. the performance conditions will described jarvis+ scripting language that can understood both the trading party and the computer. the traders can understand the scripting language which the smart contract can executed. important for the traders eliminate misunderstandings among themselves and ensure that the integrity the intelligent contract. transaction output, that is, the result the execution the smart contract according the performance conditions, that is, the transfer the smart contract the asset. the execution result the smart contract will recorded the blockchain, complete the execution the entire smart contract. efficiency the conversion present, the writing smart contracts mainly relies popular professional programming languages. for example, neo's smart contracts rely popular computer programming language the industry. ethereum invented the private smart contract programming language solidity, etc. for traders, these languages are difficult understand, which difficult for them understand that the terms performance smart contracts are not conducive the principle transparency smart contracts the time. the future, jarvis+ will use the scripting languages such like python javascript build smart contract. these scripting languages are popular, simple syntax, and have large audience. the authoritative survey the tiobe website, python language ranked fifth and javascript ranked eighth, which greatly facilitates the development and promotion smart contracts the future. security present, smart contract execution mainly done the consensus node blockchain. however, there effective mechanism constrain the code smart contract. although the development blockchain technology still its infancy, from the perspective the future, very likely that virus program based smart contract will execute the consensus node blockchain the form smart contract, thus achieving the purpose destroying the whole blockchain. jarvis+'s smart contract execution engine will use sandbox technology isolate each instance smart contract and impose limited resource usage conditions. this has the advantage that the smart contract code running the sandbox isolated from each other. once issue occurs the execution smart contract code, will not affect the execution and performance another smart contract code running the sandbox. jarvis+ will fully implement the signature system the smart contract script code, sign the smart contract with the private key associated with the smart contract developer's address, prevent the script code executed the smart contract from being tampered with the future, and guarantee the fairness the smart contract performance. multi public blockchains supported unlike the current smart contracts, which can only executed their respective blockchain infrastructure, jarvis+ committed the performance and enforcement smart contracts across multiple public chains the future. jarvis+ will serve standalone saas paas platform for developers and traders the future. therefore, jarvis+ will interface with the industry's mainstream shared chains support the flow assets across different public chains. the kyc multi-factors authentication kyc (know your customer) important part the transaction, the current kyc process cumbersome and lengthy, and requires lot manpower identify the user submitted materials. x-contract will use the power artificial intelligence provide efficient and safe kyc programs, the full use human face recognition, voice fingerprinting, equipment fingerprinting and other artificial intelligence technology enhance the accuracy customer information better optimize the overall level artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence identify the risk. face recognition vivo detection the current x-contract face recognition algorithm based the latest convolutional neural network technology (cnn), the model based the resnet (real neural network), and some adjustments have been made. the addition residuals the resnet solves the problem that neural network layers cannot trained deeper level. the network, which borrows the higway network's input and output, optimized layer the original hi-x output. order prevent malicious forgery and steal other people's biological characteristics used for identity authentication, biometric systems must have live detection function, namely judge whether the biological characteristics the submitted from life individuals. general biological characteristics vivo detection technology use people's physical characteristics, such living fingerprint detection can based the fingers the information such temperature, perspiration, conductivity, live face detection can based the movement the head, breathing, information such the red eye effect, live iris detection can based the iris vibration characteristics, eyelash and eyelid motion information, the pupil contraction expansion reaction characteristics visible light source intensity, etc. with mature facial recognition technology, commercial application more widely, however, face replicate with photos, video, etc, thus legitimate users face counterfeit one the most important threat face recognition and security authentication system. present, have made some progress living detection methods based dynamic video face detection, face blinking, thermal infrared and visible face association. present, the method instruction action used, such the face left, right turn, gaping mouth, wink, etc., and the instruction matching error considered fake cheat. face recognition extracts the location the relevant feature points and detects the changes feature points through the command action realize the detection living bodies. voiceprint recognition everyone has unique voice, sounds look very simply, but contains wealth information, such language type, accent, content, gender, age, emotion and other information. x-contract combines voiceprint recognition and speech recognition applications identify not only the identity, but also identify the content. the current industry commonly used methods include template matching method, recent methods, neural network method enhance the depth user identification, the use neural network authentication, greatly reduce the risk factor, the risk intelligent user identification. knowledge graph based risk management the knowledge graph established x-contract will able identify the fraud risks related the account, such account embezzlement and garbage registration. including registration, login, transaction, transfer and other business links. depending the scenario, the risk score threshold that triggers the secondary validation will also different. intelligent multi-factor authentication can balance system security and user experience. the one hand, improves system security introducing the latest intelligent authentication technology. the other hand, through risk assessment, these authentication links can only triggered when necessary, which greatly avoids the intrusion authentication methods users. anti-fraud anti-fraud very important link the risk control blockchain finance. the core anti-fraud the people. jarvis+ integrates related information into structured knowledge map opening the user-related data source and then extracting the user's feature tag. among them, not only the basic information the user can recorded, but also the consumer's daily life consumption records, behavior records, relationship information, and online browsing records can integrated into the knowledge map. this basis, the user's risk analyzed and evaluated resist the risks the transaction. jarvis+ builds comprehensive understanding the statistical analysis user risk data building map known major fraud factors (such message platform ids, mobile phones, devices, accounts, and geographies, etc.), and responds potential fraudulent actions timely manner. course, this requires that all kinds information the user can obtained all directions, and machine learning and natural language processing techniques can used extract data conforming the map specifications from the data. compared with the identification false identities, the discovery group fraud more difficult. general, group fraud often hidden very complex network relationships and difficult identify. only sorting out the network hidden relationships, possible analyze the potential risks. using the vast amount data accumulated jarvis+ knowledge maps, developers can implement risk-control anti-fraud applications that facilitate analysis and prevent group fraud. smart investment advisor jarvis+ currently collects data from about few hundred companies the blockchain field the platform. the data divided into three types. the first the basic data the company, including the data the supplier, the founder, the descriptive data the company, and the label the company. the second piece jarvis+'s efforts collate and analyze some the company's data the internet collaborating with partners. there also piece information pan-sex sentiment, such recruitment, search popularity, salary levels, and staff turnover. developers can integrate this information into the knowledge map, provide users with relevant investment advice, and implement smart investment advice applications, such whether buy currency. precision marketing jarvis+ combines multiple data sources analyze relationships between entities better understand user behavior. for example, you can discover the common preferences organization, that you can have targeted marketing strategy for certain group people. jarvis+ can help companies better and deeper understand the needs users, help companies better marketing, develop marketing tools for the crowd. smart q&a jarvis+ implements intelligent automatic question answering system through knowledge graph. jarvis+'s knowledge graph engine can understand entities and their attributes involved user statements and the semantic information corresponding the query. through efficient graph search, subgraphs connecting these entities and attributes are searched the knowledge graph and converted into corresponding graph queries. these translated graph queries are further submitted the graph database for answers and the corresponding answers are returned. chapter x-contract foundation establishment the x-contract foundation x-contract foundation was established singapore. the main mission the foundation develop and operate the jarvis+ platform open, impartial and transparent manner, not for profit, and support the development team jarvis+. the x-contract foundation approved the acra, regulated the singapore companies authority and comprised independent board trustees. known for its stable and sound legal and

service principle nlp data marketplace eco partner program continuously development chapter the smart economy based jarvis+ coin introduction jarvis+ token economy there are two stages designed for the jarvis+ token economy: business landing, the development intelligent community platform including dapp service smart assistant. this stage focuses implementing the capabilities, tool chains for community, scenario business solutions, and others. with more and more blockchain community use the intelligent community platform and realize their business goals, then more and more knowledge and data will accumulated the community, and the demands community will met with democratized way. then jarvis+ will infused into token economy. economy platform, the implementation decentralized economy platform and dual native tokens. once the goals the first stage achieved, jarvis+ will provide decentralized economy platform, through involving partners, channels, consumers and providers, and then everyone the community can become the real owner their knowledge and data, the value which can exchanged decentralized marketplace cross multi popular channels. the same time, jarvis+ will use duel tokens model grow the value and circulation, and build the mutual benefit with partners through voting mechanism token economy. this chapter will feature the ultimate jarvis+ token economy, two kinds native tokens the jarvis+ economy: and. the first stage, jarvis+ coins (abbreviated jar) the only token for both governing (e.g. adjusting jarvis+ parameters) and consuming (jar will consumed when jarvis+ services are being used). the smallest unit jar with total amount million tokens (,,). the second stage, jar will focused governing. jar used manage the authority the jarvis+ economy system. the management authority includes voting for accountants and adjusting jarvis+ parameters. that time the new jarvis+ main net will use delegated proof stake (dpos), giving advantage over bitcoin, which uses proof work (pow), which suffers from high cost and low efficiency. moreover, are planning introduce jarvis+ gas (abbreviated jpg) the fuel token the second stage, with total amount million (,,). jpg used control the resources when that are used ecosystem. jpg powers the service fee during the token transferring, and the operation and storage the smart contract, order incentivize economic activity and prevent the abuse resources. the smallest unit jpg the purpose introducing jpg avoid potential conflicts between the overall ecosystem value (jar) and the cost use (jpg) jarvis+. addition, jpg also brings benefits jar holders, which thus further encourages users hold jar. the first stage jarvis+ quite simple, will only introduce the future ecosystem designed for the second stage the following paragraphs, which the ultimate jarvis+ economy. witness mechanism jar's witness node collects transactions and bundles them into block, and then broadcasts them the network. the witness's role similar the role miners the bitcoin ecosystem. every user the jarvis+ ecosystem can vote for any number nodes, and when any node obtains more than all votes (the jar proportion the total ecosystem), eligible witness node generate the blocks and compensated accordingly. the witness node list will updated after the tally counted the end each maintenance cycle day). each witness node takes turns generate blocks. multiple witness nodes can run different countries, using several types servers devices, which can mitigate ddos attacks and improve block efficiency. voting mechanism users can vote every aspect the jarvis+ ecosystem, not just the selection witness nodes. most the network parameters can adjusted voting, from cost formulation new business scenario templates. users can even vote for their representatives vote for them, proxy vote. this ensures that everyone the ecosystem has the right elect someone represent them and their interests. the right participate the ballot jar. jar distribution ratio jar will distributed four ways: community sponsors: maximum jar will incentive the sponsors who the financial contribution the various stages. community operation: jarvis+ communities and operations are used for marketing, business development, legal compliance, etc., encourage the sustainable growth the community and ecosystem. this part jar will calculated the first on-line exchange date, after months, years three phases unlock one issue per year, total not more than jar. partner: expert consultants artificial intelligence and industry partners will allocated jar. team: the core jarvis+ team will unlock maximum the jar. will unlocked quarterly over the course three years. jpg distribution jpg generated with each new block created only after jar converted global assets. the initial total jpg zero, and gradually increases with the formation each new block. each block jarvis+ created intervals seconds, roughly million blocks year. after about years, the total number jpg will reach amount million. the first year million blocks), each block will generate approximately jpg; the second year million blocks), each block will generate jpg. the number jpg generated each block will decrease jpg annually until the year, when only jpg will generated each block. this point, each block will generate jpg until the million block generated the year. when the total number jpg reaches million, new blocks and new jpg will longer generated. according this distribution curve, jpg will generated the first year, jpg will generated the first four years, and jpg will generated years. according jar's holding ratio, jpg will recorded with corresponding address. jar holders can initiate claim transaction any time and claim the jpg jar's address. the roles token ecosystem the following roles will apply the jarvis+ token system: the x-contract foundation will work grow the ecosystem token administrator. customers, the end users, are producing and consuming the knowledge and data. providers, service vendors, are consuming the knowledge and data. ecosystem partners will include ecosystem-services companies, business advisory teams, the developer community, social app partners, etc. currency exchanges will include cryptocurrency exchanges, otc platforms and other exchange providers. investors will include cornerstone investors, private equity, and other investors holding tokens. the use token the current first stage, jarvis+ primarily serves blockchain (and smes) communities and receives service fee (including btc, eth, cash, other tradable tokens) which will used repurchase jars from the open market. the jar from the repurchase will locked for months, and then the community will vote whether destroy, redistribute these jars kind rewards jarvis+ ecosystem contributors and supporters. after entering the second stage, beside the "service fee" the first stage, jar will also become the default currency for the community data marketplace. when the data consumer requests the data, when the data consumer issues offer the data provider, the payment flow and consumption process will use and consume the jar. like the first stage, data consumers are free use btc, eth, cash, other tradable tokens pay, and then the payment gateway will repurchase the jar from the open market. most jars will reward data provider(s), and the rest will locked for months for the usage community consumption. the community will vote whether destroy, redistribute these jars jarvis+ ecosystem contributors and supporters. the future, when jarvis+ implements ddpos and jpg (jarvis+ gas), jar will also used participate the voting and management the jarvis+ ecosystem, including the creation scenario template, the generation witness nodes, and parameter voting, etc. jar will distributed investors, advisers, community volunteers, partners, witness node founders, and other people who benefit from contracts created using jarvis+. since this point, jpg will sued for most the service consumption functions, which ensures that jar has investment value and jpg has the use circulation value. token empowering smart economy the global economy, small and medium-sized enterprises have disadvantages compared large enterprises with vast resources. large enterprises can use their own brand advantages, financial strength and operating scale order act monopolistically. they can squeeze out their smaller competitors providing high salaries poach the core teams smes, buy out competitors, copy their rivals' products. however, smes employ vast numbers workers and are the source key innovations business and technology. the internet has come important crossroads: leading towards centralization? towards equal interconnection, the original goal the internet? believe that most people desire the latter but have been struggling find way. the jar and jpg blockchain based decentralization concepts that use pass proof build sustainable token economy. tokens, virtual good with cryptographic assurances, traceability, and auditing features means cannot forged, altered, double spent. jarvis+ allows smes adopt artificial intelligence techniques place transactions using dialogue such voice, language, and text. jarvis+ gives smes the power sell products and services customers using tokens conveniently without the need for program developers. this lowers barriers participate the token economy and increases the potential ecosystem. smes have immense potential participate the token economy. free from the influences giant monopolies, they can use transform their business and create new business models, reconstruct their original business model. since tokens can transferred, circulated, and used store value, its value derived from the value enterprise's products and service. with low-cost artificial intelligence interaction (ui), tokens can expand the power the enduser and lower the cost participating the token economy, circumventing monopolies and their hold traditional economies. the same time, the role jarvis+ the smart economy different from traditional equity business entity. block chain and tokens work bridge and use mathematical means allow parties transaction cooperate beyond one-time deal. with mutual benefit and trust mechanism, parties can reach consensus among each other order achieve optimal economic models that increase efficiency over time. the growth ecosystem stage one the first stage building the jarvis+ platform ecosystem, reduce barriers for using intelligent economy introducing artificial intelligence technology certain use cases. smes joining the ecosystem the initial stages can expand their businesses new consumers and gain advantage over their peers operating traditional channels. also the more continuous accumulation knowledge and data, the more innovation new business. stage two stage two, will disrupt traditional business models building decentralized economy and marketplace penetrate traditional industries low cost. with initial user base developed and the knowledge and data accumulated stage one, will use basic system mutual trust (block chains and tokens) increase efficiency, help smes develop closer relationships with end users and exchange the values, and share the benefits built the jarvis+ token economy. chapter jarvis+ coin offering the plan initial coin offering with maximum distribution more than jar. the anchor round opens investors who have been invited, and will offer more than million jar, about the total amount. this round, the investors can join the jarvis+ foundation for deeper involvement with the operation the jarvis+ ecosystem. the jar the anchor round will need locked and unlocked -year installments. private placement offers more than million jar the form limited minimum investment thresholds, about the total amount. risk disclosure investor information usa residents
