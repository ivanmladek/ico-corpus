revolutionize cell phone industry with blockchain technology! technology moves incredible pace. twenty years ago, barely any could imagine the world live today. but some visionaries eventually saw the world using the internet for buying products and interacting with others. the skeptics, however, predicted that the internet was too complex, and was for scientists and geeks. oft-overlooked catalyst the technological work live today the smartphone. the advent the smartphone changed everything: walk around with small super-computers our pockets, with access all human knowledge our fingertips. can book vacation, make free voice and video calls over data, order pizza, get professional consultation, and everything between. technological leaps this magnitude come various ways and only arise every decade so. the world wide web was the 's, then were shaped the advent the smartphone and slowly moving from web economy app economy. the blockchain the next disrupter, perhaps disruptive the smartphone was more than ten years ago--and the process disrupting everything from food safety banking voting systems. with the blockchain, organizations are either excited the infinite potential, worried about their market share. are happy the former camp, looking ahead this technology's amazing potential reshape our world. mobilink set disrupt both the mobile advertising and telecommunications industries using blockchain technology, allowing consumers use their phones and roam seamlessly around the world cost, while offering advertisers opportunity get better return-on-investment for their dollars. the current status-quo that there are two large companies who control the bulk mobile advertising and the process they have made the end-user the product. telecommunications, large organizations still control significant portion the market and have shifted from charging for sms messages charging exorbitant roaming costs and subjecting users unnecessary data caps. want change the status-quo the advertising and telecommunications industries the time has come disrupt them. our mission catalyst positive change these industries, while allowing the end-user benefit providing unlimited talk, data, and text anywhere the world. will also give mobilink sim card users the potential earn monthly revenue sharing some the advertising wealth generated with the end-user. company information mobilink coin: based manilla, the philippines: ico manager, promoter and creator. responsible for fundraising, marketing, and token issuance once ico complete. this entity will develop the mobile applications and advertising exchange platform. mobilink network: based ontario canada, actively working developing the network and distribution mechanisms globally for any mobilink sim card user. mobilink network has clients already beta test mode, and global distribution network across most major cities north america and europe. mobilink network has committed sales volume over million sim cards for the next months via established worldwide distributors. mobilink.io whitepaper current state the telecom industry the telecom industry has been consistently growing over the last decade while trying cope with the explosion data usage. users the are looking their mobile phones more than billion times day. smartphone penetration growing faster than ever, even with the older age groups which have been slow adopt the technology. telecommunication the backbone every single form voice and data transmission which includes but not limited the internet, voice communication and broadcasting. one the largest industries the world, with annual revenues exceeding trillion dollars. there are almost billion smartphone users and over billion smartphones circulation today worldwide that use voice, text and data. the need for better, more reliable services puts huge strain capital expenditures most processes are still performed manually and setting new infrastructure extremely expensive. blockchain technologies bring many solutions the table: identity management and fraud detection fraud detection important most industries and global telecommunications exception. the current annual cost for fraud the industry billion and top mind for telecommunications providers find reliable solutions establish identity. roaming fraud occurs because there are inefficiencies the systems interlinking the providers. with the blockchain, simple smart contract deployment can help establish trust relationship between the user and the network, instantly validating their roaming rights and ensuring the provider gets paid. cost reduction through automation roaming consists using mobile phone different carrier than the one the user registered with, usually different country. once the identity the user confirmed, roaming goes through validation process between different carriers, usually involving multiple third-parties. with the blockchain, carriers may able automate and simplify functions like roaming, without involving multiple third parties verify identity and validate roaming rights. this allows the provider offer faster, more reliable service the user while reducing costs. enabling micro-transactions for digital assets perhaps the most audacious and most disruptive thing that blockchain can bring the telecom world help enable micro-transactions for the purchase digital assets. the blockchain and crypto-currencies allow for almost instantaneous payments any size with very low transactional fees. this would cut out another middle man (banks and credit card processors) while allowing users benefit from global economy for digital assets like video games, rewards points, music and movies. current state mobile digital advertising digital advertising billion global industry with relatively few players. more specifically, mobile advertising controlled facebook and google they own more than the market (according the most conservative estimates). this leaves little room for smaller competing advertising firms, and allows the two large players dictate the pricing. the blockchain has already started disrupting the advertising market helps solve multitude problems and opens new possibilities the same time. currently, advertisers collect money from those who want advertise and send ads the eventual consumer. this has been the only viable option, but comes with host issues that need solved. mobilink.io whitepaper simplifying the process the current process too complex and companies not always get what they pay for. some organizations have started cut out the middleman directly build their own advertising exchanges. the blockchain will help enhance this process, adding more transparency and eventually eliminating the buying process all together--allowing the advertiser pay the end-user directly view ads. trust, trust, trust once data enters the blockchain, can never changed, and since there central entity controlling the blockchain, immutability guaranteed. the advertising industry plagued fake profiles, artificial impressions, fake clicks and fake followers instagram and twitter. advertising fraud set cost the industry almost billion with the blockchain, companies can make sure real user looking their ad, and the data can never manipulated hackers and fraudsters. allowing the user benefit once trust established, the blockchain may end disrupting the system completely--allowing the consumer verify their identity directly the product being advertised and setting their own advertising preferences. this completely removes the need for middle man, and allows the user benefit either being directly paid view ads, use the advertising revenue they generate pay for service. blockchain technologies for telecom and advertising mobilink.io whitepaper advertisers and telecom providers spend very large amounts money establish trust and identification usually with the help more than one third party. global roaming agreements are example such process. with digital distributed ledger and trustless structure, the blockchain can help eliminate most, not all third parties. and irreversible and auditable, the blockchain provides advertisers what they have been looking for: simple inexpensive way make sure that they are interacting with person the other side, and not advanced program building fake profiles and getting fake impressions. using the blockchain telecom environment for creating and performing authentication: mobilink.io whitepaper introduction mobilink the blockchain set disrupt the telecom and advertising industries significantly. discussed above, many blockchain technologies will give the user more power, either selecting the ads they view paying
