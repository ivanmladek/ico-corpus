develops the first blockchain solution for the global dental industry. driven vast community progressive dentists, software developers and marketing specialists, the foundation has managed create new dental ecosystem which favors all industry stakeholders: patients, dentists, manufacturers, suppliers, labs, insurance companies. through common, industry-specific cryptocurrency dentacoin (dcn) and several blockchain-based software tools, all market participants are securely interconnected, empowered efficiently exchange information and values. the core purpose the foundation improve long-term health, reduce costs and pain, and continuously support the growth the value the dcn currency. dentacoin develops the dental industry well creates market intelligence through cryptocurrency reward system that inspires participation throughout the community. looking forward, dentacoin expects the platform drastically improve dental health and hygiene habits, thus improving the quality life for individuals resulting improved overall health and increased longevity. introduction the purpose this paper thoroughly explain new conceptual framework used within the dental industry for organizational purposes. through the utilization recent technological innovations, have created model with the ability overcome the majority the dental industries' major constraints and furthermore, proposes various measures that will significantly improve the efficiency dental practice thus improving the patients' level dental well-being. dentacoin strives create dental industry community rewarding people -who provide valuable contributions- with crypto currency. through this reward system, the foundation will see rise currency that will able reach broad market, including vast number people who have yet participate any cryptocurrency economy. according harvard business review: "to protect the blockchain vision from political pressure and regulatory interference, blockchain networks rely decentralized infrastructure that can't controlled any one person group." the integration blockchain and dentistry extraordinary concept; one that requires the creation community which transparency and shared responsibility can take place. mission statement the dentacoin foundations' core missions are improve the quality dental care worldwide, reduce treatment costs and create dental community. the dentacoin token was created help assist the dentacoin foundation with the above mentioned missions giving power the people. dentacoin focuses developing number tools, each one targeting different sector the dental industry. individuals who use and implement these tools will receive dentacoin tokens reward, which they can later use pay for their dental treatment purchase dental products. the goal not compete with other cryptocurrencies, but rather provide solution and support for the healthcare industry through blockchain. the dentacoin foundation interested evaluating the actual substance and value that can created with coin (dentacoin) that represents the health all individuals. dentacoin will both fin tech and logistic platform the global dental industry. the foundation's exact contribution erc coins (dentacoins) used for dental projects will provided later the whitepaper. core objectives all service industries aiming long-term success are driven their customers' feedback. the healthcare industry exception. regulatory authority, central institution, powerful organization individual could control the industry better than the patient community. people trust people, thus there nothing more valuable the industry players than constant, trustworthy feedback from the patients. however, community needs exist for this achieved and this where dentacoin steps in. dentacoin emphasizes the industry's challenges and reveals the solutions for increasing the dental practice's efficiency. implementing blockchain based industrial cryptocurrency can incentivize the industry solving the majority the existing and future constraints. below are the phases implementation each with its own milestones, goals, and focus. project development phases phase blockchain-based trusted review platform through creating and implementing the first blockchain-based platform for trusted dental treatment reviews, the dentacoin foundation will allow patients voices heard and dentists will have access up-to-date, extremely valuable market research data and qualified patient feedback the most powerful tool improve service quality and establish loyal patient base. through self- executing smart contract, the dentacoin review platform will assure optimal autonomy, trust, speed, and safety thus mitigating any risks connection with manipulations. the brand new, blockchain-based feedback system (smart contract) will trigger dynamic movement patients and dentists open dcn wallets. there will dentacoin community that will create the prerequisites for the future steps that will taken penetrate the global market and will provide valuable market research results. this moment time, dentacoins' developers are working the frontend, the address database and the smart contract. this platform already presented the market despite the fact that the ico only takes place october once the ico begins the market offensive strategies and the advertising campaigns for the global expansion will implemented and create rapid growing community patients and dentists. benefits: transparent reviews once the blockchain, reviews cannot modified manipulated permanent data storage market research value patients will have access the rating and reviews each dentist and can base their decision which dentist the provided information. patients will have the option speak out and present their opinions. dentacoin (dcn) will diversely distributed. every single review rewarded from the foundation subject the foundation having stock dcns. the creation closed economic system the basic idea provide and maintain decentralized review platform based ethereum smart contracts. this website rewards high quality "patient reviews" and "market research surveys" with dentacoin. the incentive structure has strong influence the quality dental treatments and increases the mutual responsibility between dentists and patients. the review project will the first major milestone dentacoins' roadmap the future dentistry. dentacoin's own research and experience dental business teaches one important need that concerns dentists worldwide: the need build strong relationships with clients and gaining valuable feedback /market research data enhance their treatment plans and communications. the other hand, patients lack reliable source where different dentists can compared means their rating and reviews well the possibility give anonymous and unfiltered feedback when sharing their thoughts and opinions. through the platform, patients will able find specific dentists order write anonymous review. each survey will linked the ethereum blockchain and paid for dentacoin smart contract. return, the earned amount can used pay for part the further treatments one our partner dentists/clinics. providing ways earn and spend dentacoin, the dental currency will distributed throughout the industry. furthermore: dentacoin collects important knowledge the industry and makes available all dentists and patients, thus allowing dentists and patients form strong communities around the world and build upon mutual interest. preliminary test campaigns signalled strong demand towards the trusted review platform. next step: trusted reviews order provide trust worthier customer reviews, dentacoin will implement new notion "trusted reviews", thus the review platform will have both standard reviews and trusted reviews. standard reviews, which can written anyone and trusted reviews, which can only written actual patients. ensure that reviewer writes the feedback based prior treatment, each partner dentist will ask for the patients' e-mail address the medical office and right before each treatment, the patient will get email containing review request link. this link then leads reviews.dentacoin.com, where the review form marked trusted and linked the dentist/dental team question. trusted reviews are rewarded with higher amount dentacoin (dcn) than standard review. these trusted reviews would seen highly beneficial the dentist and the industry will lead increase trust gained and reviews higher quality and reliability standard which would result more valuable market research data. the community will benefit from these trusted reviews due the fact that the reviews are higher quality and reliability, which accomplishes objective reference each dentist's services, thus rendering them comparable. due the transparent, incentive-based and censorship resistant nature the blockchain based solution, dentacoin will create extremely well functional review and market research system that will accessible reviews.dentacoin.com for all contributors. phase ii: dentacare mobile app and dentavox opinion platform "repetition the same thought physical action develops into habit which, repeated frequently enough, becomes automatic reflex." norman vincent peale dentacare mobile app aims form long-lasting dental care habits through intensive -month program engaging gamified environment. through reminders, notifications, voice navigation and tutorials, users will taught how improve their dental hygiene and thus, form healthy habits. the app educates users how brush, floss, rinse properly and advises them further how take proper care their teeth with regular check-ups, better nutrition, etc. emergency function implemented allows users get advice from the dental specialists within the dentacoin network case problems. the app tremendously beneficial for children well, forming dental hygiene habits young age prevents the formation deeper dental problems future. the basic initial program lasts for months, considered that this the time slot needed for certain activity permanently integrated into the daily routine individual. only after maintaining proper routine for -month period, users will rewarded with dentacoin tokens, which they can later use for paying for dental services, dental care products, dentacoin assurance, they can store them trade exchange platforms and thus, benefit from the expected value multiplication. "this not the wisdom the crowd, but the wisdom someone the crowd. it's not that the network itself smart; it's that the individuals get smarter because they're connected the network." steven johnson dentavox collective customer intelligence tool, that rewards users for their honest opinions variety dental health topics while simultaneously forms valuable upto-date market research data for dentists, suppliers, manufacturers. thus, all dentacoin network participants are win-win situation. dentavox consists questionnaires variety healthcare topics with different length from questions, placed engaging interactive environment. the rewards dcn are allocated according the user efforts. smart mechanism detects the concentration the users when filling the surveys order guarantee highquality results and prevent manipulations. dentavox tribune for users speak out, give their honest opinions, get rewarded and have strong influence the industry, one could ignore, delete manipulate their true opinions. the statistics from each open questionnaire are visible all registered users. they could then used dentists, suppliers, manufacturers, media up-to-date, extremely valuable market research data and tool for constant service/ treatment/ product/ process improvement. furthermore, dentavox will offer options for businesses conduct custom surveys, based pre-targeted audience. phase iii: dental assurance concept dentacoin's 'unique feedback platform will supported various other valuecreating solutions devoted achieving the same purpose -to improve dental care quality worldwide-. the revolutionary, blockchain dental insurance will become one dentacoin's most powerful tools the dental industry, explained below. dentacoin has created uniquely original dental insurance smart contract that will exist between the individual and their corresponding dentist order achieve the above-mentioned purpose. agreed upon both parties, the contract becomes tradable within the blockchain, this allows for the creation value held the contract. all smart contracts existence will form part "super smart contract". "super smart contracts" ensure that the patient covered the case insolvency death the dentist. the smart contract focuses the alignment both parties' main interest maintain healthy teeth and overall oral hygiene. entering into the smart contract, both the dentist and patient have obligations and duties fulfil, upon completion, both parties will reap the benefits the smart contract. patients must attain the oral hygiene and care that set out the dentacare mobile app and dentists, who restore and maintain their patients' teeth their own expense, are perform their job the utmost quality and satisfaction. both parties' duties and obligations are met, monetary rewards will issued. this monetary motivation method creates environment where both parties whilst performing reach common goal are simultaneously benefitting themselves and the dental industry high levels personal health are met well high quality performance from the dentists. phase iv: healthcare database blockchain offers model, which has the potential enable secure lifetime medical record sharing across all healthcare providers. the rationale for considering blockchain electronic health care records twofold. first, avoids adding another organization between the patient and the records. the blockchain implies decentralized control mechanism which all have interest, but one exclusively owns it. this architectural change that generalizes past medical records.' 'second, adds due consideration time-stamped, programmable ledger. that opens the door for intelligent control record access without having create custom functionality for each vendor. the ledger also inherently includes audit trail.' john halamka, md, andrew lippman and ariel ekblaw, 'the potential for blockchain transform electronic health records' (harvard business review, march dugan maddux, md, facp, vice president, kidney disease initiatives,'cybersecurity and blockchain health care' (acumen physical solutions, april hibbucket,'artificial intelligence blockchain research and development' (hubbucket healthcare blockchain-hubblockchain) the blockchain has the potential standardize secure data exchange less burdensome way than previous approaches. the dcn distribution model aimed value creation for the dental industry worldwide, each patient activity, which generates value for the dental industry, will rewarded with dentacoin. dcns could later used for paying dental treatments. dentists, the other hands, could consider dcn financial investment they could remunerate employees for their extraordinary performance the workplace. they could also pay suppliers dentacoin with extra time, middlemen and more high international transaction costs. this direct connection between producers and dentists will then allow dentists provide lower prices patients. the currency cycle closed. moreover, the establishment dentacoin industrial currency will put all market players suppliers, dentists, and patients "win-win-win" situation. roadmap this section aims explain the different phases dentacoin intends progress through over the next few years, and the various milestones connected with each phase dentacoin wishes achieve for the users, developers, and the industry overall. total, there are phases, namely: knowledge, expansion, determination and eternity. each phase and its corresponding milestones, goals, and focuses are set out below. knowledge gather the required market data, using blockchain based review network create global, growing database. expansion create global community and motivate the participants make use the dcn currency. determination implement decentralized insurance model. eternity build dcn infrastructure for direct international trading between dentists and suppliers cooperation with ups, alibaba and amazon. the roadmap dentacoin shown below: the first major step after the release the dentacoin token february was the establishment and registration the dentacoin foundation maastricht, the netherlands the ... there are obligations any kind token-holders towards the foundation. neither there any obligation any kind whatsoever the part the foundation towards token-holders. the public presale commenced the july, (during which dcns' were distributed) and the gathered funds are being used create team front and back end developers for the trusted review platform testnet, the programming, and launching the trusted review platform (testnet) and its supporting tools, being the dentacare mobile app and the dentavox opinion platform. following the public presale, the testnet version the review platform will launched the august the october the first token sale will publicly held during which the overall dcn amount will distributed. later distribution will happen through further token sales and our tools. the tokens that are not distributed during the year their release will locked and distributed after they will released based how much supply there the market during that period and aligns with the token distribution supply plan. case there higher amount tokens the market than what was planned the distribution supply plan, will then release amount that will fit the inflation ratios. once all the necessary data from the test phase the trusted review network has been gathered and analysed, necessary changes will made the testnet based the gathered data and upon the completion the testnet alterations, the trusted review platform (mainnet) will launch later the year. dentavox market research platform will launched. may dentacoin integrated platform will introduced, along with dentacoin assurance testnet during the foundation plans healthcare database integration. the dentacoin foundation was the first develop solution the blockchain for the dental industry and has the potential the market leader this industry. the strength dentacoin the dentacoin foundation recognizes that the value all user contributions (reviews, recommendations, rewards, payments, trusted feedback, etc.) one the most important assets the foundation. single review worth next nothing, but millions trusted and impartial reviews are worth many millions (or possibly even billions) euros. individuals should paid for everything they that brings value not only dentacoin but also the dental industry. major breakthrough for dentacoin was the purchase real existing dental clinic, the dentaprime international plc. london. the transfer ownership took place july once the purchase price had been paid. this transaction was phenomenal due the fact that the calculated purchase price the value million usd was paid entirely dcn. this means that even before the ico, the dcn was given high, real value professionals the m&a field. this purchase unique the history the blockchain tokens. the dentacoin foundation will continue active m&a and will purchase additional clinics they can take pilot function within dental industry possibility indirect profit sharing once year, there possibility that the dentacoin foundation will able change back the dentacoin tokens from market for ether bitcoin with the operating profit. this will have the effect that the global dcn supply decreases. the other hand, the dentacoin foundation may use the the operating profit reinvest into the tools that are being developed the dentacoin foundation. the decision how use the resources including any profits and liquidation proceeds will only and every time the hands the management the foundation. the operating profit includes interests from assets, profits the clinics bought the foundation and any other return investment. token creation there are ,,,, (eight trillion) coins pre-mined. "dcn" refers one individual dentacoin and because erc token, configured used globally all individuals and its value derived from the exchange with ether. the symbol has been chosen represent dcn. token sales for now (//) the following sales steps have been planned: july public presale hard-capped presale volume: dcn the total supply) price: usd dcn dcn/usd cents update (..) the exchange rate dcn/eth during the presale fixed dcn/eth. other words: eth dcn. funds allocation: creating team front and backend developers for the trusted review platform testnet. programming and launching the trusted review platform (testnet). programming and launching the supporting tools being the dentacare mobile app and the dentavox opinion platform. october first token sale hard-capped ico volume: dcn the total supply) price: usd dcn dcn/usd cent update (..) the ico price dentacoin was set dcn/eth and dcn/btc. funds allocation: creating team insurance specialists, dentists and programmers develop the dental assurance model. launching the trusted review platform mainnet and dentavox market research. initial global communication campaign for acquiring partners and multipliers. payments handling dentistry today growing, high-tech oriented, billion usd industry. dentacoin the first and only crypto coin created payment method the dental industry worldwide. the dentacoin foundation will implement state channel payment method. this method operates similar manner how payments cheques are handled. simple terms, person (the benefiter) can receive check from bank account holder means payment. order for the payee receive the amount money promised the cheque, the issuer's name and benefiter's name must written the face the cheque, the amount and currency specified and should signed (authorized) the bank account holder. all conditions are met this cheque order becomes exchangeable the bank for the amount money promised. the exchange, however, may not completed due insufficient funds the issuer's account and hence denied. the transfer dentacoin (dcn) operates similar manner the abovementioned example. upon the wishes one user (x) obtain services goods from another user (b), the exchange will happen when promises that payment the form dcns' will take place upon the transfer goods/ completion services from once has fulfilled their obligation, request will made and the smart contract will carry out the request means transferring dcns from xs' account into b's account. history all transfers will stored the ledgers both parties and the balance for each account will present the contract state. users may request send tokens from their wallet any ethereum wallet through smart contract. smart contract ethereum allows the running decentralized code conjunction with smart contracts, enabling reliable services and payments handling. 'smart contracts are central component next- generation blockchain platforms.' due the contracts' self-executing nature, single party manipulation averted because control over the execution the smart contract does not fall into the hands single party. hence, could said that smart contracts provide autonomy, trust, speed, and safety. dental services market global report https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/tlqzbb/dental_services. dentacoin smart contracts are computer protocols the ethereum blockchain that facilitate, verify, negotiate and conclude contracts between individuals and their contracting party. more information the smart contract code will provided later the whitepaper. due these smart contracts holding value, mentioned earlier this whitepaper, individuals may participate audit all dentacoins' smart contracts github. all smart contracts are connected one "super smart contract"(ssc) but don't lose their individual rights. smart contract cannot fulfilled due performance impossibility (death), then the ssc saves the patients' rights! thanks the trustworthy nature smart contracts, many the industry problems can mitigated extinguished. dentacoin erc standard token contract the core contract extended version the standard ethereum token contract (erc). you can explore and prove https://etherscan.io. token contract extensions automated transaction fee handling dentacoin owners need not worry about transaction fees (gas) ether. not necessary for dentacoin holders hold any ether order send and receive dcn due the fact that all fees are automatically deducted from the receiving amount (in dcn) that received the receiver. this transfer function due the upcoming metropolis ethereum hard fork might updated handle token fees internally. function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success) (_value _value balances[_to] _value balances[_to]) balances[msg.sender] safesub(balances[msg.sender], _value); (msg.sender.balance minbalanceforaccounts _to.balance minbalanceforaccounts) balances[_to] safeadd(balances[_to], _value); transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value); return true; else balances[this] safeadd(balances[this], dcnforgas); balances[_to] safeadd(balances[_to], safesub(_value, dcnforgas)); transfer(msg.sender, _to, safesub(_value, dcnforgas)); if(msg.sender.balance john halamka, md, andrew lippman and ariel ekblaw, 'the potential for blockchain transform electronic health records' (harvard business review, march dugan maddux, md, facp, vice president, kidney disease initiatives,'cybersecurity and blockchain health care' (acumen physical solutions, april https://acumenmd.com/blog/cybersecurity-and-blockchain-in-health-care/ hibbucket,'artificial intelligence blockchain research and development' (hubbucket healthcare blockchain-hubblockchain) blockchain technologies,'smart contracts explained' (blockchain technologies bain&company: global healthcare private equity report. extract could found here: world health organization: global health observatory data repository world health organization: oral health publications dental services market global report
