cryptopay introduced flex accounts instant exchange options. whenever user sends bitcoins one these fiat denominated accounts, bitcoins are instantly converted and not require any additional manual conversions. cpay prepaid card the cryptopay prepaid card was launched early and was one the first digital currency cards the market. that time, the card was the first real tool that brought bitcoin the mainstream. allows any bitcoin holder spend their coins, online otherwise, anywhere that accepts traditional payment cards. this, paired withwhite the digital ico cryptopay paperwallet, allowed

customer support ux/ui dispute resolution cpay bin sponsor reporting and complience card scheme settlement funds segregation card bureau issuer processor card issuing payment processing fund segregation card production card personalization card delivery and handling the second generation our card has been completely redesigned. not only has the physical design the card been updated, but we've improved how works, and it's backed different technology stack: nfc enabled the world's first contactless bitcoin prepaid card; cards have higher atm withdrawal limit; ico cryptopay white paper cpay prepaid card (continued) cryptopay verification now takes less than one business day and doesn't require any review the issuing bank. now, have issued more than cards, both plastic and virtual. merchant processing the bitcoin payment gateway was the first product released cryptopay began providing high risk merchants (gaming, gambling, etc.) with the ability accept/send bitcoin payment channel without the risk holding bitcoins. most merchants use our api with sla guarantee and have developed features meet their specific needs. featured clients: payment processing product with long-term development strategy that heavily relies sales and business development. from commercial standpoint, the revenue from this business stream driven the adoption bitcoin and the long run this will affect other revenue streams through various cross-sell business opportunities. products under development brokerage services the recent dramatic valuation different popular digital currencies have generated lot wealth for early adopters. from the long term perspective, many digital currencies holders will eventually have reduce their exposure digital currencies due many reasons starting from liquidity preferences changing attitudes perceived risk. soon expect see many investors shift the holdings their portfolio from digital currencies traditional financial assets stocks, bonds, derivatives and even term deposits. ico cryptopay white paper brokerage services (continued) believe that will benefit traditional asset managers/brokers they will get interest from relatively young, but wealthy individuals. however, due compliance reasons, much the shift wealth will followed multiple issues asset freezes, compliance checks, bank account shutdowns, etc. traditional financial institutions neither understand this new generation clients nor can they serve them the right manner. our focus provide traditional financial services the digital currencies community secure and compliant way. users cryptopay brokerage services will able move holdings from bitcoin, say, apple stocks within single account and without any additional effort. regulated entity with payments and prepaid cards are the best position combine high level service that our users love with regulatory requirements. current accounts and banking services the moment, making and receiving payment from bitcoin related source (bitcoin exchange, broker platform) liable end compliance nightmare. yet again, traditional financial services companies not understand digital currencies and whenever there inflow funds from that space issues arise. many cryptocurrency traders and miners dream bank account that understands the nature their business, and able provide the very least, basic payment services. however, even europe, difficult obtain and maintain bank account that associated with digital currencies. cryptopay plans provide its clients' payment accounts with iban attached and the account will the name the customer, rather than cryptopay. bridging these two distant worlds together will create place where the digital currencies community will able hold, save, and transact with its fiat holdings without fear getting their current accounts shut down. thus, believe that providing complementary services like brokerage and contactless prepaid card will able retain customers and new customers will switch their current banking provider favor cryptopay. ico cryptopay white paper marketplace without doubt, the market icos and fundraising through such icos here stay. now the market its early days. lack investor protection and presence fraudulent market players discourages many investors participate while putting the larger market risk. believe that regulations not necessarily mean that icos would not allowed banned. for more conscientious projects, commencing ico regulated marketplace provides the opportunity reach more investors, due transparency the marketplace and clear investor protection mechanisms. once our previous fundraising goals are met and the projects connected with those goals are implemented, cryptopay will have enough resources and underlying infrastructure establish regulated marketplace for icos without sacrificing the spirit decentralisation promoted blockchain. getting brokerage and payment license means establishing sound dialogue with the regulator. having raised enough funds would prove eyes the regulator, that our project has enough resources and investor demand continue moving further. cryptopay will liaise with reputable regulator continental europe find the best regulatory and legal framework that most conducive with success. critical functions like trading, price discovery and settlement clearing will taken care subsidiaries that were established funds, raised the previous milestones. other critical functions, like authorisation, audit and legal services would provided through partners from well established and reputable professional firms. top that, will run and underwrite icos and perform legal due diligence, mandatory escrow and provide communication platform for projects. some existing, well known tokens will added the platform drive the adoption and attract new investors. the same time, many roles, like register and listing authorisation depositary would performed the ethereum blockchain itself. retail investors will able invest broad range tokenized securities, create custom investment portfolios and get insights and reports though cryptopay investment research department. accompanied with debit card this the perfect solution not just invest, but also keep investments liquid. ico cryptopay white paper marketplace (continued) accompanied with prepaid card this the perfect solution not just invest, but also keep investments liquid. ico cryptopay white paper cpay initial token sale general overview initial token sale initial coin offering (hereinafter "ico") the
