the gemini dollar: regulated stable value coin gemini trust company, llc dollar@gemini.com abstract the gemini dollar cryptographic token that (i) issued new york trust company, (ii) strictly pegged the u.s. dollar, and (iii) built the ethereum network according the erc standard for tokens. the gemini dollar stable value coin that combines the creditworthiness and price stability the u.s. dollar with the technological advantages cryptocurrency and the oversight u.s. regulators. erc compliant token, the gemini dollar can transferred the ethereum network. gemini dollars are created the time withdrawal from the gemini platform and redeemed "destroyed" the time deposit into the gemini platform. introduction cryptocurrencies have recently surged popularity and investor interest. while they bear promise perhaps profound the internet itself, they suffer from substantial price volatility, thereby hindering their use medium exchange and unit account (two the three functions money). one proposed solution the creation stable value coin (often called "stablecoin"), whereby issuer distributes cryptographic token customers exchange for specified fiat currency, like the u.s. dollar, fixed exchange rate. because the u.s. dollar highly desirable medium exchange, well globally accepted unit account, desirable peg for stablecoin. several implementations fiat-pegged stablecoins have been proposed, however, they all lack some combination supervision transparency and examination []. result, doubts surrounding their solvency persist, concerns regarding the systemic risks they pose []. what needed stablecoin that people can trust. this paper, propose the gemini dollar, regulated stablecoin that combines the creditworthiness and price stability the u.s. dollar with the technological advantages cryptocurrency and the oversight u.s. regulators. trust building viable stablecoin much trust problem computer science one. while bitcoin created system based cryptographic proof instead trust, fiat-pegged stablecoin requires both due its reliance centralized issuer. desirable outcomes system that relies (at least part) trust requires oversight the context stablecoin, submit that the issuer must licensed and subject regulatory supervision. from this, transparency and examination become requirements the system, ensuring its integrity and engendering market confidence. propose gemini trust company, llc (gemini), new york trust company, the issuer the gemini dollar. gemini operates under the direct supervision and regulatory authority the new york state department financial services and subject the new york banking law and other applicable u.s. laws and regulations. gemini maintains the necessary licenses and registrations lawfully issue gemini dollars. proof-of-solvency one desirable outcome stablecoin convergence between the tokens issued and the u.s. dollars exchanged for their creation. the amount tokens issued and circulation can observed the blockchain, however, verifying the underlying u.s. dollar balance demonstrate proof-of-solvency requires examination trusted party. for assurance, propose that the audit committee the board directors gemini engage independent registered public accounting firm regularly examine and attest the underlying u.s. dollar balance accordance with the attestation standards established the american institute certified public accountants. creation, redemption, and transfer simple and elegant mechanism for creation and redemption necessary promote useability and encourage adoption. achieve this allowing gemini customers create and redeem gemini dollars the gemini platform. gemini dollars are created the time withdrawal from the gemini platform. gemini customers may exchange u.s. dollars for gemini dollars exchange rate initiating withdrawal gemini dollars from their gemini account any ethereum address they specify. the u.s. dollar amount gemini dollars debited from customer's gemini account balance the time withdrawal. gemini dollars are redeemed "destroyed" the time deposit into the gemini platform. gemini customers may exchange gemini dollars for u.s. dollars exchange rate depositing gemini dollars into their gemini account. the u.s. dollar amount gemini dollars credited customer's gemini account balance the time deposit. the gemini dollar can transferred the ethereum network. contract specification the specifications the gemini dollar require network that allows for the development decentralized applications (including smart contracts) that may used store and transfer value according certain conditions set the developer. the ethereum network fulfills this criteria and has technical standard for tokens, the 'erc' standard [], which has experienced widespread, global adoption. result, there already exists plethora software and services that support erc compliant tokens and provide access and usability for end users (cf., tether originally built omni layer, protocol built top the bitcoin blockchain []). alternatively, the gemini dollar were built the native token its own blockchain, would take time for similarly vibrant ecosystem third-party developers and software emerge. result, have built the gemini dollar erc compliant token the ethereum network. consequently, the gemini dollar can transferred the ethereum network and stored any ethereum address. contract separation regulated issuer, need technical design and implementation that gives the ability upgrade the gemini dollar token can: resolve vulnerabilities; extend the system with new features; improve the system and optimize its operational efficiency; and pause, block, reverse token transfers response security incident (i.e., catastrophic event) legally obligated compelled court law other governmental body. enable upgrades (the mechanism for which describe more detail below) building system smart contracts that cooperate with each other. the core components the gemini dollar system are three smart contracts that refer 'proxy,' 'impl,' and 'store.' the smart contract known 'proxy' the public face the gemini dollar the gemini dollar's permanent address the ethereum blockchain. there is, and will only ever be, one instance 'proxy.' provides the interface with which token holders can interact and perform operations such transferring tokens and viewing token balances; however, 'proxy' contains neither the code nor the data that comprises the behavior and state the gemini dollar. instead, 'proxy' delegates the right execute the logic that governs token transfers, issuance, and other core features the smart contract known 'impl.' turn, 'impl' does not directly control the data that constitutes the ledger the gemini dollar (i.e., the mapping token holders their balances); instead, delegates ownership the ledger the smart contract known 'store' the external and eternal gemini dollar ledger. contract custodianship for certain high-risk actions the gemini dollar system, need offline approval mechanism. we, therefore, require each smart contract the gemini dollar system look custodian for approval. custodian may another smart contract keyset (online offline). custodian may look another custodian, which may look another custodian, and forth, thereby creating chain custody "custodianship." for instance, smart contract may look another smart contract, which ultimately looks keyset for approval. smart contract's custodianship terminates offline keyset, offline approval mechanism for its actions has been created. for example, 'proxy' looks smart contract called 'custodian,' which ultimately looks offline keyset for approval. likewise, 'store' looks 'custodian,' which ultimately looks offline keyset for approval. contract upgrades upgrading the gemini dollar token high-risk action that utilizes the gemini dollar system's offline approval mechanism. this, replace the current instance 'impl' instructing 'proxy' (via 'custodian') delegate active token implementation new instance 'impl,' and instructing 'store' (via 'custodian') treat this new instance 'impl' its single trusted source when accepting updates the gemini dollar ledger. the above diagram reflects post-upgrade state the world, whereby the previous instance 'impl' has been replaced new instance 'impl' the instance 'proxy' now delegates 'impl' similarly, the instance 'store' now only accepts calls from 'impl' the previous instance 'impl' remains, but has become inert because now unlinked from the system. taken together, the custodianship 'proxy' and 'store' makes gemini dollar system upgrades possible. addition, custodianship itself can upgraded. for example, need change our offline keyset, can instruct 'custodian' instruct 'proxy' look new instance 'custodian' that looks new offline keyset. printing tokens printing tokens high-risk action the amount gemini dollars issued and circulation must never exceed the underlying u.s. dollar balance. need solution that provides the security offline approval mechanism yet the flexibility online approval mechanism. propose hybrid solution whereby the custodianship 'impl,' the smart contract that controls increases supply gemini dollar tokens, involves both online and offline approval mechanism. implement this unique approach, insert smart contract called 'printlimiter' into the 'impl' chain custody. with the approval online key, 'impl' may print gemini dollars amount "limit" specified 'printlimiter.' this limit may increased with approval offline keyset (or decreased with approval online key). this solution gives the gemini dollar system the desired level security and flexibility with respect token issuance. contract security the gemini dollar system implements the following security features: offline keys: keys that approve high-risk actions are stored offline gemini's proprietary cold storage system. key generation: keys are generated, stored, and managed onboard hardware security modules (hsms). only use hsms, each "signer," that have achieved rating fips pub level higher []. dual control (multisignature): high-risk actions require approval (i.e., digital signatures) from least two signers. utilize signing design, whereby m=. this provides both security and fault tolerance. time lock: even after approval, high-risk actions are locked for minimum period time before being executed. this provides grace period detect and preemptively respond potential security incidents. revocation: pending actions can revoked, allowing for the nullification erroneous malicious actions before being executed. conclusion have proposed solution for stablecoin that establishes trust through cryptographic proof and regulatory oversight. our technical design implemented the ethereum network. includes upgrade feature, offline approval mechanism for high-risk actions, and hybrid online-offline approval mechanism for token issuance that provides the desired level security and flexibility. our trust implementation involves linking licensed financial institutions and examiners form network trust. together, these implementations form the gemini dollar, regulated stablecoin that can serve viable medium exchange and unit account for centralized and decentralized applications. references buterin al., next-generation smart contract and decentralized application
