privacy and security guaranteed boolberry solves cryptonote issues boolberry solves cryptonote issues boolberry's feature: improved transaction identification this presentation you'll find out how boolberry reduces block chain bloat compared *ordinary cryptonote coins. *ordinary cryptonote coins based the original cryptonote core, such bytecoin, ducknote, monero, etc. boolberry solves cryptonote issues block chain what block chain and how does work? the block chain database shared all network users that stores the transaction history. transaction not recognized until added the block chain, which referred confirmation. blockchain block transactions block transactions block transactions block transactions boolberry solves cryptonote issues block chain what does block look like? simplified block structure: version info nonce previous block timestamp proof-of-work hash block merkle block block merkle tree hash transaction's list block header contains service information (version info, nonce, previous block and timestamp). merkle summary built from the block's transaction identifiers. transaction's list list transaction's identification hashes, that was included into the block's merkle tree boolberry solves cryptonote issues block chain how transaction get included into the block merkle merkle tree hash transaction's list hash prefix extra outputs extra outputs hash prefix outputs hash prefix outputs extra outputs hash prefix outputs extra outputs coin base transaction suffix ring signature transaction ring signature transaction ring signature transaction suffix suffix transaction gets included into block's transactions list identifier calculated from both the transaction prefix and suffix (ring signatures). boolberry solves cryptonote issues the problem bloated blockchains examination the boolberry block chain (-jul-) shows the average transaction size bytes. calculations show ring signatures take average that size. and these calculations are for block chain where mixins are not widely used yet. when mixins are used ring signatures take the transaction size. ordinary cryptonote coins have keep all the ring signatures, since not possible prove that transaction belongs block without them. boolberry solves cryptonote issues solution: cut off the ring signatures once transaction gets lot confirmations (say one year old transaction with hundreds thousands confirmations) the ring signature longer needed... even transaction's output not spent yet. why not just cut off? boolberry solves cryptonote issues let's compare! ordinary cryptonote coin prefix outputs suffix extra outputs ring signature transaction prefix outputs suffix extra outputs ring signature transaction ordinary cryptonote calculates transaction hash using all boolberry calculates transaction hash using only the transaction prefix. ring signatures are excluded from transaction hash. boolberry solves cryptonote issues block chain how are transactions included boolberry block? merkle merkle tree hash transaction's list hash prefix hash prefix outputs hash prefix outputs hash prefix outputs extra outputs extra outputs extra outputs coin base transaction suffix ring signature transaction ring signature transaction ring signature transaction suffix suffix extra outputs each transaction included into block's transactions list identifier calculated from transaction prefix only! this allows boolberry cut-off ring signatures from old transactions but still able prove that transactions belong given block and protected proof-of-work this block. boolberry solves cryptonote issues block chain let's compare the ordinary cryptonote block chain and the boolberry block chain after one year: ordinary cryptonote coin block transactions block transactions block transactions block transactions block transactions block transactions block transactions block transactions boolberry solves cryptonote issues guess what? boolberry designed use resources more efficiently! boolberry will drop the ballast ring signatures for old transactions, even transaction outputs not spent yet. we'll start cut off ring signatures after first year currency live (we gonna that least with checkpoints, but also gonna start public discussion talk about other more interesting/smart ways that). this feature will make boolberry block chain least and smaller than ordinary cryptonote coins. compact block chain produce faster synchronization for better user experience and convenience! boolberry solves cryptonote issues guess what? boolberry the most convenient modified cryptonote coin date! boolberry trading www.poloniex.com and www.bittrex.com for more information please visit www.boolberry.com contact: press@boolberry.com boolberry solves cryptonote issues
