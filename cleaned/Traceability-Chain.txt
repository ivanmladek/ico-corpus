considered investment advices. the content herein shall only used reference and the project may very the team, technology, environment and policy change. traceability chain foundation ltd. reserves the right revise the white paper. tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain outline traceability chain (referred tac for short) traceability public chain erected through block chain technology. according the trans-chain protocol with eth, builds traceability cloud platform using the blockchain's unique non-temper distributive book recording feature. through the sub-chain the implementing project and corresponding dapp application, tac solves the enterprise puzzles during raw material procurement, production, storage, circulation, distribution and terminal consumption such information traceability, anti-counterfeiting and verification and accurate marketing, provides swift and high-efficiency development cloud service cluster for the technological developers and solves the "trustable" puzzles for the brand enterprise and consumers. tac ecology includes major chain, cloud platform, developer, enterprise and consumer. aspect commercial mode, tac erects basic blockchain platform and provides intelligent contract interface. the developer may provide blockchain traceability anti-counterfeit technology solution for the brand client and the brand client pays corresponding fee. the consumer may obtain different awards from the brand enterprise via free scanning research. thanks the business model design and the basic platform erected based core idea, the traceability chain enables more technology developers join ecology and facilitate more brand clients upload the commodities the chain, which way the traceability chain may enter into the market and capture the market faster. big data expo guiyang may regards the anti-counterfeiting problem maotai, huateng, tecent ceo, expressed that the future, the networking anti-counterfeiting form that was based cloud end and mixed blockchain technology was far effective than the traditional anti-counterfeiting trademark. the blockchain technology medium existence. like accounting book, may record all trading data which can used verify whether the information true. firstly, the blockchain different from the usual centralized information storage organization. the decentralization feature realizes the openness and equality the data together maintained many nodes the blockchain. secondly, the verified information will stored forever after being added the blockchain tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain and the data cannot revised with single node. thus, the blockchain data have higher stability and cannot tempered repudiated. thirdly, anybody may check the blockchain data and share and exchange the data the whole system public interface. therefore, the blockchain keeps the highly openness and transparency the system information. vitalik buterin, god founder ethereum also said: "traceability" business awesome blockchain implementation application. the blockchain provides wonderful chance for the traceability business. traceability refers the circulating chain used trace and record intangible goods digital goods. through each circulation registration, may realize the objective information collection and record, sourcing traceability raw materials, production course, batch inspection, logistics circulation and anti-counterfeiting and verification and improving supply chain and providing financial services supply chain. the internal logic and data storage and verification situations for applying the blockchain technology traceability, anti-counterfeiting and supply chain improvement are much familiar--non-temper data and time stamp. the traditional traceability system adopted centralized account book mode adopted dispersive and separate record and storage the market participants. was kind information island mode. the centralized account table mode, the key whoever maintains the account table the center. matter whether the source enterprise stores the channel distributer stores, since they are both the interested parties the circulating chain, when the information the account book against their interests, they may temper the account book tell lie that the account book gets lost due technology reason. global project, tac starts china and accumulates experience and improves the platform. the project develops, tac will set the technology research and development center and the market expanding center silicon valley and radiate north america and europe. other regions, continually insist the fastest application landing and focus traceability, anti-counterfeiting and supply chain application solve the "trustability" for global goods circulation, and win bigger value increment for the whole ecology virtue the industrial reform the blockchain. tacchain.io absorbed creating

...................................................................................... tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain traceability chain understanding blockchain background blockchain project internet has experienced two huge changes during its near -year development history. the first change was global computer networking. since the birth arpa network the world mainstream countries were gradually connected internet start the global networking journey. the second change was that the global internet application. since world-wide-web thesis network appeared the internet application realized global application outburst like hundred flowers bloom". now the third change pregnancy. e-cash proposed digital payment system but failed later due the centralization reason. hashcash proposed digital currency that adopts poof work (pow) and has been widely and hugely applied digital currency. b-money proposed the first de-centralized digital currency system. pity that did not propose detailed implementation. satoshi nakamoto firstly proposed blockchain conception. although the blockchain has experienced revolution several generations beforehand, this period the development stage digital currency. until the birth bit currency which symbolized that the blockchain technology brought huge hope for the digital economy era, then really realized decentralized and public-financial digital currency system, formally opened the development the blockchain technology and also started human research and exploration the aspect intelligent contract. version blockchain was featured with digital currency and version blockchain was featured with intelligent contract. then version blockchain was featured with application landing, which digitalizes the offline situation and synchronizes blockchain network. any great creative technology will form huge change the world. the steam engine has changed the production form; the internet has changed the interaction form; what's the blockchain changed value form. the change from blockchain the world mainly expressed through changing the company organization form, commercial cooperation form and social governance form. significance blockchain project with the support from the blockchain technology, people find that the blockchain meaning that can build much reliable internet system and fundamentally solve the cheat and rent-seeking during value exchange and transmission. the blockchain technology becomes popular, the digital economy will much authentic and reliable since can not only publicize the information but also protect the privacy; not only make decision together but also protect individual benefits. this mechanism will enhance the value interaction and lowers the cost. tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain the public service layer, the blockchain technology exploring the application fields public management, social protection, intellectual property management and protection, anti-counterfeit and traceability commodity and land ownership management. relevant practices prove that such technology may assist promote the public participation, reduce the social running cost, enhance the social management quality and efficiency and play important facilitating effect the tips for social management and governance level. the economic meaning, the new value interaction form created blockchain based "weak centralization", which however doesn't mean that various "centralizations" the traditional society may disappear completely. the future, there will huge amount "multi-center" systems blockchain. focusing union chain, private chain mixing chain, the blockchain will further enhance the running efficiency the "center" and reduce rather part cost. the view technology, think that the blockchain kind technology system that maintained together many parties, stores the data with blockchain structure, uses cryptology guarantee the transmission and access safety and can realize consistent data storage and avoid temper and refusal. such technology brings indefinite imagination space the world. the global concern about the blockchain overheats continually. the major global economic entities start the research blockchain technology and development trend the state strategy layer. the birth the blockchain technology symbolizes that the people start building the real trustable internet. while, the application innovation "blockchain plus" then points out the new development direction the industrial innovation and public service. what's the traceability chain hope to, basing the technology blockchain, adopting unique non-tamper distributed ledger characteristics the blockchain, build the communication node bottom layer, traceability cloud platform and distributed storage cloud service; solve the enterprise difficulties information traceability, anti-counterfeit, verification and mobile marketing during raw material procurement, production, storage, circulation and distribution, store and terminal consumption process the commodity through the sub-chain the landing project and corresponding dapp application, and provide fast and efficient cluster cloud services development for the technical developers, solve the problem "trusted" for brand enterprises and consumers, and then build new blockchain ecosystem ---traceability chain the future world-selectable commodity information and internet value transmission protocol, and push forward the practicability and usability the whole block chain industry. the most promising blockchain ecosystem, tac thoroughly combines the system framework advantages ethereum, ripple and fabric. tac will also constantly and gradually form the blockchain economy through the construction the foundation platform, the design and development the software and hardware products, the development various products and the development and iteration the commercial landing project, gradually form tac economy tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain system, improve the industry efficiency, and promote the effective and collaborative development the society. advantages traceability chain project through tracing and recording the circulation chain the tangible goods intangible information and registering each circulation, tac realizes full-course traceability from information collection and record, the sourcing, sourcing traceability the raw materials, production course, processing round, storage information, verification batch, logistics circulation, the third party's quality inspection, immigration control customs, anti-counterfeiting authentication, and improve the service accuracy and safety the supply chain data according the traceability information and further provide blockchain financial service for the participants the industrial chain. the internal logic and data storage and verification situations for applying the blockchain technology traceability, anti-counterfeiting and supply chain management are much familiar--non-temper data and time stamp. the traditional traceability system adopted centralized account book mode adopted dispersive and separate record and storage the market participants. was kind information island mode. the centralized account table mode, the key whoever maintains the account table the center. matter whether the source enterprise stores the channel distributer stores, since they are both the interested parties the circulating chain, when the information the account book against their interests, they may temper the account book tell lie that the account book gets lost due technology reason. such example usual real life. the camera always off key moment. therefore, the centralized account book maintained the interested party not reliable. under information island mode, the market participants themselves maintain account book which commonly known standing book and named input into invoicing system after electronic input. matter whether the real standing book the electronic invoicing system, the owner may temper edit later freely. the real-time checking ability registration and settlement situation and the non-temper and time stamp ability data storage and verification situation the blockchain provide powerful tool for the traceability, anti-counterfeiting and supplychain financial and management situation. ii. background traceability and anti-counterfeiting market according the statistics, the loss from the false and counterfeited products the markets worldwide has reached usd billion. the annual deal amount the false and counterfeited products has occupied the total trade worldwide. china, due the powerful imitation and production ability, the false and counterfeited product scale made china has exceeded cny- billion, especially the fields where counterfeiting and infringement are much common, namely currency, medicine, food, cosmetics, clothes, agricultural material products, auto and farm machinery parts, audio and video products, software and computer chips. has been the "severe area" the false and counterfeited goods. tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain three great demands the future public safety field. the informatization and electronization trend becomes much obvious and provides much effective technical means and platform for the criminal prevention and strike public safety field. for instance, since january taxis shenyang have been installed with anti-counterfeiting sign. the anti-counterfeiting sign will become effective formally and the "unlicensed taxi" will have nowhere hide. food safety field. the "twelfth five-year" development plan food industry puts quality safety first and proposes enhance the food quality sampling qualification rate from higher than which may hugely reduce the rate food safety accidents, obviously enhance people's food satisfaction, ensure that the consumers are not worried about food and further safeguard people's fundamental interests. people's concern and high attention food safety increases, how guarantee the food safety and prevent the infringement the false goods has becomes the technical and management puzzle food safety field. the government and consumers long for simple but easily-operational technology protect the food safety. how let the food put the dining table safely becomes the hot point and difficulty the new technology, new equipment and new application. drug safety field. according the requirements relevant policies and documents such notice implementing electronic supervision all kinds basic drugs, till april all basic drugs shall implemented with dynamic management via electronic supervision code during the circulation. almost covers all medicine enterprises and manufacturers that produce drugs. the involved scope wide. the electronic supervision code the unique symbol distinguish the drugs and the "id card" each box drugs. the application the electronic tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain supervision code aims helping state relevant organs carry out much accurate and timely supervision the drug production and circulation rounds, providing convenience for the producers carrying out effective management and control the drug sales and meanwhile providing supervision platform for the people realize medication certain extent. according the development schedule the electronic drug supervision work, the basic drugs that are not connected the network and are not marked with electronic drug supervision code shall not allowed join the drug bidding and procurement. according the reckoning, kinds basic drugs will get involved more than medicine plants which will need about billion tags annually. traceability and anti-counterfeiting application condition china ali-health tmall medicine together started "nutritious china" brand strategy october ali-health and tmall medicine together started "nutritious china" brand strategy and declared build "nutritious china traceability system" realize the "one code for one nutritious product" traceability. virtue "relieved code" platform ali-health, can realize the traceability relevant nutritious products, meaning that the nutritious products have "id cards". the consumer may find the nutritious products with authorized sign "nutritious china" tmall quickly long logs the home page tmall and searches "nutritious china", namely medlar, chinese caterpillar fungus, bird's nest, colla corii asini, dendrobe, ginseng, pseudo-ginseng, honey, and pilose antler, which have basically covered the popular nutritious products the market. yunnan baiyao: "truth traceability" was brand commitment november yunnan baiyao erected platform for assisting enterprise brands and launched brand-new electronic tag anti-counterfeiting and traceability solution solve present bad situation that the good and the bad mixed the market and the consumers cannot tell the truth from the false. junlebao dairy built anti-counterfeiting and traceability system december junlebao trademark chinese famous trademark. after entering into the mobile internet era, junlebao dairy responded state policy call, followed the enterprise tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain development trend, protected the consumers' benefits, and started implementing enterprise internet+ plan and built dairy anti-counterfeiting and traceability system. fir mus powder milk launched cell phone app check whether the product true false fir mus created and launched product traceability app cell phone and realized that kinds information such fresh milk, finished product, place origin, inspection place, logistics head warehouse and the initial distributor can traced and checked. the aspect the information completeness and transparency, not only complies the state requirements but also the first the industry. after creating the leading traceability system dairy product industry, fir mus still carries out innovation and upgrading unceasingly and continually improves the product safety traceability through informatization and digitalization seek self break-through. anti-counterfeiting and traceability system maotai rfid anti-counterfeiting wuliangye wuliangye started using rfid anti-counterfeiting technology since the basis bottle code and box code, wuliangye added the unique rfid code and combined the three codes. the first enterprise inside apply rfid technology wine anti-counterfeiting and traceability. wuliangye improved the anti-counterfeiting overall and the consumers may check whether the wine true false via cell phone directly. overseas traceability and anti-counterfeiting application condition since many countries and regions have applied the traceability system agricultural tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain product quality safety management. agricultural product traceability system the european union. the eu's application the agricultural product traceability system the earliest, especially the traceability system live cattle and beef products. includes the agricultural product traceability system into legal framework. according the beef tag law, the countries shall build verification and registration system for live cattle during production round and provide clear enough product sign information the consumers during sale round. january the published food safety white paper, which proposed fundamental reform, namely to, based controlling the whole course "from farmland dining table", define the liabilities all relevant producers and business runners. january the issued no./ decree ruling that each agricultural product enterprise shall provide guarantee measures and data for the raw materials, ingredients and relevant materials used during the production, processing and sales order ensure the safety and traceability. agricultural product traceability system the us. the with extremely developed market economy, the agricultural product traceability system mainly built the enterprise out own accord and the government plays driving and promoting role. american industrial association and enterprises built voluntary traceability system. more than associations and organizations and more than professional livestock raising and veterinarian people composed usaip jointly join making and establishing livestock sign and traceability plan, aiming being able determine all enterprises involved direct contact within under the condition that foreign epidemic diseases were found. may fda published food safety tracing regulation, which requested all enterprises involved food transportation, distribution and importation shall build and keep the all course records relevant food circulation. agricultural product traceability system other countries the british government built internet-based cattle traceability system. the system records the cattle's transfer condition from birth death. the farm owner may record and register new cattle and check the conditions other cattle owned through the online network the system. canada started implementing compulsory live cattle and beef product labeling system since july and demanded that all beef products shall labeled with bar codes the standards. national livestock identification system (nlis) australian livestock label and traceability system. the live cattle shall identified according the ear label rumen label identified nlis. when the cattle moves new place the identification reader the plant slaughter house may read and recorded nlis database migration information. the ministry agriculture brazil decided carry out compulsory growth record the beef cattle since march and realize growing condition supervision from birth the table. tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain the significance product quality traceability for enterprises the product quality traceability system not supervise enterprises, but help enterprises build brand images and improve social effect and economic benefit. the whole process traceability management not only strengthens quality management enterprises and reduces the cost error correction, but also facilitates enterprises collect commodity information, understand consumption trend and improve quick response capability. the fields circulation and manufacturing, especially the fields food safety, drug production and manufacturing some chemical products, the establishment product quality traceability system has become important means management for enterprises survive on. retail and manufacturing enterprises, such automotive and electronic products, when quality problems arise, establishing the traceability system, the enterprises may quickly find out relevant batches and key quality problems them and recall relevant batches products. the one hand, the enterprises can quickly deal with the problems consumers; the other hand, the enterprises can reduce losses arising from recalls. the significance product quality traceability consumers product traceability allows consumers comprehensively understand the lifecycle information products and make consumption more transparent. meanwhile, the establishment product traceability system can propose appropriate countermeasures reduce losses consumers when accidents due poor quality happen, that consumers' benefits can protected. for example, recall system the automotive industry based product traceability system. famous companies lay out blockchain traceability ant financial the blockchain technology developed ant financial technology lab will implemented and applied food safety and certified product traceability. according the introduction ant financial, milk powder products brands from australia and new zealand, such abbott, aptamil, wyeth and bellamy, have their own "id cards", namely, traceability code. users can know all information, including place origin, date production, logistics and inspections opening alipay app and scanning codes after buying milk powder products tmall global and receiving them. product anti-counterfeiting query with blockchain different from previous commodity information query typed merchants because blockchain has permanent traceability and difficult tampered, ensure the correctness information and records and prevent false information. previously, ant financial applied blockchain public welfare and mutual-assistance insurance. the former similar supply chain traceability principle. the latter mainly uses transaction transparency and nonrepudiation ensure trust. product anti-counterfeiting the third scene the implementation and application ant financial tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain blockchain technology. with the guidance and witness guidance the ministry agriculture, general administration quality supervision, inspection and quarantine the people's republic china, the ministry industry and information technology, china quality certification center, china chain-store franchise association and china animal agriculture association, jingdong will set "jingdong quality traceability and anti-counterfeiting alliance" jointly with brands the fields fresh food and consumption goods, such kerchin, shuanghui, jingqishen, wuliangye, huggies, wyeth and nestle. jingdong thinks data untamperability and existence proof time stamp that blockchain has can well support the traceability and anti-counterfeiting commodities. take fresh food example, the future, after shopping jingdong, users only need open app, find the order and click "one-click traceability" directly scan the traceability code the product for information traceability. take beef example, through the only traceability code the beef purchased, you can see which farm does the beef purchased come from, breed and age the cattle, the fodder, quarantine certificate number the place origin, enterprise information the processing plant, slaughter date, information pre-delivery inspection report, time warehouse, temperature and spot check report for storage. even delivery information for final delivery can traced and shown one one. therefore, illegal transactions and frauds may have nowhere hide and the users can eat safe food. zhang chen, cto jingdong group, said leader self-run e-commerce, jingdong mall has inescapable responsibility adhere building high-quality shopping ecosystem and technology will become important support for jingdong's high-quality shopping. ibm assists wal-mart wal-mart ensures the safety pork supply chain. china country high pork consumption. its pork consumption accounts for more than half pork consumption the world. the largest retailer, the first step wal-mart's global blockchain program ensure the security pork supply chain chinese market. this project uses ibm's blockchain technology based hyperledger, subordinate open-source software linux foundation, timely record product information, including farm source details, batch number, factory and processing data, date expiry, storage temperature and transport details, and information each process safe blockchain database. through implementation the project, wal-mart can check place origin the pork sells and the process each intermediate transaction from time time, ensure all the commodities are verified. tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain three different points from tac three blockchain businesses ant financial and jingdong serve their own platforms and are only open merchants within their platforms present. ibm's system systematic and integrated customized service directly provided for large- sized customers. however, cloud platform traceability open and win-win ecology developers. provides distributed communication nodes and perfect blockchain open platform the bottom, provides the environment and interface for developers quickly conduct development blockchain applications and serves global brand customers and millions small and medium-sized worldwide enterprise customers through developers' community which becomes stronger and stronger. addition, tac develops consumers through researching and developing dapp "thousand star city", grants rewards through behavior mining, and stimulate the consumer's activation and participation through computing power. the accumulation the consumers may improve the brand enterprise's interactive marketing and e-commerce sales and further attract more brand enterprise in. one difference point between the traceability chain from other several blockchain traceability businesses. tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain iii. fields covered traceability and anti-counterfeiting business and development plan traceability and anti-counterfeiting business field traceability and anti-counterfeiting business widely applied various social fields. please see following figure for detailed situations: figure application situation ... food safety food the first necessity the people. the food safety has rose major national strategy during the five-year plan period. with the implementation the most strict food safety law the people's republic china, various measures have been taken across the country relation food safety. among which, the construction food traceability system essential item food safety work. result, the market prospect food safety traceability platform considerable, and the industry will usher great opportunities. the establishment the food safety traceability platform ensures that the whole process the food from the field the dining table can traceable, and the circulation the fake and inferior products restrained large extent, and meanwhile, the digital dynamic tracking and monitoring system also established during the whole process foods production for the consumers. today, the establishment the traceability chain project innovation the founder team for themselves. the whole process traceability system, the dynamic tracking and monitoring system and the block chain technology are combined utilize the distributed storage the data the chain, and the characteristic non-duplication and alternation, the platform can construct tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain commodity full life cycle tracking and tracing system for enterprises from the raw materials the terminal consumers. the detailed information each procedure during commodity production recorded real time ensure the controllable source; the flow direction the commodity comprehensively tracked, the commodity circulation details are realized, and the defective products are recalled directionally, thus achieving the traceable disposition the products. when prevent and eliminate food safety hazard thoroughly, the fake and inferior products are eradicated from the source, the data basis provided for later consumers, thus strengthening the reputation the enterprise and the consumer's purchase confidence. the traceability chain team has reached the cooperative intention with the wild blueberry enterprise greater khingan mountains and jiaozuo wenxian yam, which has solved the problems traceability and anti-counterfeit blueberry and yam through the landing the traceability chain platform. additionally, with the attention the market block chain, docks the merchants with the mobile marketing and mobile e-commerce developers, the block chain blueberry and the block chain yam market full media propaganda and marketing will promoted, thus making the technology truly serve the market. ... medicine and health products the medicine industry more specific than other industries, first all, the audience different from the common consumption group, mostly old and weak patients; secondly, the product more professional, and common consumer does not have the discrimination ability. contrast, fake and inferior medicine and health-care products have flowed into the market, which caused great harm consumers, and the identification counterfeit and inferior products more difficult. cao guying, the national famous drug inspection and discrimination expert, said interview that considerable amount fake drugs are made professionals, and they are deceptive. large proportion them has effect, which can't cure the diseases and won't cause death people. there are also some drugs that illegally add hormones, chemical (western medicine) ingredients immediately reflect the 'effect', such health care products that claim 'therapeutic effect and reducing blood sugar'". which means, the patient and the families are difficult identify through their ability once the drug has launched into the circulation market, regardless whether the advertisement, trademark curative effect are viewed. the whole process tracing the traceability chain ensures that the quality the medical and health-care products ensured, and the dynamic tracking and monitoring system can solve the problem incorrect storage and impersonating replacement during the transportation and circulation processes, and the control the circulation details medicines makes easier achieve the emergency treatment and directional recall. the same time, also provides the references for the governmental administrations strengthen the means law enforcement and strengthen the market supervision, thus creating orderly medical and health care products market which free from worry for merchants and reliable doctors and patients. tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain the traceability chain team has reached cooperative intention with domestic well-known medical enterprise generate sub-chain for the enterprise through the traceability chain provide the full life cycle tracing and anti-counterfeiting and consumer interactive services for hundreds medicines the enterprise. addition, the tac team also negotiated with one national medicine group and started making relevant feasible research reports using blockchain technology upgrade and reform the all-life circle traceability and supplychain chinese traditional medicine. ... maternal and child products from milk powder vitamin balance, from cradle chewing gum, the parents are always tread thin ice. from family the minimum industry and society the maximum, all parents hope able bring the best food and supplies the baby. however, fake and inferior products always cling the demand and "profit". the quality problem domestic milk powder previous years made the consumers experience carry-over fear, and the good and bad overseas purchasing mixed together, and was more difficult for the parents choose. when shopping receipts have become the assistant tool fake goods enjoy the trust, what more can people believe? the traceability chain and the traceability anti-counterfeit platform introduces traceability from raw materials every procedure production and circulation, and the distributed storage technology ensures that all the data cannot changed and covered, the producer can monitor the production and circulation procedures through the platform any time, the consumers may realize the source raw materials, flowing direction products through the platform. with the mobile app, the consumers may even realize where the cows that produce baby's milk powder eat the grass, and where the cotton for producing the clothing mother adopted, combining the control the whole production and circulation process. traceability chain makes the parents free worry, makes baby healthy and returns the market the merchants. the traceability chain has signed memorandum cooperation with innovative brand enterprise maternal and child products, and will provide traceability and anti-counterfeiting solutions for the company's products after the traceability chain has been officially launched. ... cigarette and wine cigarette and wine are not the necessaries life, but irreplaceable hard demand. has been for long time for the demands cigarette and wine, with the development society, the increasing people's living pressure and the fermentation the unique wine culture china, the demand the market tobacco products has never been attenuated. and the brand products the cigarette and wine have marked prices, which can obtain the universal value certification the sales circulation range, and can even circularly used the circulating medium. therefore, the one hand, the one hand, the anti-counterfeiting the cigarette and wine has been paid great attention the producer and seller, and the aspect anti-counterfeiting technology, tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain absolutely walking front other daily commodities; the other hand, the production and sale the fake cigarette and wine industry has always been "keeping pace with the times", "following the tide", and presenting the situation that "no prairie fire can destroy the grass, shoots again with the spring breeze blows". there are more than dozen anti-counterfeiting marks for some brands cigarette and wine, however, the one hand, consumers have different purchases for purchasing and have limited identification ability; the other hand, the means making and selling fake products are different, and the effective, long-term and systematic anti-counterfeiting identification system has not been established all times. this case, synchronization monitoring system can trace the source and realize the two-way tracing show its capabilities. from the raw material supply the production and circulation, where the raw materials are supplied for which batch products, where the finished products are sold, and which batch product shall not sold which area, from the tobacco growers the manufacturer, from the manufacturer the distributor, from the distributor the retailer, from the retailer the consumer, all the procedures the production and circulation are traceable bidirectionally. the distributed ledger ensures that the data authentic and reliable, and absolutely impossible tamper with the fake and inferior products. the traceability chain team making relevant layout the field cigarette and wine, and has docked with several medium-sized cigarette enterprises and liquor plants, and striving reach cooperative intention the second quarter thus pushing the traceability chain land the field cigarette and wine. ... luxury and cosmetic with the development social economy, people's consumption level also upgrading accordingly. more and more people have the increasing demands consuming famous brand luxury goods and cosmetics. it's human nature love beauty, and various luxuries with the combination beauty, grace, nature and practicality are attractive for many people. however, luxury goods are named "luxury", besides the high quality, the price course expensive. for variety reasons, the price domestic luxury fully demonstrates the so-called "identity recognition" function, and has successfully made many buyers stop the counter. take the estee lauder "small brown bottle" eye cream the example, its cif price rmb, the import duty rate the consumption tax rate plus the cost during import process, the import dutiable price rmb., which nearly rmb higher than the cif price. the domestic circulation process, business tax, vat and urban maintenance and construction tax will paid, plus the advertising fee, the final retail price its direct operating store and sephora exclusive counter about rmb. and this price has successfully promoted the demand-hungry consumers transfer overseas online shopping. for most domestic consumers, the overseas shopping website and the shopping store taobao and for products overseas products have been complex mood love and hate. not tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain extinguished demands and inaccessible pit --- consumers need high-grade goods relatively reasonable cost performance, the online dealers and overseas shopping are providing such supply and service, which would have been win-win, but the operators were driven interests and consumers lacked discrimination. the lack transparency the process commodity purchase and circulation leads this "operational space", which what traceability chain devoted and capable filling. ... publishing and derivatives with the rise knowledge economy, intellectual property has become the core element market competitiveness. driven interest, the cultural industry has become serious area copyright piracy. the publishing industry early years, the internet creation and the derivatives industry recent years have suffered heavy losses under the infringement copyright. before, occurred the vendition meeting that the reader fans asked for signature with the copy pirated work, which made the author awkward position; while has become phenomenon that the works resources such online novels, games, music, videos and pictures which have been disseminated and downloaded freely, this situation, people can't realize that this abnormal and improper. however, this disorder not only hits the author's creative enthusiasm, increases the operating cost the operation agent, causes huge losses for relevant creators and institutions, but also impedes the formation the ordered market relevant fields. the users and audiences are accustomed free use, it's hard accept payment, and the so-called free often the most expensive. the good work requires the author devote lot time and energy his creation. without benign interaction and reasonable return, what damages the author's creative passion and creative ability, which can lead the final absence good works. when difficult find work worthy watching after searching the whole network, are paying the price for poor copyright protection when choosing hot movie but suffering from the bizarre plot, the strange transition, artificial dialogue and rough production. the traceability chain project has made brave attempt for the protection intellectual property, which not only the grasp the utilization trend the block chain technology, but also the positive response the market demand the society and market demands the protection intellectual property. the technical application traceability chain copyright protection can not only promote the consumers realize the whole creation and publishing process the commodity but also provide real evidence for the creation party and the publishing party maintain legal rights, and reduce the evidence cost the process maintaining rights the maximum extent. monitoring from the source the end, from the process the details, copyright infringement won't find the place hide. ... art collection art collection combines ornamental value and investment value. with the enhancement people's artistic levels, rapid spread auction prices artworks and media's promotion tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain treasure evaluation programs and activities, more and more people are eager enter the artwork market. the biggest difference between artwork market and other markets lies the default requirement the field for people's connoisseurship and aesthetic standards, which not only naturally enhances the admittance requirements art collection market, but also regards losses arising from authentication faults "tuition fees for entry". such industrial status and more and more new members undoubtedly make speculative counterfeiters see opportunity that can made use of. the choice artworks may vary from collector collector due their different aesthetic orientations. however, one will choose forged and fake artworks. art collection not only commercial activity, but also kind heritage and protection culture. cannot leave any operation space for counterfeiters because the so-called "industry characteristics" any other reasons. eliminating the false and retaining the true the issue that traceability tries achieve. from creation completion auction collection and circulation, records are kept for every step change artwork. each circulation can verified untamperable data. development plan the beginning, yuansu platform was founded prevent and completely eradicate potential food safety hazards, ensure the whole-process traceability food from field table and completely eliminate gorged and fake food. next, will make overall arrangements fields food, drug, baby and maternal products, alcohol and tobacco, luxury goods, cosmetics, publication, copyright and art collection, provide whole-process data for merchants and consumers and provide basis for government departments strengthen their means law enforcement and intensify their efforts market supervision. electronic commerce, automobile parts, building materials and governmental affairs processing and auxiliary query will the journey for the next step. the road extract something worth from miscellany and eliminating the false and retaining the true, traceability will trace the sources all the way and restore genuine and authentic market environment.. iv. technical architecture the technical architecture the traceability chain consists three parts: bottom chain, platform layer, and application layer the traceability. please see following figure for further details: tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain figure technical framework tac: traceability chain token, digital license the bottom layer the entire system, not only the fuel for information exchange the basic links, but also voucher for value transfer the entire ecosystem. dpoa: blockchain certificate various rights and interests assets, such the right use assets and ownership assets. shared host cloud plan uses file data storage solution based ipfs protocol ipfs based content storage, rather than file names. uses content addressing instead traditional addressing based ips and domain names. users needn't care about the locations servers consider the names and paths for file storage. ipfs based the only encrypted hash value calculated according its content. the same content will have only hash value. hash value directly reflects the content the file. when ipfs requested for file hash, may use dht find the node where the file located, retrieve the file and verify the file data. ipfs the infrastructure general purpose, the underlying storage based storage technology, and there storage limitation. can perfectly match with blockchain, the system can use ipfs process quantity data, store content ipfs network, then store corresponding hash into blockchain and print timestamp. this way, storing data ipfs and completing data pricing, right confirming and right transferring through blockchain can give full play data value. subchain management one the main functions the traceability main chain the subchain management, traceability subchain can created authorized account any time after the main chain runs. the creator can custom-make the detail functions subchain and specific information tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain subchain token according application requirements. these custom-made information forms data structure subchain, and releases information creating this subchain the main chain the means invoking smart contract main chain. this kind release needs deduct certain tac (including creation charge and service charge), thereby can recorded the block current period accounting node. this point, the information the subchain recorded the main chain, and then the subchain will regarded independent blockchain, which records the corresponding transaction records and related data all kinds business logic the subchain (pictures, audio and video data will stored the cloud host ipfs). because the tac transaction only recorded the main chain, the operation main chain independent the subchain. the nodes running the main chain only need save the main chain data, and only the consensus and verification the tac transaction block. tac, flexible subchain creation mechanism, determines that the subchain tailorable, the state the subchain has influence the completeness and security the main chain functions; besides recording the description information the subchain, the related data other subchains will not have effect the main chain. platform frame figure application platform frame ... basic blockchain operation-interface: adopt distributed cloud deployment, increase the stability and handling capacity the interface; support invoking rpc; support json data format; tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain smart contract: present, the contract layer the traceability chain has been fully developed, and cloud platform for the decentration traceability chain has been built. make easier for developers, complete the verification traceability anti-counterfeiting code, the inquiry logistics code based the contract, all which are smart contracts. the location traceability chain the public commercial application platform, the traceability chain will take different ways public chain (main chain) ecological integration and promote the formation with other smart contract platforms. the traceability chain will recruit and stimulate the third-party team (technology development company), build more actual and practical landing application projects based the traceability chain, the front-end audiences will ordinary consumers, and then will accumulate and precipitate large numbers fans for the brand enterprises traceability chain and subchain. ... various subchains functional characteristics subchain when the subchain created, can realize the customization general function through invoking the bottom interface the traceability chain, which can make the subchain support all the functional characteristics main chain, also can restrict not provide certain functional characteristics according application scenarios the subchain, thus the functional characteristics consistent with application scenarios demand specific subchain can quickly custom-made. functional characteristics supporting customization include subchain token transactions, transactions subchain token and main chain token, cross-subchain token transactions, subchain business transaction logic, pseudonym (aliases), voting system, account control, instant message, data storage, etc. subchain token transactions through customization, subchain can support the subchain protogenetic token transactions, transactions subchain token and main chain token, and cross-subchain token transactions. when the cross-currency transactions are conducted, the token holder puts forward transaction request, the transaction request information contains the types transaction (buying and selling), domestic currency type, target currency type, transaction price, and the number transaction, traceability chain agreement will make match and complete matching buying and selling means decentration, and the generating transaction record will recorded two crossing chains, compared with the traditional trading center, has the advantages publicity, fairness, reliability and traceability. consensus mechanism dpos the node consensus the bottom the traceability chain uses the dpos algorithm, and all blockchains are essentially deterministic state machine driven transactions. consensus tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain mechanism process agree determining the order transactions and filtering invalid transactions. many different consensus algorithms can produce the transaction sequencing with same effect, but dpos has run reliably many blockchains for many years, which proved strong, safe and effective consensus mechanism. like all consensus algorithms, the maximum damage possibly caused block producer review. the validity all blocks must follow the deterministic open source state machine logic. dpos algorithm summary the dpos algorithm can divided into two parts: how select group block producers and scheduling block production. the selection process should ensure that the interest holder has the ultimate control the situation, because when the network running abnormally, the loss the interest holder the greatest. since the selection process itself has little influence how reach consensus actually, this article will focus introducing how reach consensus after the block producer selected. order better explain this algorithm, assumed that there are block producers, and because reaching consensus requires majority make ruling all situation, this simplified model, the producer assumed the role breaking the deadlock. reality, there are more block producers. similar workload proves that the general rule the longest chain wins. any time, when honest node sees longer valid chain, will switch from the current bifurcation this longer valid chain. the certificate entrusted rights and interests (dpos) strong any case where can think natural network fracture, even when most producers are cheating. unlike some other consensus algorithms, dpos also can continue function when most producers are unqualified. this way, the community can vote replace the unqualified producers until the participation rate restored. cognitive domain, other renew algorithm can remain strong under such high intensity and variable failure conditions. the final analysis, the reason why dpos has such powerful security comes from the algorithms its selected block producers and verification node quality. the approval voting process can ensure that one person cannot choose alone and assign any producer even has valid voting right. the design dpos aimed optimizing the mechanism that the honest nodes the strong network connections participate the consensus. this allows dpos confirm the transaction within the average seconds and with determinacy, and simultaneously degrade elegant and detectable way, recovering from degradation normal just piece cake. application layer the early stage, the traceability chain provides general application protocol the bottom, develop different landing projects, and fastest make the blockchain benefit the masses. tacchain.io absorbed creating global biggest traceability public chain for most people, the goal using and developing blockchain not recreate set blockchains themselves, only wishes develop their own applications based the existing blockchain bottom technical framework. tac blockchain application program that provides the next generation platform, allowing the development and distribution blockchain application program based the traceability chain. tac provides easy-to-use interface and full-featured ecosystem. through tac, developers can build, publish, distribute and achieve aims the application program the supply system allowed use custom-made blockchain, smart contract, cloud storage and computational node. tac provides standardized program module and makes development template aiming different business scenarios. framework advantage available coexist with traditional central data system can realize the second-time business development without revising existing centralization system and realize the coexistence, natural switch overall migration the new businesses and original businesses. under the actual background that the blockchain lands, how realize much friendly upgrading and switch the key. visual intelligent contract generation template tac provides open intelligent contract template, open industrial contract template and intelligent contract generator for operators, which greatly lowers the intelligent contract making threshold and flexibility ratio and may enable more developers join the tractability chain ecology. available mix with mainstream technology frame together tac application and development can compatible with all mainstream technology frames present, adapt original technology frames the industries and save the migration cost. qualified for million-level daily processing
