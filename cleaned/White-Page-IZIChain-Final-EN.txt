about them, shun them recognize them, bitcoin and blockchain gradually became integral part our lives. blockchain still need improvement. blockchain's existing fundamental challenges transaction volume the number requests that system will process within unit time one the greatest challenges for present blockchain platforms. the average bitcoin processing time transaction per second. the average ethereum processing time transaction per second. this humble figure against visa's processing capability transaction per second. cryptokitties, simple operation app, significantly lowered ethereum's processing speed and and catapulted transaction fee. the same month, bitcoin witnessed skyrocketing transaction volume due price surge, turning down the whole system's processing speed and dramatically intensify transaction fee. light those incidents, safe conclude that existing blockchain platforms shares critical drawback: sudden increase transaction volume shall result increased fee and decreased transaction processing time. block time the average bitcoin block time, the average bitcoin transaction processing time, seconds. the average ethereum block time seconds. this also the time taken for transaction processed. transaction fee bitcoin transaction fee reached record high while ethereum's transaction fee reached its record the same time frame. now, these figured lowered and $,, respectively. root cause? the limited number transactionprocessing node against the sky-high number number transaction, causing transaction processing fee propel upward. bitcoin investors were forced accept the high price because low one may cause their transactions pending for, say, weeks months. transactions with higher prices are always prioritized for processing. elevated cost use turns out one the barriers that prevented blockchain from becoming popular application. also puts lot strain programmer developing free apps. the demands for free access and usage from users are ever-increasing, just like with website and mobile app. similar internet, blockchain technology needs support for free apps, helping blockchain widely applied, which, turn, providing programmers and businesses more opportunities create new services with value instead requiring users pay free for the use blockchain network. consensus algorithm the use proof-of-work consensus mechanism created competition between computers, leading compute capacity and power-consuming issues. the moment, bitcoin transactions' validation fee exceeded average city's power consumption, causing heavy waste. cross-chain transaction now, cross-chain asset transfer have not been available any existing blockchain platforms. the solution for asset transfer between different chains was the key for blockchain technology's applicability. block size visa's transaction processing speed around million transactions, which would consume roughly storage should this converted blockchain. this exceeded conventional computer's storage limit. user-friendliness existing blockchains are quite complicated use. most them aims those with sufficient knowledge about blockchain instead non-experience users. for example, smart contract programming using solidity ethereum quite complicated and not for everyone. attract more user, current blockchain platforms should apply simplicity philosophy and use-friendly approach, similar recent popular websites and mobile apps. what izichain? zichain public hybrid blockchain hyperlink platform providing blockchain custom solutions for financial markets with social and real-life applications. izichain allows users interact with smart contracts, participate smart contract completion via and big data mechanism, and operate blockchain-powered financial applications such asset digitization, digital asset trading, and loan offer and transaction. both individuals and entities may develop and provide standalone financial applications izichain's blockchain platform. izichai's application izichain completely change the way financial markets work financial asset and real asset digitization izichain's blockchain platform. izichain's expected financial market consists two main components: financial asset market: equity securities, fixed-income securities, fund stocks and payment instruments. tangible and intangible asset market: commodity, real estate, equipment and machinery with other tangible assets such business idea, technology license, brand... fund stocks equity securities common stocks mutual funds preferred stocks etf funds warrants hedge funds tokens asset-backed securities financial assets payment instrument fixed interest securities loans bonds financial lease convertible debts regulatory money-backed digital asset commodities real estate tangible asset machinery other tangible assets business idea technology model license intangibl asset brand other intangible asset izichain enables individuals and entities perform all functions financial market: invest individuals and entities with idle funds may find investments izichain platform via: ibo investment, loan using the global financial network app. look for loan izichain's financial network app help individuals acquiring loans for consumption purposes. companies may search for loan finance their businesses. government may seek funding for national infrastructure development activities. the loan could collateral non-collateral loan. bank pay lender (deposited money) blockchain help minimize this intermediate fee hold bank banks collect interest from borrower funding start-up companies and real estate projects may seek for ibo funding, which the type financing digitizing tangible and intangible asset using blockchain technology. digitized assets transforms existence into tokens, which have legal equivalent business cooperation contract (bcc). digital asset transaction investors may conduct digital asset trading asset exchange powered izichain technology. izichain ecosystem includes the following applications: asset digitization asset digitization (tangible intangible) for purposes: digital asset trading ibo funding collateral assest digitizat ion digital asset trading collateral digital asset trading market includes: digitized asset post-ibo standard token provide liquidity for digital assets and ibo investments highly secure and financially safe transactio issue and trade loan direct connection for lender and borrower blockchain and smart contract application transaction time and fee optimization credit-worthy model and big data application asset digitization asset digitization the process 'blockchainize' (tangible and intangible) asset input, which done automatically and decentralizedly. way blockchain technology application, the asset digitization could done decentralized, reliable, transparent, and traceable manner which does not require immediate third party. most tangible and intangible assets are digitizable. post-digitized assets could quantified, then into circulation, utilized for trading, transferring, used collateral asset apply for loan and issue other debt instruments such corporate bond... future, real estate constructions, houses, vehicles, all have the potential become tradable assets izichain network. digital asset exchange asset digitization and digital asset exchange are the two building blocks digital asset market, which, asset digitization forms the primary market (or issue market, which, digital assets are issued and available for the initial trades via ibo). digital asset exchange take the role secondary market (the trading market for post-primary market successfully issued digital assets). below are some functions digital asset market: act funding and capital flow channel between the over-funded and the underfunded: similar stock exchange, digital asset market also functions capital flow channel from over-funded individuals people looking for capital acquirement. entities need finance would conduct fund-raising issuing digital asset token for investors. these tokens would then experience open trading primary market and secondary market. could speculated that digital asset market would contribute the effective distribution capital economy, enhancing overall efficiency and productivity for the whole economy. digital asset markets would indirectly improve livelihood for both the funded and the funding. add liquidity for digital asset: digital asset markets provides mechanism for investors trade their digital assets the secondary market, which, turn, create liquidity for digital assets. without liquidity, investors would forced hold digital assets until their company going into bankruptcy, dissolve asset liquidation. the more developed the digital asset market, the higher the liquidity level. valuation financial assets: means the relationship between seller and buyer (market supply and demand relationship), digital assets' prices would defined. hence, digital asset market the place determine the prices for digital asset (or market "commodities), 'asset-valuation market'. encourage competition and improve business efficiency: digital asset market assetvaluation market, which encourages competition between businesses. community finance would transfer the businesses with highest efficiency. able survive and thrive, helping increasing value for digital assets owned investors and corporates, companies must strive for enhanced business efficiency. increase funding chance for companies and diversify investor portfolio: ibo new financial instrument created better meet issuers and investors' demands. ibo was created during the course blockchain's development and application existing business platforms benefit from legal advantages, helping companies acquire funding with decreased cost, providing facilitation for new companies, and market entry and faster funding opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprise, and avoiding costly loan and strict control from commercial banks and venture capital funds. addition, ibo give investors more options diversify their portfolios and minimize risks, improving financial market efficiency. revolutionary technical elements: along with blockchain and the most advanced technology platforms application, the digital asset market will throughly computerization, eliminating the immediate role depositories and payment agencies, reduce time taken and increase transaction volume the market. relieve centralized economic power: the digital asset market would contribute towards fairer re-distribution. breaking down investment and public ibo issue, the centralized economic power would relieved, pushing the economy step further towards fair and democratic society. the relieving centralized economic power would also create fairer competition conditions, improving economic growth and efficiency. lending market our targeted lending market would focus the lending. lending already has history long before banks were born. the past, due limited access information, lenders and borrowers have not always reached mutual direct connection. the appearance banks, acting the immediate agencies receive deposits and then use those deposits for lending activities, was the answer for the question about lending and borrowing demands. however, the enormously high cost maintain such institutions' operation adds lending interest rates imposed banks, raising significantly higher than borrowing interest rates, compensate for operation cost. besides, their credit evaluation and approval process are famously strict and consumes lot time, making inaccessible many those with demand. traditional lending model deposit lender deposit interest peer-to-peer lending model lend lend lending interest bank borrower lender lending interest borrower izichain provides blockchain platform operating the service model peer-to-peer lending with global network, optimizing all lending activities the blockchain platform. different countries and credit institutions may utilize their idle fund participate our system develop standalone lending system. the izilending peer-to-peer lending provide the following exceptional benefits for its users: loan approval process made short thanks database and smart algorithm application; interest made lowered against bank's lending interest for borrower; interest made higher against bank's deposit interest for lender; investors may utilize their digital asset izichain's blockchain other platforms lending and borrowing instruments izilending. superstructural application because one ever have the ability making everything themselves, from the old ages, trading became the ultimate need human and society. currencies were born and went circulation, facilitating trading process. the demand for trading has never been aggressively high the moment due the push and urge technology, however, there were still numerous unsolved trading problems that needs addressed. the businesses trading, from tangible and intangible commodities capital and currency, each has its own set characteristics. conducted thousands surveys with different social and class populations with various social roles. the result showed that one among them were really satisfied with the trading, transaction and payment systems they were using, some even express severe complaints. their voices were not heard. everything needed changed and there must someone it! -izichain- encountered challenges existing transactions have been experiencing serious issues: ownership verification, security, transaction fee, transaction speed... with details below. ... regulatory asset trading assets with verifiable ownership with and its owner benefits being protected avoid dispute the laws are called regulatory asset, namely real estate, trademark, share, option contract, commodity, commodity batch, business, ... they could traded between individuals and entities but the trading itself encounters lot real-life difficulties with multiple inconveniences. these challenges could sorted into main categories: time challenge and distance challenge. per the aspect time, trading process typically takes time perform, which could possible lasts forever. there are too many steps taken for small exchange. exchange parties must follow procedures legal document, certification, notary, contract... which could eat enormous amount time for waiting. disputes and deviations, should they happen, are troublesome reasonably settle, incurring additional costs. per the aspect distance, let's take example: you found really beautiful house the internet the other side the globe being offered really good price. after throughly studying, you decided buy because you really want own for later use when you are longer young holiday home just investment. you will encounter issues on, for instance, currency and nation difference. and, with certain contracts that needs identity verification and signature, you may even have take flight there and another one return after everything are settled, while you are busy person. this such heap inconvenience but you really want have right way. the whole situation are layers after layers hardship. so, what should you conduct regulatory asset trading regardless distance the quickest manner? ... digital asset trading centralized exchange this type exchange operates the interaction between users and servers. all assets, information history and data are stored centralized servers and controlled the exchange's internal staff. this type exchange shares the same critical operation risks with current traditional bank system. security: mt. gox exchange collapsed. the root cause that allowed hackers steal enormous amount money, possibly converting tens billions dollars current value were security neglect and lack responsibility towards investors. became the worst crisis the financial history bitcoin. problems encountered single exchange not just cause loss for certain individuals entities. badly impacts the whole market, with the most obvious reflection being price's downward spiral. along with gone everyone's trust blockchain. the problem does not lie within this technology alone but the tendency blaming the whole bitcoin thing for the malfunction single exchange everyone. hence, bitcoin usually bear the brunt sole exchange's bad example. the number victims not just few but uncountable figure. there are two main factors responsible for this chaos blame game: external factor, mostly hackers, and internal factor being the exchange's development staff. imagine that, one beautiful day, the huge fortune yours vanishes without reason. transaction fee: for some, transaction fee plays trivial role. however, for people practicing transaction regular and occurring basis and those with small amount capital, cost become crucial matter. there are typically two types fee: transaction fee and withdrawal fee, which varies from exchange exchange. add confusion the matter, some exchange even charges high amount deposit fee. the fees may look like trivial ones but overtime, they could amass into huge figure. monopoly: default, all information about the exchange and its capital are the hands its management. there are not single thing guarantee that they will play their game fair and transparent. they have total control over price gouging, regulating and controlling generate profit. most centralized exchange only acts market shaping and controlling institutions. some report study pointed out major exchange's fraud tricks transaction volume the world. and so, these exchanges are like the bank and users take the role player the game gamble they created. players may achieve victories here and there but ultimately, the bank always collect the biggest win over time. complexity: there are currently exchange designed for beginners, although fact, they are the main source interest. transactions are hard for them and discouraged them. there joy having blindly study every detail. some exchange even managed confuse even veteran traders how trade and call. nonetheless, for the sake demand, they would still study get hand the usage, wasting tons time the process. generally speaking, exchange' how-to quite complicated and troublesome, unlike iphone apple changing the world with just one button. legislation: the government china aggressively established bans targeting ico and cryptocurrency trading activities, causing many exchanges the country announced their shutdown. red became the dominant color the whole market that time. could concluded that, many countries all over the world, the government may govern exercise execution over centralized exchange, and may indirectly practice control over users, from personal information storage impose transaction tax. this eliminates the decentralization and privacy cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. decentralized exchange decentralized exchange directly operates blockchain, free from the control and management any server. user operation based direct interaction with blockchain with transaction history being permanently recorded data blocks. because transactions are controlled users, they exist their wallet. decentralized exchange fills most centralized exchange's gap. the rivalry between these two types exchanges resembles the competition between traditional bank and blockchain platform. however, because being imperfection-proof, decentralized exchange still hasn't secured total win over user' heart. speed: transaction speed decentralized exchange extremely low, this also drawback current blockchain platforms. there are massive amount transaction request, the exchange become overloaded, rendering itself unable process transactions and causing decline user's transaction quality due high latency. this results the low and insignificant number transactions these exchanges. hard use: decentralized exchange operate way that quite different from centralized exchange, causing difficulty and confusion for user. there has been lot frustration coming from traders these exchanges. interface: most decentralized exchanges' interfaces are not user-friendly, and featurelimited, with unpleasant even terrible interfaces. some are even obnoxious that one care look back after first glance. they not receive adequate priority and care design. poor functionality: let's take example: wants trade bitcoin with b's nano. the facilitation for their peer-to-peer settlement plays crucial and difficult role must satisfy the demand recording two transaction the same time different blockchains. able perform this task, different blockchains must equipped with correspondence, information synchronization, communication, and cross-trading capabilities. unfortunately, the first generation blockchain was not designed for this. moreover, the matter becomes impossible because block time and transaction speed varies from blockchain blockchain due their different technologies and algorithms. the number transaction pair decentralized exchanges trivial, which does not meet user demand. the moment, there has been number suggested solutions for above-mentioned issues, namely cross-chain with wanchain, on-chain atomic swap with litecoin and decred... they themselves poises material flaws and whether these solutions work not, only time can tell. ... cash flow trading there are type people: those having idle and redundant cash flow wants deposit for their future donate for other's futures take chance venture capital fund and those being lack cash wants have some money for investment and consumption. these two group compensates each others, connection and exchange opportunities should provide them. collateral, mortgage, guarantee and deposit the first place for most people with finance need the network local banks. mortgage collateral asset are required able obtain loan, with lot paperwork completion. loan application processes are time-consuming and interest rates are high. addition the matter, not everyone qualified for loan. time and cost are two major drawbacks. the other hand, for those with deposit need, process completion and deposit, withdraw and cancellation are inflexible and uneasy, with tons inconveniences and annoyances. inflation over time are taken into account, the earnings users gained are only enough help them avoid fraction inflation. the worst case, when the bank goes bankrupt, they may lose all their money. angel investor, philanthropist and fraudulent trading entrepreneur with grave need funding would trade anything for chance with potential angel investors. the business manages flourish, they will reap their benefit. fails, they are still happy about the amount money spent it. the securing measure for the loan this case future potential values. however, there catch: should the business achieve success, there still nothing guarantee that the benevolent angel investors will receive their rightful benefits the other party decide renege the initial agreement. another aspect, most the time, philanthropists who want provide aid for the places suffering from natural disaster, war poverty have come immediate agencies due distance constraint. there exists sad truth about our present society: charity money frequently does not reach their recipient full. they are secretly cut off help those not worthy receive the betterment they may bring. more than often, being kind and doing good deed not simple and easy seems. cause ... limit human and awareness aspects the foundation society benefit-based relationships. there practically nothing prevent individual entity from protecting their interests, generating their own profits ill-gotten gains. human greed knows bounds. those acts may cause damage for many others. the game finance, users and traders are the most vulnerable groups. they have way protecting themselves and often end becoming tool for other forces, suffering from endless harassment and exploit until they have nothing left. they have control over the game they play, even their money not their hand. they put their head block without even knowing. risks wait for them every corner: ban and restriction issued from the government, all users' money may one day going into the pocket bad people even their dishonest administrator. even benevolence ones with charitable deeds for lot others attracts vultures with their own agenda like moths flame. greed dangerous matter because does not take specific shape appearance. may emerge out nowhere and wreak havoc everywhere. trust, the other side, fragile thing because its uncertainty. these are the prevalent limits human and organization, and social awareness aspects. ... limit technology and legislation aspects not many take interest blockchain technology until recent years, safe assume that the prime time still on. all aspects the new technology are still incomplete state with lot flaws and deficiencies. decent human resources are lacking both number and interest. scores technical issues are still waiting for solutions, most which are unavailable the moment. major topics such optimization, expansion, speed and cost are still big concerns many experts. could only hope for better future. make matter worse, there are also large number bad examples caused several wicked individuals. their use technology for fraudulent and destructive purposes, shaping negative attitude towards blockchain the extend public denouncement and even official ban. the chaos brings about the underdevelopment great deal other technologies the near future. ... asynchronism between supporting technological apps the requirement migrating one cryptocurrency from wallet another, from wallet exchange, produces unnecessary inconveniences and additional cost. the reason lies the separation between blockchain, wallet and network exchange. they connect non-streamlined and inconsistent way, each with its own purposes usage. goal with extensive knowledge about user' struggles and their root causes, our team conducted hundreds thousands different surveys, met numerous traders, and finally found answer for all their needs. knew instant that the mission our hands: develop state-of-the-art blockchain app dedicated the trading art, combining the superiorities both centralized and decentralized architectures create the best product for user. "izichain". ... user-friendly interface removed unnecessary elements against other trading apps. izichain' interface boasts minimalistic interface with simple colors. ... easy use izichain allows super speed action. transaction could carried out matter few taps, even with beginners. drew inspiration from apple, the world-leading company design creativity. artificial intelligence was employed record user habit and provide precise suggestions, speeding actions and simplifying functionality. user would experience the simplicity and dedication from log transaction process and would definitely enjoy it. ... transaction fee there transaction fee izichain. user are also gotten enjoyed free-of-charge deposit and withdrawal. appreciate and practice great care for regular users and those with limited finance. non-profit the purpose and funding sustainability the ultimate goal the trading platform. ... optimized speed the practical architecture the exchange and blockchain was designed the optimum level produced near instant transaction speed, with delay interruption for users from anywhere. the smoothness preserved even when there are hundreds millions transaction request made the same time. superior speed are all what want give our users because they grew tired slow apps with high latency and constant lags badly affecting their transaction efficiency. ... fairness your asset izichain wholly belongs you and you only. one may control take them from you. izichain are formed the basis free trade market, with controller and complete transparency. prices are based public agreements between traders, not from governance manipulation. users are free own their assets, free trade and free set price. izichain has the capability become truly and completely free environment. ... maximum security enforce maximum security while maintaining simplicity, replace the traditional security measured, which based email, password and two-factor authentication (fa), with user fingerprint-powered account creation and verification for the login layer and password for the withdrawal layer. the old way security contains considerable amount vulnerability and may cause harm than good for users. they have memorize store their password somewhere safe but when they forget lost it, their security will stake. things may take turn for the worse when they somehow lose both email and fa. such because not attached them. with fingerprint security, each fingerprint unique and their owners have remember nothing. the time required for login and use will also dramatically reduces while security level and speed increase. solution accomplish expected achievements and goals, and address lingering problems, our team spent good measure time study and learn from previous technology solutions. breaking down those projects helped great deal acquiring knowledge and experience. came the realization that, right from the beginning, the blockchain technology were full huge gaps but, luckily, those were fillable using many other technologies, for instance the dag (directed acyclic graph)-based tangle structure implemented iota. aligning many technologies together, our team developed new and unique technology structure because previous structures did not meet izichain's ambition. are the course implementing this new technology and need quite lot more time finish it. our team's founder decided give the name 'hologram lattice chain' 'hlc'. ... hlc structure the hlc structure includes component chains and peer layers: citizen class chain (x) this chain created identify owner, each users unique and unchanged. its operation are shown the below graph: izi chain (y) this chain's duty update currency balance (izi). makes use block lattice which closely resembles the technology applied nano project. enables free transaction, limitless expansion and transaction super-speed. chain (z) (exchange property) the chain set define digital digitized asset ownership. asset chain with defined ownership, with asset block being perceived set objects with the same attribute. there are asset blocks distinguished: regulatory asset block and cryptocurrency asset block. the former must notarized for ownership verification for the sake its owner's benefits should dispute arises, and the latter non-controlled type without notary validation. each type requires different kind process. already have effective measure for both types. protection class (blockchain "t") for entities engaging activities such verification, notary protection (banks, governments, courts, etc.), special service providing and network maintenance. this class allows public database storage for ownership from actual verification for initial owners, assisting manifesting citizen class. trading izichain: overall structure: status(id; ep; izi) (ep are described with public properties) a's identity belongs the block numbered want sell the asset block numbered (foundation) with the price set at: (izi). has: (izi). b's identity belongs the block numbered agrees buy has: (izi). sell (n.id; k(p).ep; (n, buy (m.id; k(p).ep; (m, transaction process: (n, (m, error when executes buy, the transaction will automatically take place. similar the trading such asset bitcoin, ethereum, ... the moment those assets are transfered with success confirmation, the equivalent agreed izi will automatically returned without any influence from any agency interference from criminal. the hlc structure make izichain one-of-its-kind, not just mere digital trading app but truly e-commerce platform, allowing trading, dealing, advertising, and transacting commodity and asset. also open the door for future generations peer-to-peer digital bank. with izichain, you can buy anything with any currencies your choice. ... izichain system's main features digital exchange intended for users with the need for mutual trading digital asset, enabling fast and non-profited peer-to-peer transaction. initially, will maintain support for the most popular cryptocurrencies and will gradually add more overtime. real exchange intended for users with the need for mutual trading regulatory asset, regulatory asset and digitized asset, purchasing, advertising, leasing and more. regulatory asset will described and may found label, format and auction price. user may organize auction for any their real asset supported our system. the shared unit payment izi but customers may opt use other cryptocurrencies they want. izichain will penetrating every aspect life and society, making easier conduct business, trading and commercial activities. digital banking intended for users with the need for depositing funding, based peer-to-peer lending structure. user with deposit need may choose the smart
