red pulse rpx whitepaper jonathan ha, cfa stanley chao, cfa, caia july abstract today's information age, there shortage market data and financial research. yet, due historically entrenched market dynamics, the economics financial research production and distribution are dominated only few gatekeepers. this prevents independent analysts from having voice, while research consumers are forced accept whatever coverage already available. what market participants truly need context providing relevance addition scale. red pulse intends employ rpx mechanism fairly and directly incentivize research producers for their works, while providing research consumers with mechanism guide research coverage and provide fair compensation. motivation china's economy already the largest the world terms nominal gdp [], and terms purchasing power parity (ppp) []. however, market for investment and industry participation, remains incredibly difficult understand. this disconnect presents huge opportunity platforms and services that can bridge this informational gap. the problem made all the more challenging solve several critical circumstances. research content ecosystem broken the research content ecosystem exists today broken. the economics the research business has become dominated few key players content production (sell-side research []) and content distribution (major financial terminals []). smaller and independent research producers lose, all financial institutions, both large and small, that are forced into the "all-you-can-eat" pricing model. information accuracy and transparency while sources information china's financial markets and industries abound, information accuracy and transparency are ongoing problems. common theme for china market pundits and reputable news sources report market rumor the morning, only have denied the afternoon. it's difficult know who and what trust, amongst all the noise. information overload china has leapfrogged ahead into becoming one the most mobile- and internet-connected societies the world [], market information has now not only become ubiquitous, but well excess what average analyst can humanly process. this information overload phenomenon [], while not unique china, has made the job analysts all the more difficult. solution: sharing economy for research red pulse solves these issues creating groundbreaking research content platform that simplifies incentives and directly compensates research producers for their valuable insights, while ensuring research consumers can access the research that most relevant them. independent analysts and market commentators can now contribute their ideas and insights ad-hoc basis, and compensated accordingly. rpx the underlying mechanism used facilitate this ecosystem, and provides rpx holders with direct participation the rise china's economy. what red pulse does red pulse market intelligence platform covering china's economy and capital markets. creating global community around common interest, incentivizing participants produce truly relevant research, and providing technology-enabled analysis tools, red pulse seeks solve the problem that all face today: information overload. scaling the research process figure research process are building new content production, distribution, and consumption platform focused initially china's capital markets, oft-mentioned, but little-understood market that set become the most influential market the world []. recognize that incumbent platforms are well-entrenched the financial system, and not seek directly challenge this. red pulse offers alternative, complementary research platform that seeks address unmet needs, which there are many, when concerning china markets. contribution from independent research analysts independent and fresh research will voluntarily contributed industry experts, active investors, and market watchers, often filling the market coverage gaps that are left more traditional sources, such sell-side equity research firms. helping grow independent financial community focused china through high-quality analysis, contributors will receive payment for their work, the form rpx, that enables the incentivization system that drives the platform. combat the problem information accuracy and transparency, research contributors will designated with system-generated credibility score, which calculated based the accuracy and quality past research determined readers and the red pulse editorial staff, and general popularity the contributor's works. hypothesis insight creation our solution the problem information overload then rests two principles. first, research consumers have the opportunity create research "prompts," indicating their interest new relatively thinly-covered topics, paying adjustable amount rpx. the greater the contributions, the higher the indicated demand. consumers may also trigger special rights such exclusivity for adjustable periods time, paying above minimum threshold, they are the originator the prompt. second, red pulse employs machine learning technology highlight new market events that may significance both research consumers and producers, while making topical recommendations both agents, based past individual user behavior. this helps prioritize certain topics individual user-level basis that have higher likelihood relevance. this cloud event data feed will offered both research producers and consumers starting point for potential coverage and analysis. why blockchain? reducing frictional costs traditional methods transferring capital incur relatively high transactional costs (often ranging from along with flat fees regardless transaction size) due banks and other financial intermediaries having address counterparty risk and settlement and clearing costs. using rpx significantly reduces these costs, especially the platform engages large amount relatively small payments. creating system record the blockchain ledger publicly-verifiable record that can used confirm that content producers our system have been fairly compensated for their works. research consumers will also have confidence that payments have gone towards research content that they selected, with dependable system-of-record always available accounting their usage. solving the "cold start" problem finally, employing rpx the underlying mechanism for our open research platform solves the "cold start" problem: convincing enough independent analysts and commentators contribute the platform, while convincing enough research consumers (e.g. finance professionals and financial institutions) use the platform. both cases, one party unwilling participate there not enough activity and usage the other party. solve this, rpx used immediately incentivize and reward research contributors, thereby seeding the platform with enough valuable content that would attract critical mass research consumers. with more consumers, the platform gains popularity, thereby increasing the exposure research producers, and their corresponding rewards. why our own rpx? building community establishing rpx allows create common language and value system that can build community around. ultimately, this becomes rallying point, and will attract new participants, both research content producers and consumers the red pulse platform. our platform also introduces the concept research prompts, which allow research consumers request new research content specific areas, similar request for proposal (rfp) process. payment scaling issues major digital assets, such bitcoin ethereum, have issues with scaling, each payment, matter how small, incurs transaction fee. our content platform thrives the concept micropayments exchange for small chunks research content, these fees can quickly add up. rpx allows both content producers and consumers keep running "tab", and setting thresholds for automatic manual asset exchanges, thereby minimizing the frequency transactions and reducing aggregate fees. managing the monetary supply finally, establishing rpx our own underlying software protocol driving the content ecosystem, red pulse company can manage the supply, which needed ensure the fairness the payments system and research content price setting that commensurate with real world compensation for similar work produced professional research analysts. rpx purpose research producers rpx used incentivize and compensate research producers for producing relevant and valuable research china's financial markets. better analysis results greater popularity terms net upvotes, which then rewarded with more rpx. repeated game, research producers' credibility score will also factor into the amount rpx earned for piece research content. responding research prompts will also allow the research producer earn minimum, preset amount rpx put for bid interested research consumer. this addition any additional rpx earned net upvotes, determined the system. or, the research consumer may opt "lock-up" selected article responses the prompt for adjustable periods time, with longer periods requiring higher amounts rpx. our platform both english and chinese, translators can also receive portion the rpx payout, reward for work done. the accuracy the translation will also determined net upvote downvote voting system. research consumers rpx used drive our ecosystem, and relies primarily upon research consumers determine relative amounts for each article. rpx can also acquired content consumers that wish further increase the baseline rpx reward attached research "prompts" that are initially funded the red pulse platform. doing will prioritize certain research "prompts" more lucrative for content producers. holding rpx will give consumers additional benefits: greater voting power, which can used upvote research articles. upvotes will also have multiplying effect rpx earned content producers. users that have been verified from financial institutions will have greater voting power, planned -to- ratio versus standard users. early access content from research producers with higher credibility scores users initiating research prompts with rpx will give those users exclusive access temporarily other stakeholders red pulse platform: rpx becomes the common language and rallying concept for the red pulse community, while also facilitating the transaction mechanism that makes our new content ecosystem possible. red pulse company: rpx price control mechanism that used the company ensure fair compensation for research and analysis. the company also earns commission that levied each rpx transaction. rpx mechanism rpx supply rpx will have supply with nominal value usd ,,. this represents the total rpx created. inflation the supply rpx will increase over time rate per year. half this provided proportionally current holders rpx the red pulse platform anti-inflationary measure, while the other half used provide payment content producers the platform. rpx held "off the platform" wallets, exchanges, and other locations, will not receive the anti-inflationary measure help offset the effects the annual inflation. the inflation rate will gradually adjusted downwards, there deemed enough additional rpx circulation provide reasonable rewards for new research content. rpx used payments payment for content production: content producers will compensated per-article basis rpx. the specific amount rpx will determined credibility score, prompt rewards, and article popularity (description calculation methods challenges section). payment for translation and other tasks: platform participants may also act content translators, from either english chinese chinese english, the cases where the original author has only posted their content one language. translations will also rated and ranked there more than one version, with rpx distributed the top ranked translation. other platform tasks may defined the future, for which there will also rpx compensation. rpx refunds: certain cases, rpx may refunded platform participants. for example, prompt has gone unanswered after weeks time, any rpx that was paid research consumer(s) will then refunded the payer(s). other cases may arise that will necessitate refund, but typically will follow minimum period weeks before this takes place. current platform: market fit red pulse already has operational research content platform www.red-pulse.com and ios mobile app (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/red-pulse/id), focusing china's markets and economy from event-driven perspective. capture major macroeconomic, regulatory, corporate action, and m&a and cross-border events that deem have the potential for significant impact specific companies, industries, the economy large. date, the platform built only for our internal employees generate and publish content our clients. our intent transform this into open research platform, with rpx its underlying transaction mechanism. data sources the company employs combination traditional research techniques and advanced technology such machine learning and chinese natural language processing (nlp) facilitate the collection, classification, and analysis major china market events and trends. our data sources include but are not limited to: regulatory announcements government policies corporate disclosures press releases news articles social media figure red pulse web platform china's markets continue reform and

investment environment. follow major government and regulatory bodies, providing analysis relevant policies that may have impact sectors and companies. institutional investors retail investors contrast more established financial markets such the and europe, where institutional investors make more than participants trading activity [], china's stock market figure red pulse ios app activity dominated individual investors, representing estimated all trading activity []. although investors are very quickly becoming adept developing their own investment strategies and views, most investors are newcomers the market and have only few years experience, given how nascent china's capital markets are, and the relative short period time that individual investors have been given access. furthermore, individual investors often not have access choose not employ the services professionally-trained wealth manager. consequence, large proportion stock buying and selling decisions retail investors are heavily swayed news, events, and rumors, rather than basing investment decisions economic fundamentals []. our expertise tracking events across the markets allows select the important and relevant information, while discarding rumors false reports. platform coverage the red pulse platform currently covers market events spanning several key sectors, including banking, brokerages, insurance, asset management, real estate, internet, telecom, semiconductors, consumer goods, travel hospitality, food beverage, aerospace aviation, and energy. subscribers can access our research

sectors. the feed consists short-format notes that are differentiated from traditional equity research, that are purely event-driven. concise two paragraph format consisting synopsis and contextual analysis sourcing primarily from chinese language sources, ensuring timeliness focus confirmed reasonably vetted facts, rather than market rumors these event notes are published both english and chinese, with cited sources, along with tags based industry, sub-industry, topic, event type, company, region, and others, with custom china-market focused taxonomy over tags. this allows for precise search and querying our entire years archived market event notes, via solr implementation faceted search engine our client web portal, well custom push notifications tag our mobile app. current clients our clients include major investment banks, asset managers, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, exchanges, and other institutional investors, validating our platform and value proposition providing timely and relevant market intelligence china. the key challenge continuing expand our research coverage based demand from our clients, while maintaining the quality the analysis and minimizing operating costs. sharing economy for research solve this challenge, will create direct-incentivization ecosystem facilitated rpx, thus creating global community contributors, free the physical confines office spaces and employment contracts, while minimizing operational risks and costs for the company. with this open platform, the format research notes will also liberalized yet standardized, starting with several templates: market event research note employed current platform company-specific research article industry sector-specific research article macroeconomic research article users the new platform the same time, red pulse can maintain quality providing editorial oversight the platform structure, administering fair and transparent incentivization system, and vetting and approving select research producers expert-level contributors. rpx helps align the interests research consumers and producers, directly addressing the increasing demand for china market insights, and thus benefitting from the rise china's economy. users the platform are generally research producers, research consumers, both simultaneously. other tasks such editing and chinese-english translation work will also earn rpx according system-defined algorithm. new platform expansion developing and implementing rpx and the open research content ecosystem requires significant capital investment. aim seed the initial interest and usage the platform itself the early stages. users our platform and rpx are very likely the same demographic people that are interested, already active, china's capital markets. new platform challenges building new content distribution and ecosystem with research produced scale independent users, and monetized based quality, relevance, and usage, faces major, yet not insurmountable challenges. subjective content nature, analysis and opinions voiced research content subjective, and what considered relevant changes depending the preferences the reader. better organize high-quality research, the platform will organize the articles category and then popularity. popularity rank calculated using combination metrics: author credibility score editorial staff reviews page count average reader time spent article comment activity red pulse's machine learning algorithms, along with its advanced search and customization features, will also help readers find more relevant and interesting research based past user behavior. rankings manipulation popularity rankings can subject manipulation from fraudulent clicks views. lessen the impact page views popularity ranking, will use several methods emphasize legitimate activity driving rankings: research article views: the easiest track, but will also need account for accidental misclicks articles that are viewed for only few seconds. combatting fraudulent views may arise from malicious users creating multiple accounts increase views. this will combatted tracking ips and devices, and banning ips entire ranges extreme cases. view growth over time will factored in: measure the velocity page views. articles with large views short period time will ranked higher due the "viral velocity" such articles. views over time: measured percentage daily, weekly, monthly article views percentage total views. length time spent article: article views must reach minimum viewing time, which will depend the length the article. too brief, and may miss counting the score towards the article. however, this metric can still gamed clicking the article and leaving open, although the impact limited how many malicious users engage this per article, which will minimized and device tracking. article activity: will also measure clicks the user (highlighting, mouse clicks) scroll activity, how many times article shared, and number comments. editorial review: staff can give additional points the quality the analysis. initial submissions must meet minimum standard order published. however, further reward outstanding analysis, in-house staff can reward more points. gaming and manipulation popularity metrics can never eliminated, but the combination quantitative and qualitative metrics above can help improve the effectiveness the ranking algorithm. credibility score calculation credibility score for each author calculated the platform, and demonstrates readers which contributors are more established and whose research can more reliable. several metrics will determine the score, which out total points: popularity articles: greater number popular articles will increase credibility score. article view count over time: growing view count over time, while also taking account number total articles written, will increase credibility score. quality past articles: editorial staff will look through past articles determine accuracy forecasts, predictions. upvotes paid using rpx. plagiarism red pulse has strict policy forbidding any degree plagiarizing our platform. users found violation this may have their account revoked and banned from our system. remaining balances may may not paid out, depending the severity the case. that being said, research content (themes, ideas, partial entire articles) could copied, plagiarized, otherwise misappropriated from other existing articles the platform, from external content sources such news websites blogs. regarding similar content the platform, red pulse will monitor articles that have been found semantically similar using chinese nlp and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. another form plagiarism when authors intentionally re-post their own content, similar enough derivative content more than once. the same natural language processing engine will used identify such activity, order ensure users are not attempting get paid more than once for the same content while spamming the platform. this particularly critical for research prompts that have exclusivity time lock-ups, which would become problematic, should authors repost the same analysis multiple prompts. regarding plagiarism external content, the red pulse editorial staff will review the articles enough users have flagged potentially violating our anti-plagiarism policy. furthermore, our system becomes more sophisticated and able scrape external content websites for archival purposes, will use this identify any newly posted articles that may have been plagiarized part whole. existing platforms blockchain-based content platforms there are existing blockchain-based content platforms that have pioneered the use case incentivization mechanisms for content creation and distribution. steemit.com [], based steem, has developed novel way incentivize social media content creation, similar reddit.com. although there are several key differences, have borrowed several concepts from the steem steemit.com platform including: net upvote downvote system based vote per rpx rather than vote per user squared proportional reward distribution function that weighs the rewards more towards the top-voted research content, but still allows everyone earn something scheduled increase rpx circulation supply rewards for new and existing research content pre-determined anti-inflationary mechanism for existing rpx holders that are willing commit holding period, also provided scheduled increase rpx circulation traditional financial research platforms expanding beyond the content distribution systems from above, also consider traditional financial research platforms. not seek directly compete against established platforms, such bloomberg, thomson reuters, factset, s&p capital iq, but complement research those platforms. opposed traditional sell-side equity research reports found those platforms, our content comes from independent investors, researchers, and market participants. the intent provide coverage currently thinly-covered industries, sectors, companies, and topics, dictated the research consumer community. web-based user generated content platforms other sites, such seeking alpha and similarly china-focused xueqiu.com, have user generated content. however, differ from these sites several distinct ways: seeking alpha: red pulse specializes china's financial and capital markets, whereas seeking alpha's content and readership primarily aimed towards us-based stock markets. top authors are compensated per-article basis, presumably from the site's advertising revenue. xueqiu.com: all content written chinese, creating barrier for non-chinese reading audiences. authors may tipped readers for good content, but this not guaranteed and not consistent form compensation. disclosures and conflicts interest authors are subject red pulse's information disclosure standards. personal positions stocks any conflicts interest must disclosed authors and agreed writing. ethical standards red pulse employees are required follow the highest ethical standards. employees are forbidden from front-running any yet published research and forbidden from abusing their position red pulse (knowledge, access, authority) for personal gain. internal compliance team will established, with separate reporting line the board directors, ensure adherence these standards. rpx risks rpx not intended investment vehicle. rpx the underlying mechanism that drives the red pulse open research platform, and supporting rpx vote confidence the success our platform. that being said, there are several risks that all users should aware of. project risk with any project, the development and execution our platform carries with the risk delay and even failure. the core team has strong track record development and business management experience, but this not guarantee success. the team will endeavor hit the milestones outlined the project roadmap, and will transparent possible regarding our progress and any challenges met. cryptocurrency risk nature,
