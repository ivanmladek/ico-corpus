atlas protocol light paper defining blockchain interactive adver tising marketing version: motivation with the rapid growth the blockchain industry are seeing continuous rollouts blockchain projects. however, today, there very little interaction can done blockchain other than balance transfers. even though have smart contracts that enables dapps, good mechanism for information transferring and discovery still defined. there are prior attempts trying solve digital advertising's problem with blockchain technology, however, blockchain economy has its own advertising problem solved. impractical promote blockchain projects internet since digital advertising industry can not profile blockchain addresses and current blockchain could not support complicated interactions required advanced advertising practices. hence better infrastructure needed help define ways identifying, activating users and conveying information along with value. nebulas labs (nebulabs) and xgoogler blockchain alliance (xgba) has jointly incubated atlas protocol (atp) close this gap the blockchain ecosystem. atp tasked build blockchain native interactive marketing infrastructure enable information flow freely chain and also explore new ways on-chain interactions. protocol overview atlas protocol proposed new blockchain native media for value ranking and circulation via advertising. atp aims connect advertiser, publishers(e.g, dapps), blockchain users with on-chain interactions via atlas ads. tie atr udp atlas protocol components includes: transaction interactive element (tie): interactive elements build top blockchain transactions atlas targeting rank (atr): value ranking mechanism based on-chain activities user data protection incentive (udp): mechanism protect user privacy from abuse well include users into the value circulation rewarding user for engaging on-chain interactions. protocol: transaction interactive element atlas protocol, transaction interactive element (tie) defines generic structure for users blockchain interact with each others besides transfer transactions. worth noting that tie also defines how one can proactively reach other blockchain users on-chain with information and interaction intent. the protocol itself defines: generic interaction structures that could specialized for different scenarios tie data structure and related storage transportation guidance how interpret tie data end user facing channels smart contract interfaces for record tie interaction data blockchain address brand advertising address tie survey voting viral marketing address hash: cd....a from: address to: address value: nas address address address protocol: atlas targeting rank atlas targeting rank (atr) aims navigate advertising information the ever growing blockchain network and make sure reaches the most wanted audience. smart contract addr atr defines value ranking mechanism for addresses that is: address address based on-chain activities addresses specialized for advertising used increase the overall roi on-chain promotions addr every address' atr value updated periodically, and relatedness among user and multiple candidates are calculated dynamically during match. addr smart contract protocol: user data protection atlas protocol ascertains that user data belongs user themselves, and value user contributed data through interaction their contribution the ecosystem rewarded. hence user data protection (udp), the protocol specifies the follow details: ways using blockchain technology and other security measures ensure user data. privacy, including that atp user profiling will not use risky traditional technologies such cookies. mechanism make sure atp applications complaint with data protection regulations such gdpr. guidelines for distributing incentives user acknowledge their data contribution. use cases: atlas smartdrop the era blockchain advertising, airdrop new way promotion that native blockchain, however, current solutions all rely internet for spreading the word and does not have good targeting hence are costly and inefficient. with atlas smartdrop, one can rely atr for selecting targeted audience on-chain base their need and proactively reach out onchain addresses with information, engagement intent well token rewards, hence making the whole process highly efficient, yields great roi. airdrop
