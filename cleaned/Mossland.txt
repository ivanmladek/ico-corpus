virtual properties landmarks from the real world. mossland utilizes the in-game currency moss coin (moc), erc- based cryptocurrency, run the in-game economy. through the platform, virtual properties are bought and sold, auctions are conducted, and accessories can created the form erc- tokens. the effort users put into virtual property (upgrading virtual property, applying accessories, increasing user check-ins etc.) can also stored the erc- format advanced form blockchain technology. users will have simultaneous ownership virtual properties and accessories all the services under the mossland platform. instead making individual gaming environment with their own virtual properties and ownerships, game producers will have access market with sufficient number users and convenient virtual property trading system choosing mossland their platform develop their own services. new blockchain technology with higher performance and correspondingly lower transaction fees introduced after mossland launched, mossland may converted blockchain-based platform and all mossland's assets would then become on-blockchain assets. figure real-world property with player-added accessory mossland: the auction virtual landmark auction service mossland: the auction auction service where users can trade virtual landmarks, the core assets the mossland platform. users can participate the auction win landmarks provided mossland and eventually resell them other users for moss coin (moc) through the open auction. transactions mossland: the auction are executed using moss coin, mossland's

mossland and landmark owners can earn advertisement fees hosting advertisements from hosts mossland's world their own property. the advertisement fee (usually moss coin this case) will divided among mossland, the owner the landmark and users who watch the advertisement. users seek for treasures, they will naturally exposed the advertisements, resulting high overall conversion rate. mossland: the auction and mossland: the hunters are services under the mossland platform which means that they use the same virtual property values. one aspect, these two services can seen the alpha versions mossland: the city will released advance pre-validate some main features mossland: the city improve game quality and broaden the initial user base. mossland: the city virtual landmark management and gaming service mossland: the city location-based gaming service focused collecting and managing virtual landmarks. upon winning landmark mossland: the auction, landmark owners can manage their buildings controlling various features such decorating their properties with digital accessories. users can also communicate with other landmark owners users chatting and checking into buildings etc. our player base expands and service launches various countries, the virtual property market will continue expand with new landmarks and functions such accessories and gradually increase the engagement third-party contributors using mossland's ecosystem. figure mossland: the auction. exchanges are made using moss coin mossland property trading and currency mossland: the auction provides auction and in-game currency system which enables users trade virtual properties among themselves. with the implementation such features, developers may able easily create games where users can deal with virtual assets. this can implemented games that need auction system and provide easier environment for mossland and third-party developers make games based landmarks and assets. trading players can buy, sell, and exchange properties with other players mossland: the auction. all transactions are moderated open auction system where direct exchanges between players are allowed order ensure that all exchanges are fair and take place within mossland. currency mossland's economy may ultimately governed three currencies: gold, gem and moss coin (moc). each currency has different value and slightly different use case. gold the most common in-game currency which would generated the gameplay and spent users without any supply control. players could acquire gold through check-ins, missions and in-app purchases. therefore, the total supply the gold can only controlled indirectly through game contents. gem premium in-game currency used for buying premium features and items the game. gems are only given out through certain events acquired through in-app purchase. like gold, the supply gem only loosely controlled since there limitation in-app purchase. moss coin the in-game currency used mossland for players purchase and exchange virtual property. players can purchase moss coin through cryptocurrency exchanges with other cryptocurrencies such bitcoin and ethereum through in-app purchases. however, once the total amount moss coins available for in-app purchase runs out, players will longer able purchase moss coin and will only able acquire externally markets through property sales mossland: the auction. each moss coin transaction mossland: the auction will also have associated transaction fee, which will collected the mossland team. transaction fees will partially redistributed the game locked mossland's cold wallet moderate the in-game economy. table currencies mossland figure currency flow moss coin location based services mossland may provide various location-based services (lbs). lbs became popular result the gps functionality our personal mobile devices. widespread adoption gps functionality led the creation and popularization location-based social networks and mobile applications, such foursquare. users can "check in" physical locations, compete with friends and other users the network own virtual version the physical location. following the first-generation check-in services, facebook and google began rapidly integrate similar functions into their existing social graphs. while first-generation services such foursquare, gowalla, and mytown remained popular, the advancement mobile hardware promised additional augmented reality functions. ingress' launch followed pokemon go's launch both hinted the development more engaging and social feature driven application the near future. through the lens pokemon go, integration our physical world with virtual counterpart started become near-future reality and established the foundation for surge interest and development. mossland: the city attempts build the compelling check-in model first established services such foursquare, while also integrating many the collection and gameplay elements found ingress and pokemon go. giving players the ability check-in, claim, and manage virtual properties, mossland: the city planning use technology. players are not just incentivized check-in properties more often, but explore and discover ways promote their properties other players, thus creating dynamic, player-centric attention economy paired with more traditional virtual real estate economy. put more simply, every aspect mossland: the city's design anchored the goal creating more engaging social virtual world. check-in check-in one the foundational actions mossland: the city. players can explore their location and check-in into any nearby buildings. players are rewarded with gold items and can use these resources purchase and develop their assets. while traditional check-in services such foursquare are designed enhance existing social graph, mossland: the city attempts add more value every check-in, further encouraging players check-in into nearby buildings often possible. property property mossland: the city finite virtual asset tied real-world real estate. unlike foursquare, which points interest (poi) were originally player-registered, mossland: the city will utilize existing map and location data ensure that properties aren't duplicated and can controlled only single player any given time. this necessary order create working property economy mossland: the city, ensuring incentivization both ownership and check-ins. figure check-in nearby property accessories accessories are digital graphics that can added landmarks. users can add accessories upgrade and enhance the value their landmarks attract players check-in. purchasing accessories and adding them properties require in-game currency and time. however, accessories allow landmark owners display their progress other players visually showcasing their success their properties. this type boasting important part for both advertising their properties and providing new players with guide when they first step into mossland: the city. moreover, accessories play integral role that encourages both new and experienced players actively participate the game. example, unmodified leaning tower pisa would appear the same the real world mossland: the city. however, player adds the "pteranodon" accessory the property, other players would able see pteranodon flying around the tower. the property owner benefits from additional check-ins due the accessory, the owner can upgrade the pteranodon dragon, further increasing the benefit other players for checking into the property and increasing the rewards the owner receives from each player check-in. figure accessory the physical size accessories also affects the value properties and number check-ins. this because digital accessories are based the player's device's cameras, which means that bigger buildings with larger accessories will more likely attract users. figure large properties and accessories can seen from distance accessories are also associated with unique rewards, encouraging players seek out properties with specific accessories according their specific needs. figure accessories provide in-game reward addition visual effect mossland: the city users may earn rewards not only through check-ins but also interacting with accessories tapping them. hereby, accessories become definite reward factor for both property owners and players checking properties. each accessory may also have unique visual effects and animations both their idle state and after direct player interaction. items items may created integral part the property and the accessory acquisition process. players may collect items through check-ins, accessory interactions and property ownership. items are semi-random and have rarity. the cost accessories will scale with their rarity, making common accessories easy acquire, while the rarest accessories will require very rare items and significant ingame currency purchase. all the services using mossland will share the virtual properties. for instance, when user purchases building using moss coin mossland: the auction, the owner also the owner the building mossland: the city which means that the owner can execute owner's rights such attaching accessories the building. conversely, buildings acquired mossland: the city can sold mossland: the auction. additional platforms compatible with mossland: location based pp(peer peer) advertising platform(mossland advertising platform) global advertising markets are controlled small number large players with the capital necessary afford access players and markets, making difficult for smaller advertisers gain foothold the market and reach their audience. the mossland advertising platform empowers local businesses advertise directly players their vicinity, making easier for restaurants, shops and other retail businesses find their targets and bring players into their businesses. the basic structure the mossland advertising platform outlined figure figure mossland advertising platform, high-level any mossland: the hunters and mossland: the city player would able run advertisement campaign paying advertising fee the owner any property obtained through mossland: the auction. however, will obviously more economical the building was owned the client itself. player submits advertising campaign another user's property, the owner will need approve before commencing the campaign. all advertisements can reported inappropriate harmful players and moderators. the mossland advertising platform cpa (cost per action) platform, resulting cost and payment based when players interact with the advertisement the specified way (view, click, visit, register, purchase, etc.). the largest portion the advertising fee will paid directly the players who interacts with the advertisement, while the remainder split between the property owner and mossland foundation (in the form fees). most importantly, would create opportunity for players acquire moss coin without having spend money exchanges through in-app purchases. this will instigate more players participate and earn incentives mossland: the city resulting greater number active members the community. the mossland advertising platform would become one the first micro advertising platforms integrated into services based virtual property markets. enabling any player create advertisement the services, mossland advertising platform attempting democratize access customers and enable hyper-local advertising, all which are result mossland: the auction. players will able start, stop, and evaluate the success their advertisements using simple management tools supported the game. figure examples augmented reality advertisement moss coin summary moss coin erc- token based ethereum. table moss coin moss coin usages mentioned players will use three different in-game currencies mossland: the city. the third currency, moss coin, currency issued the mossland foundation. used players for the purchase and sale properties and accessories via mossland: the auction and run advertisement campaigns. moss coin can used any service within mossland. order use the services, players have deposit moss coin mossland. then, moss coin will available the player's in-game account. these moss coin will securely managed and stored cold wallets managed the mossland foundation. there are four ways acquire moss coin mossland: extra-game acquisition and exchange players will able purchase moss coin participating the mossland ico later cryptocurrency exchanges markets. in-game in-app purchases players will able conveniently purchase moss coin mossland through in-app purchases. however, purchasing moss coin the game will more expensive due the fee imposed google play and the apple app store. addition, the amount moss coin available will limited the amount moss coin that was initially reserved for in-app purchases and moss coin collected the mossland foundation via transaction and advertising fees for mossland's services. advertising engagement when the mossland advertising platform complete, users will able receive moss coin the game interacting with the advertisements created other players, allowing other players advertise their properties. these fees may fairly small per-player basis, but overall will significantly contribute the flow currency the in-game economy. property sales property owners mossland: the auction will receive moss coin selling their landmarks. figure player's acquisition channel moss coin figure withdrawal moss coin moss coin distribution the total supply moss coin will not exceed moc. after all moss coins have been issued, new moc will not created. issued moss coin will distributed outlined table and fig table moss coin distribution figure moss coin distribution chart the total coin supply was distributed during the moss coin pre-ico and main ico. the preico was divided into two rounds: private round for volume participants and public round for general participants. the main ico was also divided into two rounds; round for strategic partners and fund partners and public round for general participants. ensure the team's and advisors' commitment the project, moss coin allocated the mossland team and advisors will not distributed until year after completion the main ico. order ensure that players will able purchase moss coin directly via in-app purchases mossland, moss coin are reserved only for this purpose. when this moss coin reserve exhausted, only the transaction fees and advertising fees will available for purchase directly through the mossland's in-app purchase system. issuance moss coin the mossland foundation will collect moss coin through the services using mossland and advertising fees. this moss coin will resold players through in-app purchases. additional moss coin issuance there will additional issuance moss coin addition the original coins. seeding and redistribution the mossland foundation deems necessary beneficial, reserved moss coin may distributed allowing in-app purchases moss coin the players. the price in-app purchases moss coin will determined the market price when the redistribution implemented. the store price may vary compared the available purchase price depending live market movements. additional moss coin will not made available directly exchanges, but only through in-app purchases within mossland. moss chain technical aspects applying blockchain mossland will developed service proprietary central server. when sufficient number users have joined the community, user data may transferred blockchain. when the performance verified and optimized, the data and functions may transferred decentralized app (dapp) the corresponding blockchain. transaction performance mossland platform that supports the development location-based cryptocurrency services which prioritizes player's experience. transaction speeds are essential good player experience, and current public blockchains not satisfy the required performance. specifically, difficult immediately check whether bid during auction successful due the slow response existing blockchains the event that there are many users bidding asset. this can lead sub-par user experience due confusion around which bids are successful, why, and how transaction fees are calculated and collected. fees transaction fee designs contemporary blockchains discourage in-game activity and require different model for mossland operate efficiently. currently, every action creates information which must stored new block and added given blockchain. mossland's case, new block will created for all game actions and transactions which could eventually discourage users due excessive fees. therefore, mossland will need utilize blockchain with minimal transaction fees order ensure that both the action the game and asset exchange operate way that both logical and satisfying players. these issues have already been addressed several public blockchain projects (such eos), and anticipate that public blockchain platform that has undergone tremendous advancement will commercialized the near future. until then, mossland has been developed off-chain project order begin the process growing the player base and demonstrate the value virtual assets the game's property market. then, once proven blockchain platform has been introduced, mossland may transferred on-chain project, allowing virtual assets leveraged across multiple projects. decentralization mossland figure shows how mossland, off-chain project, may changed on-chain project the future. property and accessory information stored the mossland server would transferred the blockchain, and resource files stored the client applications using mossland would transferred the resource download server. therefore, augmented reality dapps utilizing virtual assets the moss chain (mossland's blockchain) can developed lighter clients, which will lead more open environment where mossland's virtual assets can utilized more services. figure decentralization mossland sdk called moss frame may developed and distributed. moss frame reads information the properties and accessories stored the moss chain based the user's location and camera information. this also accesses the necessary resources from the resource download server and makes them available the player's client application, also giving developers the ability directly display them player's screen. moss frame will facilitate the development dapps allowing developers easily render augmented virtual world without in-depth technology. mossland may transform from off-chain project which handled all the functions with all the resources one moss chain's dapps. would serve the primary dapp that best exemplifies the moss chain and moss frame encourage third party developers develop more dapps based the expected success the market. through these steps, mossland wants increase the value virtual assets releasing its own assets the blockchain instead monopolizing them. mossland will also support the successful launch other dapps maintain the value virtual assets. ico (initial coin offering) pre-ico the pre-ico was divided into private round for volume participants and public round for general
