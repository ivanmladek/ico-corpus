programmable business society ultrain vision core vision ultrain the advent the information revolution driving businesses expand borders and streamline processes. are witnessing the unfolding brand new business society, where all things are increasingly visible, interconnected and exchanged, call this "programmable business society." this society, the commercial logic trillions business transactions that take place daily will migrate from traditional smart business contracts, which are automatically executed and realized through the control and delegation resources the internet things (iot) blockchain. decision-making during the automatic execution process will increasingly driven decentralized artificial intelligence (ai) that operates the blockchain. this will take over most the computational and decision-making tasks, enabling highly efficient and reliable automated processing. this business approach will widely used across various fields, such public utilities, transportation, manufacturing, medical care, agriculture and finance, significantly reduce the cost business operations. the greatest advantages are zero trust costs, automation and intelligence. this business ecosystem, the organization structure will more flexible, agile, autonomous and self-disciplined. people come together, motivated common goal; the organizational goals and incentive mechanism are open, transparent, consensus-driven and automatic, participants voluntarily and autonomously contribute abilities and resources promote the realization goals, hence lowering corporate governance and operating costs. building programmable business society furthermore, the business rules and logic driving inter-company transactions can become more dynamic and smarter with the use artificial intelligence; the development blockchain technology will result fairer and more reasonable distribution commercial interests transparent manner. the use smart contracts will significantly lower the need for trust capital, allowing transactions completed with zero trust costs. this business ecosystem comprises several business elements. overall, consists three parts: the technology layer, consisting integrated infrastructure services based public blockchain, ai, and iot. the horizontal services layer, aggregating organizations which provide various decentralized business services, including banks, insurance, loans, etc. the vertical application layer, containing numerous decentralized application services that serve many users and can implemented multiple industries, including scientific research and development, manufacturing (such machinery and textile), logistics, retail, finance, culture and entertainment (education, literature, intellectual property and gaming), pharmaceutical biochemistry, food, real estate, agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing, services (catering and travel), etc. the progress this business society achieved through technological advancement, with blockchain, well iot technologies its backbone. while blockchain has the capacity transform the production relationship, will impact productivity, while iot will reform the means production. through the integrated application blockchain, and iot technologies, this business ecosystem enjoys several advantages over the traditional business environment: lower operating costs, higher operating efficiency and more transparent distribution commercial benefits. this can greatly enhance social production efficiency, generate more value for the real economy and create better society. the vision ultrain advance the realization programmable business society. productivity means production production building programmable business society features infrastructure programmable society just the industrial society depends the infrastructure water, electricity and coal, the information society relies the infrastructure information technology. the foundation the programmable business society synthesis blockchain, and iot technologies. blockchain technology key this, given its role building the trust and value delivery network. the layer above, needs run the blockchain provide fair and efficient smart decision-making services. for the layer below, the blockchain serves the basic infrastructure for value delivery, integrating and connecting iot equipment and networks provide services external parties. general, the blockchain infrastructure should have the following features: ultrain transparent and trustworthy value blockchain delivery public peer-to-peer (pp) network the heart the programmable business society lies the programmable business consensus. the key the programmable business consensus shift the basis trust from conventional contracts technology, with the latter ensuring the consensus agreement cannot tampered with, forged destroyed, and transparent and verifiable for all. from the perspective infrastructure, the entire network needs public, open peer-to-peer (pp) network with master-slave distinction and special nodes. the same time, this needs low-concentration network ensure plurality participants, which will, large degree, ensure that individual small group nodes can seize control the network, and also prevent attacks from people with malicious intent. support for large-scale business applications building programmable business society such blockchain infrastructure holds the promise support large-scale business applications, achieving high performance and quality low cost; however, existing public blockchain technologies have not been able realise this. there are two main issues: low system trading performance: let's take bitcoin example. the network supports about transactions/second, and verifying transaction takes one hour. contrast, alipay, mainstream payment transaction system, accomplished peak transactions/second double (i.e. //). the latter almost times more efficient and clearly demonstrates that the current system unable support large-scale business applications yet. low smart contract performance: existing smart contracts have the following problems: limitation the number lines code each smart contract; limitation the execution time smart contracts. generally, the current smart contracts need completed within single consensus, which greatly limits the complexity these contracts; execution sequence smart contracts. existing smart contracts can only executed serial manner, while sophisticated business logic requires the parallel execution smart contracts. the new public blockchain urgently needs address the performance problem that blockchain can become genuine infrastructure that supports large-scale business applications. value computation enables the real economy currently, order maintain the security the existing pow-based public blockchain system, large amount its computing and electric power used for hash value calculation. this highly resource-intensive and low value-for-money approach unsustainable. the new public blockchain infrastructure requires lesser computation support the operation the public blockchain system, which turn, frees substantial computing power, re-organized and re-deployed for purposeful computation, empowering the real economy create social value. infrastructure, supports the realization decentralized business logic, which crucial the programmable business society. user-friendly smart contracts the programmable business society, large number conventional business contracts and agreements will exist the chain the form smart contracts. therefore, the development smart contracts should easy preparing powerpoint and excel documents; anyone should able easily read, write and review smart contracts after some basic training. however, the existing smart contract syntax too complex. need new smart contract language that similar the format the human language, thereby making these contracts more user-friendly and keeping learning costs for ordinary users low, ultimately allowing more building programmable business society people use smart contracts serve different business scenarios and purposes. support the programmable business society complex and comprehensive business ecosystem that driven technology and built the foundation democratic autonomy. this ecosystem faces numerous economic factors that need dynamically adjusted constantly ensure efficient performance the economy. traditional economic systems respond such demands differently: the planned economy adopts national macroeconomic means regulate economic parameters, while the market economy relies the 'invisible hand' where efficiency low. for the programmable business society, there exists more effective way adjust relevant economic variables dynamically through and increase the chances system optimization. ensure that this regulation fair, just, reasonable, tamper-proof and traceable, the matrix group solution based mathematic calculation that lavage technology cannot provided one few centralized service providers. the training and operation the matrix group should completely based the data the chain, and the matrix group needs run completely the chain. super body can ultimately created through autonomous learning process that harnesses knowledge gleaned from historical data and human experience. iot device support another core feature the programmable business society the widespread use iot devices. transactions will take place smart devices large scale, where value exchange and transfer occur automatically the basis machine consensus e.g., distributed energy. traditional iot technologies, usually accompanied redundant nodes and hybrid clouds, are unable implement effective value transfer under ultra-large-scale nodes. while technologies such the latest iota, which developed its new platform using mathematical concept known the directed acyclic graphs (dag) hashgraph are better for securing data transmission between smart devices, value exchange between the devices cannot guaranteed, there deterministic mathematical proof demonstrating that these technologies can solve the double-spending problem. the value exchange must implemented using the blockchain technology. for the iot system, blockchain technology equivalent the operating system device. blockchain technology can integrate hundreds millions iot devices into common software framework. through smart contracts, data transmission and value transfer between intelligent devices can realized safely, reliably and efficiently. simultaneously, the computing power individual devices can effectively aggregated form large computing pool provide external services. building programmable business society core functions ultrain with ultrain the foundation, are committed providing computing service called trusted computing. compared traditional cloud computing, this brand-new computing service model based blockchain architecture. components such cpu computing, gpu computing gpu optimized for taking huge batches and performing the same operation over and over quickly, while cpu idea for handle few software threads time, memory computing, hard disk resources, bandwidth resources and others, can all included the scope and framework this model. all these will take the characteristics blockchain computing i.e. difficult tamper with, cannot destroyed, and are transparent and traceable all. this service blue ocean for businesses that need establish business models with low trust costs. ultrain offers these unique features that facilitate trusted computing: high-performance computing with breakthrough innovations cryptography, ultrain established new consensus mechanism call random trust consensus framework. this new consensus mechanism can increase performance -fold fully decentralized network, utilizing only computing power traditional pow system, and still achieve the same level security performance pow. this consensus has the following features: feature completely decentralized architecture. completely decentralized architecture ensures the security the public chain system. the network itself complete network without any special nodes. feature ultra-large-scale network cluster. networking more than million nodes building programmable business society supported, and the entire network supports horizontal expansion while maintaining linear growth performance. feature multi-terminal support. addition nodes with large computing power, various smart devices including mobile phones are able connect our network, providing the corresponding computing power for the entire network. feature high-performance execution. for every blockchain system, the overall performance evaluated based two premises: transaction performance and the confirmation time. the new framework offers two consensuses that are specifically applied the main and side chains embedded ultrain, ultimately enhancing the system's transaction performance and enabling efficient confirmation time. feature decentralization scalability design. have fully considered the decentralization issue the entire architecture design with the intent avoid the concentration machines the mine pool. envision mining infrastructure more like ordinary computer, which can placed homes across the globe. this device could used computer, but when not use, becomes node the network and can perform mining functions the benefit the owner. this the design goal that ultrain targets achieve. trusted computing creates value key idea ultrain liberate more computing power create social value for the real economy while ensuring the security the blockchain. through innovations ultrain cryptography, only the network's computing power required implement mintage when consensus formed every round, and the remaining the computing power can used trusted computing manage services, such cpu computing, gpu computing, memory computing, hard disk resources, bandwidth resources and on, for external parties. ultrain composed the main chain and side chains. the main chain intended for guaranteeing the security the entire system and for secondary confirmation the calculation result the side chains. therefore, the main chain requires high transaction per second (tps) performance, whereas the confirmation time can longer. side chain the running environment specific dapp and each dapp can choose form its own side chain. since the side chains are the business system real services, they require short and quick confirmation time but not high tps performance. meet this requirement, the random trusted consensus framework offers two consensuses, one which applied the main chain, and the other applied the side chains. the performance the main chain reaches tps, and the confirmation time seconds. the tps the side chains ranges from and the confirmation time second. the centralization issue actually very serious problem faced bitcoin, ethereum and others present. because bitcoin mining rigs deployed centralized manner for mining can generate excess returns, there are only over external egress addresses available the entire bitcoin network (as november which diametrically opposed the original intention completely decentralized network design. building programmable business society the primary user these computing capabilities intended third party dapp developers. paying ugas (which cryptographic token for service billing ultrain), such third party dapp developers can enjoy services equivalent performance and quality cloud computing, only %-% the price. cpu computation dna analysis gpu computation graphics rendering memory calculation machine learning hard disk storage nas virtual supercomputing center for networkwide computing power integration flexible and sophisticated multi-token system the prosperity the public blockchain system depends the prosperity the dapps running it, and important factor for the prosperity dapps whether the token economic system each dapp reasonable and healthy. the selection and design the token economic system needs match and adapt the dapp business model, with the former designed promote and stimulate rapid development the latter. however, token issuance existing public blockchains too rigid. for example, ethereum smart contract pre-determines the total token amount and once the contract established, all these would have been issued. this will have material impact the regulation the future business economic ecosystem dapps. order solve this problem and better support the token economic system design dapps, ultrain adopts the dual-layer token architecture system ultrain empowered project token and ugas. ultrain empowered project token the generic name the tokens issued dapps running ultrain, similar erc ethereum. each ultrain-based dapp can issue its own token and set its own token monetary system according characteristics its business model, such inflationary, deflationary mildly inflationary. based variations the monetary system, each dapp can choose different consensus mechanisms, including pow/pos/dpos/poa/ rpos, establish its own consensus mechanism. the basis different consensus mechanisms, exclusive mining rig for the corresponding token can produced support the token issuance. ugas token that used purchase the necessary computing power for running smart contracts ultrain. all smart contracts deployed the main chain and side chains ultrain building programmable business society can run only with ugas. similar the "gas" ethereum, ugas charging and settlement tool for ultrain. building programmable business society consensus building mechanism for mutual confirmation central the blockchain technology the idea decentralization. decentralization means that community complete equality with central authority, group people reaches consensus through negotiation accomplish goal agreed everyone. the blockchain, there technical consensus and business consensus. technical consensus traditional network architecture, network development controlled the team that owns the technology. however, due the decentralized nature blockchains, the blockchain network co-created many parties, typically the miners that provide the host computers and the r&d team that provides the blockchain software. the parties cannot agree the development direction, could result the fragmenting the network into multiple small ones. this has already happened both bitcoin and ethereum. the early stages blockchain development, many the community held the idea that blockchains should not tampered with. however, incidents recent years such bitcoin's hard fork episode and the ethereum dao hacking incident, have cast shadow over the practicality immutability. the focus not whether modifications should allowed; the key whether modifications, when the situation calls for them, are guided central decision-maker the network community. protect technical consensus integrity, built into ultrain's network governance special feature that supports democratic voting. business consensus decentralized community, complex and difficult task for members set goal and accomplish together. reality, conflicts will occur during the process because one can independently propose perfect solution all problems. the same time, waiting for everyone make decision will time-consuming. refer this the non-deterministic consensus issue. order resolve this, try develop participant-driven consensus building mechanism the basis "mutual assurity". this concept best illustrated during the cold war where the united states and the soviet union refrained from attacking each other, was assumed that the defending party has the ability respond accordingly, resulting the certainty destruction both parties. this "mutual assured destruction" doctrine guaranteed the balance and peace between the building programmable business society united states and the soviet union. ultrain hopes build effective participant-led systematic mechanism that all participants can contribute building better future together without requiring full consensus. call this "mutually assured consensus building mechanism." specifically, participatory consensus building mechanism needs guide participants consider, and make choices based three core principles under the guidance coordinator: basic principles, appropriate processes and the correct approach tools. during this decision-making process, all related designs decisions independently made the participants are accessible all, and can revised and reused others. this allows the community embrace more possibilities than the traditional decision-making process, the same time encouraging collaboration and co-creation, even complete consensus has been reached. with the assurance blockchain technology, ultrain hopes popularize such values and mechanisms within our community, that the community can work and make decisions efficiently. network governance based democratic voting order effectively implement technical consensus and business consensus the technology level, have designed network governance mechanism based democratic voting. believe that people with more resources the economic system are more concerned about the health the system and deserve have greater say. ultrain provides common negotiation table for everyone the community means reasonable and effective democratic voting method, allowing everyone vote for solution that ultimately need choose. such solution will automatically deployed and updated the network the form smart contracts. these network governance solutions include multi-level design and integration common business goals, dynamic optimization economic system parameters, dynamic optimization blockchain network parameters, restart mechanism during hacking attacks, penalty mechanism against malicious behaviors, etc. the different governance solutions are determined democratic voting each time. the number votes each person holds assigned according the number ugas that he/she holds, and the voting results are coordinated and automatically executed the governance ultrain. this way, avoid autocracy, well give full consideration the opinions all parties. this hybrid advanced governance system adopted ultrain combines the power the community with and adaptive machines make decisions. the system has operational privileges unique the virtual management system and can execute the submitted solution. the same time, when facing escalating cyber-attacks, the system has the ability continuously upgrade and evolve using and machine learning algorithms. building programmable business society terms democratic voting, ultrain has introduced reward and penalty system that operates through credit evaluation scheme for each account. the initial credit value each account conditional upon the initial number ugas the account; thereafter, the credit value increased (if the vote consistent with the voting result) decreased (if the vote inconsistent with the voting result). this also encourages community participants make considered and responsible choices. building programmable business society user-friendly smart contracts the biggest issue with existing smart contracts that the learning curve too steep and learning write them challenge. smart contracts are typically based the c++ language, which converted into smart contract language through the removal some key words. believe the future programmable business society, the preparation smart contracts will technique similar preparing powerpoint excel files. ordinary people should able master the skill writing smart contracts after some basic training. ultrain hopes use quasi-natural language approach allow more people master the writing smart contracts and apply their own business activities. based this idea, ultrain has designed new programming syntax for smart contracts based the design the javascript language, including providing standard code library support; providing series standardized smart contract templates using the template technology; and implementing smart contract formalization and colloquial programming practices using the machine learning technology, thereby simplifying the learning process for the layman. artificial superintelligence the chain phase reinforcement learning platform the chain ultrain ecosystem running environment third-party service facial recognition bot annotated data contributed everyone available for training risk detection bot speech recognition bot medical examination bot trust recognition bot situation awareness bot ultrain master network governance bot economic regulation bot blockchain machine learning platform model operation model training reinforcement learning economic return hierarchical resource scheduling supercomputing virtual machine ultrain has built complete reinforcement learning training and operational platform that based idle computing power, which includes multiple master ais essential the operation ultrain, well ais deployed third parties that provide various service capabilities. these ais can also called upon and used third parties need ais. compared with the traditional running cloud services, the running ultrain (known building programmable business society ubot) has the following features: trustworthy ai: the model running ultrain utilizes data the chain that obtained through the machine learning training platform the chain, and operates the same machine learning training platform. hence, the model has the characteristics immutability, non-destructibility and complete transparency, and can tested all network users. this effectively results trustworthy model. socialized data contribution: with the development machine learning, has become consensus the industry that more data superior better algorithms. however, high-quality data often the hands internet giants. small- and medium-sized startups often have difficult time obtaining massive amount such data, which directly limits the further development and application ai. using the token incentive mechanism the blockchain, can encourage the public contribute high-quality data over the blockchain platform for economic returns. such, data contribution platform can formed effectively for collecting and accumulating large amount high-quality data solve the data shortage issue companies face, thereby laying the data foundation for creating efficient and reliable services. reinforcement learning: reinforcement learning refers unsupervised online learning technology that evolved from theories including animal learning, stochastic approximation and optimal control. during reinforcement learning, the ubot perceives status information the environment and searches for strategies select the best action. this causes change state and delayed return value. the ubot updates the evaluation function, completes learning process, proceeds the next round learning and training, and repeats the loop iterations until performance optimization achieved. the machine learning platform ultrain implements continuous evolution and constant optimization deployed ultrain using the reinforcement learning technology combined with more and more high-quality data obtained through socialized data contribution, and eventually achieves optimal performance joint effort the entire network, gaining unique competitive edge numerous centralized services. the first phase the direction, ultrain aims build service platform that economically driven, socially-involved and controllable. phase artificial superintelligence based deep belief network blockchain-based value iot the iot field, one ultrain's chief objectives achieve operational trustworthiness and reliability single iot device and between iot devices well reliable payment building programmable business society transactions between different iot devices, means blockchain technology. meanwhile, intends implement firmware-level compatibility and unified external programming interfaces iot devices introducing the blockchain-level operating system. the traditional module and clouding computing model will difficult sustain when massive iot devices are interconnected and interoperable. however, using edge computing implement self-organization and self-governance nodes from the perspective single computing node will feasible computing model. therefore, there need form unified abstract programming model beyond the iot firmware. iot node usually very small computing unit. due its power consumption requirements, usually computing unit with limited resources. its memory and storage space are both very small. difficult for such node participate the consensus process. the computing power required the control node iot device will come from edge computing units, possibly gateways routers. the specific application can deployed the form smart contract the chain, and the local network can managed using the control unit implement business interaction. building programmable business society on-chain components ultrain provide comprehensive support and services dapp developers and allow dapp developers develop applications more easily and conveniently, ultrain, the one hand, offers comprehensive developer tools and development environment support; the other hand, provides rich business components and functional components, including identity authentication, credit system, oracle machine and zero-knowledge proof, the chain, allowing dapp developers quickly build their own business applications. most the on-chain components ultrain are developed ultrain's technical partners. when using these components provide services, dapps will directly pay service fees the form ugas, and these fees will paid on-chain component developers. ultrain welcomes more technical partners build more functional components the chain optimize the dapp development system ultrain. dapp healthcare sharing economy identity authentication credit system asset mapping zero-knowledge proof prediction market gaming on-chain components ultrain computing power scheduling r-pos identity authentication component vertical scenarios similar healthcare and finance, when user uses dapp, the user identity needs authenticated allow the user use the corresponding functions. the data sources required for this identity authentication need provided authorities. this function universal requirement, which rendered ultrain general functional building programmable business society component. ultrain integrates variety universal and dedicated identity authentication components according laws and regulations different countries provide identity authentication components different levels, which have the following features: multiple identity authentication data sources data sources for ultrain identity authentication are provided different identity authentication service providers. the authentication data has series distributed trust sources, and different authentication methods are selected different scenarios. the identity information all entities exists only the provider the specific identity trust source. will not retained ultrain ensure compliance and privacy all types business. multi-level identity authentication different levels authentication, such mobile phone number verification, information verification and real person authentication, can selected authenticate the identity person ultrain based the different requirements the application scenario. dedicated identity trust sources according business scenarios laws and regulations, entity ultrain can use different identity trust sources, such the eid specific field region, ca, government, institution, school, company, community, individual, etc., meet different trust authentication requirements. credit system component business transactions and activities, the credit system the foundation business transactions and basic component many dapps involved business activities. ultrain has retained all historical records and information account transaction activities. authorized the user, the credit system service provider can rely various types consumption and behavior data the user ultrain, and, combination with the financial information ultrain, can comprehensively process and assess all data using technologies such cloud computing and machine learning well model algorithms including logistic regression, decision tree and random forest. then can objectively present the comprehensive score the individual credit status from five perspectives, including user credit history, behavioral preferences, performance capability, identity characteristics and personal relationships, and establish unified credit system model for ultrain accounts and for dapps. accordingly, the cost for establishing credit system for each dapp lowered. online and offline mapping component this component belongs the smart lock field and relates smart anti-counterfeiting device based the smart contract and anti-counterfeiting traceability method based the blockchain technology. building programmable business society the goods can easily replaced counterfeited during the circulation process. difficult provide entire set systematic solutions solve the anti-counterfeiting traceability problem using the traditional methods. the traditional password lock can guarantee that will not unlocked illegally, but has decentralized trusted network such the blockchain, and cannot implement large-scale commercial key storage and distribution. the customer still cannot verify the real source the goods because not traceable. the customer can neither verify whether the obtained key authentic nor confirm whether the password lock itself authentic. criminals can fake password lock long the lock can unlocked using any keys. the online and offline mapping component designed ultrain solves the product traceability and anti-counterfeiting problem using the two core technologies cryptography technology and smart contract technology. the cryptography technology guarantees the security devices. the blockchain technology prevents commodities and owner identity information from being tampered with and ensures continuous traceability each related operation. smart contracts the blockchain ensure the trustworthy circulation smart anti-counterfeiting devices and control information. oracle prediction market component the prediction market refers platform where people make predictions future events with clear results. people can predict promising results and receive rewards for the predicted results. the incentive allocation depends the final result the event which the parties participated, and follows simple yet powerful rule: that is, those predicted accurately are rewarded and those predicted wrongly are penalized. order win much possible, people will make predictions accurate possible using various methods, such information collection and mathematical modeling. according the statistical law large numbers, the prediction accuracy greatly affected the number participants. with sufficient number participants, the prediction accuracy rate will significantly improved. online prediction market that allows sufficient number people participate quickly and easily has great social value and significance. however, centralized prediction market can hardly gain trust from participants. with the development the blockchain technology, the public blockchain has become impartial and decentralized trust intermediary. its features, including information transparency and tamper-resistance, have made the blockchain perfect running platform for the prediction market. the natural impartiality the blockchain makes the trust cost running the prediction market almost zero, and the realization smart contracts further empowers the blockchain with computing power that allows programmable dynamic calculation. based the huge application potential the prediction market, ultrain cooperates with service providers provide the prediction market service component the chain for direct use dapps need. building programmable business society zero-knowledge proof component the data the blockchain transparent and viewable all people because the characteristics the blockchain itself. some fields which data privacy needs protected, such finance and healthcare, this characteristic the blockchain obviously not applicable. for example, patients clearly not want their private healthcare data the chain viewed all. this requires that the on-chain data should easily accessible and available when needed and that data privacy should guaranteed. this case, the zero-knowledge proof technology required. the zero-knowledge proof originates from the minimum disclosure proof. assume that the entity that holds certain information and hopes prove the fact that holds the information, and the entity that proves this fact. protocol proves that does have certain information, but cannot deduce what the information is, say that has implemented the minimum disclosure proof. addition, knows other knowledge except that can prove certain fact, say that has implemented the zero-knowledge proof, and the corresponding protocol called the zero-knowledge protocol. this stage, the zero-knowledge proof technology immature, and mainly has the following problems: complex use logic: each proof logic requires complex setup process during creation and cannot flexibly configured and used. large number calculations and low performance: zero-knowledge proof involves large number mathematical calculations the process generation and verification. the calculation load very large, the run time long, and the performance low. ultrain provides on-chain component based zero-knowledge proof for scenarios that require good data privacy protection. the zero-knowledge proof component ultrain has the following features: programmable: the zero-knowledge proof module can customized based the business logic users and can flexibly configured. setup process required for any asset and any proof logic. highly efficient: software optimization and chip customization, ultrain dramatically improves the computing speed zero-knowledge proofing both the client side and blockchain node server side. building programmable business society ultrain economic ecology introduction token system the ultrain economic ecology ugas tool for service billing and settlement ultrain with upper limit billion tokens. further details, including economical parameters, will disclosed after further testing and adjustment done the public chain, when goes online. ugas generated mining: the generated ugas evenly distributed among all nodes that participate the current round consensus. ugas generated selling computing power: assuming that the unit price computing power ugas, the first year, each node (mining rig) which the computing power used obtains ugas for each unit used computing power and obtains ugas for each unit unused computing power. each year, the number ugas obtained for each unit used computing power reduced the previous year. the generated ugas retained the foundation for the maintenance and operation the ultrain ecology. the smart contract will allocate ugas the development team; the hub leaders (see section for the role hub leaders); and the active users dapp. the event that there are issues relating unfair allocation between the hub leaders and the dapp users, the community shall polled resolve such issues. generation ugas use ugas purchasing computing power using ugas: dapp running ultrain needs purchase the computing power for running its code using ugas when its smart contract running. cost amount price. amount indicates the amount ugas consumed for this running, and price indicates the price ugas. ultrain monitors the market price ugas using the oracle machine mechanism and dynamically adjusts the price, ensuring that the operating costs dapps are maintained relatively stable level for period time. purchasing third-party services using ugas: dapps running ultrain can purchase, using ugas, third-party services deployed ultrain, such the authentication service, credit service, and zero-knowledge proof service. obtaining tokens: all nodes (mining rigs) participating mintage and computing must stake certain amount ugas participate the economic system ultrain. building programmable business society description the ultrain economic ecology opine that the value growth the blockchain's economic system derived from the process value creation for the real economy, that the economic system has solid

and also the joint owner the porsche brand founder and manager pae group, including entertainment brand pae media, human resources management firm pae design talent and social media platform hot pot design collaborating with traditional communities, enhancing the influence the idea decentralization did not come into being just because the blockchain emerged. with the development human society, the society will further evolve towards the protection individual rights, towards the respect individual privacy, the protection personal property and the respect individual rights and interests, and towards civil society. civil society promotes such elements equality, autonomy, democracy and people-centeredness. advocates that group people who uphold the same values and ideas strive for the same goal means autonomy and self-determination. this goal can large establishing autonomy consensus principles for community, small achieving specific implementation objective. famous example the christmas bird observation program the united states. the national audubon society (named honor john james audubon famous ornithologist, explorer and wildlife artist) non-profit non-governmental environmental organization incorporated all members participate conservation activities donation volunteers. this community committed protecting birds and the environment which they live using science, advocacy, education and field protection the americas, today and tomorrow. the community now has international, national and state projects, natural research centers and nearly local chapters. has designated more than key bird protection areas and working voluntarily for the common goal protecting the environment and birds. the christmas bird count (cbc) activities are conducted around christmas every year. the cbc data completely open. anybody can participate cbc activities after paying us$ (free for people under the age and can get copy the birds america. during the event, least birdwatchers gather observation team, and all teams are distributed nearly observation areas. each team responsible for area with radius building programmable business society kilometers, observing and recording the types and numbers birds the area. according official reports, the (-) cbc, birdwatchers across the americas voluntarily participated the event observation areas, and observed and recorded species total birds. "no other organization does the work audubon does. it's very well rounded and well run." --julia a., member audubon. non-profit, non-government environmental organization has gathered volunteers with the same hobby and goal complete task that even the government may not able accomplish even consumes lot manpower, material resources, and financial resources. each bird-loving volunteer makes his/her own contribution different ways. they are different ages, different races, and have different occupations. they stand and speak public for birds, donate money online, feed the birds the garden, outdoors regularly observe and record birds, and participate the annual cbc event. they even promote legislation protect birds and the environment. bit bit, they have accomplished the accumulation that cannot accomplished any government department, forming invisible huge network, network protect birds and the environment which they live. this the enormous power spontaneously striving for the same hobby, same goal, and same dream. there are variety non-profit communities around the world that are similar the national audubon society, among which many non-governmental organization (ngo) communities that pursue democratic autonomy sharing communities with the core idea knowledge sharing have demands for decentralization. ultrain hopes unite these communities and people and provide unique value for these communities through its own features such the decentralization design and polling mechanism. meanwhile, the unique user-friendly smart contracts ultrain can also benefit the community users with poor skills. the other hand, these community users with democratic ideals will also become solid user group the ultrain ecosystem. building programmable business society application scenarios gaming platform chain based the ultrain architecture, gaming platform side chain can designed and game coins can issued. game developers can develop games this platform chain, and game operators can operate games the ultrain platform. the interested parties the platform include game developers and operators, game players, ultrain gaming platform, investors, downstream live streaming platforms, event operators, etc. the ultrain game coins, issued game developer under ultrain's help, are used the currency circulation the gaming platform side chain. all transactions are automatically settled the form blockchain smart contracts. this guarantees the payments all relevant parties and reduces transaction costs. each interested party the platform can use the game coins for cross-game transactions, and can exchange game coins for ugas for transactions the main chain and other side chains. the gaming platform the core portal that gathers game player traffic. provides the development environment and operation platform for game developers and operators and offers variety game options for game players. the gaming platform pays ultrain fiat currency ultrain exchange for ultrain services, including but not limited the following: solving the data storage problem using the blockchain technology; solving the data replication and desensitization problems using proprietary technologies; solving data privacy issues using the blockchain zero-knowledge proof technology; and series data services such data access, data standardization, data association, etc. investors can invest gaming platforms and game coins. game developers and operators can obtain game coins selling games and game props. meanwhile, they can sell game copyrights, data and other information live streaming platforms, event operators and data analysts. game players use game coins purchase games, game durations and in-game pay props. similar the existing steam gaming platform, game players can purchase game currency using ultrain fiat currency and can obtain game currency means in-game prop sales in-game prizes. they can also gain game currency signing contract with downstream third party the ecosystem, such live streaming platform. game live streaming platforms, event operators and data analysts can pay platforms game players with game coins exchange for copyrights and data, which are then cashed out through live streaming tipping, event advertisements and other means. healthcare data chain ultrain now working with number healthcare big data service companies promote the construction the healthcare data side chain. the healthcare data chain mainly intended for solving problems including lack circulation and transparency healthcare data the building programmable business society industry, lack control patients over personal healthcare data, and lack data relevant medical research institutions. use c-end healthcare services individual user c-end healthcare service application integrate healthcare service software and hardware solutions healthcare service provider provide data gain profit provide personal healthcare data gain profit big health data platform personal health data bank pay healthcare tokens exchange for use data healthcare data consumer healthcare data transaction service exchange ugas for ultrain blockchain services ultrain platform the interested parties the platform include individual users, c-end healthcare service applications, healthcare service providers, healthcare data consumers and ultrain platform. c-end healthcare service applications can synergize with many healthcare service providers provide variety healthcare services, including basic physical data monitoring service, gene sequencing service, nutrition advices, chronic disease detection service, medical examination (advice) service, outpatient service, clinical service, etc. the applications can also provide variety medical-related services for the sub-health population, specific disease patients and family members patients, and guide the family members and doctors systematic long-term tracking and analysis patients' personal healthcare data. building programmable business society medical testing clinical research genetic testing drug research hospital doctor gene research the families patients have personal health record and electronic medical record that can queried any time the big health data platform. they can provide authorized health data the platform exchange for healthcare tokensissued developers. addition, each time patient's data used third-party scientific research business institution, the patient will receive certain number corresponding healthcare tokens. the patients can use these healthcare tokens purchase corresponding healthcare services. healthcare service providers can provide basic physical data monitoring, nutrition advice, chronic disease detection and other services earn income. they can also take advantage the features the blockchain technology greatly reduce their costs, including data storage costs, security costs, privacy protection costs, etc. meanwhile, they can resolve the healthcare data circulation and reuse issues through data exchanges, and can join the alliance built the platform provide one-stop healthcare solutions for patients together with other service providers. healthcare data consumers, including insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare value-added service providers, can pay healthcare tokens the platform exchange for authentic and valid data. utilizing the continuously updating massive and accurate healthcare data, insurance companies can effectively improve their actuarial capabilities; pharmaceutical companies can solve the problem lack coherent data clinical trials new drugs; and healthcare value-added service providers can offer patients with tailored value-added healthcare services accessing cross-domain data. the big health data platform pays ugas the ultrain platform exchange for ultrain services, including but not limited the following: solving the data storage problem using the blockchain technology; solving the data replication and desensitization problems using proprietary technologies; solving data privacy issues using the blockchain zero-knowledge proof technology; and series data services such data access, data standardization, data association, etc. the healthcare tokens are used for payment and settlement the network. the same time, all transactions are automatically settled the form blockchain smart contracts, building programmable business society which can protect the payments all relevant parties, reduce transaction costs and create dynamic market. fan economy chain china's fan economy now era stratification and diversification. the value niche content (animation, music, movies, etc.) gradually being appreciated and accepted the public. however, the agent system and multi-layer distribution system the traditional cultural and economic fields are confronted with many difficulties, including value centralization, intermediary exploitation, proliferation false information and single way realization, which seriously affect the normal ecological development. there little spontaneous communication between the traditional media and communities, and traffic dominated mainstream and vertical media and communities. the lack communication between channels and monopolization traffic has seriously affected the flow value products the cultural and economic fields (artists, ip, etc.), and most the product revenue harvested intermediaries and intermediary agencies. the "decentralization" concept the blockchain technology and the opened fan behavior data can completely subvert the current situation and patterns the entire industry. fan economy chain can developed based ultrain, comprising the information registration system for public figures such singers, and key opinion leaders (kols, copyright registration and authorization system, data storage system, and information inquiry and payment components. this side chain can issue fan tokens, issued developers, circulation tool for the economic system. fans can pay fan tokens purchase authentic video and audio files exchange for opportunities interact with public figures. performance companies can send performance invitations artists through this platform without intermediary companies and agencies, saving costs. copyright owners can select copyright purchase requests from all over the world the platform and collect deposits and follow-up revenues using smart contracts. the third parties are data users, such performance companies, film companies brands. they can pay fan tokens exchange for popularity data various public figures and copyrights well fan portraits, and choose suitable artists and ips for various performances, films and commercial endorsements. all copyright owners and public figures (or their studios) can upload information and make "listed transactions" the platform for free. sharing economy chain sharing economy side chain can built based the existing architecture ultrain. one the characteristics the sharing economy disintermediation. the traditional sharing economy has extended from the removal intermediaries the removal small building programmable business society intermediaries during the development process. although the costs intermediaries during the transaction process have been reduced, the situation still far from the ideal state the sharing economy. merely realization platform business for sale the "right use". the underlying architecture the sharing economy built ultrain using the blockchain truly enables direct peer-to-peer transactions between asset owners and asset users, realizing the reconstruction the business logic the sharing economy. the ultrain platform can reconstruct the online ride-hailing platforms, short-term rental platforms and other sharing economy models the current market. users can directly search all house and vehicle sources the ultrain blockchain and filter out and display those that meet their requirements. the same time, all the transaction records the chain will stored distributed manner replace customer ratings. favorable comment will effectively improve the reputation the house vehicle source suppliers and shape their irrevocable blockchain identities. with the resource sharing iot devices, bicycles, power banks, homestay services, and the like can also join the sharing economy ultrain. besides sharing, you can also conduct data transactions. for example, you can make real-time data transactions with data demanders providing your vehicle data, real-time vehicle operation data, and the like. logistics chain the ultrain blockchain ecosystem can meet the four major demands the express service industry: maintain ownership high-value markets. effectively record the asset transaction process and record the shared data using the blockchain ledgers. provide high-quality data for any compliance audit requirements based the tamper-resistance feature transactional data. allow all participants the industry record and share data using the blockchain distributed ledgers the data sharing scenario. response the above four demands, the ultrain ecological chain can support the following four service scenarios: express value insurance: the value insurance scenario, when courier companies transport goods, the asset transactions are transparent, insurance companies can effectively provide value insurance goods. merchants offer goods for sale, buyers purchase the value insurance services, and the government conducts industry regulation. commodity value insurance contractual concept. when customer signs for parcel properly, claim settlement the account automatically triggered. the contract ends normally and the premium automatically liquidated. parcel has problem missing, the insurance claim process triggered. charity activities: for example, the "one cent" campaign takes one cent from the fees each charity parcel and donates the account charity organization. this scenario, courier companies still undertake the transportation goods, charity organizations carry out charity activities, and poverty alleviation merchants provide poverty alleviation building programmable business society products for sale. the tamper-resistance and transparency features transactional data ensure the reliability charity. industry blacklist sharing: the security and reliability couriers are major concern. currently, offline blacklists are available inside the industry. using the blockchain technology, ultrain allows each company record the blacklist practitioners the blockchain. the data cannot modified but can queried other companies. allows you trace information such which company person the blacklist worked for and what the misconduct was. express security regulation: courier companies are usually equipped with security inspection machines, and the government also wants know there are any transportation security risks each logistics company. the distributed ledgers ultrain allows each courier company record useful information security incidents the blockchain when such incidents occur, that regulatory authorities can monitor the information real time but cannot tamper with it. the courier industry trying the "federalism" system through the blockchain. "federalism" refers composite organization consisting two more organizational entities, and members the organization follow the conformity contract the system. "federalism" different from the traditional franchising model. the biggest difference between franchising and "federalism" lies the generativity basis. franchising about cooperation and co-creation bringing external participants; features exogenous weak links and longitudinal linear control. the intervention the blockchain transforms the franchising model into federalism, which encourages all partners enhance their links and cooperation means features including effective data sharing, tamper-resistant data and distributed ledgers. sports chain ultrain working with partners build vertical blockchain side chain the sports industry. integrating with the side chain, smart wearable hardware devices can effectively monitor the exercise status, daily heart rate, sleep, blood pressure, blood oxygen and other data users. meanwhile, dapp developers can assign exercise tasks users, and users can complete the exercise tasks and burn corresponding calories get mining opportunities, obtain the encrypted equity assets. this encourages users love sports and reap the benefits both wealth and health. the incentive method can guide users keep away from sub-health status exercise, and supports various exercise forms and allows users simultaneously record multi-dimensional exercise data such walking, running, cycling, mountain climbing and ice skating. building programmable business society
