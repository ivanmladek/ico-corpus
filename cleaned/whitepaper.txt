flexa network whitepaper may flexa.network executive summary flexa, believe that the best way for global commerce become more efficient and accessible making cryptocurrency spendable everywhere. with cryptocurrency transactions exceeding billion usd each day, it's simply matter time before digital commodities become central part global commerce. and yet, cryptocurrency's collective value trillion usd remains practically unusable physical retail. considering that percent retail sales the still take place offline, brick-and-mortar payments are the primary hurdle realizing the true utility cryptocurrencies. furthermore, widespread retail acceptance cryptocurrency critical for its sustainable value. the solution blockchain payments have developed the flexa network open standard that enables instant cryptocurrency payments stores and online. this new network designed act intermediary between merchants and the blockchain, offering them inexpensive and fraud-resistant transactions without volatility exposure. flexa enables consumers pay with their preferred cryptocurrency while preserving their freedom, security, and data privacy. and, flexa doesn't require any physical cards merchant point-of-sale upgrades. flexa was developed from decades experience fintech, retail, and payments. today, flexa features many high-profile merchants its platform, the launch which marks the first real instance decentralized, global payment network with the power make commerce more efficient and accessible for billions people. vision we're making cryptocurrency useful the blockchain the future commerce framework for consumer adoption product scalable retail payments for any app the flexa payment experience principles for network development people core team advisors background the present state digital payments vision we're making cryptocurrency useful the original bitcoin whitepaper, satoshi nakamoto outlined perspective the fallacies modern-day commerce, which relies "almost exclusively financial institutions... process electronic payments." digital payment instruments the united states and around the world consist complicated financial settlement processes--costing merchants percent processing fees for purchases and involving twelve different entities (each discrete point failure) process single exchange. meanwhile, retail fraud losses the alone continue reach all-time highs, claiming more than billion usd however, present-day payment instruments are extremely useful consumers because they have widespread merchant acceptance. and order for cryptocurrencies realize similar real and sustainable value, critical that they become spendable everywhere. many companies have recently developed wallets and apps that enable retail blockchain payments, but they are universally dependent existing payment networks. the promise cryptocurrency not being realized when also requires physical debit cards, linked accounts, centralized payment infrastructure facilitate the purchase cup coffee. flexa the first network specifically designed facilitate practical cryptocurrency payments enabling instant, no-fee transactions stores, restaurants, and online. flexa represents milestone the utility cryptocurrency--payments that are both consumer and merchant we're making cryptocurrency useful friendly. with simple sdk, flexa allows developers add retail payment features any app, streamlining acceptance cryptocurrencies for merchants and eliminating volatility exposure. flexacoin (fxc) the new digital collateral token for facilitating retail cryptocurrency payments the flexa network. flexacoin staked collateralize every payment the flexa network, enabling instant, fraudfree point-of-sale transactions merchants worldwide--helping achieve long-term vision making cryptocurrency spendable everywhere. simple, neutral, fixed-supply erc token, flexacoin ensures that the network itself blockchain-agnostic, and allows people spend the cryptocurrencies that are meaningful them. anyone can use flexacoin stake wallets the flexa network. stakers help collateralize payments made those wallets, and return, they earn stake rewards based transaction volume. connecting merchants, banks, and the blockchain with this open network, we're building new, global payment system challenge the status quo. envision that the flexa network will ultimately come represent open network infrastructure for any blockchain payment, similar how card associations such visa, mastercard, unionpay, and american express offer closed payment rails for credit cards. beyond that, with digital global payments excess trillion usd each day, this retail platform will make cryptocurrency more valuable, meaningful, and useful. the blockchain the future commerce the limitations traditional payment instruments-- fraud and cost--are solved the primary strengths blockchain technology. accordingly, merchants and the greater blockchain community each stand benefit from making cryptocurrency spendable everywhere. for many merchants, payment card fraud and transaction expense are two the most significant operating costs manage and actively reduce (e.g., losses due payment card fraud amounted estimated billion usd worldwide). payment card fraud today takes many forms, from stolen account numbers abuse marketing incentives. even chargebacks, initially developed consumer protection over forty years ago, have become vehicle for malicious activity. and smaller merchants ultimately share disproportionate share the damages, they have fewer resources counter sophisticated fraud defend themselves the case dispute. addition the costs fraud, the very act processing payment can extremely expensive, due the variety fees and operating expenses involved handling cash, payment cards, and other payment instruments. for instance, the top twenty-five merchants revenue worldwide spent collective billion usd accept payments. general, these expenses are result complex settlement processes across variety network participants, including payment gateways, processors, card associations, and financial institutions. due this complexity, standard payment

merchants and the blockchain stand benefit the blockchain offers practical solution merchant concerns fraud and cost. dramatically reduces the number possible fraud vectors enforcing tamper-proof transactions ledger, and decentralizes transaction verification--creating open market for processing that more closely represents the actual computation cost. added benefit, the blockchain provides native support for borderless payments, which opens merchants global community customers without requiring additional payment infrastructure currency exchange. meanwhile, the blockchain needs merchant adoption order become viable supplement other payment methods. additionally, with this increased utility comes more straightforward cryptocurrency valuation, reduced volatility, and market stabilization. growing merchant acceptance will make cryptocurrencies substantially more valuable, and truly enable the globalizing effects peer-to-peer electronic cash that satoshi nakamoto envisioned. blockchain adoption inevitable for these reasons, believe that the blockchain complements the infrastructure traditional payment instruments. however, due the operational and technical complexity managing native cryptocurrencies scale, many merchants will require intermediary service. this service must designed that cannot compromise the core principles data protection, decentralization, and choice that have bolstered the cryptocurrency community since its inception. believe that the flexa network offers the first practical cryptocurrency payments service for retail, dining, groceries, fuel, travel, and more. remove the complexities acceptance bring fraud resistance and low-fee processing merchants, while still protecting consumer tenets privacy, decentralized governance, and freedom choice. allowing merchants and their customers engage directly buyers and sellers, global commerce becomes vastly more efficient. framework for consumer adoption the software that moves the vast majority money around the world today still uses legacy standards created during the late but the absence compelling alternative, consumers are trapped into maintaining the status quo. since the creation bitcoin blockchain communities have attempted make cryptocurrencies useful complement traditional payment instruments like credit cards, debit cards, and cash. however, fundamental user-experience challenges such unintuitive code interfaces, complex address strings, new security protocols, and network capacity issues have hindered commercial adoption. various scaling solutions such multi-layer protocols and proof stake consensus algorithms show considerable promise for improving the speed and utility blockchain transactions, but create issues complexity and compatibility for merchants. variety mobile wallets are promoting cryptocurrency payment solutions, but unfortunately, they are completely reliant existing legacy infrastructure. these wallets utilize high-fee virtual visa and mastercard debit cards--requiring bank accounts, physical cards, and multiple tiers centralization. digital payments these platforms are subject low transaction limits (in some cases, less than $), well apple's restrictions for nfc access ios devices. justifiably, these systems have extremely low consumer adoption due the increased friction compared typical payment card. framework for consumer adoption the solution blockchain payments not building cryptocurrency acceptance top the existing multi-layer networks, but creating new network that solves merchant and consumer needs alike. while decades retail payments experience confirm the pain points fraud and processing cost, find that consumers' needs are distinctly different. consumers evaluate payment instruments against individual framework five basic criteria: basic consumer criteria freedom choice the need avoid fees, and mechanisms unwarranted control bank transfers payment cards mobile wallets security the need use system without fear loss deception failure speed the requisite convenience instant confirmation, often lost security usefulness the need for widespread acceptance particular payment instrument value any incentive use payment instrument (e.g., rewards, fees) speed, usefulness, and value are often the most critical factors choosing particular payment instrument retail. each these features must addressed for cryptocurrencies see widespread adoption. flexa framework for consumer adoption order for viable blockchain cryptocurrency payment network achieve meaningful scale, the table stakes for consumers are the following: real-time transactions merchants and their customers need receive confirmation that transaction was successful less than one second. consumer-facing fees consumers will not pay premium use blockchain cryptocurrencies, because such cost represents negative value their decision-making framework. the fee must zero the consumer side the transaction, and ultimately provide competitive spending incentives. broad acceptance order see widespread consumer adoption, must possible use cryptocurrencies for the majority daily expenditures. any less than that, and the mindshare required maintain "front wallet" utility will not attainable. meeting and dramatically exceeding these expectations will challenging, but any new payments network must comprehensively solve both consumer and merchant needs. believe that flexa satisfies all the core consumer requirements necessary break the legacy payments status quo. product introducing flexa flexa open network for enabling instant cryptocurrency payments stores and online, allowing merchants receive secure cash deposits via their existing points-of-sale. scalable retail payments for any app any coin eur any fiat *** *** any flexa any app network merchant flexa designed facilitate payments from any wallet, any coin, any merchant, across the globe. flexa's network already integrated with many high-profile merchants, offering instant acceptance potentially hundreds cryptocurrencies developers all over the world. the vision for this new network become the open, seamless standard for cryptocurrency payments physical retail. new network flexa will enable developers integrate retail cryptocurrency payments within their own apps. creating the most simple, direct network, flexa enables broad cryptocurrency acceptance with the least complexity-- longer requiring the variety payment gateways, processors, associations, and financial institutions. sample flexa transaction flow

(fpan) real time authorize the transaction the merchant's pos the app requests the current terminal, then pushes fiat funds conversion rate for the customer's the merchant's bank account. the desired cryptocurrency, and submits customer's purchase complete. blockchain transaction via flexa. new network the flexa payment experience flexa payments are designed simple possible. with just single tap and scan, flexa verifies your cryptocurrency balance against public index rate and generates proprietary flexcode for payment. because flexa payments not require nfc (like traditional payment cards), they are not restricted apple's requirements for payment cards loaded into the wallet app, nor tap-to-pay (contactless) implementation timelines transaction limits. this greatly reduces the network's risk compared other cryptocurrency payment solutions. flexa transaction has two primary components, which are delivered client apps through the flexa wallet sdk: the first called fpan, flexible primary account number, which one-time authorization that allows merchant debit local fiat currency against the selected cryptocurrency wallet balance. the second called flexcode, which proprietary and backwardscompatible barcode format that scannable standard point-of-sale barcode readers. each flexcode conveys the fpan with any userauthorized metadata through the merchant's point-of-sale system. because all flexa transactions use the same authentication process for payments, they represent the only interface that just secure--and just usable--whether used stores online. online flexa transactions will make use identical fpan provisioning mechanisms and back-end integrations. fact, online flexa transactions will differ from physical flexa transactions only their form approval. instead using flexcode, virtual flexa transactions will relay fpan via account-linked device. new network principles for network development flexa has presented six principles for the network, representing our vision for its ongoing development and sustained platform growth. order become trusted, public cryptocurrency payment rail, believe that flexa must be: compliant secure instant open present these principles help guide the development flexa, and hope build trust and transparency with the blockchain community articulating them the ongoing intentions guiding the network: compliant designed flexa support local compliance requirements and data protection regulations. notably, unlike alternative solutions for institutional cryptocurrency payments, the network does not require flexa third parties act custodian funds; the technology functions direct payments processor without volatility exposure for merchants. secure the flexa network has been designed with open-source, end-to-end encryption for resilience from man-in-the-middle attacks and other forms surveillance tampering, and exposes only non-sensitive information the course completing transaction. simple useful new network instant flexa the only network offer instantaneous conversion cryptocurrency via direct bank deposits merchant point-of-sale, regardless block time. end users need only one tap authorize payment, with transactions (confirmed point-of-sale) currently measured less than second. flexa transactions are designed the absolute fastest payment solution available the world. open flexa designed enable the free and open use cryptocurrency retail. the network will accessible wide variety developers and merchants around the globe. support this widespread acceptance, the network community need only stake flexacoin. therefore, flexa requires proprietary license gateway order for developers integrate their wallet transmit cryptocurrency transactions. simple from tap transaction, flexa supports simple, straightforward api methods for exchange and payment. because the network not reliant existing payments infrastructure, payments are pre-authorized single message, enabling authorization signatures and settlement combined into one fraud-resistant transaction. flexa's simplicity integration, operation, and settlement makes cryptocurrency payments easy for merchants and their customers alike. useful finally, flexa designed backwards-compatible with existing pos systems, and interoperable with many partners and platforms possible. have developed the flexa network toward broad accessibility and widespread acceptance--starting with the very first apps the network, which take advantage existing pos integrations and require new hardware merchant upgrades. people

majority these transactions are conducted using one any combination three instruments: direct bank transfer payment cards mobile wallets e.g., swift, fedwire, ach e.g., visa, american express e.g., apple pay, google pay, alipay global and domestic bank plastic cards leveraging credit mobile apps that proxy traditional clearing networks that move and debit networks move small payment instruments move quadrillion usd million purchases trillion usd more than billion usd transactions per year billion transactions per year million transactions per year common throughout europe for common most geographies common asia-pacific for all all transaction sizes, and the throughout the world for small transactions (via bank transfers); and canada for large and transactions, especially the us, gaining broad acceptance the commercial transactions canada, europe, and asia-pacific us, canada, and europe page page page the present state digital payments direct bank transfer general, non-cash payment instruments are underpinned daily processing volume traditional account held insured financial institution, such commercial bank credit union. whenever money exchanged via swift one these payment instruments, whether electronically trillion usd offline ledger, ultimately transmitted between financial institutions. million transactions reconcile these payments, variety domestic and international standards are used for direct bank transfer between businesses and fedwire consumers (also sometimes called "electronic funds transfer"), such trillion usd ach/iat, chips, swift, rtgs, fedwire, beps, neft, and kftc. transactions despite their ubiquity, each these systems rely legacy infrastructure chips that remains vulnerable fraud and transaction inefficiencies. trillion usd transactions legacy infrastructure the underlying technology the global financial network difficult navigate, consisting variety incompatible legacy protocols and standards; many the current electronic settlement systems have remained relatively unchanged for years. for instance, automated clearing house (ach) transactions the united states are still conducted via fixed-width text files (with precisely characters per line), uploaded various ftp servers and downloaded specific times day for settlement. until these transactions cleared the following business day, when nacha announced update allowing for same- ach billion usd million transactions the present state digital payments day payments. this "upgrade" involved changes the underlying specification; rather, banks were required process transactions twice instead once daily. other clearing systems include the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication (swift); the new york clearing house association's chips network; and the federal reserve's fedwire network. each involve substantially more robust checks and balances than ach and benefit from greater speed, increasing the complexity the global financial system. together, these systems transmit staggering quadrillion usd global volume. fraud vulnerability despite the additional supervision involved these ledger systems, their protocols and networks are vulnerable fraud. survey the largest financial institutions, "cybersecurity concerns" was the mostresponded challenge that bank executives said they faced their day-today role, and many such instances theft have recently become public. thieves made off with million usd impersonating central bank swift operators. throughout single weekend, they routed four transactions through the new york fed's mostly automated system, moving million usd from bangladesh the philippines. was only when new york fed official caught thief's misspelling the beneficiary name that they were able alert bangladesh bank officials and prevent the transit additional million usd. larger heist was discovered involving the punjab national bank and promissory "letters understanding" issued through swift, where funds were laundered using password provided bank officials for direct access the swift network. letters understanding were issued for the equivalent nearly billion usd, and they were not correlated with the lesser amount that was registered via swift the bank's holdings. despite repeated warnings against fraudulent swift messaging from the deputy governor the reserve bank india, the scam went undetected for nearly seven years. the present state digital payments transaction inefficiency despite the underlying fraud vectors, funds transmitted over swift, fedwire, chips, and ach incur costs approximately billion usd every day. additionally, transfers require three five days for settlement, and percent payments fail due technical reasons. the blockchain could potentially offer several enhancements these systems, namely cryptographically secure transactions, immutability, and data redundancy. for instance, ripple, prominent startup, allows financial institutions quickly settle cross-border payments using its xcurrent network, claiming percent reduction net cost. remittance providers such western union and moneygram have also piloted using native ripple blockchain tokens (xrp) for settlement. using products such these, believe that blockchains have the potential influence well beyond the primary layer the global financial network. the present state digital payments payment cards direct bank transfers are just one the several steps involved daily processing volume conducting standard transaction with payment card (e.g. credit debit card). practice, the payment card authorization and settlement union pay framework implemented throughout the united states and europe billion usd involves the coordination fewer than six parties order transmit million transactions and guarantee funds. visa although payment cards offer universal acceptance and consumer billion usd benefits, they are prone many single points failure well the million transactions rising costs fraud and incentive fees. mastercard many single points failure the companies involved payment card processing serve mutually exclusive roles and extract share the transaction fee. this fee called "interchange," and has been variously regulated the european union (interchange fee regulation, april and the federal reserve (durbin amendment, july payment cards also mandate secondary network provided entities called "card associations." card associations work with payment processors conduct the three broad stages payment card transaction: authorization (verifying funds accounts either side transaction), clearing (transferring funds between banks after the exchange goods services) and settlement (paying merchant). billion usd million transactions american express billion usd million transactions jcb million usd million transactions discover million usd million transactions the present state digital payments order accept payment cards, merchants incur disproportionately high processing fees which are often one their largest operational costs. responding these rising processing fees, some the largest merchants the us--including walmart, target, best buy, cvs and -eleven--created cooperative organization called merchant customer exchange (mcx), with the charter developing ach-backed payment instrument avoid interchange fees. after three years continuous merchant investment and delayed development, the mcx mobile app never exited pilot phase. although was successful reducing merchant costs processing, mcx was never able deliver compelling consumer value proposition. morgan chase acquired the mcx technology integrate with its existing chase pay system. the past decade, payment card processing fees have skyrocketed for two main reasons: first, because increase fraud, including losses that are paid issuing banks when they reimburse their customers for unauthorized charges; and second, because the consumer demand for better card benefits and rewards high-end credit card products. rising costs fraud emv (europay mastercard visa) chip cards have found mainstream adoption europe, asia and the us, but payment card fraud aggregate has continued rise. despite broad acceptance the card-based technology, million fraudulent accounts were created and account takeovers cost merchants billion usd. additionally, transactions made online (i.e., "card-not-present") have seen fraud losses increase more than percent since the introduction the emv standard. chip-enabled cards have subsequently increased payment security, but are still vulnerable man-in-the-middle attacks, especially when merchants don't upgrade their systems support encrypted transaction data from emv-capable terminals. cards can also cloned from unsophisticated account enumeration, physical card skimmers, rfid readers, simply restaurant waiter with cell phone camera. the present state digital payments the total fraud losses for payment cards worldwide was estimated billion usd, with percent all citizens reporting card fraud within the past five years. recently, the rate identity theft has soared, with more than corporate data breaches, including the theft million credit reports from equifax and million credit card numbers from target. yahoo--now part verizon--also revealed that hackers obtained the personal information its entire database billion worldwide users during attack incentive fees credit card rewards points also contribute the high fees incurred merchants accept these payment instruments. originally introduced american express these points have since become cornerstone consumer marketing for major credit card products. today, travel and dining bonuses have become extremely competitive for the major credit card issuers: chase, capital one, and american express are each vying for coveted "front wallet" placement offering points five percent cash back various purchase categories. result, many industries have developed help the affluent consumer "optimize" their spend for maximum returns, perhaps without realizing that the true cost these rewards subsidized either the small merchant businesses (which lack the required leverage negotiate more affordable interchange rates), the other payment card consumers who finance debt through high monthly apr interest. many small businesses ultimately choose avoid payment cards altogether and revert cashonly transactions, putting them significant consumer disadvantage. the present state digital payments mobile wallets more and more, third-party mobile wallets are becoming mainstream daily processing volume payment instruments, capitalizing their ability aggregate various aspects bank accounts and payment cards and offer even more alipay consumer choice and convenience. while some (like apple pay, google billion usd pay, and samsung pay) simply serve vehicles for virtual cards million transactions proxying existing payment cards' primary account numbers, pans; others (such alipay, wechat pay, paypal, venmo, square cash, wechat pay and apple pay cash) have built suite value-added services and billion usd integrations top what essentially stored value account. million transactions many these mobile wallets have seen substantial growth recent paypal (incl. venmo) years--especially china--but their traditional payment instrument million usd underpinnings present limitations the ability provide meaningful million transactions incentives, grow internationally, and manage fraud vulnerabilities. paytm limited incentives today, even the largest and most successful mobile wallet apps and services enable the vast majority their transactions proxying underlying insured regulated payment instrument, such bank account payment card. functioning this abstraction layer, services like apple pay and paypal are able offer value-added features like enhanced security purchase protection, but are limited their ability provide unique incentives sustainable bonus structures beyond what the underlying instruments already support natively. million usd million transactions the present state digital payments international incompatibility moreover, mobile wallets have seen substantial growth markets without entrenched financial institutions. for example, the absence traditional, credit-based payment infrastructure throughout china, companies like alipay and wechat pay have built direct system that facilitates mobile transactions private payment network over the internet. the rapid growth these platforms--in terms both scale and versatility--is impressive. but because the underlying financial infrastructure still provided domestic financial institutions, international growth encumbered the overhead adapting these systems foreign banks and exchanging currencies. outside payments, the major value third-party mobile wallets their usefulness for internal peer-to-peer transactions via network effects. many people join alipay, wechat, venmo square cash because their friends are there, because it's easier send money phone number username than share account numbers. these features build community, but ultimately limit platform growth these regional groups because users have limited incentive interact internationally. fraud vulnerability mobile wallets are essentially interface existing payment instruments, which can make them vulnerable certain types fraud. storing many payment instruments behind single online account and password, these apps create opportunity for account takeovers, which amounted billion usd losses. many apps also distinguish between peer-to-peer payments and payments for goods and services because their inability mitigate buyer fraud, such chargebacks and ach returns. for example, due its ach underpinnings, venmo's terms and conditions explicitly warn against using the app for retail payments. when fraudster reverses ach transaction used load venmo account, the company forced reverse the transaction within its own ecosystem, sometimes directly debiting beneficiaries' bank accounts. references "cryptocurrency market
