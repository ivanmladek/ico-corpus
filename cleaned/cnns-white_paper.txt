open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and verifiable and permanent way. built upon connecting list digital records, called "blocks", which are linked using cryptography. each block contains cryptographic hash the previous block, timestamp, and transaction data. once recorded, the data any given block cannot tampered with changed retrospectively without alteration all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus the network majority. bitcoin, the pioneer the blockchain technology, was announced the white paper called "bitcoin: peer-to-peer electronic cash system." january its author, satoshi nakamoto released the first bitcoin software that launched the network and the first units the bitcoin cryptocurrency. cryptocurrency refers digital coin that runs blockchain. ethereum, further extended the capability blockchain, replacing bitcoin's more restrictive language with universal blockchain framework run series code with turing-complete virtual machine capability. ethereum allows developers program their own "smart contracts". smart contract computer protocol intended digitally facilitate, verify, enforce the negotiation performance contract. smart contracts allow the performance credible, trackable and irreversible transactions without third parties. blockchain the core technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum that can reduce cost, improve efficiency and data storage security introducing decentralized and peer-to-peer communications trustless and distributed system using cryptography, timestamp, distributed consensus, economic incentives, and more. blockchain itself not brand new technological innovation but creative model that incorporates such series technologies. opportunities and challenges blockchain technology, with its advantages reduced cost, improve efficiency, immutability, security, and transparency, has the potential revolutionize wide range industries, including but not limited the financial industry, supply chain, gaming, healthcare, iot (internet things) and energy. due such broad opportunities, blockchain technology, form decentralized and self-governing system, are drawing significant attention from governments worldwide. while cryptocurrencies remain challenge regulators, various nations claim have been studying

data. divide the global nodes into super nodes and general nodes. super nodes the early stages, cnns will propose super nodes through our super node projects for rapid development the cnns ecosphere encourage highquality content providers and contributors join cnns and provide highquality service all cnns users. cnns users will have the ultimate rights select and deselect super nodes with their votes. this based decentralized voting mechanism and more democratic than other consensus algorithms because cnns will have little influence control the final super node election. cases where super nodes fail perform their duty, they will removed from the list and replaced new super nodes. super nodes include but are not limited the following four types: super nodes responsible for connections with businesses and customers. super marketing nodes responsible for cnns promotion and community growth. super content provider nodes responsible for high-quality contents within the platforms. super contribution nodes responsible for cnns rapid growth. general nodes every user node capable not only communicating with the whole blockchain network but also participating the super node selection according our dpos consensus mechanism. among general nodes, cnns will reward the superior ones including but not limited the following two types, even they don't reach the higher level super node: content nodes able generate high-quality and useful blockchainrelated content. community influencers able help govern the community key opinion leader (kol) details about the election and competition mechanisms super nodes will revealed before the official launch cnns global super node project. token issuance and token economy token issuance the cnns token erc standard token based the ethereum
