powering the decentralised global iot data network economic white paper devices "things" are truly remarkable, within just the mxprotocol remarkable solution, unmatched years the iot data market will experience sensational any other iot device data offering the market. increase over comparatively speaking, the global population expected billion, however the same year, there'll over billion devices connecting the internet* resulting massive network congestion. (*source: ihs). this data generated devices (in billions) today already pushing the limit. wi-fi doesn't have the network capacity cope with the colossal increase device generated data. wi-fi networks have reached tipping point. device data growing dramatic rate, things continue make our lives easier the current network facilities are struggling cope, will zb. lpwan network capability wi-fi network capability everyday challenges, mxprotocol solutions the mxc "machine exchange protocol" facilitates the uninterrupted exchange information between connected devices. the intrinsic blockchain based mxc protocol ensures devices connect the internet using the most convenient lpwan gateway lying range. this "convenience" determined using essential factors: cost per downlink, signal quality, availability and mxc influential algorithmic factors convenience cost per downlink signal quality availability smart bidding sensors mxprotocol: smart bidding, inter-chain data market street lights, garbage sensors send lot packets day, which jam the free licensed bands. door lock needs unlocked few seconds, smart bidding solves the problem doing the network resource auction, the highest bid takes the link resource. platforms like ethereum, rootstock are quite data hungry, they need oracles feed smart contracts. data market protocol for different blockchains purchase data from mxc using their own token. failed bid downlink accepted bid data blockchain data market applications inter-chain data market smart contracts' oracles there's truly never been better time part mxc. we're delivering tomorrow's device data solutions, today and we've only just begun!
