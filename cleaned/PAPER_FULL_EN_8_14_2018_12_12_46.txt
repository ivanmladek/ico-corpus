overview locus chain locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain overview locus chain executive summary locus chain state the art blockchain protocol that can maintain stable transaction time even the number nodes and transactions increase using account wise transaction chain (awtc). through the use awtc, locus chain able provide high transaction speed for every user the eco-system and the network. scalability essential for any blockchain protocol. locus chain applies the latest technology unique dynamic state sharding the transaction ledger block resolve the problems associated with ever-growing data size. the locus chain main net uses very fair and competitive consensus model, vrf-pbft pos+dpos, that revolutionary ensures proper compensation based the relevant contribution the locus chain network. using the most advanced technology locus chain, smart contracts can executed even harshest network environments that other blockchain protocols will not able to. furthermore, locus chain resistant quantum computing attacks, huge threat existing cryptography system. abstract the hype and craze cryptocurrency have given sneak peak the large scale decentralized blockchain revolution with mass adoption the future. currently, most the services and protocols control and retain majority the profits under the pretext user security and asset safety. this results large amount resources being spent government bodies and organizations. cryptocurrency and the notion decentralization have become very well endorsed today's landscape, and token generation event (tge) one the most popular fundraising tools allows for decentralization the funds raised. decentralization might finally the sight people again due strong influence cryptocurrency popularity. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain revisiting the past, the centralized operating models tend incur the operating cost the company and provides safe haven for those power. however, through the use cryptocurrency coupled with decentralized operating model, these issues can mitigated. the moment, the utmost goal cryptocurrency projects will gain mass adoption replacing fiat the ideal payment solutions to. this overly idealistic there insufficient technological infrastructure place support such adoption and transition. nonetheless, this does not impede with the booming the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. time come, will not surprising use cryptocurrency our daily lives. throughout the course history, currency holds specific value specific group people and can used exchange for something equivalent higher value. what this translates for the various decentralized cryptocurrency platforms that has achieve common value and liquidity. this competitive yet intriguing characteristic digital currency will result showdown between the top tier cryptocurrencies they compete the most widely adopted cryptocurrency. this have extensive requirements the technical system that the cryptocurrency running and thus locus chain have taken extensive consideration when designing their protocol. introduction locus chain strives the digital currency with state-of-the-art technology that will the heart all the smart cities and massive economies through strategic partnerships and key collaboration. the approach locus chain not compete with centralized government agencies and powerhouse from traditional industry but instead form lasting strategic partnerships develop locus chain together achieve mass adoption and wide spread acceptance. eventually, locus chain will stable coin being used extensively. locus chain pride itself the solid technological footing has maintain high amount transaction per second (tps) even when the number transaction increase exponentially. with plan for locus chain implemented smart cities, locus chain being developed with extremely high technical standards meet the needs smart city areas such machine machine (mm) authentication system. locus chain have incorporated advance algorithm and consensus their system design prepare for such high-level technical requirements. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain locus chain philosophy decentralization was first introduced satoshi nakamoto along with bitcoin. decentralization very well received concept allows the transparency and integrity the transaction that happen isolated from external factors such politics financial gains. however, many blockchain protocol today did not address the issue decentralization and focus developing business idea that will sell well investors instead. otherwise, they are overly centric the tps their product and neglect other important aspects. however, for locus chain, decentralization along with superior tps and functionality will both achieved. there are obstacles such low tps, poor security, high transaction fees and poor structure design impeding cryptocurrencies from becoming mainstream payment methodology. locus chain have accurately identified such obstacles and already have found the solution tackle these issues realize their goals being the mass adopted blockchain protocol transaction and authentication that can used such energy and iot. the previous few digital revolutions have alleviated the social divide and inequality society today. with blockchain, locus chain can reduce inequality and promote sustainable growth. above and beyond pure business profit, locus chain aspire the blockchain protocol for all business and all global citizens. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain chapter related literature previous studies and cases locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain related literature previous studies and cases bitcoin many people are still amazed bitcoin's innovative concept even though its technology relatively outdated the moment. bitcoin has some disadvantages used our everyday lives, but bitcoin has obviously led new era. figure ..a comparison between bitcoin's blockchain and locus chain the following are the advantages bitcoin: decentralization operates without central server. need emphasize this advantage. this the core every cryptocurrencies and the related business. bitcoin achieves decentralization the true sense which completely rules out centralized facilities. transparency transaction records are transparent and cannot manipulated. similar the role balancing the pendulum decentralization. with these two elements, can get inspirations for fair, efficient society. about true efficiency beyond mere prevention corruption distortion. the above mentioned two advantages bitcoin will clearly reflected the philosophy locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain locus chain development works. however, consider that the following disadvantages that must overcome: slow transaction speed due the designed capacity block throughput, takes long time for the transactions confirmed. high fees high fee incurred for fast processing since there limit the volume and unit time transaction addition. power-inefficient the pow calculation required for each block consumes considerable amount electric energy. not scalable the more nodes there are, the longer the waiting time. addition, there will frequent collisions; thus, increasing the amount power consumption. unstable value since difficult use the real-world financial case, evaluated simple asset, and are not sure about its future values. iota the ledger saving data structure switched from the blockchain dag remove the limitation the speed add-on transaction. result, the transaction speed greatly improved among many scalability issues. authentication mandatory whenever any node adds transaction. therefore, fee gained when there mining. nano nano uses account-wise transaction chain the name block lattice, which kind dag. has reduced the frequency collisions the transaction and also removes the speed limit. there locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain neither mining nor fee, which means less incentive consensus nodes the collisions. compared other blockchains, the structure blocks relatively less complex, there unique attack vector such precomputed pow attacks. light node exists, but the ledger state sharding full nodes not mentioned. zilliqa zilliqa has adopted the "network sharding" and can enhance the performance entire system the number nodes increased. state sharding has yet introduced. radix radix has adopted "state sharding, and algorithm explore the transfer order two randomly selected transactions even when the partial order each transaction defined. once the number shards set, cannot changed. will disclosed the second half algorand each time you select block, you will choose node add block and committee node verify based vrf (verifiable random function), and then process consensus based pbft. each pbft phase, different node selected, very hard attack it. consensus voting depends the stakes. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain chapter goals locus chain locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain goals locus chain discussed the overview, make sure that locus chain used payment method wide range fields from energy, communications smart city, least allow have high asset values, will develop locus chain fulfill the following goals: sufficiently fast transaction speed fast and reliable transaction the primary requisite enable locus chain used financial transactions. our goal achieve high transaction speed. other blockchain technologies may also aim have high transaction speed, but the most critical issue how one can maintain stable high transaction time despite the increasingly huge number nodes transactions. locus chain will incorporate account-wise transaction chain (awtc) architecture accomplish this. technology improve transaction reliability the smart contract technology which implemented many next-generation blockchain technologies will also supported locus chain with the promise fast, reliable transaction environment. efficient data structure and consensus algorithm locus chain uses awtc, type dag provide high transaction speed for every user and the entire locus chain network. the consensus algorithm will based new consensus algorithm model that ensures proper compensation depending the contribution the network without using the traditional proof-of-work (pow). our design will incorporate stake-based proof-ofstake together with the delegated proof-of-stake (pos+dpos) scheme, combined with verifiable random function based practical byzantine fault tolerance (vrf-pbft) algorithm order achieve two main goal decentralization and fast transaction. the core design and algorithmic choice locus chain not only improves the speed and capacity but will also enable the reliability whole network far future without concentration power. are also designing our system sustainable. some blockchain systems with decreasing transaction processing compensations (mining returns) may not sustainable the compensations are critically dropped the future. for that reason, many different blockchain companies are announcing plans change their compensation method. locus chain has very clear vision and goal future locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain proof, from the very beginning our r&d. blockchain technology with scalability and flexibility offer better scalability with high transaction speed, dynamic state sharding technology will applied locus chain. dividing blocks into smaller manageable sub-blocks ("shards") will resolve the problem ever-growing data size. moreover, are organizing multiple application development teams provide various types programming interfaces and hardware applications early possible. secure technology the locus chain team expects that the attacks utilizing the quantum computing power can threat the existing security systems and cryptography system. therefore, having the resistance tolerance against the abusing the quantum computing environment the one the important development tasks the locus chain team. will collaborate with top-notch university labs that specialize for the relevant fields (security and cryptography). even after the locus chain's main net launches, will continue apply research results this field ensure the highest level security. locuschain.com

with ceo mohamed gabry from oncomed solutions when blockchains are applied healthcare services, medical data that was difficult standardize due reliability and cost can standardized low cost. addition, since all medical records patients can checked all hospitals, reliability various imaging and test data increased, and medical records and charts are transparently managed. comprehensive health management patients will much easier. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain chapter business applications locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain business applications business vision recently there are many teams among blockchain related developers who trying focus the optimization for the certain usage specialized the target industry and naturally various alt-coins are newly emerging. these alt coins are being developed several different blockchain platforms-based dapp (decentralized application). since single company cannot control the entire industry, these approaches are surely the most realistic ways increasing the scale the entire blockchain business. when the smartphone's revolution has started, various industries have created many different types applications for the smartphone (google's android and apple's ios) and could get the benefit from those applications. now, believe that new experiences from the smart phone's applications had very positive impacts the entire human society. still, one should pay attention the fact that the development blockchain platform differs from the development business the past, since separate payment and authentication structure will eventually required for each goal, therefore connecting them becomes the most critical issue. result, matter which you use, there need generate transaction between business areas using different types blockchains, there has kind relay system that operates reliably. connecting such blockchains with totally different structures may raise concerns terms technology and business since they can increase costs security vulnerability. reduce the risks relaying other systems, take the direction develop the integrated(universal) blockchain platform, which has the homogeneous but advanced structure. discussed earlier, locus chain uses the same basic structure supporting various dapps (decentralized applications) one platform token; note, however, will integrated blockchain that enables the most transactions and authentications under one blockchain technology. business structure very difficult task create the organic protocol, which can interact with the various different protocols developed for different fields, since each protocol digital coin will exist act its own independent system. not easily realizable matter both terms technology and locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain business and this attempt can easily cause the security vulnerability well therefore, locus chain team's primary goal develop the most flexible platform blockchain, which can integrated one unit. are setting the technical features locus chain for these goals and carrying out r&d implement them. figure ..a overview the full business structure when locus chain becomes successfully commercialized technology, the locus tokens would then used transaction currency the market beyond simply serving the transactions. present, are connected various companies organizations providing various energy and communication services construction smart cities for the near future; are cooperating with many partners from the early stage their project development for locus chain utilized fundamental technology. therefore, when each smart city our partners constructed, locus chain will used cryptocurrency for each smart city, supporting almost every type transaction such bb, bc, locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain cc, mm. various on/offline network transactions using locus chain within city will expand various industry fields, and every transaction will connected single currency the locus chain ecology. the locus chain technology will used method for authenticating and recording every service; result, transparent, accurate service will achieved, significantly improving the overall level trust the city. will first apply locus chain individual smart city industry field, and then verify the test net that can eventually make connection between individual smart cities industry fields implement the smart world. the common usability locus chain, enables use unit transaction for various industry fields; thus giving reason believe that the future value locus chain very massive. the smart city project the very good example that can shows the vision and business goal locus chain, since demands, requires various types highly advanced technologies for many areas and also the reformation the transactions. have seen and heard from various news media, smart city the space for providing very high-level digital service all areas such administration, transportation, residence, shopping, entertainment, and legal affairs. you try implement them all centralized structure, then highly likely incur high costs, induce technical dependence, and give rise numerous security problems. once the construction the smart city starts, one can easily meet the conflict between cost and efficiency, because certain process transaction shall handled the low cost have the usability, despite being highly related safety and privacy. remote technology becomes common, such problems will emerge more often. business applications starting with the energy and communication sectors, locus chain will used transaction and authentication tool for various fields such medical, shopping, iot, and public sectors. here, will give examples several industry fields and application methods thereof. internet things (iot) internet things (iot) industrial area where many companies have been carrying out r&d since smart devices were introduced the market. iot the technology that connects the internet using various sensors and communication functions within various things. objects are connected with each other through wireless communication; the course data exchanges, locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain each object can analyze and learn the information its own and pass users allow users adjust them remotely. iot application areas range from electronics used frequently our daily lives mobile devices, various wearable pcs, automobiles, and building systems. since expect the future scale the industry massive, many global companies are participating it. particular, with communication technology and smart device technology continuing evolve rapidly, the development the iot industry seems very promising; since every iot device vulnerable external hacking, however, perfect security technology required. especially the fields automobile, heating devices, and locking devices where safety important issue person's life property can severely affected, believe that iot requires blockchain-based technologies. the blockchain market, special blockchain technology for iot has emerged, and has already been proven more suitable for application the iot industry than the existing blockchain technologies. based the information disclosed far, believe that other competing blockchain technology developers have resolved the issue speed certain degree but have failed address the security issue when the number nodes drops below certain limit the unit network specific time when network communication reduced region with poor network conditions. most the iot devices are composed small hardware modules, and they tend have small memory. this case, the blockchain can cause fatal problem compared the centralized system, and the problem consistently increasing block size mentioned earlier can emerge earlier than expect. the block size increased given the insufficient memory, the problem must fixed immediately before normal operation can guaranteed. are fully aware that the problem very urgent one that needs fixed. briefly mentioned while explaining the game and online service areas, the problem can fixed our unique blockchain technology methods. conclusion, the technology that can realize high transaction speed and security and small-sized blocks are the prerequisites for use fundamental basis for the iot industry. once the locus chain network completed, the problem will removed completely, can use properly commercial service. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain resource and energy the existing centralized transaction resource and energy involves process wherein specific customer purchases the product traditional minerals, oil, latest wind power generation from the producer and makes individual transaction. this type transaction, since specific organization solely owns the individual transaction information, called capitalintensive structure wherein they can control the cost for transaction with each producer and the company country owning the sole rights supposed gain more profits. eventually, the transaction method centralized for several agents leads the end user's relatively greater disadvantages. with the introduction locus chain, however, every person organization can supply resource and energy. addition, since direct transaction can realized while all the transaction records are disclosed, the transaction itself becomes highly reliable and fair according the market principle. apart from the existing problem with transaction information rights centralized certain persons, there the issue efficiency. there slight problem within the producer the production process for example, the mid-manager corrupt, outdated production facility causes measurement errors then becomes difficult find the cause the entire system quickly; there will also variance the production costs. introduce locus chain this series processes, however, then will able set direct transaction between the producer and the customer and manage all the processes including distribution and purchase transparently and real time and clarify the history tracking process. eventually, will able reduce the production and distribution costs significantly. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain figure ...a resource and energy application other words, with the help the technological excellence the locus chain-based system, can support (i) the authentication the energy production distribution, (ii) verification the transactions between end users, (iii) unmanned transaction/process implementing the (machine machine) communications for all the deals energy and resources-- all which were not possible with the existing blockchain technologies. for this reason, many politicians and companies countries regions producing lots energy and resource are participating advisers for locus chain. communication the current communication sector shares similar characteristics with the energy sector previously described. the service provider that implemented the communication network the sole owner the individual transaction information, and they tend demand very high prices consistently from large number specific customers who use the network order pay off the initial costs for implementing the network. according the market principle, cannot say that this wrong since specific service provider solely owns the information about the repair, maintenance, and control the network, however, this can give rise various unfairness issues. such, customers cannot get fair transaction communication service due the nontransparent market policy. this the most urgent problem that needs fixed. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain since the blockchain technology applied the communication sector, now possible disclose the history more precise, detailed network use; thus, the efficiency network use will improve, and fair trade will then realized between the network owner and the consumers. the network operator can configure the entire network efficiently and provide transparent price policy gain the trust customers, who turn will able pay fair price for their service use. moreover, regardless the size and time period, resale becomes very easy achieve. thus, many new customer-friendly services driven vno (virtual network operator) and mvno(mobile virtual network operator), who will cooperate with the licensed network operator for using the small sized network including wi-fi network, could more actively developed. this vision the future will ensure that various types mvnos (mobile virtual network operator) vnos (virtual network operator) which have been not easily allowed many countries will have the proper positions the market based the detailed, diversified service model. instead luring consumers with big-budgeted marketing protect their own profits, network operator will make efforts and allocate more budget improve the fundamental quality-assurance network service; eventually, they will able gain profits and customer trust the same time. moreover, consumers will free from the burden paying additional fees for the initial network implementation and able pay fair fees based network use. figure ...a locuschain.com communication application (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain therefore, locus chain plans sign the strategic partnerships with various service providers (network operators) the middle east and africa support the more efficient, transparent network. through the verification efficiency, can achieve the one big vision the smart city with communication infra followed the smart world with ultra-connections. medical locus chain combined with the healthcare service, medical data whose standardization used difficult due reliability and cost issues can now standardized into the medical data blockchain cloud, etc. low cost; result, small hospitals lacking digital systems due the high cost can easily check all the history patient's medical records and can more easily obtain the past medical data sent from other clinics. since the full history the patient's medical record can viewed, the examination's accuracy and reliability can much more improved; thus, medical records and charts can managed transparently. consequently, the medical charge billed public/private health insurance medical accident disputes cannot manipulated; the hospitals and medical staff's preference and abilities are disclosed more clearly, and the entire medical industry expected advanced further. the future, expect the level machine examination, remote examination, customized examination improve further. the application team locus chain will develop closed/open blockchain cloud system the future support the safe, easy management medical records low cost. public the above described three industries, profit public and private sectors are mixed combined. therefore, the role and responsibility those sectors are usually decided upon the policy each government. industrial areas where public and private profits are mixed, all the rights are assigned the private sector, then likely for specific company have monopoly over the information. avoid such side effects, usually most the government tends control such business government project, which operated and funded government budget. case government-funded project, however, there are limits many aspects such human resource management the operating entity, facility repair and maintenance; many cases, hardly achieved the cost-effective operation from the government driven projects and can very sensitive weakness since the government budget based the tax income from the taxpayers. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain figure ...a public application the locus chain-based blockchain technology applied public investment, however, then the characteristics blockchain wherein all the transaction ledgers are disclosed will enable realizing transparent transactions. moreover, since possible track the progress and actual transaction costs from the past when the government selecting company, the overall investment efficiency will increase further. consequently, can make sure that the efficiency tax money spending improved, and the proper amount budget spent only necessary area. can also wield positive impacts the national economy, and the citizens the country can receive benefits indirectly directly well. game and online service areas with the blockchain technology becoming the center attention for the market, the entire game industry began show interest contents development. fact, present, various crypto games are being developed. for example, the ethereum dapp-based crypto game called crypto kitty digital cat collection game based the ethereum platform. from the perspective game contents, about simply buying and breeding cats and selling them back the market. very similar the tamagotchi game that appeared the market about years ago. there nothing new terms content; with the cryptocurrency gaining popularity however, became the center attention the market because transaction made the game connected locuschain.com the ethereum (c)locus chain all rights reserved network. page locus chain figure ...a game and online service application game user who buys, breeds, sells cat will connected the ethereum network, and gets consume acquire ethereum just like when making transaction through the cryptocurrency market. user's action simply involves the use contents the game; reality, however, there will transaction occurring the ethereum network, gas consumed processing fees. possible configure similar service online game general service application; the locus chain network, however, will adopt further improved compensation methods. for locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain example, when user uses contents service within the game, the locus chain network maintained, contributes transactions consensus, will differentiate the level compensation depending the level contribution. will explain later the chapters technology; instead doing heavy workloads, will apply new concept network contribution wherein all you have place node online. since all user needs contribute the networks continue using the locus chain-based service, the compensation method will somewhat similar receiving points cashbacks frequently used the current market. compared the existing service wherein user does high-cost mining acquire tokens, much better terms accessibility and node distribution. charity works and education areas what businesses make man most human? are sure everyone believes education and charity works are some them. from the eyes reasoning rather than from eyes with sympathy compassion, all believe that charity work can bring about huge profits for mankind. mankind has developed much the inherent unfairness has disappeared, there need prove that education and charity works can bring the best benefits mankind. the biggest problem with charity work that not trust the efficiency transparency expenditures. for such reason, relatively less amount funds collected, the organizations are forced use very stimulating video clips new ways raise funds, and the viewers watch them with frowns their faces. charity organizations can gain their trust through efficient and transparent fund execution, then more funds will collected, and the range beneficiaries will widened. the locus chain foundation engaged serious discussion the matter with several charity work organizations. the entire process fund raising execution disclosed completely, everyone will more willing charity work. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain figure ...a charity works and education true charity works must accompanied cooperation for basic training. will aggressively participate the process through cooperation with several charity work organizations. addition, will provide software technology training beyond basic training. regions with inherent technological subordination the western world and asia with highly advanced technologies, governments have hard time developing the industry very quickly they can only select few excellent students who will get study abroad. politicians from such areas and the locus chain foundation are discussing possibilities for direct and indirect cooperation such construction technology center. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain chapter technical design locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain technical design approaches locus chain the main focus locus chain scalability. achieve this goal, are pursuing dynamic state sharding. expect that the usage blockchain will increased, much the transaction speed getting faster, but the problem that the size the ledger will also escalate much larger. our opinion, there point discussing practicality this problem not resolved. resolve this complex problem, decided adopt the awtc ledger data structure and the stake based vrf-pbft consensus algorithm. consider that this approach can implement more flexible block-ledger's sharding and can support smart contracts much better. are currently developing practical test bed based this structure. block awtc (account-wise transaction chain lattice) a.k.a. nano awtc (account-wise transaction chain) type dag, that has separate blockchain ledger per account and stands out since the performance whole system can improved without the slow-down transaction speed, even the number nodes increased. easy apply dynamic state sharding well. ledger structure adopted under the name "block lattice" "nano" for the first time. but locus chain doesn't follow the exactly same per-account blockchain with nano, since locus chain uses different consensus algorithm. vrf pbft consensus locus chain adopts definitive consensus method without branching the ledger data order ease transaction processing under sharding. when adding transaction, each node selects the committee independently based vrf (verifiable random function) and stakes order reach the verifiable random function based practical byzantine fault

vrt-pbft consensus algorithm, where the verification multiple nodes for each transaction are required, facilitate smooth transactions, introduce the concept gas sub currency which earned when verifying transaction and spent when creating transaction support the smooth operation the locus chain network. one wants send out transaction without gas, then either has wait verify another

total issuable token will gradually mined. when there are small number active nodes, especially the early years, locus chain would periodically mined the incentives encouraging transactions and maintaining network stability. the minable number tokens can decided upon the frequency, that each node has participated verify transactions. since node must connected the network the time selected committee member verify transactions, the more stakes there are and the longer connected the network, the more tokens being mined. the number additional tokens mined decreases gradually depending the remaining number tokens. after certain time period, they will all issued; after that, issuance will only done refill the spent amount fee. locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain chapter tokenomics design locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain tokenomics design tokens the token type before the main net will ethereum-based erc token with smart contract issued locus chain foundation based singapore. however, given that the tokens the public ethereum network cannot used the locus chain directly, will making use hashed time-locked contracts allow -to- atomic swaps locus tokens from the ethereum main-net the locus chain. multiple examples such cross-chain atomic swaps already exist, such republic protocol, comit. for simplicity, will not attempt integrate these protocols, and will only support -to- atomic swaps locus tokens from the public ethereum main-net locus chain. token economy the primary design the token distribution and economic incentives were centralized around three concepts that act foundational pillars that underpin the rest the ecosystem value mechanisms: value stability and security incentive compatibility proportional contributions the ecosystem decentralization value aggregation and ownership order fulfill these three criteria, locus chain's consensus mechanism will use form proofof-stake, which allows the delegated proof-of-stake well, otherwise termed "pos+dpos". within locus chain's system, anyone can become "full user" who able participate the validation transactions earn coins their incentive, which form mining. full users can become the validators downloading the ledger and meeting the criteria that they have not delegated their stakes, followed maintaining their connection and staking long enough. this model suited nodes running background desktop pcs normally connected the internet. when the node delegates its stake, the node then classified "light user". light users not mine coins but have the capabilities transact without keeping the ledger, this model thus suited for nodes running hardware with lesser processing power like smart phones. this choice gives freedom anyone validator mine locus long they have accumulated lot stakes and have long internet access time, regardless their hardware specifications and hash locuschain.com (c)locus chain all rights reserved page locus chain power. the pos+dpos locus chain mitigates against asymmetric mining circumstances, the barriers mining locus tokens are low, and anyone can mining easily. the system ultimately only allows programmatic rules that can prevent from delegating errors byzantine faults (malicious hacking attempts). apart from these rules, any other artificial interventions aren't allowed the system, and this reinforces high levels decentralization. such mechanism better than traditional dpos prices the positive externalities contributions the ecosystem and network, which currently undervalued. aside from the usual benefits dpos such faster processing speeds and not needing waste unnecessary energy hashing, our incentive mechanism also very effective for kickstarting stable and constant growth the platform, which key factor that barrier for many new blockchain platform entrants. this gap that have seen other consensus mechanisms, which not sufficiently factor the high risks associated with early contributors, whereas our pos+dpos mechanism scales rewards based the such associated contributions. rewarding early contributors fairly for the risks associated with building top our new platform, send strong message that shows that value platform creators and enablers that help generate platform growth. token allocation total billion locus tokens has been
