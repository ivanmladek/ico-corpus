certification, the process even more fragmented. degree certifications and grade reports can altered, difficult verify, non-verifiable many situations. employers spend significant amount resources searching for candidates with the right skill set, and even more resources check their references and verify their academic records and skill certifications. all these problems can solved with immutable and verifiable blockchain based system. particular, the following areas are most affected inaccuracies education, skill, and employment history: (a) degree inflation inaccurate false education and degree information being listed resumes order gain employment attain high position industry. high profile case scott thompson left the employment yahoo! its chief executive officer after

(b) skill inflation certain specialised industries value and seek candidates with the right skill set. result, many applicants who apply for jobs such industries will claim have the requisite skills their resumes. for example, certain information technology skills become increasingly demand, claims applications possessing certain information technology certification areas such big data artificial intelligence have become more common. entirely the employer verify such claims. situations where certification provided private organisations academic institutions, verification such academic credentials can difficult. (c) job experience inflation inaccuracies job experience stated resumes are not limited certain sectors, but are pervasive across industries. the following are some the more well-known cases that took place recent years (i) celebrity chef robert irvine lied about designing price charles and princess diana's wedding cake business insider. this what happened executives who lied about their resumes. https://goo.gl/qqwqf shirl; keeler janet; reiley laura february montgomery, ben; kennedy. chef spiced his past exploits. st.petersburgtimes, echolink blockchain based professional networking and recruiting platform (d) chen (ii) massachusetts institute technology mit dean never received any college degrees despite claiming have bachelor's and master's degrees; (iii) jeffrey papows, president ibm's software maker lotus development, fibbed about his academic and military background; (iv) top wall street analyst lied about studying mit when actually attended boston university. one time, salomon smith barney's jack grubman was wall street's highest-paid analyst with salary million per year; (v) former university notre dame head coach lied about receiving master's degree and being football legend college when never even played game; (vi) top norwegian bureaucrat lied about being registered nurse and having degrees. she was sentenced months prison; and (vii) bausch lomb chief executive officer lied about his masters business administration mba "). ronald zarrella had forfeit his bonus million when was revealed that never received his mba from new york university claimed. commenced study the programme, but did not fact complete it; (viii) former harvard university student adam wheeler fabricated scholastic aptitude test (sat) scores, letters recommendations, and transcripts gain admission and received grants. wheeler's true academic credentials were revealed when attempted apply for the rhodes and fulbright scholarships his senior year. cross border verification the global number students who study abroad continues rise with annual increase there were almost million international students the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) has projected that, with demographic changes, the international student population likely reach million often difficult ascertain information regarding degree skill level certification across borders. also difficult judge the quality education for degree holders from abroad, with the exception well-known universities.

pay? http://blog.verifirst.com/blog/bid//cost-of-a-background-check-how-much-should-you-pay june echolink blockchain based professional networking and recruiting platform chen advantages blockchain traditionally, any kind credential verification has depended the issuing institution other trusted authority confirm the authenticity credential. this time consuming and costly process. the issuing organisation has ceased exist, records are lost and unverifiable. the blockchain provides more robust solution the form distributed network recorded ledger. blockchain cannot easily altered taken down, removes single points failure, and ensures that records can verified without any organisational dependency. the blockchain logs transactions between parties, and can used verify: (a) existence record; (b) that record has not been altered since its issuance; (c) the identity the issuing institution; (d) ownership the record; and (e) that the record has not expired been revoked. this all done distributed and public system. all amendments and alterations the record are also recorded the distributed ledger, which provides chain evidence the record well. once record, the form smart contract the blockchain, has been cryptographically created and recorded the blockchain, cannot altered spoofed. any person attempting impersonate issuing institution will not able execute the smart contract. decentralized key registries map keys and institutions across different industries. economic incentives the echolink system operates public blockchains, which greatly reduces the cost operating similar system traditional web environment. the case the ethereum platform, with properly written smart contract, the cost execution fixed gas. given that the speed transaction confirmation not the most critical factor the context hereto, the smart contract may confirmed slower pace. when confirmation transaction done around seconds, the cost around usd per record creation. for sizable university, such university california, berkeley, with graduating class approximately students, the cost creating digital proofs graduation for the entire class year approximately usd per year. the case the neo public blockchain, with allocation free gas per smart contract, the echolink system essentially runs free charge most situations. this greatly reduces the cost maintaining the system. the economic benefits are shared with all the participants the system. for businesses particular, our system reduces the cost verification, which directly translates into reduction cost hiring. for academic and training institutions our system removes the burden maintaining verification system, which most cases requires personnel and equipment. this amounts savings operational costs. addition, our system passes portion the fees paid echolink blockchain based professional networking and recruiting platform chen businesses issuing organisations. this creates positive economic incentive for issuing organisations. for students our system makes their credentials credible. potential employers put greater trusted verified education, skill, and work experience. our system injects higher degree seriousness employer queries, and provides students greater exposure the job market. technical implementation overview the echolink system consists four major components, and offers heterogeneous and multiple blockchain support: (a) digital identity and mapping system translates digital identity real world names and well known institutions; (b) on-chain credential creation system supports batch creation and storage credentials; (c) off-chain data i/o system external data input and output from web, database, feeds, etc.; and (d) multi-chain data browser for end user intuitive

identity the corresponding student. all information stored blockchain encrypted format. through the echolink browser, users may find candidates matching certain attributes based recorded certificate degree information. query results will resolved the naming service into user-friendly readable format. results are presented the end user the echolink browser. figure echo system overview echolink blockchain based professional networking and recruiting platform chen envisaged that all certificate degree information will entered into the system the relevant issuing organisations, which lends the credibility and integrity the certificate degree information. note [reference implementation] ethereum. the echo system supports neo, dash, iota, and other blockchains. digital identity and credential creation the echolink system utilises publics key (for example, ethereum addresses) identify entities the echolink system. each student intended hold public key the system. each issuing organisation will also have public key (in other words, account) the echolink system. credentials creation involves the issuing organisation executing smart contract that binds the issuer (for example, the academic institution) the recipient (for example, the student) along with the corresponding credentials information. the smart contract acts proof existence the credentials blockchain. since the smart contract executed the issuer, can certain the authority such credential. ... digital identity digital identities the participants the system are stored the blockchain the form public keys. students and known issuers will have set public keys that are recognised the community. the public keys are used the creation credentials the echolink system. the echolink system provides convenient way mapping public keys students, known issuers, and their accreditation. business organisations pay fee the form echolink token access the mapping information real world identities and public keys the echolink system. ... credential creation issuing entities create credentials executing smart contracts that set the status the state the smart contract. the case ethereum, smart contracts with state information are time-stamped and stored the blockchain. this mechanism creates immutable proof existence. issuing entities may include the recipient's public key address, degree information, even hashed value photographs and paper degree files into the blockchain. even though the blockchain can downloaded into node and scanned, the information contained the echolink system smart contract are only utilisable after resolution from the identity mapping service the echolink system. the state information (in other words, credential details) presented user-friendly readable format through the echolink browser. encrypted document storage utilised store image and binary information associated with certain credential. once called upon, images and other binary files can accessed the echolink browser, thus providing the end user with rich media experience accustomed business users. echolink blockchain based professional networking and recruiting platform chen figure encrypted document storage one method implementing such off chain data feed through interplanetary file system ipfs images files portable document format (pdf) associated with the recipient are stored ipfs. hashed addresses such documents are used the smart contract that generates the credentials, thus linking additional documents the credential. ... digital identity mapping system stated above, digital identities the participants the echolink system are stored the blockchain the form public keys. since the echolink system system that intended provide trustworthy credentials, anonymity not requirement for the users the echolink system. the contrary, participants the echolink system should make their identities known order respond system queries. the echolink system provides mapping service map public keys identities students and organisations. this mapping service related the echolink browser the end users, and transparent the end user. only during the presentation query results

will span the globe. the echolink system intended serve students from various countries studying abroad. businesses recruiting internally may also use our system find the best talent worldwide. the echolink system will eventually need provide support for data stored different blockchains operating different technology platform and countries. echolink blockchain based professional networking and recruiting platform chen the echolink system operates through smart contracts for credential creation various blockchains. blockchain platforms that offer support for smart contracts with turin-complete virtual machines can used the underlying blockchain layer for the echolink system. (for example, ethereum, neo, and dash). although not necessary, blockchains that offer oracle access off chain data would more compatible with echolink premium features, such graphical credential certificates. the mechanism establish multi-blockchain support through the echolink browser. the end user interface for smart contracts multiple back-end blockchains. the nature the supported blockchain can public ledger, alliance ledger, even private ledgers. the echolink browser provides readable and user friendly interface multiple blockchains. economic model indicated earlier the paper, large amounts financial resources and personnel are spent acquiring talent businesses around the world. average, each user linkedin's corporate recruiter service pays per year. linkedin generated staggering million from such solutions alone. the need find the right job candidate the fundamental economic driver the echolink system. the fees paid business users contribute the health the echolink system. portion the fees are distributed education and training organisations incentives provide verified information. portion the fees also contribute the actual upkeep the echolink system. token echolink system echolinktoken the echolink system provides exchange medium pay fees between users and other participants the system the form the echolinktoken (symbol: eko). with support for heterogeneous back-end blockchain data sources the echolink system, common exchange medium needed. the echolink smart contract and multi-blockchain browser have built-in support for the echolinktoken across different blockchain systems. therefore, data providers from public blockchains, alliance blockchains, and even private blockchain would easily rewarded with echolinktokens. even more important use the echolinktoken establish international education reputation and skill level market place. with the echolinktoken the common method value exchange the echolink system, quality education different countries, institutions, and disciplines can measured common and consistent token. conclusion the echolink system user focused blockchain application system, and designed from user perspective. the echolink system supports multiple blockchain platforms across countries. addresses acute business need, namely identifying great talent with verified credentials reduced cost. the echolink system driven real-world economic needs and built top sound economic model. furthermore, the echolink system breaks down barriers between education systems, credential verification systems, and value systems bring out truly trusted and worldwide talent market. future work plan further strengthen the echolink system focusing the following areas: echolink blockchain based professional networking and recruiting platform (a) next generation end user access and interaction: both mobile and desktop; (b) more industries support addition talent and education; and (c) education credential valuation market based echolink system users voting. chen addition improvements the echolink system, the same design principle can utilised create blockchain based notary, transaction, and proof existence system for other industries. acknowledgements would like acknowledge several industry veterans for advising our project. whitepaper versions echo april initial release echo july first updated draft echo october second updated draft echo november third updated draft code base codebase: https://github.com/echolinktech/echolink
