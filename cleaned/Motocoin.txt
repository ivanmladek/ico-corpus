motocoin crypto-currency new kind. inspired bitcoin but has major difference. bitcoin based scheme called proof-of-work. this scheme miners perform some computations (called work) their computers and then use proof that work secure coin transactions and get their reward. motocoin similar bitcoin but instead relying work done computers relies work done humans. this work consists playing moto-simulator game, hence the currency name. people play the game and get rewarded for this. call this scheme proof-of-play. proof-of-play proof-of-work block nonce hash(block, nonce) gpu asic for bitcoin. level generation levels are generated using perlin noise. there good description perlin noise: http://webstaff.itn.liu.se/~stegu/tnm-/perlinnoiselinks/perlin-noise-math-faq.html perlin noise fact function assume that there ground where value this function less than certain threshold and sky greater.
