these being the fundamental parameters contributing pro"table retail business. opportunity the exciting breakthroughs technology described above present huge opportunities and expand the size the addressable markets for project mozo. some the key ones are follows: loyalty market the worldwide loyalty market, estimated us$ billion, makes the opportunity presented this technology even more interesting. address such large market, the goal for project mozo unlock this mammoth loyalty market, support the larger retail industry, and reduce customer acquisition costs shi#ing them away from advertising and discounting mozo. distribution loyalty market the asia-paci"c region translates into us$ billion market opportunity addressable project mozo. digital consumers asia alone, mckinsey predicted that there will approximately billion consumers using digital banking some form []. even more than western countries, asian consumers are highly motivated promotions, discounts, vouchers, and the like. short, monetary rewards motivate consumers turn into walk-in customers opening possibility that project mozo will have signi"cant impact "rst the asia-paci"c retail market. foot tra!c the addressable market related annual foot tra!c encompasses trillion walk-in customers visiting million physical stores globally, making average annual foot-tra!c per store. distribution the above "gures asia paci"c region means billion annual foot tra!c and million physical stores directly addressable project mozo. already, physical stores have committed use mozo technology, i.e. have just achieved fraction this addressable market. the majority foot tra!c concentrated around shopping malls the asia-paci"c region. according our own estimates, there are total shopping malls the region, excluding japan [-]. this equates total real estate value shopping malls approximately us$. billion assuming average shopping mall real estate value us$ million each. increase foot tra!c these shopping malls (driven more foot tra!c generated mozo its equivalent), translates into us$ billion increase these malls value. this represents enormous market opportunity for project mozo and perhaps this addressable market where project mozo can bring its most signi"cant value proposition. worldwide loyalty market us$ billion global number stores million stores stores committed use mozo b&m market retail market) trillion global foot traffic (annually) trillion walk-in customers stores asia-pacific loyalty market us$ billion asia-pacific (excluding japan) number mall malls forecast years currently, have signed stores which are committed using mozo upon its launch (set for january our target sign-up around retail stores malls, market share asia-paci!c region the next three years. this translates annual foot tra"c under our control over billion annually. signup stores malls (asia-pacific) control billion foot traffic annually capture loyalty market share (asia-pacific) increases foot traffic us$ billion us$ billion us$ billion increase mall valuation extra revenue for stores loyalty market value mozo blueprint online e-commerce has been successful !rst wave growth for the retail industry, driven the arrival the internet over the last twenty years. going forward, believe that the blockchain-based retail sector the verge exponential growth and will form the next wave growth. project mozo provides critical building blocks needed for this new business segment thrive: discover products services through iot based devices mozo, cryptocurrency support loyalty program solo, proprietary blockchain network for microtransactions system bridge online-to-o"ine gap data-driven product recommendation and shopper personalization secure socket layer for retail activities asymmetric cryptographic security wallets management production (new arrival, sale...) virtual showroom event (marketing, season...) gift user preferences recommendation notification search third party integration: sdk, api consumer apps iot sensor services nearby favorite/wishlist video/image/content/* image shared interests ecoupon loyalty redeemption smart switch merchant apps wallet mozo marketplace solo proprietary blockchain ethereum global blockchain private token exchange public token exchange network security mozo administrator's web services -factor password access authentication venue operator/ merchant's web services public wallets risks management private key distribution team mozo has experimented with the business model and these technology building blocks over the past two years; with extensive !eld tests both the shopping malls and individual retail stores. are now integrating our mozo so#ware with the ethereum blockchain network under the above blueprint. below are descriptions the major components our blueprint, beginning with solo and ethereum blockchain integration. how does mozo work? shopping malls, hotels, resorts, stadium, tourist destinations... venue operators rewards for increase foot traffic gifts rebate rents, coupons, ads buy/sell tokens consumer friends redeem rewards for increase foot traffic buy/sell tokens erc buy/sell tokens merchant's physical stores redemption marketplace token exchanges the above ecosystem, team mozo has completed the implementation venue operators (such ase.g., shopping malls) mozo and merchant's physical stores redemption market places mozo need tie these and the other parts the ecosystem together our next so!ware release mozo and subsequent releases. now, let's dis discuss how the mozo concept can implemented the real world. merchant package: many merchants (malls and retailers) not sign for new programs due time and cost constraints. mozo solves this giving every merchant "mozo-in-a-box" package. mozo will initially provide certain amount mozo tokens free charge registered merchants well our custom-made beacon and sticker sensors (mozo can also work with code and barcode). mozo-in-a-box will enable merchants test revenue generating opportunities o"ered project mozo before they commit any budget regular use basis. the amount free mozo tokens, may proportional the merchant gross #oor area. retailers and mall operators can mount beacons their ceiling glue them their walls, they want reward consumer for entering their stores malls. retailers can also associate stickers with products and services they want consumers discover and calculate how many mozo tokens they reward consumers for doing using the mozo retailer app described greater detail below. this same app allows store sta" upload product information such marketing collateral, inventories and prices, allowing shoppers discover these products just bringing their smartphones close the beacons stickers mounted attached those displays products. course, these shoppers must have previously downloaded mozo consumer app onto their phone. backed robust big data engine, the data collected from the consumer app allows the retailer gain valuable insights into its customers. air-drop for consumers: the majority consumers not sign for loyalty programs due the inconveniences described previously, and the time spent complete registration. mozo solves this doing air drop. for consumers, mozo will air-drop some mozo tokens free charge, when they download the consumer app from apple's app store google's play, they walk into venue operators that are members project mozo. venue operators such shopping malls, may advertise project mozo their physical space where they want increase foot-tra$c. this provides initial incentive for consumers test project mozo's exciting o"erings. our o"erings consumers will include: mozo token earning/ mining tools that are organized easily navigated maps;
