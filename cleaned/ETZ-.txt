contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain introduction etherzero etherzero (etz) new generation smart contract platform initiated group professional and technical geeks worldwide provide better service dapp developers and users. etz team aware the needs always maintain the platform thrive the challenge for the needs high-quality requirement including security. recently, etz announced the etherzero version. etz's latest improvement has been successfully achieve its goal provide thousands tps smart contract blockchain and using revolutionary zero-fee under current new version platform. don't forget that etz always evolving, etz always improves cope the blockchain platform and its application needs. background etherzero abbreviated etz general smart contract development platform and has unique features smart contract capability with transaction fees, high transaction processing capacity, near real-time transactions. etz was built based the knowledge masternode pow double-layer network and distributed autonomous architecture nature dash coin and clique protocol from ethereum's proof authority rinkeby testnet. etz growing and innovative platform, one should expect that etz will always configured answer the demand serve multi smart contract and other blockchain needs. currently etz arranged under new and better consensus under the new version leaving its previous pow and its masternode mechanism new configuration using mpos. what are the advantages the latest etherzero version etherzero current etherzero (or etherzero double-layer network structure which better than previous double layer network etherzero version which use masternode and pow twolayer concensus. etz team found from other network hacking attacks that pow based platform likely more susceptible compare full pos mechanism. dash.org https://docs.dash.org/en/latest/introduction/about.html#whitepaper the ethereum proof-of-authority protocol called clique and well described the clique github issue. ethereum currently uses this algorithm for the rinkeby test network. ethereum core developer, peter szilagyi https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/ white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain new consensus mechanism mpos replaces the initial design the masternode pow two-layer network consensus; after deleted the double-layer network, the masternode has full authority handle all transaction verification and packing block work; detailed design and implementation the power mechanism support dynamic network resource configuration; detailed design and implementation community governance framework based masternodes and smart contracts; mpos consensus will affect the underlying economic mechanism, out the rewards for masternode, and the rest for community budget; the mpos consensus-based main network online and needs plan the next task. definition blockchain digital ledger which transactions

pow proof work tps transaction per second market conditions eventhough the end the encrypted digital currency, also known cryptocurrency, already has total market capitalization exceeding billion dollars and likely still increasing, but undeniable that most investors don't really understand about cryptocurrency, and also confused about how blockchain can achieve trustworthy transaction value, and even more absurd discuss this with outsiders common peoples who knows nothing. while some peoples started recognize cryptocurrency blockchain the overall cumulative market caplitalization seems increase over next year. order speed mass adoption, public should familiar with blockchain. this also means blockchain and cryptocurrency urgently need killer application which can help common peoples understand more about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology which will give big impacts their lives. this kind killer application not exist independently, but should built public chain smart contract development platform which support some key characteristics. etherzero built based these considerations. still needs more effort for blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiasts around the world before mass adoption ready, the key mass adoption make every blockchain and cryptocurrency application simple and easily use everyone. mass adoption also means that are urgent-need class killer platform and applications that can help more ordinary peoples understand the tremendous impact the technology blockchain and cryptocurrency their daily lives. this kind killer applications not exist independently but rather should built public chain that supports some the key features with smart contract development platform. etherzero based this assumption. global cryptocurrency benchmarking study, garrick hileman michel rauchs university cambridge judge business school, white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain etherzero made for any possible application featured with blockchain technology and etherzero positioned itself the one who combine, promote blockchain technology and make popular for daily use. the reason why need combine because the fact that most today's innovative blockchain technologies are still the experimental stage, severely isolated from one another, and applied the field that are not clearly defined. needs organization stand from the spectator point view observe the possibilities integrate application these technologies and provide developers with operating system which can accommodate various technologies and oriented the application. after completing masternode development, etherzero will use private placement funds recruit new blockchain technical staff integrate the existing technologies which the long run will promote transformation technologies into practical application using production and experimental network parallel. promoting and making the blockchain technology popular for daily use are targeted real application scenarios. technology must have real usability scenarios and create economic benefit breakthrough the existing technology system order become mainstream. will organize one specialized industry application working group with team members from conservative industry experts, blockchain technicians, and blockchain developers. extensively, also conduct industrial research and scenario feasibility studies various industries the current society, with hope successfully deepen and popularized blockchain revolution. blockchain developers are currently offering many types and concepts its technology. these various technology-schemes may also mean that will become big obstacle the process for normal user understand and enjoy blockchains. want avoid users directly contact the complex concept through combination cognition and technology, and exporting mature product users. will our best guide community developers develop real and reachable products. general application platform requirements etz made accommodate any application, believe that etz can host multiple killer platform and this killer application can only built such features etz: basic operations with zero transaction fees: order support the development and business operations decentralized applications broader sense, various basic operations, such registration, login, collection, browsing, search, sharing and various small/negligible services operations should not charged. etz can provide every possible service without fee. white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain super-high concurrency and scalability: the ability operate concurrently with the contract code block chains for users worldwide, data concurrency challenging issue tackle, this kind application platform have enough scalability able expand proportionally along with the growth users and applications. real-time feedback: the vast majority the user's operations should have real-time feedback under secure condition. the basic requirement for decentralized application comparable with traditional applications. version system: application version system helps developers quickly complete bug fixes, and for developers conveniently complete a/b testing for user studies. platform evolution: community proposal systems and masternode voting can help drive community-driven evolution etherzero. facilitates the rapid implementation various technical iterations and platform governance rules. the most critical component functions: decentralized storage such ipfs protocol, secure hotfix procedures, and the underlying platform services for identity authentication, anonymous communication, notification systems, etc. etherzero key features zero transaction fee etherzero extends the gas mechanism ethereum, and improves the power mechanism the basis it. gives each account the right use network resources. also governs the speed transaction response when the right used. thus, the characteristics zero transaction fee are carried out safely. the transaction initiator only needs hold and the transaction does not need consume the basic currency the network (zero fee). fast confirmation the new etherzero network, the trade side can define the number verification blocks required for transaction confirmation themselves. since the outgoing time shortened and the number masternodes authorized generate block the cycle therefore even considering security, all transactions can usually obtain more than confirmation within and the final transaction white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain confirmation within maximum only the confirmation/verification very fast especially compared with current available blockchain technology may need couple minutes hours duration. high throughput based the mpos consensus, and setting the appropriate time generate block and other parameters, etherzero has implemented more than tps transaction processing capabilities thousands masternode structures. open decentralized community autonomy etherzero built the mpos (masternode+pos) consensus mechanism the basis dash coin masternode pow double-layer network and community autonomy structures and clique consensus algorithm eth. this consensus mechanism, anyone can participate etherzero network transaction processing and community autonomy after hold agreed amount etherzero coins and build server that meet requirements. the same time, since masternodes are selected from thousands masternodes each approximately one hour voting cycle, this provides super-high degree open decentralization. proposal decision and budget distribution functions based voters the masternode have been developed and integrated into the etherzero master network. zero transaction fee intelligent contract development platform zero transaction fee revolutionary and can make any small blockchain can rolled real blockchain services many possible applications. necesity zero transaction fee the most persuasive tool etherzero characteristics zero-transaction fee. taking the simplest distributed collaborative to-do list, to-do application, example, its decentralized implementation can applied the task decomposition process global decentralized collaborative team. this process requires each participant the project understand the tasks other unfamiliar members. everyone's task validated team consensus result, has certain traceability and need for trust. white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain can imagine tie small application the blockchain current available concept. every small steps service will have cost. the application involves the registration members, the addition and deletion tasks, and on. according the operation-requirements eth, all these operations require gas consumption fee. also means that every service will eventually converted into eth and charge users, which not reasonable for the small service/operation charged with cost (under fee mechanism), not economically-wise both for user experience. etherzero, the frequency transaction initiation and the number execution steps intelligent contracts are positively correlated with the balance held the account. this not only meet zero transaction cost, but this also takes into account the reasonable use network resources, and limits the malicious attackers launch ddos attacks requiring higher capital investment. this concept zero transaction cost from economic perspective will really lead decentralized applications into the daily-life scene. gas mechanism etz has different approaches gas mechanism. ethereum, the transaction fee calculated the value the ethers, the mining reward, gas incurred and the gas price, the gas paid the initiator the transaction will eventually counted the value the eth currency and paid the miner fee, i.e. gas cost gas used gas price. the function gas and eth ethereum are described follows: tool measure computational resources usage the network; converted into transaction fee, reward for miner and block verification; converted into transaction fee, economical method resist dos attacks etherzero, gas still used computational resources measurement tool and the-fee replaced and expanded the power mechanism. the gas and power mechanisms together established solid foundation for zero-transaction cost safely. power mechanism power actually currency which issued for users who hold etzs, cannot traded and can only consumed, representing the power use network resources (computing, storage, bandwidth, etc.). gas price (ethereum) https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-price-ethereum.asp white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain each time you hold etz, you will distributed certain amount power, and each power represents share network resources. other words, the zero transaction cost does not mean that the network can used without any cost, and the user still has pay the time cost holding the priceable currency etz. the more the number coins held the user, the more power there is, the network resources that can used, such the maximum power value consumed per transaction, and the recovery rate after power consumed. can imagine the usability power etz like game. game, the power value determines the maximum blood volume and blood volume recovery speed. when player plays against monster, must consume certain amount blood kill certain monster. the blood consumed should higher the monster more powerful. for the power mechanism, the number etz held user the power value. the maximum blood volume the power max the account. the blood recovery rate power speed. the task killing different types monsters perform different types operations such trading deploying contracts. power different from gas eth: for each account, the maximum power fixed when the account balance fixed; power can restored, and the recovery speed positively related the number etz coins the account; power consumption power reduction process, but eth, calculating the fee through gas accumulation process. the operation consuming power etherzero similar the type operation that consumes gas eth: sending transaction requires account consume power; the larger the amount data carried during the transaction, the more power consumed; the more complex calculation the data the contract, the more power consumed; the order the transaction pool sorted gas price from high low. mathematical explanation power all accounts with balance greater than equal etz will continue produce power the block grows until the power limit for this account reached. query your own available power the console: eth.getpower("your address") web.fromwei(eth.getpower("your address"), "ether") white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain two properties power there are two properties power etz: upper limit max value (the upper limit determined the etz balance); speed output per block (determined the etz balance); power value account calculated as: power min(powermax, blockgap powerspeed) blockgap current block height the height trading block this account power consumed transaction calculated as: powerspend gas gasprice for example, general transfer gas and gasprice gwei gwei .,, ether normal transfer requires power ether power upper limit (ie powermax) for one account calculated as: powermax (math.exp(-/(x*)*)*+)*. white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain for example, account with balance .etz, powermax ether, assuming gasprice set gwei (i.e. ether), the single transaction this etz balance can set max the gasprice gwei. this case, this account cannot send transactions with more than gas. assuming that gasprice set gwei (ie ether), the single transaction for this etz balance can set gas may assume generalize it, the gasprice gwei, this account cannot send transactions with more than gas. power recovery speed account (ie powerspeed) calculated as: powerspeed (math.exp(-/(x*)*)*+)*. for example, account with balances receives etz block height power this account block height power this account block height white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain power this account block height power this account block height power this account block height (will not continue grow); after the block height the upper limit has been reached. user needs upgrade power, this user needs increase its account balance. white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain balance-power comparison table (reference) power balance under etz can relation between account balance with its (gas) power. below table can used basic reference: for reference only, the actual operation, might changes according service requirements. from the table, you could find that account with .etz balance could consume maximum million gas for single transaction (assuming gasprice was set gwei). white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain master node and mpos concensus the latest etherzero working the combination masternode and pos. considered and call etz mpos blockchain platform. masternode masternode similar with node but has very important job and additional order etz network consensus. what masternode? the masternode, concept derived from dash's full-node server, exist the necessary service facility ensure that the blockchain provides certain services and basic performances. the dash network, the masternode operates based the pos (proof stake) mechanism and forms conceptual double-layer network together with the miner node responsible for completing the pow (workload proof). the requirement become the dash coin master hold dash coins and set the server required. unlike dash coins, the etherzero's masternode more similar the super node eos. under the mpos consensus mechanism, the masternode group replaces the miner role the pow mechanism jointly handle transaction verification, and broadcast work. the etherzero's masternode server requirements not necessary like eos which requires reach the data center level, general cloud service can meet the requirements, and the lower node server requirements allow the network more decentralized etz more widely open public. masternode responsibilites the responsibilities the masternode including: transaction verification: verify the signature the transaction, account balance, nonce value, etc., execute the transaction and smart contract, and using legitimate transaction perform block generation; community autonomy: community has voting rights the proposals, the proposal will reflect the community's discussion trends and focus, and will involve all aspects etherzero's development, including but not limited the direction technical iterations, operation plan adjustments, member dispute resolutions, changes economic parameters, etc. block producers (bps) eos whitepaper white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain rights and interests masternode the construction and maintenance masternode require the investment financial resources, time, energy and technology provide more and better services users and developers within the whole chain. the etz block generated will awarded the masternode. due the consensus algorithm, the blocks generated the poor performance the masternode are easily discarded, the blocks generated the masternode with better performance and network conditions are recognized with higher probability, and more rewards can obtained. operating masternode there are requirements for becoming the masternode etherzero holds etz; deploy cloud server. the server should have independent address; least ram; and hard disk space should available. for details, please refer the community's for further details, please refer etz formal announcement mpos concensus mechanism etherzero version having mpos concensus govern the block generation and verification. block generation and verification explain the implementation logic the mpos algorithm, need first introduce the two traditional methods block generation ethereum. offical announcement

https://medium.com/@etherzero/how-to-synchronize-themasternode-time-dcb masternode github repository https://github.com/etherzero-org/go-etherzero/releases/tag/v.. white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain the first connect all the transactions and blocks one after the other from the creation block. this approach has proven consumes lot resources complex network such ethereum. the second that only authorized-machines have the right generates block, and the nodes will authorized de-authorized voting. these additional voting mechanisms are recorded the extra data field the block. this way, the difficulty block generation and maintenance cost the network are reduced. the nodes only need download the block headers and verify their validity. after that, you can download arbitrary recent state from the network and check the nearest header. this consensus mechanism currently running ethereum's test network called clique. etherzero's mpos consensus algorithm based the second idea that blocks can only done trusted signers, and each block seen each node can matched against list trusted witnesses. the challenge here how maintain list authorized witnesses that can rotated instantly. use system intelligence contract guarantee that the protocol for maintaining the authorized witness list for each round included the block, while the zone. the extradata section the block header, put the signature the node into it. this will allow any node that gets block authenticate against the list authorized witnesses. the same time also invalidates the field the miner address the block header. this also increases the security the primary node account from another perspective. block composition the following figure illustrates the etherzero block data structure: white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain authorization policy order ensure that the list authorized witnesses dynamically and randomly changed, use the hash value the block calculate with the masternode and sort according the calculation result, thus ensuring the unpredictable and random witness list. also ensures that the results calculated all nodes are the same and the consensus reached. long the witnesses meet the above specifications, they can authorize and assign the blocks they deem appropriate, reducing network traffic and forks adopting the following strategies: calculate the best signature time for the next block (parent block_period); the turn, wait for the exact time arrive, sign and broadcast immediately; not, delay the time signature random(signer_count ms). this strategy will ensure that the current turn witnesses has slight advantage over signatures and dissemination. instant confirmation during each one-hour voting period, masternodes selected the random authorization algorithm are out the block, and the block time once transaction has been confirmed different white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain identities, that is, after verification different entrants, the transaction considered completely final and unchangeable. however, the actual processing, the trade side can flexibly customize number confirmed blocks required. for transactions with low importance and high real-time requirements, the minimum number block confirmations can set (three). fact, transaction has been confirmed blocks, its confirmation has reached more than high scalability based the outbound time, safe and efficient consistency algorithm, the current normal operation the etherzero network, the actual tps can reach how prevent attack the etherzero version has high security level protection. the mechanism mpos itself combination speed, scalability and security protocol. attacks the existence the threshold the masternode makes extremely expensive initiate attack based building large number nodes. etherzero, when the total number masternodes are order obtain attack success rate .%, the hacker needs control create masternodes, this means that the attacker should purchase million etzs, which close the total etz circulated. definitely real big effort attack the network with small probability paying huge economic costs. combined with the locked etz, the overall possibility attack reduced, and this kind attack becomes even more unrealistic. number attack nodes total number nodes: number attack nodes total number nodes success rate .e- .e- .e- .e- the amount dash required white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain where: the length the masternode chain; the number active masternodes the current network; the number bad nodes controlled the attacker,and its value double spending problem bitcoin prevents double-spending problems through pow and block confirmation. due its design limitations, transaction confirmation, network needs wait for longer time. etherzero adopts the same scheme eth reject double-spending transaction nonce value, this kind scheme description one account's transaction the network are executed based the sequence transaction, and this scheme also cancel pending transactions which are not processed for long time and provides the possibility carry out transaction setting higher gas price replace pending transaction with the same nonce value. sybil attack refers attack that benefits from creating multiple accounts the network. single-account transaction ability attenuation feature constructed the power mechanism will result more effective sybil attack only holding large number etzs, and the trading pool which run the transaction order based gas price will further reduce the impact the attack. ddos attack ddos attack refers large number spam requests host server short period time, which may cause some the master nodes goes offline and service disruption. because the gas and power mechanisms, ddos-type attacks have small influence etherzero network. finney attack the finney attack named after bitcoin user, hal finney, attack that exploits unconfirmed transactions bitcoin fraudulently accept bitcoin payments, variation double-spending attack. the precondition for this attack that the merchant trusts the white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain unconfirmed transaction and immediately ships the shipment after receiving the unconfirmed transaction and cannot revoked. this actually using the time difference the high-latency transaction confirmation service such btc. the etherzero, the near real-time transaction greatly reduces the possibility this attack. community autonomy and evolution thanks the support smart contracts, etherzero community autonomy can solved entirely through client dapp and online wallet. the approach governance through, increased focus masternode proof stake (mpos) etherzero community; responsible etherzero leadership team making decisions and risk appetite. proposal initiation anyone can initiate proposal; million blocks has one vote, vote counting period around two weeks; the proposal failed meet the requirements within the period, need resubmitted; the budget requested each proposal cannot exceed current available budget. masternode voting any masternode has one vote for each proposal the current period, which can used approve, against, abstain. vote counting and budget approval the eligible proposal has criterias below: total number votes which approve proposal total number votes which against proposal for all proposals that meet condition will sorted based the difference the votes and the current available budget will given based the order. after the release completed, the remaining budget does not meet the budget requests the next proposal that meets the above conditions, then budget will not awarded and the remaining budget will added the next period; the vote counting performed the last block each cycle. community governance contracts will give awards the eligible proposals. technology and economic parameter white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain technical structures concensus parameter the etherzero consensus mechanism: mpos; signature algorithm: secpk; hash algorithm: sha; voting period: around hour; number blocknodes: each voting period randomly rotated from all the masternodes according the algorithm; required different block masternode/number for final confirmation: block parameter block generation time: block generation reward: etz; reward allocation: distributed equally the online master node; for the community budget. masternode parameter threshold etzs; basic requirements: ram larger than hard disk not less than tb, -cores cpu. white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain economy system currency usage the use etz coins throughout the ecology categorized the roles involved: masternode needs hold certain amount etz block reward will rewarded the masternode developer needs hold certain amount etz order have the basic power needed deploy the contract user you need hold least etz order have the basic power initiate the transaction. the more coins you hold, the more transactions you can initiate per unit time, the higher transaction complexity that can initiated; community; budget for the eligible proposals approved the community. economy system based the above functions can effectively motivates each role work for common goal within the etherzero ecosystem. money supply etherzero abbreviated etz, initially issued with total million, which million are distributed equals the ethereum holder after the fork. the remaining million etz distributed for private placement early investors, etherzero foundation, etherzero post development and eco development. block reward will add approximately million etz per year, with each block output for the masternode and for the community autonomy budget. currency lock etherzero coins are locked under smart contract when joining the masternode and power mechanism. white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain masternode lock dash currently has masternodes (december and each masternode needs lock dash, accounting for the total amount dash, coins (december etherzero each masternode needs lock etherzero coins, assuming after -year operations, etherzero operating main-nodes masternode, therefore needs lock million etz, accounting about the total etz. power lock based the power mechanism, all operations network computing, storage, and bandwidth resources, such transactions deployment contracts, will consumes power. the power max and power speed account depend the number etzs held the account. therefore, the power mechanism will cause large number etzs locked into the account. monetary policy the coin-locking behavior various roles such masternodes, common users, and developers causes the market supply maintain certain amount deflation for long time. the business grows, the value these locked coins will adjusted through the community's voting system. can seen from the above that there will most the etherzero etz stored the masternode and the smart contract. this endogenous economic system, together with the steady flow new accounts, the payment demand for the etz and the trading platform, new investors will demand etz and will continue push the price etz. technical characteristics technical considerations after considering ethereum's performance, etherzero has put place number mitigating factors: our current block generation time and etherzero has further considered the data reading speed ethereum evm executing smart contracts and the core issues affecting ethereum performance. white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain the bitcoin system, the execution time bitcoin scripts never considered the transaction delay time problem bitcoin networks, mainly because bitcoin scripts are non-turing complete and very short, and the implemented-functions naturally are very simple. ethereum account model that itself state machine and supports turing's complete smart contract. compared the bitcoin script, the ethereum uses worldstate use mpt (merkle patricia tree) record the entire ethereum state change. ethereum's evm spends large part the time spent executing smart contracts reading networkstate. the following figure depicts the storage the mtp state tree root hash: note: image comes from ethereum stack exchange. since this unique data structure will increase with the amount transactions recorded, the number interactions with the underlying database per read for specific value will increase o(n). these accesses are not sequential storage but discrete random storage. the underlying leveldb very low performance when faced with such large number data reading. present, the miners ethereum are paying more attention hashrate order ensure the block generation rate. however, this block completed the gpu, therefore, not very concerned about white paper etherzero (smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain, mpos) etherzero smart contract platform decentralized applications blockchain the overall performance the data reading when the smart contract executed. solving this problem and further improving the processing speed and stability the network will the next goals our team. work arrangement the technical characteristics the platform iterative rollout will correspond the ecosystem's progressive development plan, guiding developers and users pay attention the killer application supported the corresponding features based different characteristics different periods. etherzero will look the organic growth ecosystem from development perspective. application scenarios and market expectations etherzero team believe that the development etz will make the blockchain technology its new height and can bring blockchain service next level. you can imagine that small service activities are required the multimedia interaction and will not feasible under current fee blockchain cryptocurrency scheme. etz will release the true power blockchain. general application the core task the blockchain that trust irrelevant, which is, matter who the counterparty is, the
