bibliography snowgem whitepaper introduction introduction snowgem whitepaper digital currencies have been deliberated over for the last several decades. alternative ways create systems which are more innovative, reliable and secure have been the minds very knowledgeable people the field cryptography. experts finance, technology and accoun- introduction ting have tried design and implement new ideas since the snowgem whitepaper david chaum and stefan brands created the issuer based e-cash protocol adam back developed hashcash, proof work scheme for spam control introduction wei dai proposed the distributed digital scarcity based crypto called b-money nick szabo proposed the digital scarcity based crypto called bit gold snowgem whitepaper unfortunately, these early attempts put forward viable alternatives world fiat currencies did not get off the ground. governments were vehemently opposed seeing them succeed and deemed them threat the status quo monetary systems. was, therefore, difficult for the early contributors the field push their ideas wider audience. nevertheless, there was still eagerness pursue further research. october individual group people known the alias satoshi nakamoto published the bitcoin whitepaper[]. described innovative breakthrough, especially those who initially read it, for the initiation and implementation new type money called cryptocurrency. bitcoin learnt from previous failed systems creating decentralised network-based transparent ledger. provides several desirable features including: peer-to-peer decentralised network protocol introduction incentives for users keep the network robust finite hard cap supply prevent inflation since the inception bitcoin, thousands cryptocurrencies have been launched. most ventures into the cryptocurrency sphere have not gone according plan their founders would have hoped. nevertheless, there are currently hundreds crypto related projects which are succeeding. snowgem new type cryptocurrency which has objectives improve upon proven technologies developed far. there will similarities between snowgem and other coins, but the team wish follow their own philosophy. snowgem whitepaper after this innovative breakthrough, people have been developing technologies that apply practical use cryptocurrencies. for example, some cryptocurrencies have focused providing users with reliable, compatible and user friendly wallet client systems for robust forms payment. most ventures into the cryptocurrency sphere have not gone according plan their founders would have hoped. nevertheless, there are currently hundreds crypto related projects which are succeeding. introduction snowgem new type cryptocurrency that can developed verified technology. project that embraces unique philosophical approach how cryptocurrency can used real life. snowgem aims build better cryptocurrency incorporating previously proven aspects blockchain technology including network robustness, feature rich services and end-user friendly support. snowgem whitepaper what snowgem? what snowgem? snowgem whitepaper snowgem (xsg) cryptocurrency decentralised currency used via the internet. described ecosystem which allows one transfer value, either trans- what snowgem? parently privately, anywhere the december the first equihash privacy coin implementing zsnarks code for it's masternodes was born. let show you snowgem. world without the need trust central authority such bank other clearing house. snowgem users are able send receive xsg quickly, reliably and securely using personal computer, laptop mobile device. snowgem whitepaper rather than trying reinvent the wheel from scratch, the founder snowgem tinh pham (txid), after studying the codebase other cryptocurrencies, decided base snowgem zcash. zcash the first cryptocurrency apply zksnarks (zero knowledge succinct non-interative argument knowledge) which allow parties prove statement without revealing any information other than the validity the statement. snowgem began fork the zcash blockchain() and inherited all features zcash that time (rd december what snowgem? snowgem officially launched its blockchain the december after blocks had been timestamped. during the first blocks, external miners could mine (less than xsg was mined during this period). was considered necessary make sure the blockchain launched seamlessly. the april masternode payments were activated. this meant that snowgem became the first equihash algorithm oriented cryptocurrency with zksnarks() implement active masternode technology. like all cryptocurrencies, people have chosen adopt snowgem medium exchange/ store value through personal choice. innovative feature, affinity towards the brand high confidence the community could reasons for doing so. key advantages using snowgem are: snowgem permissionless, anyone free use its services. accessible from anywhere the world. has central point failure. free from government censorship. snowgem users receive regular block rewards for participation helping secure and decentralise the network protocol. snowgem whitepaper history history snowgem whitepaper since the inception snowgem back december the project has grown from strength strength. laying the brickworks our foundation the snowgem team and the community have worked non-stop diligent manner ensure the rapid success snowgem. history both the snowgem team and community have contributed the ongoing success the project. snowgem whitepaper key events which have occurred during snowgem's relatively short history include: the december the snowgem blockchain was announced the wider cryptocurrency community via online forum called bitcointalk. the december the snowgem blockchain officially launched utc block number the january the first cryptocurrency exchange initiate live real-time xsg trading was stocks.exchange (now known stex). the february the initial testing phase masternode technology was announced tinh pham. beta specifications were made available. history the march updated simple wallet client (version ..) was released for users install. became possible for users create snowgem masternodes. the april the first masternode payments were received operators block number the may the first snowgem mobile application was released the android operating system. became possible for users store xsg their phones. snowgem whitepaper the may the snowmine mining application tool was released. the june the snowgem blockchain successfully hard forked improved variant the equihash hashing algorithm (from the september the snowgem modern wallet was released. client which includes way more features than the simple wallet client. presented with more professional and seamless gui, users can manage and monitor their snowgem portfolio well other coins which are being added. history members the snowgem team are dedicated build upon the progress made the last year so. there enthusiasm that, with the help from the community, snowgem will become highly adopted and used method payment. snowgem whitepaper specification specification snowgem whitepaper snowgem officially launched the december before the launch, tinh pham (txid) unveiled the initial coin specification snowgem proof-of-work coin using the equihash algorithm that started without ico pre-mine environment and has limited supply xsg. specification which outlines the structural parameters the snowgem blockchain. snowgem whitepaper these being: genesis block: december utc official launch: december utc timestamping algorithm: hashing algorithm: block time: equihash (currently seconds block reward: xsg* block halving: every blocks difficulty re-targeting: total coin supply: pre-mine: specification proof work ico: founders' reward: every block xsg xsg none block rewards for the first four years** *the founder coded block generation incrementally increase xsg each block beginning with xsg block reward block number one. attained the xsg block reward approximately block number this gave users ample time join the network and prevented high hashrate miners from accumulating large number xsg early on. **a founders' reward was decided upon the best method which raise the necessary funds for code development, marketing and other operational activities. while acknowledging that ico (initial coin offering) great way for blockchain projects raise initial funds, was considered risky approach. snowgem know the importance that, for project succeed the competitive crypto sphere, funds are required attract talent and pay for services. the future, the team are seeking outside investors. snowgem knows the importance this, for project succeed the competitive crypto sphere, funds are required attract talent and pay for services. the future, the team will seek outside investors. snowgem whitepaper blockchain blockchain snowgem whitepaper every cryptocurrency has corresponding blockchain within its decentralised network protocol. blockchain simply described general public ledger all blockchain our blockchain strong and made for the gpu miner mind. hashing the equihash algorithm with the parameter setting makes for asic resistant mining environment. transactions recorded blocks ever executed since the very first block. additionally, continuously updates real-time when new block successfully mined. snowgem whitepaper blocks enter the blockchain such manner that each block contains the hash the previous one. therefore utterly resistant modification along the chain since each block related the prior one. consequently, the problem double-spending solved. the first block the snowgem blockchain timestamped utc the december was not until block number the time which the blockchain officially launched, that external miners were permitted mine blocks. since this time, there has been one notable update the underlying codebase which required hard fork for protocol parameters change. the june important update (version ..) was released for users install before block number primarily, changed the parameter setting the equihash hashing algorithm from after which the snowgem blockchain became low-memory gpu and asic resistant. blockchain for members the general public view the blockchain, web developers create block explorers. they are online websites which present certain aspects the blockchain including wallet addresses and transaction identifications. snowgem officially recognises https://insight.snowgem.org its most reliable block explorer. snowgem whitepaper blockchain time goes by, the number xsg mined per block will decrease. this means there hard cap the number xsg mined, which xsg. what follows the snowgem block distribution table which covers timeframe for the next years. first block last block blocks snowgem whitepaper reward total coins equihash hashing algorithm equihash hashing algorithm snowgem whitepaper one the major breakthroughs which equihash hashing algorithm bitcoin brought the table the removal central authority. fiat currencies, equihash memory-hard proof-of-work algorithm with asic resistance mind maintain decentralized network protocol. such the dollar issued central bank, are highly susceptible inflation, manipulation and theft. snowgem whitepaper equihash hashing algorithm for cryptocurrencies, central authority third party required verify the validity transactions the blockchain. instead, miners are collectively responsible for validating each and every transaction proof work timestamping process. this competitive task secures and decentralises the network protocol. snowgem adopted the equihash hashing algorithm and implemented its code the december miners compete find hashes, then are subsequently rewarded certain number xsg incentive. these coins are issued the software transparent and predictable way outside the control its developers. the equihash hashing algorithm defined as(): memory-hard proof-of-work introduced the university luxembourg's interdisciplinary centre for security, reliability and trust (snt) the network and distributed system security symposium. the algorithm based generalization the birthday problem which finds colliding hash values. has severe time-space trade-offs but concedes vulnerability unforeseen parallel optimizations. was designed such that parallel implementations are bottle-necked memory bandwidth attempt worsen the cost-performance trade-offs designing custom asic implementations. asic resistance equihash based the assumption that commercially-sold hardware already has quite high memory bandwidth, improvements made custom hardware may not worth the development cost. therefore, snowgem currency which has central authority issue its coins. its users are not required trust anyone perform transactions, but rely entirely the distributed network consensus the blockchain. snowgem whitepaper enhanced privacy enhanced privacy snowgem whitepaper being able seclude information about oneself from authority appealing some people, especially when invol- enhanced privacy ves sending money online. many central snowgem provides enhanced privacy using zsnarks, technologically proven protocol allowing the user have both private and transparent addresses. authorities collect, and even distribute, spending habits find out what people engage in. snowgem whitepaper bitcoin offers certain level for anonymity for its users, but falls short. design, every transaction the bitcoin blockchain recorded public ledger, thus, any point time, the full transaction history accessible. possible use various methods, such network analysis[] web purchases tracking[], track who spends what and where. this obviously not ideal for users who like preserve their privacy. snowgem utilises technologically proven protocol called zksnarks (zero knowledge succinct non-interative argument knowledge) which allow parties prove statement without revealing any information other than the validity the statement. zcash the first cryptocurrency apply zksnarks. enhanced privacy similar zcash, snowgem provides two types address: t-address used perform transparent transactions, which are publicly recorded the blockchain z-address used perform shielded transactions, which hide the identity both the sender and the receiver. the amount xsg transacted also hidden therefore, snowgem offers its users choice whether they transact transparently privately. there are some situations where parties prefer stay transparent. snowgem whitepaper masternodes masternodes snowgem whitepaper simply put, masternode server decentralised network which can utilised carry out bespoke tasks including instant and private transactions. they are masternodes snowgem masternode coin that encourages owners with large percentage the block reward. specialised nodes (computers) that host full copy the blockchain. like all other nodes, they help verify the validity transactions sent from one peer another. snowgem whitepaper snowgem fully implemented masternodes the april anyone free create masternode, but must raise the necessary collateral order operate one. this associated cost (entry barrier) become masternode operator necessary because disincentivises one cheat the system. snowgem masternode operators must hold total xsg (cannot spent and described not being part the overall coin circulation) designated wallet address order keep the node running. masternodes incentive for masternode operators keep their nodes running, they collectively receive percentage overall block rewards. what follows table which shows how many xsg have been, and are, rewarded masternode holders whole: snowgem whitepaper first block last block block reward block reward xsg masternodes date number masternodes annual rio yearly income us$ aug sept oct snowgem considered the ramp masternode reward percentages allowing users the time accumulate xsg more easily the beginning via mining. therefore the case that masternode operators earn passive income the investment they have locked up. what they receive terms the number rewarded xsg depends the total number active masternodes any given time (see table immediately above). snowgem whitepaper key features key features snowgem whitepaper snowgem modern wallet designed more professional, comfortable and simple, the snowgem modern wallet was released the september brings together the most important aspects the snowgem ecosystem into one place. transferring xsg units account easier process. unlike the snowgem simple wallet, allows users monitor and manage their masternodes. snowmine also accessible from this wallet. key features had ease mind when creating our wallets, mining tools and masternode map. all have been designed with user friendly features. snowmine application tool snowmine the ultimate mining application based snowgem. makes the process configuring one's mining equipment easier. mining issues arise, the application promptly sends notification (either via e-mail pop-up) make the miner aware. users are able receive statistics and control their mining equipment via mobile device, discord telegram. account required. snowgem whitepaper snowgem web wallet built especially for novice users, the snowgem web wallet does not require users download, and then install, any software. secure, reliable and robust online medium send, receive and store xsg units account. snowgem android wallet released the may the snowgem android wallet secure, open-source and easy method which send receive xsg units account via mobile device. all private keys remain the control the user all times. like other wallets, multiple wallet addresses can created and customised. live masternode map key features the official snowgem website, visitors are able check live world map which all active snowgem masternodes are located. jakub korbel designed and developed it. released the completed version april snowgem whitepaper how acquire snowgem how acquire snowgem snowgem whitepaper snowgem are initially acquired (as incentive) miners who direct processing how acquire snowgem power successfully finding blocks. each block has associated reward that either goes lone miner split between snowgem can acquired via gpu mining purchasing xsg one many exchanges. miners via mining pool service. miners are then free store these xsg units account, create snowgem masternodes place sell orders the open cryptocurrency exchange markets. snowgem whitepaper how acquire snowgem over time, cryptocurrency exchanges have initiated xsg trading their platforms. they allow people buy sell xsg units account the going market price. what follows table all exchanges which snowgem has been added: cryptocurrency exchange date trading initiated btc trading market url stex january

future vision the future snowgem will filled with many technological advances cryptocurrency desired other projects. nowledges that there still lot work before that time. snowgem whitepaper looking forward, snowgem will investigate and develop ways improve upon their blockchain. what follows are the most exciting things being worked on: overwinter and sapling upgrades snowgem are working hard implement two network protocol parameter changes. particular, the sapling upgrade will integrate improvements the efficiency which shielded transactions are processed and lower cpu memory optimise performance mobile devices. both upgrades will integrated into snowgem via single hard fork the blockchain. future vision masternode reference masternode operators will able invite friendly masternode servers. being reference, the masternode operator will receive extra xsg bonus reward when the friendly invited masternode has received their masternode payment. reference applied, the block reward sent proof work miners instead. lottery systems snowgem users will able participate regular lotteries via the snowgem modern wallet. payment solutions objective make easier for everyday users purchase goods and services. snowgem wants create fast, unique and secure payment processing system, directly top their blockchain. will built into any software which supports api calls including ecommerce, e-shops and point sale (pos) systems. snowgem whitepaper decentralised exchange well known the cryptocurrency space how frustrating online centralised exchanges can be. users regularly complain about lost, manipulated and stolen coins. snowgem wishes create their very own decentralised exchange (dex) that will help improve the trading experience without downtime and maintenance periods. content masternodes snowgem plans improve the code make possible for all types data stored their blockchain. documents, media files and contracts will publicly privately stored. they will also necessary for running the snowgem dex and provide file storage for data required for decentralised applications (dapps) (based ipfs protocol). future vision blockchain technology company order take great strides forward, legally and compliantly, snowgem wants establish official foundation. will help snowgem become more professional and attract much needed investment. ultimately, the goal for snowgem used instead fiat currencies. the moment, the main purpose snowgem store value for performing transparent private transactions. after further development, there confidence that snowgem can gradually expand
