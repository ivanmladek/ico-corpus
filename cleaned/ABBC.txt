upgrade abbc blockchain? abbc started out late bootstrap project jason daniel paul philip. needed validate our business hypothesis fast and get early traction. for these purposes, forked bitcoin, which was one the leading solutions its time (and still continues within its market niche). bitcoin had sufficient amount technology adopters, mining infrastructure, and technology improvements. spring our cto started actively researching the existing solutions replace cloned bitcoin blockchain with technology that best suited our purposes. after several months research, became clear that eosio unbeatable candidate for the case. june started switching eosio blockchain, and august launched the abbc testnet, which private dpos blockchain based eos. invented and developed the concept hybrid account-model, which generates added value for both: customers with the basic understanding blockchain transactions and for expert customers. transaction fees not depend token value according eosio technical documentation [eos github]: "one the major benefits the eosio software that the amount bandwidth available application entirely independent any token price. application owner holds relevant number tokens blockchain adopting eosio software, then the application can run indefinitely within fixed state and bandwidth usage. such case, developers and users are unaffected from any price volatility the token market and therefore not reliant price feed". page abbc whitepaper this independence from volatility the token market particularly helpful, bitcoin and ethereum transaction fees killed many worthy startups during times to-the-moon. dpos consensus dpos requires way less computational resources compared proof-of-work and more community-driven comparing regular proof-of-stake. less computational resources mean less commission and other financial burdens the end customers. more community participation means additional revenue streams for technology-savvy community members. explain more the economics section this paper. abbc and byzantine fault tolerance the dpos consensus bft comes from the famous cryptography problem, explained using the middle ages story the hypothetic generals byzantium, who are leading the army against enemy (persians) and because the empire moral and financial decay there are high chances that one several the generals (not ruling out the commander the force himself) are traitors. the conditions the blockchain world, where many nascent ecosystems usually rely unverified providers computational resources (and this does not necessarily mean "bad" providers) the bft becomes particularly valid. significantly lowers the risk fraud one several bps. eos-like systems` bps have additional incentive function properly, besides bft algorithms. this incentive social capital, which bps are striving get during the voting for the actual bps. compromising this social capital and trust risky and economically unjustified. migration roadmap and milestones timing event mid-april, feasibility study may eosio blockchain development for abbc started mid-june, testnet launched august freeze in-out exchanges august august trading generation abbc coin stops crypto exchanges, hours prior official launch and migration kick-off page abbc whitepaper what will happen existing coin holders? august the abbc management team managed conduct migration for existing abbc coin holders. during the transitional period, which started from august existing coin holders were able exchange their gen. coins into gen. coins using simple exchange interface [abbc migration manual] within the abbc wallet. customer's view receives migration notice from: email our blog media legacy wallet inapp notification friend installs and opens new wallet. creates account. presses the button. selects wallet aladdin among our legacy wallets. inputs legacy wallet credentials. gets email confirmation. confirms. waits for abbc approval the migration request (up several hours). gets email confirmation the migration approval. sees account balance update new wallet. spends stakes abbc coins. abbc admin's view gets migration request via migration server. checks customer credentials, account balance, and migration eligibility. there are security eligibility issues migration server halts the transaction and generates approval request human admin. abbc approves migration request automatically via control panel migration server. abbc transfers customer funds cold wallet abbc's gen. blockchain for temporary custody. migration server allocates the equivalent gen. abbc coin the new account this customer gen. blockchain. migrated abbc coins customer account gen. abbc blockchain are available for use this customer. external auditor's view source transaction gen. blockchain (funds transfer cold wallet) appears block explorer gen. blockchain. target transaction gen. blockchain (allocation migration equivalent funds) appears the block explorer gen. blockchain. page abbc whitepaper block producers being built eosio abbc blockchain consists unlimited number nodes, which unique are selected active block producers (bp) means automated voting every seconds. like eosio blockchain, produce our blocks exactly every second and exactly one block producer authorized produce block any given point time [eos github]. misses block and has not produced any block within the last hours, they are removed from consideration until they notify the blockchain their intention start producing blocks again. [eos github] this ensures the network operates smoothly and minimizes the number missed blocks excluding unreliable bps. selection criteria technology. order eligible, candidate team must able run secure and reliable servers necessary actually produce blocks, operate full node, and offer api endpoints users. our block producers should also ready scale out their infrastructure and provide sufficient processing capacity, storage, and network bandwidth. both cloud and bare metal servers are accepted. however, our management team will examine specific details how those are operated. cloud-based teams should run their software via multiple providers order minimize reliance any single cloud service. teams operating bare metal servers should have secure data centers with sufficient backups. community. eosio philosophy about rewarding diverse community members with various areas expertise via their participation block production [samani]. therefore, will incentivize bps from various industries and technology layers. are particularly looking for bps, having not only great technical expertise but also able lead and inspire other community members. ethics and civilized dispute settlement. running decentralized blockchain sophisticated matter from many standpoints, including relations between the community members. developer's ego and "fork battles" ruined and diminished market valuation many interesting projects, including bitcoin and early ethereum. geographical and institutional decentralization. hedge our blockchain from political risks, invite bps from various regions, countries and economic backgrounds apply. will our best avoid situations when the majority our bps are located single country. voting and proxies the eos-like liquid democracy [aurora], any user who has staked abbc tokens can vote. each user can vote for candidates using the full weight their stake. for example, user has abbc staked, she can cast votes each for bps. thus unique block producers are chosen the preference votes cast token holders. the selected producers are scheduled order agreed upon more producers. [eos github] page abbc whitepaper then split the funds maintain higher value for those most trusted the community and those who run the active bps. use the same active/standby proportion eosio, with the pay going active producers and going standby bps calculated from percentage the votes received. [floyd] users have the option voting directly for block producers, but they can also delegate their voting power another account vote their behalf. the delegated account, called proxy, has control over the original user's account the user can proxy her vote trustless without handing over any keys. the proxy authorized direct that user's voting power towards certain block producers, but the user can revoke proxy's voting privileges any point. commission and customer account levels transaction fees are serious barrier entry for number well-developed blockchains, original bitcoin being good example. using "receiver pays" philosophy developed eosio [eos github] have built multi-layer approach towards customer credentials based two basic parameters: transaction activity and amount abbc coins custody. account levels novice account owner activity custody abbc coins only accepts funds the customer only installs wallet can accept and send funds the customer has wallet abbc installed, and created for (~$ cents now) her pays commission for each staker credentials same above, but without commission the customer has wallet, registered and staked coins for abbc blockchain computing resources none abbc see, "novice" basic account level for customers who are trying our solution for the first time. all you need become "novice" simply install the wallet. after the customer gets her first abbc coins abbc least), she becomes "owner." this customer type can not only accept but also send funds other ecosystem participants. for readers interested understanding more about our account levels, describe this technology the hybrid account model section below. page abbc whitepaper functional infrastructure abbc's functional infrastructure consists number microservices, nodes, and databases. gateway modules, notifications module, customer authentication module, and transaction history access module are four major microservices our system. notifications module generates information feed providing live coverage all system events within our network other modules and external clients via notifications api. developed based firebase cloud messaging that currently gaining widespread popularity the blockchain world [jayathilaka]. picked firebase for our because provides: battery-efficient connection between our server and customer devices, targeted messaging functionality based user demographics and behaviour, a/b testing integrated with google optimize. notifications may originate either from abbc's system notifications manager from our merchants, provided that they obey the schedule and content guidelines stipulated the notifications policy (document drafted our merchant relations team within six months after the launch generation abbc coin). page abbc whitepaper customer authentication module cam provides single credentials and single point customer authentication within our system. use login/password pair, which then convert into json web token (jwt) specified rfc ensure secure storage customer credentials. note that our wallet app non-custodial, i.e. customer's private key, which our wallet app generates when creating customer's account, never leaves the customer's device and separated from cam [abra]. unfortunately, this might create additional loss risks for the customer. however, this the current market best practice [skellern], and dictated the fact that only billion worth cryptocurrency was hacked stolen [chavez-dreyfuss]. jwt authentication via cam, its turn, helps customer device store and sync non-custodial data our server. this data includes transaction history, app access details, loyalty programs which this device participates and the number rewards accumulated customer's bonus account. however, use the rewards customer still needs the private key. transaction history access module txham server-side enabler our blockchain explorer. txham interacts with abbc blockchain index storage (bis) read indexed block data from our blockchain and enable any willing individual with internet connection examine all transactions within our blockchain chronologically. therefore, txham provides our blockchain with its quintessential features, namely: openness and transparency. transactions history available for access via our wallet app (you have install and register) and online via web interface. are also ready provide machine-to-machine for automatic processing via transaction history api. migration server stores migration requests from end customers internal database and processes their requests reading legacy user balances from heritage balance data storage and converting these balances into new user balances bis. txham then reads indexed data from abbc blockchain gen. and provides the updated balance gen. blockchain the end customer. the migration now technically complete. page abbc whitepaper abbc wallet multi-account hierarchical deterministic (hd) multi-currency wallet based bip proposal [bip]. the core-supported currency our wallet abbc. user can send and receive funds, review recent transactions, and manage blockchain resources. our wallet also supports ethereum and erc tokens [erc-] from the start, with more currencies added the future versions. dedicated blockchain ecosystem that has its own wallet has much better chances success comparing ecosystem without one. the logic simple: controlling additional element the added value chain and the key customer touchpoint creates more probability success. however, this approach building and supporting essential element technology infrastructure and customer interface requires substantial investment. our case, smart partnership strategy and hiring the best blockchain engineering talent that available the market enabled abbc build its own dedicated wallet within relatively short time frame (less than months) and with substantially less investment comparing the market average. bip created trezor founders marek palatinus and pavol rusnak, bitcoin improvement proposal simply bip, document which improves the previous governing standard, bip. specifies multiaccount hierarchy for deterministic wallets, namely: address type, registered coin types, account types (sending receiving funds, purpose), change, and public derivation. being bip-compatible abbc wallet ensures can interact with most the existing blockchain wallet solutions for transferring and receiving funds. the advantage bip the support multiple accounts. multi-currency people like have all their finances one place and them simple manner. j.d. power's research mobile banking applications discovered that "feature overload strains customer satisfaction with online banking and mobile apps." [j.d.power] cryptocurrency wallets are somewhat similar mobile banking with the substantial difference crypto customers doing the banking process themselves. can then conclude that simplicity and "all-in-one" approach brings customer satisfaction. the abbc wallet initially supports abbc coin, ethereum and erc- tokens. plan add support for more cryptocurrencies throughout another good reason for multi-currency support the development our crypto rewards program. this program will provide various rewards and loyalty bonuses that will incentivize our customers whenever they spend more crypto via abbc merchant platforms. multi-account besides multi-currency support, that requires multiple accounts per se, also support hierarchical multiple accounts inside our wallet. hierarchy means each account can have funds multiple currencies inside it. how multi-account support relevant? digital and crypto customers, primarily millennials, are now finding their way financial stability and savings [lerner]. digital nature modern banking and personal finance, including personal crypto finance, enables unlimited number accounts, which are merely number within the accounting system the provider. practice, this means: customer might have account for vacation savings, account for online shopping with increased security, account for educational savings for kids, etc. and like traditional banking, all that possible the world crypto finance well. multiple accounts are simple yet powerful tool for savings and for building healthier financial habits. page abbc whitepaper hybrid account model abbc wallet fully supports hybrid account model, where user can either send funds using staked resources without any transaction fees pay small fee and avoid using resource staking. new users will receive basic-level accounts for free, which will upgraded automatically once the user receives the first transaction this address. this account-model invites new customers start using abbc coins real commerce without staking obligations and with only basic knowledge how blockchain and cryptocurrencies work. customers can acquire their first abbc coins directly the wallet app, simply via the in-app purchase the app store google play. many authors indicate: complexity one the major barriers decentralization and cryptocurrency success [stankewicz]. removing additional touchpoints the customer journey (exchange, coin tickers, transfers in/out), help our customers overcome this barrier. how does our hybrid account work? classic eosio account-model assumes that before you start using the blockchain receive, store and send funds, you should create account. eosio creates accounts paid basis. existing account the blockchain has pay for account creation, assuming this customer has staked enough resources. abbc, feel that this procedure will too complicated for the first-time user (having create account, stake resources, etc.). therefore, improved eosio account model the following manner: level "novice" this basic type account. customer does not need anything create it. the customer only provides public key, which then use address. before customer receives the first asset our blockchain, there record this address this blockchain (like bitcoin ethereum). created the record only after receive the first transaction. "novice" customers can only receive transactions and hodl. case they want create transactions, then they should upgrade "owners." level "owner" once the novice received some minimum assets within our system (i.e. more than abbc), upgrade this customer level "owner" account. owners have unique name assigned. they can also use this name monitor account balance, well send and receive funds. resource staking required this point. owners pay fixed fee abbc for each transaction they create regardless the recipient's account level. level "staker' "staker" account type proper eosio-style account. has account owner who has created account within our system, bought some ram, and staked net and cpu. basically, "owner" also proper abbc blockchain user. the difference between these two that "owner" does not stake resources. don't charge stakers with transaction fees. page abbc whitepaper interaction with abbc server infrastructure our wallet interacts with other blockchain nodes abbc blockchain check account balances and statuses; also interacts with abbc server infrastructure authenticate customer account, sync transactions history, and receive critical updates, such migration notification, wallet software update, etc. interaction with abbc blockchain and other blockchain nodes send transaction, the wallet authenticates customer account credentials via server infrastructure then checks account balance with abbc blockchain node. after that, will then create and sign the new transaction. new transaction subsequently gets confirmed other nodes. eosio states that typical dpos transaction can considered confirmed with certainty after average seconds from the time broadcast. addition dpos, eosio adds asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance (bft) for faster achievement irreversibility. the abft algorithm provides confirmation irreversibility within second. figure wallet interaction with abbc blockchain page abbc whitepaper abbc focused achieving long-term goal. therefore, one our main aims adopt decentralization principles not only our technology but also the management model. principles abbc community governance firstly, while the philosophy decentralized autonomous organization provides agility and flexibility, may also make managing such system very complicated task [sanfelix]. secondly, according market studies, the lack centralized authority reduces costs [blockchainhub] and more control. opposite typical organizational model tech startup, decentralized autonomous organization governance model, which enables guided through business processes data-driven decisions, based the wishes all members the community. besides, accessible any time via smart contracts and blockchain technology. the same time, the choice this model such projects dash, pivx, eosio confirms the interest and trust such type organization the blockchain community. along with the basic principles decentralized autonomous organizations [seth bannon], which are complete transparency, total shareholder control, unprecedented flexibility, and autonomous governance, this approach delivers higher number benefits. starting from much faster and more efficient decisionmaking process, comparison the typical corporate structure, and ending with psychological factors. dao users aren't just investors token holders, but also the disruptors the business model that use the power their voices. this point, let's look into the user model. node selection and voting addition our team, recognize the two main actors abbc dao. they are users with voting power (basically, each holder abbc coin) and block producers (bp) who act decentralized government. the following basic rules guide us: each abbc holder can delegate their voting power proxy vote their behalf. each abbc user has the right receive status staking fixed part their coins, and being elected other bps and community members. vital part our ecosystem, each will vote abbc's blockchain for proposals that can directly impact the business. for example: expanding abbc's service certain region; launching strategic partnership with specific crypto project; sponsoring team project for presenting abbc front major leaders the ecommerce industry implementing new features our blockchain. we're designing the code behind abbc's dao with several safeguards that are aimed preventing its creators anyone else from cheating the voting. however, because the current whitepaper focuses the technical execution abbc coin's blockchain and our business model, the detailed description architecture and the principles abbc governance available upon your request. page abbc whitepaper abbc dev fund vital part our ecosystem, bps and other community members will vote the abbc blockchain for proposals that can directly impact our platform. below are few examples proposals that could submitted the network: expanding abbc's service certain region; launching strategic partnership with certain payment broker partner; creating custom hardware for accelerated transaction processing; developing module for augmented reality payments via contact lenses; presenting abbc front major leaders the e-commerce industry through conference sponsorships; and, establishing relationship with regional merchant platform. can see, each decision can make significant impact abbc success, and create gradual network effect, which exactly what happens with dash. the more people come into the ecosystem and implement valuable projects, the more established network becomes. voting use proceeds from the dev fund the voting for the dev fund projects should similar selection process with proxies allowed and each abbc staker having opportunity support number projects varying voting proportion. the voting should take place yearly basis for one-year roadmap. line with this, the abbc management team considers immediate evaluation projects through hoc voting. the case roadmap voting, the total amount projects voted for should selected based the total amount budget available. for example, there are project candidates with total budget million and the total budget available for the given year $k, then the number projects which will included the roadmap decreases when the total amount requested funds reaches $k. the case hoc voting for the project, there should reserve funds allocation available. otherwise, the total number abbc holders should vote for the immediate allocation project funds using the next year budget, provided that such budget already exists. page abbc whitepaper the world business, technology should deliver profit. abbc enables several business models for our community members earn money and build their reputation. this section outlines them. our original whitepaper listed several business models for abbc foundation: placement fee revenue model that typical any early marketplace [timmers]. merchants pay fees platform listed there and have access the customers this platform. this business model which ebay and alibaba built their business. however, the competition for merchants has been increasing between platforms. so, most modern e-commerce platforms have moved from the placement transaction fee, which will introduce after the migration. in-store promotion abbc will provide all participating merchants with various promotional instruments including straightforward "pay-to-be-on-top" opportunity. while, branded content programs for abbc's platform blog will given selected media outlets and bloggers. want view smm and all the "social"-based features our platform not merely "posts and clicks," but "social computing features" that acknowledges the recent fusion which occurred between content and community, making the social experience central the content website's digital business strategy. [oestreicher-singer] referral programs our initial paper only listed this business model option. currently, came clearer understanding referral programs and will split this business into several subelements: referral program service abbc wallet and server infrastructure enable build cryptoreferral program for any willing merchant quickly. the participants will get various perks which primarily refers cryptocurrency form money. these can airdropped tokens from some hot recent token sales, customer adoption influxes from the established mass-market cryptos like dash, nem litecoin. referrals for merchants and providers-- will provide referral fee for participating merchants and solution providers who successfully invite their friends join abbc. the fee will discount for the future service fee and transaction fee. value-added services are particularly interested our community members' and ecosystem participants' business with each other. this approach creates additional value for abbc ecosystem. good example video content, created professional video editors for merchants who sell some produce merchandise. another example accounting services provided one ecosystem member another. already explained our initial white paper, abbc serves guarantor for complex transactions that requires both parties rely guarantor/arbitrator whom they both trust. page abbc whitepaper migration eos-based generation abbc blockchain will enable three additional business models which differ substantially from the existing ones and which will attract more technology-centered community members our ecosystem. transaction fee mentioned item above, the modern merchant platforms are moving from placement fee (merchant pays for opportunity without understanding what revenue will exactly generate) transaction fee (merchant pays for exact deliverable measured specific customer action). that why also decided introduce transaction fee for transactions that were completed our platform. various instances might wave this fee, namely: the amount transactions for this merchant exceeds the transactions occur specific field, which consider our growth zone, the amount referral customers which this merchant generated block production according the eosio whitepaper, anyone may choose participate block production and will allowed produce blocks, provided that they can persuade token holders vote for them [eos github]. the bps the original eos have estimated earnings between $k--k [boulianne]. while abbc won't originally that intensive, can still provide bps with steady monthly income several thousand dollars. development projects implementation via abbc dao another revenue stream for the tech crowd and huge growth driver for abbc. developers are also usually the early adopters the new business models and payment options. reinvesting profit generated abbc ecosystem into the development its infrastructure and building new products based the abbc platform will strengthen our competitive edge and provide stimuli for the continuous growth the users' base. page abbc whitepaper radical personalization customer experience the global retail trend for the past few years. this applies both traditional brick-and-mortar players and younger e-commerce businesses (which the niche abbc the latest researches show that merely consumers [epsilon] are more likely make purchase when brands offer personalized experiences. along with personal offers, exclusive promotions, and virtual stores, the opportunity choose the means payment should also included the personalized experience. besides, let's not forget about pricing. due the lack commissions and the speed transactions, solutions based virtual currencies allow retailers and vendors reduce the cost goods, making more attractive the buyer. now, customers rate product prices "important" when searching for and selecting products online, and mobile device users have searched for retail coupon another form loyalty program [ups pulse]. based the information above, we'll focus two main areas work after the introduction our updated blockchain. the first partnership with the global blockchain community and the second direct cooperation with the key users our platform e-tailers who are both users and owners marketplaces. let's pause and into more detail. the second half we're going focus testing and adjusting marketing hypotheses our local market. the results will scaled globally, involving players from other regions the abbc platform: emea, apac, and finally amer. speaking more fragmented initiatives, the roadmap can presented the following way: formation team with core developers specializing major market cryptos presentation the solution key blockchain and e-commerce events sales-pipeline finalization and integration customer relationship management software for the sales team scaling emea attracting advertisers use the data generated abbc splitting the office into r&d and international sales (sales begins relocating the target geographical markets rotation principle) launch the first loyalty program and partnerships for personalized promo offers scaling from apac the north and south america involvement advisors from the advertising cluster (beginning cooperation with global advertising networks) dedicated team for cooperation with the open-source community create comprehensive industry standard for blockchainand e-commerce usage the abbc solution market leaders (amazon, alibaba, ebay, etc.) entering the omnichannel retailer market page abbc whitepaper for each quarter, will pick the core business processes, target geographical market, and core industry challenges. the targets might revisited and changed according our current business alignment. however, the principle will remain the same. page abbc whitepaper did not waste our opportunity window that opened what the readers learned from this paper, span two years, abbc has managed build solid product with the help its resourceful team. completely re-engineered our blockchain and based eosio one the most vibrant and rapidly evolving developer's communities the blockchain world. revamped our business model, shifting from placement fee per-transaction fee, requiring participating merchants pay commission only for the successful transactions which deliver revenue. added two essential new models: block production and dev projects implementation. aim these two models the technical crowd within our community, hoping unleash their innovation and tech business acumen. transformed the abbc foundation into abbc dao this will help our community have more control over the use funds and have more participation the way use them. our pleasure ensure this openness and transparency via the same decentralized algorithms which use our business. abbc wallet matter our personal pride. has beautiful design and well-tested user interface, and supports abbc coin, ethereum, and more than erc- tokens (with litecoin, dash, and eos coming soon). the wallet also opens new opportunities for our merchants they can now create customized loyalty programs for their customers. instead some lucid "point" "miles," customers can receive abbc coin rewards and immediately spend for online shopping. the hybrid account model, which implemented for account management our customers, substantially improves the original eosio account model. based our expectations, will significantly lower the entry threshold for new customers. expect widely adopted competitors and other participants the blockchain ecosystem. hard "amazon", although realize all the cumulative benefits this market position generates. think that the future digital commerce lies return from "everything store" curated specialized marketplaces, where the owner gatekeeper and trendsetter one person. because e-commerce development happens "waves," expect the next wave personalization. and course, such personalization will require handy payment tools with the commission being low possible. the current market tough for blockchain e-commerce projects the market cleansing itself from pretenders. however, hard times are usually followed even huger opportunity windows. strongly believe that customized payment instruments, based blockchain any other relevant technology that will emerge soon will drive the future e-commerce within the next several decades. and truly great pleasure surf "ahead the waves". page abbc whitepaper retail e-commerce sales worldwide from (in billion u.s. dollars)
