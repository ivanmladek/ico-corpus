peer-to-peer market for programmatic advertising. adshares provides better transparency, less fraud, and reduced costs for all market participants. adshares network runs esc blockchain and uses adshares tokens for payments. fees collected from processing payments are distributed among token holders. advantages adshares network advantages esc blockchain elimination middlemen easily scale transactions per second and over transfers per second greatly reduced fees. reduction the fees feasible blockchain bloat. disk requirements are not tied transaction volumes barriers entry. especially important for small players. cheap transactions single currency. problem cross border commerce built support for two factor authentication. ability serve controversial segments: gambling, cryptocurrencies, disruptive unique two-tier node structure equality access data -machine learning available for small players economics done right. dividend distribution all token holders. mining required. market structure that makes fraud unprofitable instant secure transactions for accounts same cluster data available academics develop better algorithms ability create instant fiat exchanges without transferring control tokens resistance adblockers ready launch multi party, distributed and secure alternative for tether usd compatible with coalition for better ads secure lightweight clients with ability run smart phones overview existing market simplified view programmatic ads market the current programmatic advertising landscape highly opaque and fragmented. far too many intermediaries stand between advertiser and publisher. this causes inefficiency pricing while intermediaries fees consume huge parts publishers' revenue. for example, google adsense takes cut for allowing you find suitable advertisers. reliable estimates typical intermediary fees are hard get (no surprise!), but estimates point around feesi. some high-profile cases point even more absurd fees %ii. just recap: advertisers pay per thousand impressions while the publishers who actually deliver these impressions only get $., perhaps even $.! this massively inefficient market ripe for disruption. more accurate state advertisement ecosystemiii part the problem that causes this fragmented market that there one standard for communication between advertisers. the adtech industry trying establish such standards, but the dominant model real-time-bidding extremely expensive and does not scale well. the primary aim for the adshares project render various exchanges obsolete making open platform that will enable advertisers and publishers find themselves and trade directly using blockchain. standardized exchange and easy access market will foster development open algorithms that will enable publishers their own ssp and advertisers their own dsp. new peer-to-peer solution decentralized market real-time auction determine buyer for every single request both costly and ineffective. forces advertisers blindly buy impressions because there insufficient time properly assess them. greatly increases the cost infrastructure because rtb systems must operate under strict response time constraints. adshares network based different model market; every advertiser creates account blockchain and associates with their domain. advertiser uses adshares api describe the inventory which wishes advertise. typical entry will include creative content (banner, text, video), various information about the intended audience and, course, price. the advertiser decide which information made public and which remain secret. publishers use blockchain discover advertisers and crawl their inventories. when user visits the publisher's site, the inventory database analyzed find the banner with the highest expected payout. before displaying the banner user, script checks the banner exactly the same the one promised the inventory. the advertiser collects information about displayed ads and periodically (e.g. every hour) analyzes received events and decides which one pay for and how much. both sides the network constantly learn and evaluate the reputation different actors. advertisers have incentive pay fair amount for displaying their ads risk getting banned from the most valuable sites, even lose bids other advertisers. publisher are incentivized display the most matching ads maximize their yield. disintermediation there are services the advertising space that need some kind trusted authority ease trading impressions. example such need classification content. some publishers are interested filtering which kinds ads they want display their websites. for example, they want exclude adult content gambling. this creates the need for common standard ads classification. adshares can accommodate such needs introducing in-network services. further illustrate this, there can service which classifies advertisements. digitally signed classifications from popular providers can included alongside inventory. publishers can then have policy only displaying advertisements checked providers whom they trust. this encourages advertisers undergo quality checking, there can numerous competing standards, and everything can paid using adshares tokens. more generally, can observe that exchanges operating centralized environments have huge pricing power over their users they can enforce certain policies and accompanying services, like quality standards, landing page classification data services. the smallest users are the ones most disadvantaged this area. with efficient, common means payment, most the accompanying services can move on-demand services, competition will greatly increase and prices will fall. reduced fraud accounts used receive and send payments for ads blockchain will linked domains. this repository cryptographic keys can leveraged authenticate events generated during request and delivery. this will substantially reduce surface attacks fraudsters. adshares operates the "display first, collect payment later" principle. this gives significant advantage advertisers because they are not forced blindly bid rtb auctions and, therefore, can take more time assess the validity impressions. fraud can further eliminated adopting revenue sharing model. decreased effectiveness blockers distributed network gives everyone the ability serve ads from their own server domain with custom solutions. this will make adblock software order magnitude harder develop. user ecosystem when the system reaches widespread adoption, users can start use adshares tokens. for example, user can offer their own bids website not display any ads share their advertising preferences with publishers get better ads just part the advertiser payment. adshares network business model market size programmatic digital display advertising spending projected over billion dollars the usa alone. expected grow almost billion dollars iv. this huge market with dynamic y/y growth ideal target for disruption. global digital ads spending projected exceed billion dollars the share programmatic ads growing.v profitability can reached once adshares takes over even small portion the market and satisfied with only average fee collected from payments. fee order magnitude smaller than current rates, even higher revenues might possible. scenario revenue per annum based year global digital ads market; fee million dollars programmatic market; fee million dollars global digital ads market; fee million dollars competition basic attention token. although bat attempts bring blockchain advertising, its target fundamentally change how ads are viewed. this laudable goal but will have enormous adoption problems. even the first step, making users switch their favorite browser for bat alternative, huge challenge. think better serve the existing market and evolve for future use while simultaneously making money for token holders. bat also potential user esc blockchain they currently have working solution for efficient large scale multi party token transfers. big players the exchange market like google doubleclick, appnexus, openx, aol's marketplace will not able prevent their users from simultaneously using our product so, they will have reduce fees and adapt maybe even start posting their inventories our network. competitive advantages the main competitive advantage the adshares network greatly improved transparency and reduced barrier entry. this will cut off most the profit for middlemen and greatly reduce the cost advertising. reduced costs will make advertisers and publishers eager switch our platform. second area improvement resistance fraud and the ability serve ads customers with adblock. new model, paying for advertisers after impression, gives advertisers more time evaluate whether traffic genuine. fraud can even totally removed switching revenue sharing. for example, advertiser running online shop can pay for directed traffic sharing revenue generated users. reduced prices and disintermediation various services will fuel greater competition which will further reduce prices and give incentives improve existing services. present ecosystem adshares network opaque auction system transparency proprietary software free software, open source infrastructure advertiser pays upfront -uncertainty about delivery advertiser pays after impression, less incentive for fraud expensive ads due middlemen fees efficient pricing publisher not sure what ads are displayed surprises every content checked against hash before displaying growth plan adshares network under active developmentvi. blockchain for adshares token and adshares adserver have completed proof concept stages and are working prototypes. more work needed bring products release quality. there also need for improved user interface. bringing adshares token blockchain release quality will take months depending funding levels. finishing development adshares adserver will take another months. simultaneously, will make further efforts find business partners the market and start running gateways existing exchanges. this needed overcome the chicken-and-egg problem bootstrapping network. copying inventory from existing networks, will have good offer for advertisers and publishers from day one. the next area that needs attention the internal market for accompanying services. will run basic data and quality checking tools within the network. preferably, will establish business relations with existing players this space they are not competing with our product. after the network starts, will use machine learning and analytics tools improve the efficiency adshares adserver. growth hacking industries which are prohibited from most the traditional networks (e.g. gambling cryptocurrencies) technical reference registering advertisers register new advertiser, send simple broadcast transaction which contains the domain associated with the sending account. {"run": "broadcast", message:"example.com"} publishers request list broadcasts and add the domain their list known advertisers. {"run": "get_broadcast", since: publishing inventory advertisers publish all their inventory under special url their registered domains get /adshares/inventory/list response will contain json encoded list available ads along
