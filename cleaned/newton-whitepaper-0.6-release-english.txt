important role the evolution human civilization. every major scientific discovery and its application have greatly improved human life. the invention and largescale application the steam engine marked the beginning the first industrial revolution and ushered era which machines replaced manual labor. with the invention and application electric power and internal combustion engines, the second industrial technology revolution began and the continuing electrical era started. computers and the internet were invented, the third technological revolution began, and human beings entered the information era and created "bit world" that never existed before. now that the "bit world" has become new land for mankind with profound influence human civilization. looking back the history information technology, there less-known development path with profound influence: the free software movement initiated richard stallman the early days the computer industry, software was sent users the form source code that users can make full use their hardware reasonable way. with the application copyright law the software field, software was authorized users binary form, representing the start the era proprietary software. this context, richard stallman launched the gnu project develop free and complete operating system, ushering the free software movement []. the beginning the century, great progress has been made the free software campaign, including abundant software technologies, complete free software licenses, global community and on. the emergence free and open source hardware such arduino and raspberry marks the development free and open source intellectual property rights movement from software hardware domain. the second half satoshi nakamoto published paper via mailing list: "bitcoin: peerto-peer electronic cash system" [], and released free and open source bitcoin software early which shows that the development free and open source philosophy has spread from software and hardware into economic field. human-machine community usually, organization self-interested. for example, commercial company usually consists some internal roles such shareholders, employees, etc., and the company's external roles such users, customers, partners are separated from those internal roles, causing inefficient coordination. besides, both the internal and the external roles are equally important contributors the company's development, but external roles cannot effectively participate formulating company's business rules, nor they enjoy the wealth brought the company's value growth. since the third industrial revolution, science and technology develop, machines have gradually replaced our hands and feet, and even some our brains 'functions, and our life quality has been greatly improved. however, generally speaking, the use computers and the human-machine relationship are still its early stages. blockchain can automatically verify trustworthiness users the user community ("credit") free, open, peer-to-peer manner without authoritative intermediary. under this credit system, the "bit world" with atomic properties can establish property rights and scarcity, turn data into wealth, and combine technologies such internet things and artificial intelligence establish trust, collaboration and incentives between people, between machines and between people and machines. newtonfoundation newtonproject.org each person and each machine can node, linked together form human-machine community. through comprehensive evaluation the credit, token, human-power, and computing power the node, the node's newforce, which can used measurement system, can computationally assessed. under the premise orderly governance, super nodes can elected through voting mechanism optimize the human-machine community. human nodes one the most precious characteristics humans rich emotions and their resulting uncertainty. through the use blockchain, token and other technologies, can break the original organizational boundaries and geographical restrictions, and establish new kind open, distributed, and autonomous organization. this environment, each person independent node, and can elect super nodes around the world through voting mechanisms, which can ensure more effective largescale collaboration and innovation. machine nodes compared human beings, one the most important features machine certainty. combining blockchain, tokens, internet things, artificial intelligence and other technologies, machine network which includes credit system and economic model can constructed. each machine becomes network node and performs corresponding functions. the super node can elected through the voting mechanism. human nodes and machine nodes intertwine with each other form human-machine community, giving full play human creativity and machine certainty innovate and accumulate consensus. this way, the community gains continuous development. smart collaboration the use computers, the internet and other technologies have greatly improved human collaboration. however, due the lack good credit verification mechanism, the current collaborative processes require large quantity manual confirmations establish credit system, the overall collaboration can considered semi-automatic. the human-machine community, collaboration can achieved more intelligently, such as: programming business collaboration through smart contracts achieve reliable, automated, and efficient multi-party collaboration; automatic information subscription and value transfer between devices, etc. this way, large-scale smart collaborations between people, between machines, and between people and machines, can built across organizations, industries, and regions. chain-commerce incentives are the foundation for integrating talents and resources. under the traditional companies' organizational structure, capital gains have far exceeded labor income. new generation giant commercial institutions which have developed along with computers and the internet are accelerating the accumulation capital gains. this business model, which most people contribute the benefit few people, often creates monopolies and hinders continuous innovation. newtonfoundation newtonproject.org chain-commerce the basic business model the human-machine community. this model, any behavior contributing the human-machine community will rewarded. service providers, consumers, users, customers and other economic actors can effectively participate formulating and implementing business rule, establish smart collaborations and operate automatic, open and transparent manner. human-machine nodes are self-driven and automatically motivated, thereby forming business model where everyone contributes goods and services and are fairly remunerated for such contributions through transparent and programmable incentive system. token design newton token, abbreviated new, with total circulation billion, built-in tool for value measurement, storage and incentives, which can transfer value between the main chain and its subchains and between the sub-chains, for example: payment transaction fees, purchase commercial resources, incentive contributions, etc. the time mentioned below based the creation time the newchain genesis block. actor proportion description incentives for founding team; founding team the first year the locked period. from the second year, every month the total amount will unlocked. party token exchange for foundation's initial operation; specific exchange options, such rounds, ratios and lock-up clauses, etc., please refer the official website. foundation community for foundation's later operation; the total immediately released, while the rest will unlocked every month. incentives for community; unlock over the next fifty years. newton token metrics incentive design beneficiaries commercial activities, service providers need lock and pay newton tokens obtain commercial resources. since there commercial intermediary seeking excessive-profits, transaction costs will decrease significantly compared traditional business, consumers may purchase goods and services lower prices. order match the economic scale growth the human-machine community, the system will issue new according community-defined algorithms. the new paid service providers and the new issued the system will put into the incentive pool. node super-node can increase its newforce value making positive contribution the human-machine community through the proof contribution (poc) system. the system will feature incentive distribution algorithm that will distribute "new" the incentive pool human/ newtonfoundation newtonproject.org machine nodes based their newforce value, which turn shall based the amount computing resources, storage resources, other services provided the human-machine nodes the system. doing this, the human-machine community enters positive cycle, expands scale, and sustains development and innovation.. basic technology will develop series basic technologies support the hyper-transport protocols. the design goals and technical solutions for each basic technology will outlined below. .newchain newchain will focus and enhance its blockchain's scalability, performance and privacy controls and support flexible data structures, transaction processing mechanisms, and improved access authority control. initially, human-readable namespace encoded within- unicode characters will used account identifiers, and identifiers with less than unicode characters will reserved for system-level purposes. newchain consists main chain and many sub-chains. the main chain supports account management, newton token management, sub-chain management, human-machine network governance and more. the specific business runs the sub-chains which support multiple consensus mechanisms and data structures. value exchanges can achieved between the main chain and subchains, and between sub-chains. third-party can create new sub-chains after staking certain amount newton tokens and passing verification procedure, ant the new sub-chains can issue new passes. the main chain and the sub-chains communicate through the value transmission protocol which defines two types transactions: vtpblocktx and vtpdatatx. vtpblocktx defines the format the latest block information submitted the sub-chains the main chain. the main chain then verifies the legitimacy information submitted the sub-chains, indexes the real-time operating status the sub-chains and adjusts the system accordingly. vtpdatatx defines the format transferring data and executing smart contracts between sub-chains. the newchain nodes support distributed database plugins, such mongodb, apache cassandra, and more, and the block data stored fragments maintain sufficient scalability. analyzing the correlation transactions with static analysis engine, transactions can executed parallel. performance can further optimized deploying nodes that include the main chain and all the subchains. the main chain uses delegated proof stake (dpos) consensus mechanism build economic model, and the super nodes are elected through voting. newvm compatible with the web assembly standard, allowing the development smart contracts using mainstream programming languages such c/c++, java, python, and type script. the system provides number built-in smart contract templates help simplify the development process. the system also provides certified, open, auditable information services such logistics information, banking data, medical data, and public event facilitate the execution smart contracts complete business logic. newtonfoundation newtonproject.org technical framework newnet addition transactions, payment and other functions, there large amount data stored such as: text, pictures, video, etc., well complex computational requirements. transaction business can handled newchain, which will serve decentralized computing infrastructure providing services for applications, including name services, computing services, and storage services. newnet open network that provides secure and reliable storage services and supports databases and multiple common programming languages. most services will directly hosted newnet. developers will able publish computing tasks while nodes will select the corresponding tasks based their computing power, complete the tasks and get corresponding rewards through newnet's incentive system. decentralized name services will implemented through blockchain technology increase the ease use newnet. users can directly access newnet through regular browser software, where they can choose synchronize all network services their local nodes download data when needed. users not want run newnet nodes locally, they can choose access newnet through proxy nodes. atom hashing blockchain technology introduces solution framework secure and trade digital assets. non-digital assets are currently mainly registered through manual identification, sequence number marking, etc., which unreliable and easy counterfeit. this makes difficult for material assets traded and circulate the blockchain. the non-digital asset labeling and the speed the authentication rights not match the speed transactions, which one the important reasons for the proliferation counterfeit goods. newtonfoundation newtonproject.org atom hashing uses techniques such machine vision, and deep learning technology quickly extract multiple characteristics non-digital assets, including weight, volume, size, shape, texture, optical properties, radioactive properties, thermodynamic properties, and variety customized random features. based the data concerning these characteristics and algorithms, the unique identification and authentic right for the non-digital asset can created. the whole process can repeatable, verifiable and fault-tolerant. for example, before commodities leave the factory, the atomic hashing calculation can performed the commodities, and the calculated results can stored the blockchain. the subsequent circulation the commodities, the customers can verify whether the commodity they received the original one any time. presently the cost using this technology relatively high, will mainly applied specific commodities, such diamonds, jade, etc., and will applied wider range goods after technological advancements and cost reductions. newiot newiot will include blockchain gateways, communication protocols between iot devices and gateways, design specifications, and on. the gateway has powerful computing and storage capabilities with built-in blockchain nodes, supporting multiple internet accessing methods including: ethernet/fiber, g/g/g, nb-iot, iot communication protocols such ble, wi-fi, zigbee and on. these iot devices will store their collected information into newchain through the gateway. based the newiot specification, series newchain iot devices can developed, including the sensors for temperature, humidity, air pressure, illumination, acceleration, vibration, magnetic field, pressure, harmful gases, gps and other sensors, sound collectors, image collectors, etc. information and value can exchanged between devices when needed. newai newai distributed artificial intelligence engine that integrates distributed data sources (such user authorization data, data providers, etc.), algorithm models, and computing resources complete given task. newai consists data protocol nddata, model protocol ndmodel, and execution engine protocol ndengine. nddata data access specification that includes multidimensional data formats, data fragmentation, data compression, data encryption, etc. multidimensional data compatible with hdf (hierarchical data format) and can directly apply large number existing analysis programs. the users' private data safety will protected the k-anonymity, e--differential privacy and other methods. ndmodel specification for algorithm model definition, operation and storage that supports protocol buffers, caffe model, json and other formats while having built-in common algorithm model. more algorithm models will provided algorithm model developers. app developers can check the effects the algorithm model and use newton tokens purchase the model's usage rights. ndengine specification for executing engine registrations, deployment, operation, monitoring, and shutdown, using container technology run calculation software such tensorflow and caffe. hyper exchange protocol the hyper exchange protocol the basic commercial protocol stack that supports the operations upper layer applications. the design objectives and technical solutions each protocol are outlined newtonfoundation newtonproject.org below: digital identity and credit the blockchain asymmetric encryption algorithm natural user authentication system that can construct decentralized digital identity system. newid the only permanent identity the system's namespace. with newkey, users can easily manage their digital assets, such as: tokens, data, credit, etc., while maintaining access control, including authorizing third parties access their digital assets, getting benefits, and on. due the inherent tamper-resistant characteristic blockchain, the credit system can developed and formed naturally. credit access: users can access their personal credits any time and set their own credit model. credit access control: third party needs apply for access user's credit through access control protocol. the user may choose pass refuse authorization. credit access audit: check your own credit access control records, transaction records, etc. supply chain commodities usually through many intermediaries such logistics, warehousing, customs clearance, sales, etc., before being finally delivered consumers. when there after-sales service, there will corresponding reverse process. the current supply chains have almost never been open and transparent. difficult for consumers learn the origin goods, circulation information, etc. for some industries, such food, medicine, and luxury goods, this very serious problem. therefore, traceable and reliable supply chain system that open and transparent all stakeholders significant. digital identity the commodity: establish digital identity for commodities and track their relevant information any time through the use atom hashing and other digital identity-verification technologies. traceablity the whole process: through the use newiot, newchain and other technologies, all operations concerning commodities the supply chain, such time, location, operator, description, etc., will automatically stored the blockchain ensure that data tamper-proof. the supply chain transparent stakeholders and they can track the status the commodities any time. processing commercial smart contracts: through smart contract technology, users can complete automatic insurance claim, transfer property rights and complete many other commercial interactions according pre-set business rules, thereby reducing transaction conflicts and promoting cooperation. digital marketing. the current digital marketing system inefficient []. users passively accept large number advertisements while they can't get the information they need quickly, and usually don't get any incentives. for advertisers, difficult achieve accurate delivery the payment mode based exposure, clicks, interactions and other behaviors are indirect promotions, which lead large amount non-transparent and inefficient marketing expenses from merchants. marketing contracts: advertisers can set marketing plans through various marketing smart contract templates built-in the system, including: target users, incentive models, settlement methods, and dynamic price adjustment rules. marketing subscription: users can choose whether not they accept marketing advertisements, well the type information they need, price range they prefer and on. marketing audit: advertisers can audit ongoing and completed marketing contracts. marketing newtonfoundation newtonproject.org analysis: through the newai system, market research can conducted before marketing campaigns, and campaign results can analyzed after the marketing over. transactions and payment current offline transactions contracts have high execution cost. the online e-commerce system less flexible because the transaction logic implemented the product level. current transactions' payment costs are high with low efficiency and poor flexibility. through blockchain technology, new generation transaction and payment system can built. transaction smart contracts: users can define transactions through system's built-in smart contract templates and rule engines, including multi-party transactions based complex business rules, settlement rules, and can associate with smart insurance contracts, smart financial contracts, and offchain services. global payments: support for cross-border transactions. lighting settlement: extremely fast transaction confirmations and settlement speed. micropayments: very low transaction costs, which can used for automatic settlement between machines. payment tools: provision sophisticated online and offline payment tools. reliable physical channel the digital world, there are mature technologies that establish secure data transmission channels, but the physical world, there are currently well-developed technologies for similar functions. for example, the logistics industry, goods are lost, stolen, and privacy leaks sometimes occur. especially when transporting high-value and high-privacy goods, reliable transportation methods are urgently needed. based technologies such newiot and newchain, reliable physical channel protocol can designed and the relevant device manufacturing specifications are defined. any third party can produce security devices according the protocol's specifications and manufacturing specifications. establishing and closing channel: after signing the transaction contract, the merchant puts the commodities into the security device and locks the security device using the customer's public key establish reliable physical channel. after the security device delivered, the customer will unlock the security device using his/her private key and close the reliable physical channel. the above process will automatically recorded onto newchain. query physical channel status: the newiot module the security device uploads its geographic location, visual and environment and other data newchain, and stakeholders can subscribe and view the data. regulatory physical channel: for safe transportation, the regulatory key issued the certified regulatory authority, and the security device can opened for inspection whenever necessary. regulatory actions are automatically recorded and uploaded newchain and can viewed customers. automatic finance traditional financial service systems have large audit workload with long periods, high costs, and poor flexibility causing difficulties serving middle and small-sized enterprises and individuals. through digital identity and credit, supply chain, etc., new self-finance system can established. the self-finance system automatically combines smart contracts such insurance, lending, and investment smart contracts consumer financial services for individuals and supply chain financial newtonfoundation newtonproject.org services for enterprises. build-in financial smart contracts: defining financial smart contracts based built-in smart contract templates insurance, lending and investment including: digital identities and credits, user information, locked pass addresses, contract rules, and associated outside blockchain services. the system will automatically match the financial smart contract and complete the transaction matching. nnio developers can easily access newnet through the nnio (newnet io) protocol use services such storage, computing, and name services. storage contract: initiate and manage storage service requests through corresponding smart contract templates, including: digital identity and credit, application capacity, payment method, usage time, etc. computing contract: initiate and manage computing service applications through corresponding smart contract templates, including: digital identity and credit, application capacity, payment method, time usage, associated newai tasks, and associated off-chain services. name contract: apply for and cancel the name service through corresponding smart contract template, including: digital identity and credit, name, payment method. community economy the human-machine community will establish new economic model through smart collaboration and chain-commerce models, i.e. the community social economy. newton the infrastructure the community economy and its technical framework includes: the application layer, the protocol layer and the basic technology layer, providing complete governance, collaboration, incentives and other support for the establishment the community economy. traditional business model organizational structure community economy model closed organizational structure where human-machine community with management difficulties increase with self-driven, automatic incentives. scale expansion. cooperation mode collaboration within the organization, semi-automatic, and requires manual intervention. smarter collaboration within and across organizations, industries, and geographies, and smarter. incentive mechanisms most people contribute and only few people benefit. everyone contributes and everyone benefits. the ownership the data transaction cost third party owns user data. privacy leaks. third parties create wealth for few people through user data. commercial intermediaries pursue monopoly and super profits, pushing transaction costs. users have their own data privacy protection users can create wealth for themselves through their own data without commercial intermediaries, transaction costs are effectively reduced. traditional business community economy the community economy will become new world innovation and entrepreneurship. for example, the well-known brand companies can export their commodities the world through hyper exchange newtonfoundation newtonproject.org protocol. sellers will get new users and drastically reduce marketing costs. through the establishment new form financial services companies, the development digital asset management, consumer finance and supply chain financial services will realized. contributors the community economy, consumers will receive tokens incentives enjoy the wealth created economic growth. software developers should welcome bigger software development markets, participate the construction protocol-based economic infrastructure and develop new applications for the entire human-machine community. join the newton community economy! everyone should benefit from economic growth! newtonfoundation newtonproject.org modification record november nep- improved the newton foundation token
