whitepaper index: introduction rewards specifications pre-mine advantages investing masternode coin deterministic ordering references page whitepaper introduction: gainer coin based london. with aim provide its users investors the huge roi per annum even with masternodes. the users have purchase coins and make masternode support the network. users then get the rewards each block, for the pos coin. users cannot buy much coins, then they can buy any number coins and staking. staking gives the rewards each block. you can expect regular maintenance and smooth flow transactions blockchain have already tested the blockchain for weeks. rewards: gainer coin has dynamic reward structure. the rewards changes increases the block number increases. the rewards are split into for masternode and for staking. there single wallet setup option for both staking and masternode. this means that users not need worry about the staking rewards, the wallet does both masternode services and gives rewards for coin staking too. the wallet can used for multiple masternodes and all the rewards can auto staked automatically. from block block coins reward per block onwards specifications: coin name: gainer coin. ticker symbol gnr max supply coin type: pow (%) used totally for pre-mine. now coin pos only! which very good for the masternode holders. pos hashing algorithm: scrypt gainer block time: seconds block reward: dynamic page whitepaper advantages investing masternode coin: early investors get coins usd per coin. early investors can right away start making masternods with the coins they receive. they can staking they have amount greater than less than are not distributing tokens ico, but directly coins ico. this why users can directly start earning before the coin even hits the exchanges. are planning getting the coin http://cryptopia.co.nz http://gate.io http://kukcoin.com and http://coinexchange.io ensure proper liquidity. future plans: integrating the coin online casino sites currency for gambling. adding the coin the white label debit card websites which provide gnr usd conversion and withdrawal from debit cards. have sent proposals https://uquid.com/uquid-card https://bitwala.com have sent proposal to: http://cykeys.com for integrating gnr currency for purchases games. rewards distribution: there are blocks day. example: the reward coins per block divided into for masternodes(.) and for staking (.) further the rewards are distributed all running masternodes. the more number maternodes, the less rewards you get, because the rewards are distributed each masternode timely manner. coin distribution (%) pre-mine due the fact that the masternode rewards program fixed percentage and the masternode network nodes are fluctuating, expected masternode rewards will vary according the current total count active masternodes. payments for standard day for running masternode can calculated using the following formula: where: the number masternodes operator controls the total number masternodes the current block reward (presently averaging about gainer) blocks average day. for the dash network this usually the average masternode payment the average block amount) return investment for running masternode can calculated page whitepaper where variables are the same above. the cost associated with running masternode creates hard and soft limit active nodes the network. the soft limit imposed the price costs acquire node and the limited liquidity exchanges due usage dash currency and not merely investment. deterministic ordering special deterministic algorithm used create pseudo-random ordering the masternodes. using the hash from the proof-of-work for each block, security this functionality will provided the mining network. pseudo code, for selecting masternode: for(mastenode masternodes){ current_score masternode.calculatescore(); if(current_score best_score){ best_score current_score; winning_node masternode; cmasternode::calculatescore(){ pow_hash getproofofworkhash(nblockheight); get the hash this block pow_hash_hash hash(pow_hash); //hash the pow hash increase the entropy difference abs(pow_hash_hash masternode_vin); return difference; the example code can extended further provide rankings masternodes also, "second", "third", "fourth" masternode the list selected. references: blockchain.info.
