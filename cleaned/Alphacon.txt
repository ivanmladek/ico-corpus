put dent the universe. otherwise why else even here?" steve jobs the global healthcare data related market analyzed reach billion from billion with percent annual growth rate. according ibm, more than hospitals around the world are collecting data patients, and million patients are using remote monitoring devices. there are new data per patient each day. u.s. library congress says that the size big data healthcare generated this way the current healthcare data market evolving with ict technologies utilizing big data, cloud computing, and the internet things. this has allowed healthcare data exclusively used existing medical institutions used more decentralized and compatible manner. despite the rapid pace development, the healthcare big data market now has some limitations. although very important information, security weak and data itself dispersed and fragmented. for this reason, there also skepticism about whether can create value with the healthcare big data. alphacon platform that provides customized health solutions based healthcare data. collect, store and analyze life log data through gene, functional medicine, immunity, and smart devices provide healthcare solutions optimized for each customer such health functional products and medical services. alphacon working solving existing problems the healthcare data market through the combination block chain technology and cryptocurrency. what alphacon? definition alphacon has the meaning health care unicorn that opens the alpha age. platform distribute healthcare data and provide personalized solutions with banner

companies and matches each other's needs and aiva(ai valuation) service, which automatically evaluates the enterprise value start-ups through artificial intelligence. healthcare big data status market size according the 'global big data spending healthcare industry market research report published technavio, the annual average growth rate the healthcare big data market mckinsey company also sees huge growth potential the healthcare big data market says its report titled "the big data revolution healthcare" and many other market research agencies have the same perspective. statista predicts that the global digital health market, which was billion will reach billion the 'global digital health market from report. pwc expects worldwide smart healthcare market reach billion from billion benefit the biggest benefit healthcare big data cost and time savings. mckinsey company has predicted its research report the big data revolution healthcare' that big data will able save billion health and healthcare costs the united states alone annually. first all, healthcare big data shortens the time required for finding candidate materials and conducting clinical trials for new drug development and reduces the probability failure finding suitable patients for clinical trials. therefore, high-quality health care big data considered the core new drug development. second, healthcare big data analyzes individual's physical information and enables predictions about the disease that are likely develop the future. prediction disease through healthcare big data very significant that enables personalized medicine and even precision medicine. lastly, healthcare, big data can help medical staffs make decisions. especially when combined with artificial intelligence, the effect greater. ibm's 'watson' case point. addition, the maintenance customers hospitals, reduction the re-hospitalization rate, and reduction the cost information technology can also regarded the benefits big data. problems --. weak privacy protection the end anthem, the second largest insurance company the united states, suffered hacking incident, leaking million customer information. when adding customer information from other companies that share the same insurance network anthem, the amount personal information that was leaked close million. alone, personal health information million people, about half all americans, was leaked from five health insurers. the poor security healthcare data the most serious problem that makes difficult generate and collect data that needed for the expansion and generalization customized health care and precision health care. security issues must solved urgently they create more social and economic costs than health care costs big data can save. --. fragmentation healthcare data the most important personal information because includes physical information, well information related finance, behavior, and mental health. particular, the hospital medical records patients are strictly regulated that illegal take them out the hospital unless you are the patient yourself. thus, because the importance healthcare data, those data hospitals and inspection agencies ended being fragmented paradoxically. fragmentation also cuts the owner off his her data, making impossible for the owner know when and where his her important data circulated. course, the owner cannot claim exercise legitimate rights process and distribute his her data, making difficult continuously collect healthcare data. --. doubt about utilization security and fragmentation issues ultimately lead quantitative and qualitative issues healthcare big data. the quantity and quality the data cannot guaranteed, cannot called big data. this moment proper distribution platform available. that why the voices that raise doubts about the value using are continuing. healthcare big data platform services address the issues raised earlier, many block chain-based health care big data platform services are being introduced recently. this proves that block chain required for healthcare big data problem-solving, and that the growth potential the related business large enough. with these leading services, including alphacon, block chain-based healthcare big data services market longer strange concept, but undeniable trend. alphacon trouble shooter overview alphacon block chain-based distribution and solution platform created address problems the healthcare big data industry. when individual agrees provide and distribute data genes, functional medicine, immunity tests, and life log the platform, alphacon gives alp, cryptocurrency, the individual return. personal healthcare data encrypted and securely stored external cloud storage, and pharmaceutical company purchases it, individuals will given alp. transaction history healthcare data transparently managed because disclosed the block chain based ethereum-based protocol. the alphacon ecosystem created individuals who request genes hair minerals tests through healthcare home page network hospital use iot devices. analytical and testing agencies store these data external cloud storage when individuals approve it, and the block chain platforms with various smart contracts such token smart contract are responsible for checking access data and token compensation. companies institutions that want purchase personal healthcare data will first request access alphacon network, and alphacon network will verify and notify the result the data buyer when approved. only companies institutions that have obtained access authority can access the healthcare data. through this, alphacon makes clear that individuals are the owner healthcare data and returns the profit the owner, thereby simultaneously addressing the limitations and problems healthcare big data and existing centralized platform business. healthcare data regulations alphacon focused distributing big data healthcare and creating new value based clear perception reality. this end, alphacon redefined the healthcare big data that will distributed the platform. four types data such genomics, functional medicine, immunity, and life log will distributed primarily the platform. alphacon has set the strategy focusing distributing these four types healthcare data the korean market first and then gradually advancing into the global market. genetic testing, which the most valuable big data healthcare, produces about gene mutations once microarray chip method. korea, only the mutation licensed genes provided the individual. and all rights the unused original data except for are given the individual. desired, data the remaining gene mutations can generated, which can utilized within the alphacon platform big data. currently, only 'single nucleotide polymorphism'(snp) analysis service 'genotyping' method available korea through direct-to-consumer (dtc) genetic testing. these regulations only make possible determine the mutation genes different categories. therefore, can said that there virtually value big data healthcare. alphacon plans overcome these limitations through microarray chip approach. differentiated elements key values "medibloc" issued medi token (med) october last year distribute hospital medical records block chain with motto 'new medical information ecosystem'. med, which was created collect patients' medical information and overcome regional limitations, was listed the cryptocurrency exchange. george church, professor harvard university, established startup called nebula genomics, which trades genetic information with cryptocurrency. its white paper released february this year, nebula genomics presented its blueprint that allows the ownership the gene information held the hospital and the inspection body returned the individual, and that also allows sell gene information the individual directly the block chain network unlike other platforms that want collect and distribute only one healthcare data, such medical records (medibloc), gene information (nebula genomics), alphacon distribute complex data collected from various channels. this because becomes the most valuable healthcare data when genetic information combined with personal health records(phr). that end, established network cooperation with businesses various fields. alphacon also differs from others that provides customized solutions based analysis rather than staying providing simple distribution and analysis services. the provision customized solutions through distribution variety health care data and partnerships with multiple companies major competitive factor the creation healthcare big data distribution ecosystem and business development alphacon. alphacon ecosystem health care block chain value 'trust ecosystem' march google's subsidiary 'deepmind health' announced that will work with national health service (nhs) and introduce technology track patient information real time based the block chain. ibm, partnership with fda, has begun developing technology share patient data securely using block chain technology, and intel has patented sequence mining platform (smp) technology based block chain technology. addition financial sector, which the birthplace block chain technology, healthcare the area where the current block chain technology most actively applied. the field financial sector, directly linked money, and healthcare data, the most important personal information, attention paid block chain technology because security and transparency are guaranteed. this, turn, means that block chain technology provides confidence relation healthcare data. when the medical data individual confirmed original through block chain technology, becomes possible share the medical information, which was considered impossible the past. individuals don't have take the same test again because test records from other hospitals are deemed reliable. addition, when the transaction becomes traceable with block chain technology, distribution healthcare data and transparency transaction are ensured. then, people are willing agree provide data, making easy create big data. this sharing and big data directly related the reduction medical expenses that prevents inefficiency and enables precision medicine. even from the point view health care professionals, block chain technology very powerful means ensuring the integrity medical records and ease management. survey conducted the ibm institute for business value found that percent healthcare service providers said they found block chain technology most effective managing clinical trial records and medical records. particular, managing clinical trial records through block chain technology has great significance that prevents researchers from manipulating the data obtain the desired results the first place. market research firm idc predicted, health care data times larger than that the need for block chain technology record and manage will only get greater. trust that block chain technology establishes the healthcare field enables verification the integrity medical records, the most basic part, and sharing and using big data, ultimately reduces medical costs, the most daunting task. this way, can create 'trust ecosystem' which trust functions social capital. this why the healthcare field has keen interest block chain technology. sharing the fruits ecosystem growth through tokens block chain-based healthcare big data platform begins with individuals willing provide their valuable healthcare data. the ecosystem grows and evolves because many people put trust block chain technology, then the fruits must shared among the individuals who made possible. the fruits ecosystem growth not shared individuals, then, trust the health care big data platform, which was difficult build, will inevitably undermined. what needed here token, cryptocurrency issued block chain basis. the reason that tokens, not points (frequent flyer) miles that are commonly seen traditional, centralized platforms are needed for the healthcare big data platform that the ecosystem grows, the value tokens rise accordingly and then, the fruits growth can fairly shared. contrast, points and (frequent flyer) miles are not line with the growth the ecosystem their value does not rise. alp, cryptocurrency issued alphacon network, utility token used when using healthcare applications services built block chain basis. alp used for variety economic activities such rewards for data providers when providing healthcare data for the first time, revenue sharing for data providers when distributing data, and purchase products/services healthcare mall(myhealthcare.com). individuals who have agreed provide and distribute data will automatically receive alp their wallets according established criteria when initially providing the data. thereafter, each time the data traded, alp automatically transferred the provider's wallet predetermined rate smart contracts. investors who have participated ico and received alp can also obtain additional alp return for agreeing provide and distribute data. healthcare data can purchased only when companies, institutions, and research institutes, which want purchase the data, give eth alphacon network and take alp. alp listed exchange, can purchased through the exchange. anyone who has alp can purchase smart devices, nutritional supplements, functional foods, and various wearable devices through healthcare mall. the rate inflation after ico set every year. inflation rate can adjusted more than the total volume alp holders agree. rising value tokens the most practical way for alp holders benefit raise the value alp through the growth their ecosystem and ico. achieve this goal, alphacon network aims complete the ipo the domestic and international exchanges within six months one year after ico. addition, alphacon network will continue strive increase the value the token through alp volume control through sale and buyback, well periodic investor's meetups and briefing sessions business progress. the plan for each item expand the ecosystem, which most important raising alp values, are follows. --. network expansion heart network effects that alphacon needs become successful healthcare big data platform are hospitals and clinics, and analytical agencies. the more hospitals and clinics and analytical agencies participate the alphacon ecosystem, the more kinds and amount healthcare data that the platform can distribute. accordingly, alphacon can automatically advance into the global market. for this reason, alphacon will devote the most time and resources expanding networks cooperative hospitals and clinics and analytical agencies. the expansion plan (accumulation) domestic and overseas reserves for each data for the next three years follows: --. expansion data through healthcare city project order overcome the limitations acquiring/expanding genetic data for individuals, alphacon network plans carry out 'healthcare city' and 'healthcare company' businesses for local governments and companies. the united states, all which builds genetic information for one million veterans, and 'dubial gemoics', which collects genetic information million residents dubai are operation. such, national health care through genetic information has become global trend conjunction with the reduction medical expenses. --. building quality healthcare data the most effective means increasing the number data buyers, another pillar the alphacon platform, good quality healthcare data. alphacon has partnered with interezen, company specializing big data analysis, increase data buyers providing quality healthcare big data. alphacon will work with interezen build foundation prioritize the standardization life log data since there standard present and provide meaningful results data buyers. addition standardization tasks, alphacon plans develop tools and integrated analysis services that can integrate and analyze gene, functional medicine, immunity and life log data. --. token usage expansion expanding the usage alp has significant meaning that the platform doesn't stay the internal expansion, but expands its scope externally. primarily, alphacon network will provide more customized solutions through application services, and will continue expand its healthcare solutions and devices that can purchased healthcare mall. addition, plan build and strengthen our network with other health and beauty related online shopping malls and steadily expand the network hospitals and clinics where you can receive services and undergo cosmetic surgery using alp. alphacon network plans give back society pursue public good such treating diseases and promoting human health and welfare has solid revenue model through the establishment such healthcare big data ecosystem. alphacon technology block chain hierarchy the alphacon platform the alphacon platform the foundation which alphacon ecosystem participants can trade biometric data. the actual data that traded the platform stored external database (data banking cloud db) that was already built. ensure the transparency and integrity data transactions, the transaction information recorded the ethereum block chain network and the compensation system based this automated. the platform's structure largely divided into three tiers: contract layer, interface layer, and application layer. --. contract layer layer that stores the data that must guaranteed transparency and integrity, such status related alp transactions, the access authority the db, and that fulfills contracts. the data needed make the platform transparent and seamless recorded the ethereum block chain network, and smart contract deployed the ethereum virtual machine (evm) order enable this. smart contract consists two types according their purpose and characteristics. alp token smart contract (erc smart contract that records the status alp transactions and fulfills transactions. conforms the erc standard, which the cryptocurrency standard the ethereum network, compatible with the dapp implemented the erc basis. authorization smart contract (erc smart contract that records and modifies the status data ownership and access authority ecosystem participants. through this smart contract, you can issue check certificates associated with ownership and authority each unique record stored the external db. information about whether the distribution data provided the individual has been approved, the transaction history when the data sold externally, and the data buyer also recorded alp. unlike the erc standard, where each alp can replaced with the same value, each alp follows the erc standard where each alp has its own unique value. therefore, alp, issued through it, acts certificate for individual data transactions. --. interface layer interface layer acts link between the data outside the block chain (application layer) and the data inside the block chain (contract layer). the basic data that implements smart contracts the actual contract layer the data the application layer, but unlike the data the block chain, not transparent and flawless. therefore, the process implementing smart contract using these basic data also needs done transparently and flawlessly. interface layer consists smart oracle designed solve this. smart oracle responsible for transparent implementation smart contract and has the following features detail: logic execution and response application layer requests, provision interface for dapp receive events out-going message that reads data from the contract layer fulfills contract transparently disclosing how smart contracts are implemented policies recording log the block chain --. application layer application layer direct contact with individual users, who use the alphacon platform, and data buyers. various dapps (decentralized applications) constituting application layer serve window for users access their electronic wallet and healthcare data, check doctor's appointment medical history hospitals where the docple solution installed. data buyers can also retrieve and purchase encrypted healthcare data through api and sdk provided alphacon network. dapp form application that can driven variety platforms, including web, mobile apps, and smart devices, and continue expand the ecosystem grows. the alphacon ecosystem joined businesses which are already engaged related projects from the start, fundamentally provided with the following tools and dapps. wallet there token wallet that contains alp and wallet that stores keys access your healthcare data. docple individual can make doctor's appointment hospital where credoway's hospital solution installed, and check the medical history after treatment. for customers who need regular medical check-ups, the customer's hospital and customer will alerted the alarm specified date. healthcare data the case genetic testing, after genetic test, results reports and recommended nutritional supplements will provided. the case life log data, stored through smart devices linked with the alphacon ecosystem, and then iot health care services will provided. buyer sdk dapp that enables data buyers purchase healthcare data. order facilitate interworking with the alphacon ecosystem, separate sdk and api are provided the data buyer, and the encrypted healthcare data transacted using smart contract. individuals can sell data after otp (one time password generator) authentication performed before data buyers access their healthcare data. otp authentication further enhances security restricting access healthcare data addition the public key authentication method block chain technology. data storage for the alphacon platform the data traded the alphacon platform very large, and generated very frequently the case biometric log data, and characterized unstructured. therefore, must stored external data storage instead being recorded the block chain. the alphacon platform uses the currently commercialized big data platform collect, store, analyze, and retrieve data, and store only the hash values these data the block chain record and track ownership and authority, and configure the compensation system work. when storing data, only pure biometric data stored, excluding identifiable personal information. stored healthcare data authenticated via the otp system and the public key values stored the block chain and then delivered the data buyer. alphacon network will continue study the optimization required for healthcare data size and index and advanced research, and plan further enhance security storing healthcare data the block chain instead external storage. expected effect from the alphacon platform --. tight security with the case the aforementioned american insurance company anthem, security data the existing platform was big issue because contained identifiable personal information. however, the alphacon platform can reduce this burden using block chain. because only non-identifying information stored the data storage, you can know which account the data belongs using anonymous block chain network, but you cannot know who owns the account. thus, even there perfect security, the damage data providers can minimized when data leaked. addition, the collection, transaction, use, and disposal steps all personal information that exist within the platform are integrated and managed cope with security and management accidents such misuse and leakage that occur the personal information distribution stage through constant monitoring. --. high accessibility businesses that want promote their business related biometric data organizations that want use data can solve lot workload with basic application, api, and sdk provided the alphacon platform. because there are almost barriers participation the alphacon platform ecosystem, each participant able focus more their expertise participating the ecosystem. result, the entire platform ecosystem will move more progressive direction. --. biometric data asset the existing healthcare services, people did not know how the data provider's biometric data exists and how utilized. result, there were cases where such information could exploited, which also caused reluctance collect biometric data. however, the alphacon platform the biometric data guaranteed anonymity, the relationship between the owner and the access authority clear, and the transaction history the data recorded. these features allow biometric data become asset data providers, which can ease their reluctance. eos protocol applicability ethereum, which alphacon based on, good protocol, but also has few disadvantages. the most well-known problem slow transaction processing speed and gas cost. the biggest issue for alphacon smart contract interpretation program. the most important feature that put ethereum today's position smart contract that automatically implements the contract between the two parties and makes trust between the parties unnecessary. thanks this powerful feature smart contract, has spread around the world rapidly, but also big obstacle the service because theoretically, cannot modified once starts service. with this mind, alphacon network currently analyzing eos protocol, which drawing attention new paradigm. the operation main network, sidechain, and independent chain, which will released june considered good condition, will consider developing alphacon based eos protocol provide seamless service. alphacon's healthcare data alliance the alphacon ecosystem comprised variety companies and players. these collaborators are the key maintaining and growing alphacon while providing the technical and business foundations four types healthcare data, customized health solutions and platforms. genetic analysis data with analysis institute genetic testing, which amounted billion has come into the modern era when even individuals can analyze their genes with the advent faster decoding technology. the cost genetic testing, which was when steve jobs was tested for pancreatic cancer, decreased and approaching the mark just around the corner. since the late there has also been dtc market which individuals not hospitals and clinics and they can directly get genetic tests from genetic testing agencies. according market research firm credence research, the global dtc market size, which was million expected expand million the compound annual growth rate(cagr) from healthcare receives request for dtc testing from the customer through the website and hand over the analytical agency with which the agreement signed for analysis. the analytical agency will generate big data genes through microarray chip method for the individual who made the request, and then store the big date external storage with the approval the individual. --. customized healthcare solutions based genetic analysis with and others alphacon not just about storing and distributing healthcare data. also provides personalized optimal health solutions based analysis results. this the most essential part adding value healthcare data and the most differentiated part from other block chain-based platforms. that end, alphacon network has partnered with hospitals and clinics representing korea, including mc, mojelim cosmetic clinic, oracle clinic and hamsoa oriental medical clinic. alphacon network provides specialized genetic analysis module for each these hospitals and clinics. when individuals, who had genetic testing these hospitals and clinics, request big data analysis, they participate the alphacon platform with the big data generated. according the results the specialized genetic analysis, individuals who had big data analyzed receive customized health care solutions from each hospital clinic such obesity, hair loss, skin care and child diseases. these four hospitals and clinics have more than networks korea. specialized healthcare hospitals and clinics descriptions analysis modules korea's top obesity management treatment clinic concentration, cholesterol, blood branches nationwide and largest number liposuction record mojelim cosmetic clinic korea's top hair clinic specializing hair transplantation for years hair specialists and design laboratory branches korea and overseas oracle clinic body mass index, neutral fat over dermatologists and plastic surgeons sugar, blood pressure, caffeine metabolism (inner care) hair loss, hair thickness (outfit care) skin aging, oriental medical clinic elasticity, pigmentation, vitamin concentration (beauty care) asthma, hamsoa skin more than branches korea and overseas atopic dermatitis, tourturret syndrome, kawasaki disease, dental caries, about oriental medical doctors vitiligo (kids care) functional medicine analysis data with tei korea functional medicine field medicine that changes lifestyle and uses nutritional substances treat the cause the disease. also called alternative medicine that prevents the chronic disease promoting the physiological balance the human body unlike conventional medicines, which focused medication and treatment. functional medicine great help detecting early and treating diseases that may missed general health checkup through several biochemical tests. among various functional medicine fields, alphacon receives tma(hair tissue mineral analysis)) data from hospitals and clinics, which request tei korea analyze it, and distributes the data. tma method for examining various minerals and toxic heavy metals contained hair after collecting hair. the mineral generic term for few inorganic nutrients required for the human body. the hair accumulates three month worth mineral data generated metabolic activity while growing. the number korean hospitals and clinics conducting tma through tei korea over and the total number tma analysis data held tei korea amounts unlike the gene that tells the innate condition the body, functional medicine such tma plays role complement the deficient part the gene that indicates the current state the body. tei korea can also distribute big data related generated hair nutrition the alphacon platform when the individual wants. tei korea provides customized nutritional solutions according the results analysis for the individual who requests big data analysis hair nutrition test. with the tma test, tei korea widely known the best vitamin nutritional supplements company korea, which recognized doctors. currently, tei korea, which developing customized nutritional supplements based genetic test results together with healthcare, plans provide optimal nutritional supplements solution for customers who have completed genetic testing soon the development completed. herb cure, which manufactures and sells herbal-based functional foods, also provides optimized functional food solutions based each test result. life log data with healthcare life log data refers personal history results individual's actions collected and recorded through pcs mobile devices. rather than being specified classifiable form, literally made individual's life itself form data. the various life log data, alphacon plans primarily distribute collected data from iot scale devices. healthcare has sold selina, its iot scale brand. healthcare plans launch upgrade version selina for medical purpose, jointly developed one the top scale companies korea during the third quarter this year. life log data can monitored real time
