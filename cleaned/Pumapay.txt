pumapay white paper (c) decentralized vision. all rights reserved abstract motivation the pumapay vision motivation date, the dominant payment method for online well offline purchases has acceptance merchants mostly due their complexity usage and they not been payment cards (credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards, etc.). the problem support transactions that are more sophisticated than simple 'push' transaction. that payment cards were developed the 's, before the existence personal computers and the internet. they were originally designed for offline transactions, pumapay token economy where the customer approved transaction manually signing receipt. payment cards were not designed deal with our modern, fast-paced, global economy. their popularity mostly due lack acceptable alternatives for electronic payments. the technology payment card usage perpetuates anachronistic system, which suffers heavily from infrastructural inefficiencies. use cases the structure the payment cards' ecosystem very complex and consists there real need for payment infrastructure that built serve merchants, not exploit them. system that built from the ground for the digital era and that scalable, flexible and accessible payment cards, but without their inherent flaws and disadvantages. blockchain technology offers great opportunity create such system for the benefit merchants and consumers alike. pumapay protocol attempt design such infrastructure, which would have the potential grow into fully decentralized payment system. multiple participants: credit card associations (visa, mastercard, amex), issuing the pumapay token banks, acquiring banks, processors and payment gateways, name few. the market oligopolistic and the incumbent players each control their networks, token generation event token allocation development roadmap dictating the rules and the costs. this centralistic structure leads inefficiencies. there are several types payment cards that are managed and run specific similar many other centralized systems, the intermediaries the payment networks like visa, mastercard, and american express (amex). these include ecosystem use their power increase the spread between the value they extract multiple card types such credit, debit, pre-paid, and charge cards. payment and the value they add. the merchants that depend card acceptance for their gateways like paypal stripe and e-wallet systems such apple wallet and existence have comply with endless list rules dictated the owners google wallet are developed around payment cards. these networks. moreover, they are also subject complex fee structure that ranges from %-% their gross receipts, (depending the settings), and add team payment cards insult injury, they are also exposed the risks associated with fraudulent activity payment cards accommodate over global commerce. over billion cards transactions worldwide, visa cards alone generated worldwide and chargebacks. risk factors the introduction bitcoin electronic cash system was the first step towards modern online payment solution. bitcoin was originally designed resources address trust issues and optimize security, but the expense scalability, speed, and cost. result, bitcoin its current construct, unable offer flexible processing solutions for most the current online billing methodologies. ecosystem structure every card swipe tap triggers complex process, payment data generated and sent through intricate network stakeholders, each which charges fee for pushing the transaction through. these include: none the cryptocurrencies that were introduced over the past few years has card networks, which act central point that facilitates transactions between provided comprehensive payment solution that allows crypto holders utilize users and acquiring entities, while establishing the protocol that other parties their cryptocurrencies means payment. cryptocurrencies are far too engaged card processing are required follow. they also set interchange fees underdeveloped compete scale with payment cards, they suffer from poor (paid the issuer), ensure compliance with the rules and regulations they set, and worldpay global payment report november pumapay white paper (c) decentralized vision. all rights reserved abstract motivation the pumapay vision here's how this system works practice. buyer wants make usd resolve disputes with network members. acquiring banks provide merchants with access systems required accept card payments. they provide access payment terminals, processing services, and bank account into which settled funds can deposited. the technology credit card reader. the payment terminal reads the card and passes the data the acquiring bank, which requests the credit card network's authorization. turn, the card network communicates with the card issuing bank ascertain that there are issuing banks (which have issued the customers' debit credit cards) may either hold the deposits extend the credit associated with the account that the card pumapay token economy purchase. begin the transaction, the consumer runs the credit card through the tied to. enough funds available cover the amount the transaction. also investigates that the card isn't stolen and that there aren't any red flags hinder the payment. soon the issuing bank confirms the transaction, shares authorization code processors apart from providing different levels back-office support, the main purpose processors securely transfer payment data. with the card network, which passes the acquiring bank. after the acquirer sends the code back the merchant, authorization complete. all this takes place seconds, leaving the customer with impression finalized transaction. for use cases payment gateways work the same way, acting payment terminals and frontmerchants and acquirers. furthermore, payment gateways can benefit merchants the pumapay token token generation event token allocation development roadmap offering them additional services like analytics and reporting. batching and clearing msps (merchant service providers) and isos are intermediaries that sell payment processing batching and clearing funding processing services merchants, behalf acquirers and processors. customers make purchases structure payment card transaction batch sent acquirer merchant aggregates into batch acquirer sends batch correct card network acquirer sends transactions correct issuers credit card processing happens three stages. each them involves all players outlined above. let's take closer look the payment card ecosystem through team other parties, however, things aren't fast. end processors. services such stripe serve portal connecting e-commerce example usd purchase made customer. customers merchant batch acquirer/ processor card network issuing banks while the transaction may over from the customer's standing point, given that she's already out the store with her purchase, lot more going behind the risk factors processing batching and clearing scenes. the merchant has not received the money for the purchase yet. for that funding happen, all the individual transactions the day must grouped into batch and resources cleared. when the day ends, the batch containing all the day's transactions passed the consumer customer swipes card for magnetic stripe transaction merchant acquirer/ processor card network dyke, (august the payments ecosystem report. business insider, inc. issuing bank authorization request transaction authorized acquirer. when the acquirer receives the batch, requests payments behalf the merchant sharing the day's transaction history with the relevant card networks. the transactions are divided issuer and fund requests are sent the relevant banks. the payments ecosystem report, intelligence, august pumapay white paper (c) decentralized vision. all rights reserved abstract funding motivation flat fees addition transaction fees, merchants also pay various flat fees. these include terminal fees, payment gateway fees, pci fees, annual fees, processing batching and clearing incidental fees these fees are not fixed and are charged only per incident: collects interchange fees the pumapay vision collects assessment fees chargeback fee, batch fee, nsf fee, and more. looking the usd transaction, here are the fees collected various parties before the funds reach the merchant's account: the technology issuing banks card network acquiring bank merchant money starts change hands after the issuing bank receives request for funds. the requested amount then passed the acquiring bank through the card network, the pumapay token avs (address verification), vaf (voice authorization fee), retrieval request fee, charges markup fees pumapay token economy use cases monthly fees, monthly minimum fees, statement fees, network fees etc. funding after deducting interchange fee. there's another fee, taken the card network fee example fee usd transaction: fee example fee usd transaction interchange fees the issuing bank charges the interchange fee which usually percent the sale amount fixed transaction fee usd $.+$.=$. assessment fee the credit card network collects their assessment fee, which also percent the sale fixed transaction fee usd $.+$.=$. the payment processor, gateway and merchant bank take their share well. some may nominated percent the transaction some flat fee and some may combination both usd $.+$.=$. usd $.+$.=$. (an assessment fee). the remaining funds are passed the acquirer. lastly, the token generation event token allocation development roadmap acquirer subtracts 'markup fee'. the remainder then deposited the merchant's account. this process can take days and sometimes even weeks complete. notes: there are other types transactions such closed-loop transactions, debit card transactions, etc., but the basic mechanics illustrated above are enough for the understanding the complexity the transaction. markup fees transactions can settled real time well, not only batches. this approach has the advantage being faster, but also carries more risk and costlier for merchants. it's usually used e-commerce providers and merchants with high volume transactions. total team risk factors fees accepting payment cards comes with price and merchants are subject resources complex fee structure. there are nearly different fees and they can broadly divided into categories: transaction fees these are the fees the card-issuing banks and the credit card associations charge for each transaction, and they represent the largest expense that merchants incur. this category includes interchange fees which consist transfer the funds from the customers' account the merchants, well assessment and markup fees. the payments ecosystem report, intelligence, august keep things simple, did not take into account indirect fees such monthly fees, account maintenance fees, incidental fees etc. nonetheless, these fees may substantial. the merchant our example pays total its gross earnings all the parties involved processing the payment. this may not seem too painful first glance but remember this from the gross revenue. consider our merchant has net profit margin .%, such that from every usd sales takes home usd. suddenly the payment industry's usd chunk the sales becomes profits! ouch! pumapay white paper (c) decentralized vision. all rights reserved abstract pumapay protocol will offer merchants the advantages payment cards, without the associated costs, risks and hurdles. motivation the pumapay vision when cardholder disputes charge with their bank (the issuing bank), banks risks usually reverse the payment and refund the cardholder. this called chargeback. payment facilitators recover the chargeback funds from the acquiring bank the payment card processing exposes merchants various risks and fraud attempts. most fraud prevention features are designed for card-present environments. visa, pumapay token economy for example, has deployed several anti-fraud measures designed make card reproduction extremely difficult, including holograms and embossed security the technology characters the face the card. moreover, the signature and magnetic strip the back the card are designed verify the card-holders' identity. merchants are usually not liable for fraud when card-present transactions are properly authenticated. use cases the pumapay token token generation event token allocation online platforms, however, typically facilitate card-not-present (cnp) transactions (card payments made without physically swiping card). unfortunately, card-notpresent transactions are highly susceptible fraud and abuse, for which merchants since chargebacks may received weeks even months after the original transaction took place, sometimes difficult recover the funds from the merchant. protect themselves, acquirers may very conservative their underwriting: they will implement special policies such reserves holdbacks mitigate loss and may sometime require personal guarantees from business owners, whom they will hold personally liable for the business's financial obligations. card networks (visa, mastercard, etc.) set standards for chargeback ratios. for example, visa does not allow merchants exceed threshold chargebacks out all transactions any given month. exceeding this threshold will result online merchants and e-commerce sites, especially smaller merchants, are exposed termination the network and inability the merchant process payment cards rising wave card-not present (cnp) fraud. javelin strategy and the future. fines. crossing the threshold several months consecutively may lead account research study found that, the us, this fraud category's losses rose from found that, over the next five years, retailers are track lose billion usd cnp fraud losses globally. team merchants who generated them, and the acquirer recovers them from the merchant. and payment facilitators are not protected. losses are expected rise even more juniper research study development roadmap chargebacks minimize chargeback risks, merchants may deploy various tools and tactics, some offered payment processors other parties. while these may help reduce chargebacks, they come with the inevitable cost lost sales for falsepositive errors. merchants surveyed american express said they spent just over their budgets payment security. still, many merchants are not equipped risk factors resources hold off the cnp fraud wave. while established e-commerce providers like amazon, walmart, and target have ample budgets earmarked for security, smaller players are finding their dollars stretched too thin justify further security spending. card-not-present fraud may originate from various weaknesses and incompatibility payment cards the digital age such merchant identity theft, customer conclusion payment card processing elementary requirement for merchants. however, due the centralized structure the payment processing ecosystem, merchants are subject inefficiencies, exorbitant fees and substantial risks. identity theft friendly fraud, but they all pose one major risk for the merchant: pumapay pullpayment protocol was designed from the

pumapay pullpayment protocol allows merchants sell products and services while the idea pumapay make payments easy and transparent instalment basis. however, this puts the merchant potential risk not possible, inevitable that some disputes between merchants and consumers may being fully paid the customer. possible solution may include party credit arise from time time. arbitration companies will available solve commercial company setting service which allows assume the risks associated with disputes. such credit, thus ensuring uninterrupted, risk-free commerce. pumapay token economy the technology use cases arbitration company their pullcontract. once the purchase made, funds into integrate with such party extension service and allow customers pay off 'escrow' smart contract for set period time. within this timeline, the customer their purchases instalments. the credit company will handle all background may dispute the transaction. soon the dispute launched, the arbitration checks customers and manage the associated risks. possible implementation company freezes the funds and starts the dispute resolution procedure. may include the credit company setting special pull contract with scheduled instalment-based payments for the customer. soon customer reviews and approves the contact, the first instalment will pulled from their account and the the pumapay token payments will continue predefined schedule. the merchant will immediately receive the full amount for the purchase from the loan company and the purchase token generation event provide customers with security and reassurance, merchants may add the provide customers with more shopping options, merchants may choose will completed. with the clear dispute resolution policies and transparent communication, most disputes are expected settled within the shortest timelines, with the funds being released one party split between the parties, based the decision the arbitration company. the second party will able dispute the decision within the timelines and processes specified. there will also option take the case another mediator, should one the parties suspect any sort bias the decision. merchants are likely charged small fee for this kind service. token allocation development roadmap team risk factors smart contract management certification while some pullcontracts and

relatively centralised and relies the pumapay server. start using pumapay and accepting pmas means payment, the merchant would need register through the pumapay server receive api key. turn, the pumapay server would communicate with the merchant's sdk where the rules for the transaction would set. these rules would then translate into pullrequest targeting the client's wallet. able access the details the pullcontract available the wallet, the client would need scan code generated the merchant. the information contained the pullcontract compliant with the parameters set the client's wallet,
