developers community growth and operation community advisors token utilities and token distribution truechain decentralizing global asset transactions. background the rise global digital asset transactions over the past two years, there have been number public blockchains. each these blockchains adopts certain kind consensus. all wanted solve the impossible triangle problem and achieve efficiency, decentralization, security the same time. public chain that truly solves the impossible triangle problem could ultimately support potential large volume transactions digital assets worldwide decentralized financial infrastructure that totally independent centralized authorities and centralized trust. there are three trends that pay most attention to: the liquidation digital assets blockchain the tokenization and liquidation all financial assets and real estate assets blockchain enterprise applications blockchain these trends are providing real values public blockchains after the fall utility tokens. therefore, need public chain have following features: a.permissionless efficient, fast secure decentralized right gas model incentivize miner communities and token holder communities truechain building such public blockchain and the ecosystem around it. this whitepaper will brief consensus, architecture, incentive model, and truechain ecosystem. there are more details available web. for technical details, there yellow paper https://arxiv.org/ abs/.. for public chain developers, the github link https:// github.com/truechain. truechain's consensus and technology minerva hybrid consensus after the invention smart contract mechanism ethereum, there has been continuous evolution consensus technologies. the first stage was improve efficiency blockchain networks adopting protocols that use delegation reduce processing nodes. among these technologies, dpos was the most successful and mostly adopted. however, there fatal problem dpos chains the inability support decentralized trust ultimately, and the inevitable fate reduced centralized infrastructure. there are number trials invent consensus technologies that could solve the impossible triangle: casper roadmap that eventually transforms ethereum into pos public chain dags are consensus mechanisms that allow parallel processing transactions normally pow chain hybrid consensus way allow bft protocol work permissionless environment truechain adopts its own version hybrid consensus. hybrid consensus was firstly proposed research paper (https://eprint. iacr.org//.pdf) theory. truechain's core research team and core engineering team largely improved the original proposal and delivered the first working implementation. there are few key features minerva consensus: replaced nakamoto pow (traditional pow protocol) with fpow designed truehash, fundamentally asic-resistant algorithm designed working architecture pbft-fpow consensus protocol the fpow protocol eliminates selfish mining attack (a.k.a attack) and brings miners different hash powers the miner community. truehash makes asic mining hard. the pbft-fpow hybrid consensus achieves speed, decentralization and security. the architecture truechain below. truechain implemented double-chain structure (fast chain and snail chain). the block fast chain, which mainly contains the transactions and smart contracts, generated the bft committee when they reach consensus. similar ethereum block, fast block provides txhash, root, receipthash for other non-members verify transactions included fast block body. the block snail chain contains several fruits, and each fruit stamps the corresponding fast block. fruit hanged snail block, when fruit points fast block, the fruit stamps the fast block's hash and number it. every fast block has only one fruit stamp its hash and number. truebft pbft implemention truechain. the classical pbft assumes less than the participating nodes are corrupt. turebft assumes mildly adaptive adversary model improve the chain quality. the committee instance switched after fixed period time (with the snail chain logical clock). the members the next committee are chosen from fruit and block miners the current committee. truehash the mining algorithm for truechain and fundamentally achieving asic resistant algorithm.the implementation truehash set group which complex enough. the principle truehash's switching algorithm that the group elements will changed every thousand snail blocks and composed these snail blocks. because the hash value the block unpredictable advance, it's impossible for anyone know anything about the new algorithm. from the last cycle, the algorithm being invalidated, there only days total, makes sense produce asic such short period time. incentive model the ethereum block incentive model and gas model have been widely adopted for long time many public chains' designs. over the year utility tokens have been largely failing because most them are not backed valuable assets. other words, the value utility tokens are unsure and their economic models are generally not successful. for example, utility token with only economic model but revenue would fail miserably. therefore, public chains have support such asset backed tokens. the key this problem incentive model. the economic model eth has re-thought and new incentive model has proposed fulfill the needs valuable transactions. there recent article from truechain's research community stating the problem ethereum incentivization mechanism. https://www.reddit.com/ r/ethereum/comments/arsu/on_the_security_economics_of_public_ blockchains/ proper model has incentivize more hash power with larger onchain asset value order provide corresponding level security the network. therefore such incentive mechanism has build linkage between true token and the gross value assets being liquidated truechain. truechain planning implement three mechanisms. combined they form the new incentive model. allow tokens used gas fee token gas fees are distributed miner communities according miners' stake (true token days) and mining results (blocks and fruits successfully mined history) true token awards for successful block fruit mining governance truechain's goal governance ultimately establish decentralized governing model. the time truechain was founded, was contributed mostly the founding time. summer truechain foundation currently established board directors people). each the seven directors charge one part the foundation's governance research, core engineering, product development, developers community human resource, global token holders community, marketing and ecosystem building. together the board directors make strategic and managerial decisions. given the blockchain industry's fast pace, the foundation's board serving two purposes: risk control the decision making process encourage thorough understanding problems and improve decision quality there elected president for the board directors. the president's most important responsibility coordinate between each part the foundation's work and guarantee that truechain's strategies and plans are well executed. this president acting effective "ceo" the project, but re-elected every months. this governance model will last until truechain's mainnet supporting fairly large amount tokenized assets on-chain and true tokens are greatly distributed across large number holders worldwide. after that, truechain will enter the era totally decentralized governance. under decentralized governance model, truechain will form committee representatives that elected all true holders, and president will elected from the committee representatives all true holders. term limit will imposed both the committee and the president, with enforcement smart contracts truechain that transfers the rights using foundation funds the newly elected committee. ecosystem global developer community dapp development support truechain developer platform truechain's in-house product team has built developers' platform support deployment and management smart contracts. access is, link http://dev.truechain.pro/ trueglobal competitions trueglobal on-going, independent community effort support dapp developments truechain across the world. the first round trueglobal competition has finished jan with more than dapps submitted truechain's betanet. true holder communities over one year, there has been more than true holders worldwide. active communities are located east asia, south-east asia, mid-east, north america and europe. truechain has built network community nodes (a.k.a. contributors) each country. tools and dapps blockchain browsers: truescan, truelens; games:
