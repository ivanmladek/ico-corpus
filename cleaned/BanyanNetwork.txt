fusion value chain) dvn(data fusion value chain network) dpos(delegated proof stake) irc(introducing rewards contract) crc(cleaning rewards contract) apc(apply pay contract) tc(transaction contrac) api(application programming interface) hpb (high-performance blockchain) project background there have been widespread big data applications, and the era blockchain approaching. the common keyword big data and blockchain "distributed", representing the future fundamental change from technological authoritarianism and monopoly, decentralization. the data industry super industrial cluster with huge market potential. terms scale, data infrastructure services and automated transactions are tens billions; precision marketing/pan-regional marketing, bbn the name the token issued for this project. banyan network information verification, and business/government/personal/market consulting are hundreds billions, while the market size practical industry applications reaches the level one trillion. take programmatic marketing, classic product data applications, for example. the market size china was about billion yuan and reach billion maintaining compound annual growth rate for digital marketing, classic industry data applications, the market size china was about billion yuan and reach about billion yuan maintaining compound annual growth rate regarding the overall industry, the total revenue china's big data-related products and services was about billion yuan and expected break the -trillion-yuan mark the data industry also facing intuitive and obvious development bottleneck. terms data sources, the barriers entry into obtaining data are high, and data often incomplete and fragmented, and each data source can only provide part the available information;;there are large errors data with lack multiple data sources for correction, and thus difficult ensure accuracy. terms data products, the degree commercialization low, and connections are complex with standardized interface, making impossible measure the effectiveness banyan network single solutions. regarding data security, there lacks compliance system, making difficult trace data sources find pre-authorization. from the perspective the industry participants, the data volume, quality, and activity are the primary drivers big data values, while data connection, aggregation, and applications are the catalysts for big data values. currently, the issue isolated data islands has not been solved and data security control becoming more stringent. this double concern reflects serious topic that has long been troubling the industry the "data trust system" has not been established and indeed difficult build. via its features credibility, traceability, tamper resistance, and value sharing, the blockchain technology speeding its applications various fields. constructing the data value network based blockchain will pry open trillion-dollar big data market. from the perspective solvers industry bottlenecks, data openness, connectivity, and value flow require not only legal, institutional, and policy protection, but also strong solution that important and reliable carrier. under the scenarios big data applications with increasing focus transparency and security, the blockchain technology allows multiple nodes jointly participate data computation and recording and cross-check their validity, thereby making the data more banyan network trustworthy and more valuable. continuous growth and sequentially ordered blocks the chained data structure will reshape the ecology the data industry, becoming the future cornerstone the era the data economy. for the realization the value data integration, blockchains can not only help transmit and transfer data values but also establish the foundation for trusted data connections. the future, all participants the data industry will connected network where smart contracts smart assets are formed through contractual relationships, and the blockchain will become almighty ledger data value chains. based this foundation, access right confirmation data and commercialization data resources will depend this supporting technology, fitting development model sharing economy. the data value network based blockchain solve the above problems completely. one the core strengths dvn's decentralization avoid any illegitimate data copy, interception, storage, even modification. there would possibility theft weakening for the data value, thus greatly reducing the cost trust dvn for data sources. another advantage the breakthrough geographical and time constraints, maximizing the degree transparency, extendibility, and efficiency the banyan network participants, leading greater data liquidity and higher data values. therefore, artificial intelligence industry based dvn data will reborn. dvn will serve data provision infrastructure for artificial intelligence, supplying all the data sources, data service procurement, and high-performance distributed data processing capabilities meet the needs the application and development ai, providing adequate fuels for the future artificial intelligence. business structure there rather large gap between commercial data supply and data requirements. the data generally lack liquidity and integration, even the extent being isolated, illiquid, uncleansed and unprocessed such that their values cannot fully realized. dvn provides integrated value network framework for all participants the data industry, offering systematic solution connecting data requirements and data provision. dvn supports value-added products and service development for all stages the data value cycle, providing various fundamental customized support for each party more aggressively and actively participate the construction and optimization banyan network dvn, more efficiently promote the value gain. engine rising double helix: the dvn data value network has double helix structure "data stream" and "value stream". the "data stream" promotes data aggregation, connection, access, and coupling, while the "value stream", while the "value stream" promotes value mining, assessment, recording, and distribution. the "cross-section" forms closed-loop structure connecting data demand and data supply, while the "slice" forms exponential expansion structure that promotes value production and value acceleration, eventually forming engine that drives the big bang data value from the data contribution and value feedback all the participants the dvn. the link constructing the value network data value network dvn created meet the needs all the participants the data industry. through co-building values the business flow break the traditional distance between "data sources" and "industry applications" and applying links distributing nodes connect and integrate traditional data collection, cleansing, and integration (see figure below), lines data fusion value chain (dvc) are formed with multiple dvcs overlapping constitute borderless data value network (dvn) densely populated lines. banyan network the dvn, the parties are incorporated into unified data value ecology, and the interests all participants are ensured through the blockchain technology and supporting mechanisms.in the dvn, the parties are grouped into unified data security system employing the security multi-party computation (smc) framework protocol security and zero knowledge ensure the security and compliance data, records, and processes. dvn-collection dvn supports quick and easy access multivariate data order address access problems arising from differences storage methods and formats between different data sources supported data sources: government, financial institutions, operators, ecommerce providers, the internet, vertical industries, enterprises, individuals, etc. supported methods data collection from data sources: files, databases banyan network (relational databases, nosql databases, distributed databases, etc.), apis, data stream, ftp, crawlers, etc. supported data formats for parsing: text, json, xml, unstructured data, custom parsers, etc. dvn-cleaning for suspicious data well error values, missing values, and abnormal values data, dvn applies multi-level "cleansing" solve the problems data preprocessing and quality improvement through concatenating fields form formatted data. the process also includes data desensitization, data consistency checks, data quality assessment, etc. addition, virtual data governance positions are set attract organizations individuals get involved the process data quality. dvn-fusion dvn integrates multiple data sources achieve cross-data-source tag calculation and dimensionality expansion solve the problems multidata-source aggregation and integration. the data integration dvn achieves cross-data source tag calculation, complementing another data source with the feature data source, more fully describe the true properties the data. the same time, banyan network cross-validation multi-source data can performed further assess the data quality the data source and evaluate the data integration. the integrated data aggregated into multidimensional data cube for later use. dvn-dataapp dvn data applications adopt the formats data identification results, which are automatically encapsulated into different forms data application services. the calculated tag image data saved the format key-value, and the system imports into distributed database, providing api for external real-time queries. the data cube provides computing services for external batch jobs. supporting applications for the value network banyan score dvn has basic scoring system provide public rating service with standards, index systems, algorithms, publishing mechanisms, etc., for data sources, products, and services. banyan network banyan wormhole the dvn unified cleansing system provides services data categorization and sorting, defect detection, optimization algorithms, complementary rules, etc., quickly and efficiently standardize data packages and enhance usability. banyan taglib the dvn standard tagging system equipped with data tag access, matching, and association mechanisms, etc. and provides cross-source, multi-dimensional combination, and joint tag usage services, based data integration. ..banyanmaket the dvn open application market equipped with data supply recommendation, demand publishing, value matching, intermediate custody, etc., provide open application market based data integration. banyan security suite the dvn distributed security package equipped with data governance, process management, risk assessment, certification marks, etc., provide services data security control for all participants. banyan network technology foundation dvn supports lifecycle management for data applications in-depth combination big data technology and blockchain technology. all data the entire data lifecycle interacts with the dvn through the dvn api. after the dvn api receives data request, rewards, payments, etc. will written into the blockchain records through smart contracts. please see the sample technology architecture below: technologies involved the sample technology architecture are follows: crawlers, api, ftp, xdbc, streaming, and other protocols multidata interactions; banyan network distributed file systems such hdfs and distributed databases such hbase; tool sets such the hash algorithm, data clean box, etc.; data mining algorithms such decision trees, random forests, logical regression, clustering, machine learning, etc.; big data platforms and tools such apache kylin, presto, impala, sparks, etc. theoretical framework three laws data value and the embedded parameters the value data reflected the application, and only via circulation and practical uses can the value data realized. through validation mature business models, "three laws data value" are summarized: first law: data silence accelerates devaluation; second law: data circulation produces values; third law: integrated data promotes value added. the above laws, denote data value timeliness related the age data data liquidity dy, and data integrability parameter data quality data quality developed considering current international standards (such iso) and relevant parameters national and industry banyan network standards, reflecting the order, consistency, accuracy, and integrity data. parameter data quality data liquidity related the frequency which the data processed, traded, circulated, and applied. among them, processing, trading and circulation can change the data value (v) and quality (q); the frequency application categorized according industry experience the number and level data uses, which can expressed the following function:: dy=f(dv, dq, fq) data liquidity and integrability data integrability related the degree interconnectivity and association between different data sources, and the value equal the dimension actual association the data chain. data timeliness data age reflects the data timeliness and related time the data generation, time tdq data cleansing and organizing that lead changes data quality, time tddy data processing, trading, and circulation that lead changes data liquidity, and time tdf which data integration occurs. the specific function follows: a=f(t,tdq,tddy,tdf) banyan network ,where the longer the data generation time the worse the data timeliness and the older the data age the longer the times tdq, tddy, and tdf, the worse the data timeliness. data value function according the above definition, data value can expressed the following function: v=f(q,dy,f,a) where proportional dy, and and inversely proportional decision mechanisms for the definition data parameter functions definitions and values the data quality parameters (see .), (see depend the consensus token holders (see .). rules for the tokens introduction the tokens dvn token (bbn) token that provides support for the banyanchain. its usage scenarios include data access bonuses, data cleansing rewards, data usage payments, etc. banyan network token details the purpose the bbn issuance encourage developers and users the ecosystems enhance the quality, degree integration, and data availability across the entire network, fundamentally promoting the regulation and positive development the data industry, providing solid support and protection for the final data applications. dvn, many practical problems are solved blockchain features, e.g. traceability and tamper resistance for data cleansing, integration, and product delivery. namely, there are lot strong cases where bbn consumption needed. for example, participants use bbns all stages data governance and commercialization participate registration and top-up. rewards are also paid bbns for the completion data governance and product processing. therefore, the prosperity data industry the support for the value bbn. circulation model the banyanchain has design complete set bbn circulation mechanism with rich bbn usage scenarios, ensuring bbn liquidity through series intelligent contracts. introducing rewards contract (irc): responsible for calculating and confirming the reward for the introduction data from data sources data the banyanchain form data products and services. after they have banyan network been used, certain amount reward distributed the data source accordance with the proportion defined the governance committee. computing rewards contract (crc): responsible for calculating and confirming the reward for the participants data governance. the payment certain deposit (deposit) required for application data governance obtain certain number rights for data processing and optimization. the processing tools are provided the banyanchain, while the nodes provide only computing resources. after the data has been used, certain amount reward will distributed the data governor according the ratio established the governance committee. the specific function follows: deposit =f(v) where the data value upon the deposit reward=f(dv,time) ,where the increase data value after processing. the data governor unable finish data governance within the promised time, the deposit will confiscated (to prevent the data source from being occupied for long time without governance). apply pay contract (apc): responsible for the calculation and confirmation payment data users after using the data service. the specific payment amount shall implemented accordance with the standards established the governance committee. banyan network transaction contract (tc): responsible for calculating and confirming the cost data governance and fees for the use products. addition, with richer and richer usage environments data governance, there may more and more positions and scenarios. therefore, not rule out the possibility adding other contracts during the process system operation. holding and weighted voting rights anyone who holds bbn can obtain voting rights getting mortgage the token. voting rights are positively correlated the number mortgages and mortgage time. the governance the governance committee includes, but not limited to, the introduction and termination data sources, data valuation, data governance rewards, payment schemes for data usage, etc. these adjustments can decided group voting the governance system. governance mechanism underlying operation the underlying blockchain dvn based ethereum and operated public, because the most mature platform that supports smart contracts, and the community active and the foundation works well. banyan network not rule out the use antshares, hpb, and other independently developed technologies the future. smart contracts aim develop generic smart contract templates for the business models and processes that have strong commonalities the network used uniformly the vast majority business scenarios dvn. also plan develop smart contract repository with special tags for specific categories subsequent additions, distribute announcements, expand dynamically, and efficiently operate with flexible configurations. consensus mechanism any data dvn, the introduction, governance, processing, use and the associated reward, and payment and other token circulation, are done through the dpos consensus mechanism for recording and writing. tripartite model adopt tripartite model network co-governance, including dvn, decentralized governance committee, and participant ensure the operation the entire value system through operation mechanism with reasonable, appropriate, and limited distribution rights. among them, the governance committee responsible for "rule developing and the participant responsible for "rule execution", while the dvn charge banyan network "rule operation"(as shown the figure below) technology applications blockchain applications current mainstream digital tokens, including bitcoin and ether, are based blockchain their core technology ensure verification currency transaction records, tamper resistance, and de-centralization block validation storage. dvn token (bbn) also uses blockchain the technological support for its circulation. addition ensuring security, trustworthiness and convenience the token the circulation transaction, also allows the bbn users establish confidence market demand, giving bbn opportunity circulate large volumes and preserve value even appreciate like major digital tokens bitcoin and ether. banyan network applications artificial intelligence artificial intelligence based the mainstream method deep learning hot area for high value-added applications big data. also useful tool for big data collection, cleansing, and integration. dvn the one hand will use mature data material foundation for "training" artificial intelligence develop applications various fields into market products. the other hand, uses simulate the manual data collection, cleansing, and integration processes performed data engineers, and aim develop automated tools packages implement the tasks described above, thereby improving process efficiency and significantly reducing leakage, security risks, and other human negligence arising from human factors during data processing. acknowledgements the design and development the bbn network rely not only the core team's deep understanding and insight the data industry but also the support and trust from key customers, partners, and industry organizations, well contributions from engineering experts and industry veterans the fields blockchain and artificial intelligence. here would like express our sincere gratitude all the past contributors who have participated the technology, business, and management dvn and those resource contributors who are participating the model, platform, funds, etc., the bbn issuance. look
