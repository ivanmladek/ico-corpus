provides distributed ledger technology (dlt) enabling enterprise-ready network security, scalability, confidentiality, and performance, modular blockchain architecture. the basic workflow transaction the proposed bezant blockchain: assumption: user has downloaded client and registered with organization (channel) client initiates transaction proposal and sends this multiple peers the channel; endorsing peers verify (sign) the proposal transaction and submit the client client sends endorsed proposals orderer transaction; an orderer receives proposed ledger updates concurrently from many different applications the network particular channel and packages these into blocks; the final phase the transaction workflow involves the distribution and subsequent validation blocks from the orderer the peers, where they can applied the ledger. membership orderer (organization channel) packages and orders transactions blocks) distribution for validation registration and authentication end user (application sdk) .sends orderer initiate proposal respond with verified proposal peers peers (endorsing and committing) (endorsing and committing) ledger chaincode state ledger chaincode state identity authentication service (ias) the bezant blockchain based private and permissioned network, therefore identity authentication service will required. rather than open system that allows unknown identities participate the network (requiring protocols like proof work validate transactions and secure the network), the end users the bezant network must enroll through identity authentication service (ias). the bezant blockchain's key role will provide partners the ability accommodate vast number unique users multiple channels simultaneously accessing the blockchain. request partner reg/auth reg/auth bezant blockchain request partner user client (application) the client sdk for authentication and communication and required for access the bezant blockchain. represents the entity that acts behalf end user. must connect peer for communicating with the blockchain. the user client can request transactions, execute queries, and retrieve specific data. the user client will use api support android, ios and environments. peers blockchain network formed from peer nodes, each which can hold copies ledgers and copies smart contracts. peer host for ledgers and chaincodes therefore, applications interact with peers access resources. peer also receives state updates the form blocks from the orderers and maintains the state and the ledger. orderers orderers form block sorting the validated transactions from the client and responsible for distribution throughout the blockchain. this the only cluster-based service provided the blockchain and provides for continuous and uninterrupted service. the bezant blockchain service does not require mining public blockchain, deals with real-time transactions based trusted users. therefore, can deal with significantly higher throughput and lower fees (or fees) than existing cryptocurrency blockchain protocols such bitcoin and ethereum. bezant service platform bezant chain bezant platform bezant scan wallet service dapp

will increase the bezant network partners grows. the bezant blockchain will provide multiple authentication services for each user and will create multiple channels help ensure that there are security problems. the key attribute the bezant blockchain service will efficient processing. since the blockchain based permissioned network, all participants are known and trusted, therefore, fewer levels trust and verification are required across node types, and network scalability and performance are optimized. jehmi wallet jehmi wallet payment wallet that end users will interface with and will
