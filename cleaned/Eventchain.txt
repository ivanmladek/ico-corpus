blockchain token network that powers unique smart contract ticketing system (smarttickets(tm)). eventchain solves many the problems with current event ticketing systems available today while providing the additional benefits using blockchain the foundation. both the eventchain system and its tokens ("evc tokens") encourages everyone the ecosystem, including all stake holders such event managers sport and concert events, party organizers, social clubs and ticket purchasers sell buy smarttickets using evc tokens and other traditional payment methods. eventchain will provide simple user interface for event managers manage and execute smartticket sales globally for small large events supported the underlying blockchain technology and evc tokens, empowering true peer-to-peer network for buying and selling tickets events. eventchain has the opportunity becoming the first real world blockchain application that widely adopted the general public without any need understand the underlying distributed technology. decentralization eventchain will develop decentralized modular smartticketing network upheld peer-topeer platform. centralized event ticketing infrastructure vulnerable malicious attacks and single points failure. selling smarttickets and processing transactions the decentralized eventchain token network built the ethereum blockchain, everything secured -bit cryptography that will protect from fraud and prevent malicious attacks against the network. mission statement eventchain's mission to: solve long list issues for event ticket sales providing the advanced functionality smarttickets using evc tokens. see following sections for details. provide holders evc tokens with benefits such early bird tickets, priority seating and discounted pricing. foster the utilization evc tokens inside the eventchain smartticketing platform. although eventchain will utilize various payment gateways that accept evc tokens purchase products and services from over vendors across different countries, all significant ticketing benefits will available only those using evc tokens. page interaction with the ethereum blockchain eventchain's ethereum blockchain backbone provides the necessary framework implement scalable, fast, and cryptographically secure smartticket transactions. the system will utilize smart contracts the underlying technology for the creation smarttickets, harnessing the functional power evc tokens proof-of-purchase. eventchain's ticketing platform can operate with fiat currencies; however, the smartticket utility optimized when using evc tokens. smarttickets act proof-of-purchase for any event, containing enforceable pre-set conditions programmed into the ticket's underlying smart contract code using ethereum's native programming language solidity. these conditions can tailored store immutable information for any type event imaginable. implementing eventchain's blockchain token network for event management presents the opportunity upgrade the current event ticketing industry faster transactions, indisputable ticket vouchers, transparency from event hosts and fully programmable functions using evc tokens. the ethereum network provides decentralized, turing complete, virtual machine capable running multitude dapps, decentralized applications, including smart contracts, token systems, distributed file and data storage and the creation decentralization autonomous organizations (daos). anyone can implement smart contracts solve any computational problem, implementing logic from other programming languages and translating enforceable contracts solidity []. ethereum the ideal foundation for eventchain's smartticket system. payment processing event goers can purchase smarttickets directly the eventchain network through variety payment gateways. ideally, evc tokens will used primarily for smartticket purchase but other erc tokens including ether ("eth") may also accepted. event managers will also have the capability accept fiat currency for smartticket sales through payment gateways. eventchain will utilize various payment gateways that accept evc tokens purchase products and services from over vendors across different countries. payment gateways convert the evc tokens real time the vendor's currency. page smartticket computational costs blockchain costs are limited variable "gas" fee the ethereum network. gas exists only inside the ethereum virtual machine and calculated based the amount work being performed inside transaction. for larger and more complex smarttickets (in terms the amount work needed compute the programming the underlying smart contract) the gas fee will higher. the ethereum blockchain currently averages only few cents per transaction, significantly lower than credit-card and bitcoin transactions. centralized event industry the major event ticketing companies today run billion dollar industry monopolistic fashion. the majority the ticket sales are facilitated ticketmaster, consistently driving prices higher than the original ticket price and forcing ticket purchasers abide their rules while offering available alternatives. the current business practices encapsulate capitalist mentality that adds little value the event experience, yet hoards disproportionate share the profits. countless numbers event goers have waited for tickets sale, only have them soldout nearly instantly scalpers bots which resell them for outrageous mark-up prices, top the already ridiculous service charges. ticket companies even sell directly the secondary market, shifting the profits from scalpers back themselves and extorting event goers instead addressing and fixing the problem. many artists have attempted wage wars with ticket service provider giants the past, only fold. with the arrival eventchain, are putting the power back the hands event goers adding level transparency event ticketing that rivals current big business event management options. three the biggest companies the centralized event-ticketing industry are: eventbrite eventbrite charges service fee and per ticket sold, plus another the ticket price for processing payments, all dollars. other currencies, the fees are per transaction []. while these charges are typically less than that ticketmaster's infamous "convenience" fee, they are still unnecessarily high. eventbrite's centralized platform hosts around million events per year and processes average million tickets each week. page ticketmaster/live nation ticketmaster's current monopolistic domination the ticketing industry produced billion revenue [], with the majority coming from convenience fees, processing fees and transaction fees. many cases, these "convenience" fees are unavoidable and there alternative because ticketmaster prohibits alternative purchasing methods. stubhub stubhub owned ebay and went from providing small service buy and sell tickets for events the resale-market, running international ticketing marketplace. they take commission fee from each ticket purchase. stubhub's fourth quarter gross merchandising volume was billion and has grown year-over-year []. page ticket industry issues addressed eventchain will provide solutions for the following issues the event ticketing industry: ticket issues counterfeit tickets are created and sold for events. finite amount immutable smarttickets will available for each event and are tied event's smart contract. each smartticket has unique nonce, unique sequence number that makes impossible sold multiple times counterfeited the network. proof ownership can verified through the ethereum blockchain implementing zero-knowledge proofs whereby purchaser can prove ownership their ticket without revealing any information besides the fact the ticket theirs. tickets are often hard resell with undeniable proof that the ticket authentic original ticket. eventchain can seamlessly transmit tickets through the blockchain anyone for gifting reselling. smarttickets have the ability maintain data the form smart contract code and can interpreted through the eventchain oracle, smartticket resold all the original ticket information still embedded eventchain's framework. resale issues allegations event ticket vendors and resellers scalping their own tickets and then reselling them for much mark-up their own subsidiary platforms are not uncommon. smarttickets are fully programmable, enabling smart contract code that can peg tickets permanent price, designate maximum markup value, attribute any other individual group ticket pricing variables both the primary and secondary markets. prevent massive ticket purchases from scalpers, event ticket distribution options can tailored with any custom range the amount tickets available single users groups, and optional constraints that allow for alternative distribution methods. ticket scalpers deceive purchasers into buying re-sale vip tickets outrageous prices, but not qualify them for vip features because the tickets are vip ineligible under resale terms. page eventchain will have integrated ticket resale reputation system, allowing event ticket vendors and resellers build and grow their reputation they sell smarttickets. scalpers will clearly identified their smartticket reputation. other issues pre-sale ticket offerings are often not transparent. using the ethereum blockchain foundation brings higher level transaction accountability, scalability and fungibility the event ticketing industry than any existing centralized ticketing architecture available. the eventchain network the blockchain brings complete transparency all parties involved. event ticket services opt-in ticket purchasers into unnecessary subscriptions media and marketing material deceptive manner during the ticket purchasing process. where eventchain will not lend themselves deceptive tactics, smarttickets underlying smart contract code fully programmable and smarttickets could created fully transparent manner incorporate add-ons like food and drink, parking, draws, merchandise credit and any combination products services. website issues large volumes ticket purchasers can simultaneously flood event ticket sales website when tickets are released and often overload and crash ticket system. because eventchain's transaction framework decentralized, the purchasing tickets will not limited eventchain's website and mobile applications. eventchain will develop ticket purchasing interface that can distributed unlimited number websites, all selling tickets through plugin, dispersing traffic from centralized server, avoiding potential crashes and allowing significantly more people buy tickets simultaneously. event ticket services have been affected ddos attacks against their domain name servers, crashing their websites the time ticket purchasing. the eventchain distributed platform will pull information from the ethereum blockchain and verify through validating nodes distributed globally. distribution protects the network incentivizing positive behavior and eliminating single points attack. page eventchain features eventchain oracle eventchain's oracle will set-up push and pull data from smart contracts alleviate computational stress from the ethereum virtual machine and will communicate through integrated eventchain plugin, distributable across the web for access ticket purchases and interaction with the smarttickets system. data analysis smartticket meta-data about event related information can used for statistical analysis. for example, event creators can forecast future ticket sales using variables like the quantity smarttickets sold for each event, how many were initially available and how quickly they sold and what prices. this information recorded real-time the amount smarttickets remaining upcoming public events transparent for everyone see. forwarding contracts when rsvp deposit partial payment for event needed, eventchain will utilize "forwarding smart contracts" where transactions can initialized and the terms are guaranteed the smartticket system, enforceable until the event completed whenever the custom timestamp expires. smartticket digital collection each smartticket purchaser will have access permanent record which events they attended based their transaction history displayed through the eventchain transaction framework the eventchain oracle, creating digital collection ticket stubs and literal "chain events" recollect memories over and share with friends and family social media. these extra features incentivize the adoption the smartticket platform. the network grows, will the utility the evc tokens for operation and value added features. page leadership team the
