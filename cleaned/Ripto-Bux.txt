ripto bux ($rbx) ripto bux summary: ripto bux $rbx non-ico (initial coin offering), dual-blockchain asset/token that has been issued the waves and ethereum blockchains. swappable upon command utilizing incent blockswap technology. the native currency the waves asset tip-bot. the total supply ripto bux ($rbx) ,,, (one billion) and non-reissuable asset. functions: asset/token $rbx will serve the following functions: $rbx aims the primary tipping asset/token the waves-asset tipbot. [the tip-bot proprietary tool integrated into slack channels that allow users easily transact $waves and waves assets through simple commands. time publishing, installed waves, incent, and cryptocopia slacks.] $rbx will distributed newly created tip-wallets rate $rbx per new wallet. this automatic distribution will allow new users immediately participate tipping other community members without the need supply their own asset/token any up-front capital. (this distribution subject change depending availability.) ancillary benefits using $rbx the primary tipping asset/token are transferring real value and increasing the transaction rate the $waves network, which turn rewards those who stake utilizing pos (proof stake) and/or lpos (leased proof stake). the second function $rbx will provide new projects and their corresponding token (or core token), known from here out $xyz, with immediate exchange rate and price floor. this will achieved through negotiations with the yet-to-be released projects and tokens, and will result $rbx/$xyz pairing. this allows both parties have control portion the other's supply immediate collateral. then, through matching services, $rbx/$xyz pairing will appear the waves dex reasonable, consistent price. this will facilitate early trading volume, easy buy access, and will establish price ratio for $xyz token calculable referencing the current $rbx/$waves rate. ripto bux ($rbx) liquidity value creation: with the support the waves community, $rbx will able act intermediary asset/token separately from $waves and $btc. one the drawbacks transacting $waves and $btc that the end user may expect that either currency will rapidly increase value, which case they may choose remain holding their token, and forego transacting all together. this manner price speculation not useful terms facilitating currency liquidity. $rbx holders should feel ease transacting $rbx its value derived not from speculation, but its ubiquitous accessibility through measured distribution and the $rbx/$xyz pairs that traders will have access when trading with $rbx. this derivation value differs from other assets/tokens that does not stem from speculation future price increases. combination utilizing the waves-asset tip-bot and automatic airdrops, coupled with the ability trade newly created tokens $rbx/$xyz pairing will facilitate liquidity confer real value the $rbx asset. distribution breakdown: the $rbx supply will distributed, free charge its recipients, during multiple intermittent airdrops $wct holders, $waves holders, and $rbx holders respectively. the first airdrop was swap the form credit all accounts holding "old ripto bux" fixed ratio this airdrop took place february th, the second airdrop took place march th, and rounded out the first million distribution. the third airdrop took place march th; million $rbx were distributed. future airdrops will structured such that $rbx distributed, weighted amounts, $waves holders, $wct holders, and $rbx holders. airdrops intended for further supply distribution will occur dates yet established. ripto bux ($rbx) the $rbx supply will used purchase new tokens and assets bulk rate. this will create early price floors for these newly announced projects and their corresponding tokens. after this exchange made, $rbx/$xyz trading pair will appear the dex, and market making for the new token will occur, denominated $rbx. this will particularly helpful for assets that have difficulty being listed centralized exchanges, are non-ico community origin establish valuation and some liquidity. the $rbx supply will transferred the ethereum blockchain make easier for ethereum user access the $rbx token. these tokens will also integrated into ethereum-based $rbx token contract applications. the $rbx supply will listed exchange, centralized decentralized, order create early and steady price point. the funds generated from the listing $rbx will towards the creation dedicated $rbx full node matching services for trading $rbx its asset/token pairings. the $rbx supply will reserved slush fund for rewarding contributors the project, potential reserve trading pair collateral, additional airdrop, etcetera. the $rbx supply will reserved for the creator $rbx, and for developer assistance. the benefits dual issuance: ripto bux able exist two blockchains once utilizing incent's blockswap technology. through this capability, $rbx able take advantage the unique properties offered each blockchain. $rbx the waves blockchain will better able perform it's role tradingpair token the platform's easy use dex. additionally, transference the $rbx token will easier the waves blockchain has quick block times minute.) $rbx issued the ethereum blockchain will have access smart contract technology that, yet, not present waves platform. this opens many possibilities for future implementations and potential use cases for $rbx, some which have already begun development.
