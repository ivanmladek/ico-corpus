"the highest good, then which there higher, god, and consequently immutably good, hence truly eternal and truly immortal." saint augustine, from the book "de natura boni", circa c.e. adapting this sentence the current social, economic, political and psychological realities mankind and relating the actual technological field would obtain: "the highest good, then which there higher, blockchain, and consequently unchangeable good, hence truly eternal and truly immortal." vision and core features ipsx the first truly decentralized sharing marketplace, which will create global marketplace for ips. combined with flexible tools (sdks and apis), aid entrepreneurs and developers fully secured and transparent environment develop new applications top the already existing ips the ipsx sharing platform. will become framework and marketplace for new applications that require ips their backbone (vpn providers, data mining software, web crawling bots, micro tasks, etc.). data said the new resource our times. the backbone data mining, large volumes ips are required for the actors involved the mining process able perform tasks. substantially lowering the price ips and solving the ips accessibility and availability problems, ipsx aiming become key building ecosystem for all the fields that require larger smaller www.ip.sx volumes ips and allowing complex applications from data mining and other fields become more accessible everyone. ipsx connects actors peer-to-peer network, enabling both data center owners and individual users, that will called "providers" rent ips other users, that will called "requesters". the ips can used complete different tasks requiring one more ips from different locations. today, addresses are valuable assets with low liquidity level due the fact that there not simple solution share/rent ips based specific list filters and resources are supplied centralized providers which are constrained closed networks, proprietary payment systems, and many other restrictions. ipsx core built-in feature set dedicated ethereum-based transaction system, which enables direct payments between requesters and providers, solving all the above mentioned problems, increasing the liquidity the ips and allowing any actor that has his internet connected device, take part into multi-billion yearly business, that otherwise would closed home internet users. ipsx function, the backbone distributed market place for ips, can considered infrastructure-as-a-service (iaas), and also platform-as-a-service (paas). however, ipsx will reveal its true potential adding dedicated software integrations the ecosystem that will built top the existing ips and that can use the ips the ipsx platform. any interested party free create and deploy software the ipsx marketplace using the sdks and apis that will provided the ipsx ecosystem. fig. ipsx ecosystem representation www.ip.sx background how all started sergiu draganus along with some other friends created georanker (www.georanker.com), data mining platform focused local seo reporting instruments, that connects servers from more than different locations and retrieves live ranking data from google, yahoo, bing, yandex, youtube real time. one the major activities that followed from georanker initial business model was custom data mining for different clients from all over the world and, later on, the business model included also sharing and renting, based requests that came from our different type business partners. some the major problems encountered during the data mining processes, rental and sharing processes, among others, were low liquidity level, good quality and high prices for ips (in order obtain good price/ip huge volumes ips need rented purchased from different providers). based the increasing demand ips from the georanker platform clients, the impossibility satisfy all the requests, combined with the blockchain technology and capabilities, the ipsx concept was born july and developed initially multiple brainstorming sessions the georanker team members. that time, the team was already composed multiple blockchain early adopters, evangelists and enthusiasts, all came natural creating the ipsx concept. introduction there are about bln internet users and bln iot devices connected internet according gartner. what all them have common above other things, are: high speed cpus memory chips internet protocol addresses called ips. there huge need remote usage which results market over bln usd with yearly growth rate. remote usage popular among end user consumers to: improve privacy and security access geo-blocked services media bypass national and corporate restrictions. remote usage popular among business providers for building: vpn applications data mining; security layers other micro tasks. www.ip.sx the success such project already proven the tor project among end users, which currently has over daily users. main problems tor and other similar projects are: -liabilities you might have problem when sharing your -no revenue/ economy behind the sharing/ renting processes, which generates the next problem -bandwidth and speed quality -not usable for business and service providers. solution: sharing exchange (ipsx) blockchain based system fully automated, with full clearing utility tokens associating the price and distribution, based offer and demand for ips. first level: you will able share your device's address data center share full range unused ips order win real-time ipsx tokens safe way. (all connections will logged the blockchain). client you would able access, real time, ips from all around the world and use them for short period times, seconds whole month. second level: will create framework and marketplace and allow any business and service providers build custom made applications that require large volume ips based our sdk and apis. vpn provider, you would able integrate your system with our sdk let your clients choose from millions ips from all around the world. ipsx ecosystem the ipsx business model and use cases will fully benefit from all the advantages the relatively new technological advances. the market for sharing can now organized entirely new system and principles, and moving from centralized and hard solutions rent/share ips fully decentralized and fully automated system renting/sharing ips. the moment, the sharing market only accessible few large players that understand and its needs, and that also have the technical solutions rent/share ips. with the advancement the blockchain technology, everyone can take part into multibillion yearly business and provide their support decentralized economy and generate revenue safe and easy environment. www.ip.sx actual problems addresses are valuable assets with low liquidity level due the fact that there not simple solution share rent ips based specific list filters. below will present some projects and solutions that approached this direction far: tor free software project, famous for introducing the idea onion routing wider audience. this system, users download global list relays and exit nodes, randomly select from that list, and form onion routes from their selection. some the problems faces: high lags because there are rewards for sharing ips internal economy liabilities (you don't know what actions the users are doing using your address). virtual private networks (vpns) use encryption securely transport vpn subscriber's traffic across larger insecure network. once the vpn has received the traffic, decrypted and retransmitted across different large insecure network. the retransmission can assist users circumventing access restrictions imposed websites, and, lesser extent, reduce the tracking their website browsing habits. encryption prevents the user's isp from seeing their traffic. some the problems faced the vpn providers are: -limited number ips from geolocations where the demand high, thus leading the impossibility for some users access different services (too many users use the same and the banned restricted) -the end users are required pay full month price even they need the service for only couple minutes hours. the process sharing difficult from the perspective matching specific need with the offering. clients for sharing have different needs, such as: rental time frame number ips geolocation www.ip.sx usage scope usage protocols http/smtp/vpn etc. costs usage/duration contractual costs micropayments. providers also face different problems: -bc making money sharing phone/tablet/isp technical solution -finding clients for specific classes marketing issues -bb difficult build portfolios with different classes renting for short periods time -contractual costs micropayments -liabilities. solution the use blockchain technology advantages: -integrate cross platform clients -create marketplace where the request will meet the offer for services -sharing renting ips using custom filters time frame price geolocation protocol manage micropayments using eth protocols and smart contracts -record all "transactions" (ip shares owner/ client) the blockchain. our vision: ipsx and web the moment, internet users, are being restricted different ways, are not allowed use services and applications due censorship employed various groups interests from all over the world. all this comes many forms. nation states monitor the internet traffic, they can construct different profiles their citizens. such context, dissent becomes dangerous, and honest political discord some places impossible. very similar way, internet service providers and content providers have become unstoppable and restless their objective monitor, track and profile every user across the internet. the daily internet activity, communications and behavior every user are gathered and sold advertisers and basically anyone willing buy them. such transactions occur with little conscious consent from users and with complete disregard and lack respect for any notion personal privacy. access content being restricted its content providers certain areas due intellectual property limitations purely because low valuation users from some particular locations. don't condemn anyway the current system and its position. however, the actual context and the new economy model that rises, believe that this system old and unfair many actors inside it, and the time change now. www.ip.sx believe that the future economy and internet will fully distributed network, enabling users and actors from all sectors securely and directly exchange content, without sharing with corporations other middlemen and party service providers. this direction, ipsx allows all the actors participate the internal economy the ecosystem and provides way supporting the decentralized vision, shared economy and generating revenues. course, will support and encourage the development other technologies, many which have gained significant traction recent years. better data-sharing technologies are necessary, and order allow data sharing open and censorship free environment, the ips are required, the backbone internet protocols. taking into account the ongoing development ipfs, swarm and other solutions, the time for fully decentralization seems within reach. eventually, the blockchain networks will become more scalable, more efficient, and will include fully functional network micropayment channels. the iot devices will become easier integrate and communicate with, and larger volume ips will available, thus allowing free internet. this concept free internet not only mean terms upfront payment, but also free all the restrictions, censorships, privacy thieves and sensitive, personal information data buyers. ipsx will provide the easiest way for users from all over the world help the internet becoming fully decentralized and free the actual less fair interests different actors, sharing ips easy and totally transparent way among worldwide users and providing the fuel truly decentralization for the internet. fig. internet traffic/month area location technical approach this section the technical approach will presented. however, the more detailed technical specifications will released design documentation that currently under construction the technical team. www.ip.sx actors actor the ipsx system represented trio which consists of: human/bot administrator the device that uses the ipsx system for offering requesting ips. the lender the called "provider" and the user the called "requester"; java application/api that acts interface with the ipsx system. the java application will built for all platforms and mobile devices and will run client the end user's (actor) device; third-party vpn application which used instantiate vpn connections. according his role instance, user one the two types: "provider" user user who provides list ips placing offer orders and instantiating vpn server once deal done. "requester" user user who benefits from list ips placing request orders and instantiating vpn client once deal done. the identification data user consists its unique ipsx wallet address. other words, user represented the system his ipsx wallet address. the ipsx utility token will standard erc token issued ethereum blockchain, any ethereum account can used identification data (id). structure description: system layers: ipsx system operates three technological layers: the ethereum layer, the centralizer smart contracts will manage the wallets, the profiles, the token balances. also, are analyzing the micro raiden protocol for micropayments this layer. the application layer, the ipsx java app will implement the user interface and the communication/synchronization with the centralizer smart contract and the vpn application and will also arrange the matching process and the deals. moreover, this ipsx java app will ensure the management the service layer constant communication the ipsx pair channel between the partners the deal. the service layer, the vpn app third-party application used instantiate vpn connections between the actors. www.ip.sx logical components the centralizer smart contract: wallet (id) manages the ipsx token balance the users and has list records with the following structure: the ipsx wallet address the user balance the number ipsx user-owned utility tokens that are available his use for placing request orders just for simple transfers reserved the number ipsx user-owned tokens that are reserved for ongoing deals and future payments and that are not available him defined moment for any other operations. java application components: profiles manages the user profiles and has list records with the following structure: the ipsx wallet address the user info complex data structure that stores information about the user, including his rating and general preferences/ settings/ criteria/ history. order book manages the offer/request orders received from users via the ipsx java app. has two main components, namely the offer orders list (ool) and the request orders list (rol). the offer orders received from the providers will recorded the ool and the request orders received from the requesters will recorded the rol. both ool and rol have the following structure lists records: the ipsx wallet address the user who placed the order order the details the order. deal book manages the deals between users. more precisely, manages the deals between provider who placed offer order and requester who placed request offer the context previously identified matching between these orders. has list records with the following structure: providerid the ipsx wallet address the user who placed the offer order and will play the role provider the service level (in other words, the ipsx wallet address the "provider" user) requesterid the ipsx wallet address the user who placed the request order and will play the role requester the service level (in other words, the ipsx wallet address the "requester" user) deal the details the deal i.e. the combined data from the offer order and request order status the status the deal. this status will changed during the life cycle the deal according the status/events received from the ipsx java apps the actors involved that deal, based agreement protocol described the next sections. matching function that identifies matches between offer orders and request orders and instantiates new deal that will further placed the deal book, while asking the order book eliminate those orders from its offer/request list. agreement protocol implementation www.ip.sx this function that generates deal status based the provider status and requester status received (or automatically assigned special cases) from the actors deal. the process description presented the design documentation which currently under construction and will released future date. ipsx utility token (ipsx) ipsx utility token based the ethereum technology, issued erc protocol and will used unit exchange between the actors the ipsx ecosystem. also, ipsx will used for commission payments the platform for all the details that are sealed inside the ipsx ecosystem. the general conditions for using ipsx will set the terms and conditions that are currently process creation and review the legal and technical departments the ipsx team. the supply ipsx utility tokens will limited the pool tokens created during project funding period and other tokens will issued advanced stage the ipsx project life cycle. ipsx utility token creation the ipsx token ethereum platform. its design follows widely adopted token implementation standards. this makes easy manage using existing solutions including ethereum wallet. maximum number tokens created during the crowdfunding period (updated jan total: (%); funding participants: (%); incentives for early adopters and strategic partners (.%); bounty campaign (.%); team and strategic partners (%). www.ip.sx sending ether the ipsx smart contract will create predefined number ipsx tokens based the eth hard cap that will set before token generation event. token creation, minting mining after the funding period will possible. tokens will transferable once the funding successfully completed (this needs agreed future state). any tokens that will not distributed during the funding period will later distributed the contributors proportionally the amount contributed during the funding period. funding period the funding period the entire timeline used the ipsx management team secure funds for the development the ipsx ecosystem. the funding period will composed from multiple stages follows: .initial investment this phase has already taken place and we, the founders the ipsx project, were the investors this phase. will describe the roadmap how used the funds from this funding stage. .private investment this phase will start november and will open only private and accredited investors and also strategic business partners. there will minimum investment for this phase that will revealed later stage and this phase will conducted private and individual sessions. .private pre-sale this phase will opened early community members that will willing and able pass full kyc/aml process. also, are analyzing different partnerships with presale platforms. www.ip.sx .public crowdsale this very delicate phase and will analyze very seriously before releasing any information about it. most you know, the legal aspect very important and sensitive this subject and not want treat this easy and irresponsible way. will release official position the company blog post the upcoming period. use funds funds raised during the funding period will used solely for the development and benefit the ipsx ecosystem. more detailed distribution the funds will released the upcoming days, along with the new version (.) the whitepaper draft, after first round reviews. roadmap was said earlier, the first stage funding already took place and the team members were the first ones fund the project. below description the activities that took place far and the prevision the future milestones: august the details the project were discussed between the management team and advisors. september the work the concept started, the first draft the ip.sx website was deployed, and design and first developments the website were implemented. also september, the legal structure was defined, and the decision establish new company switzerland, zug area was taken the management the team. all the operations will conducted from the legal entity from zug. october the developing team started working the initial concept and design documentation; the first community manager joined the team (welcome daniel paraschiv) new office was opened bucharest, romania for the technical and development departments new office course being opened switzerland, zurich. november the funding period starts the legal team analyzing the possibilities and options running complete legal and fully compliant public crowdsale the website will finalized, white paper published and community engagement will start. the java applications development for different platform starts. www.ip.sx future steps will detailed the next version the whitepaper, the moment not have complete vision the development life cycle. the team the core team can seen the team section the ipsx web site: https://www.ip.sx/. also, the public linkedin profiles all the team members can accessed from the ipsx website. the team members, well the relationship and history between them, will presented blog post that will published the upcoming days. the team kindly asking all the interested community members join the telegram channel for keeping the pace with the project evolution and being date with future announcements at: https://t.me/ipexchange thank you for taking the time read these details! please feel free drop feedback george@ip.sx. will happy reply! george bunea sergiu draganus ceo ipsx concept architect ipsx bucharest, october www.ip.sx
