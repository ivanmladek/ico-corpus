plair will also partner with vechain and use the vechainthor blockchain become pioneer gaming ecosystems. choosing vechain, the plair platform will anchor into the world's leading blockchain. using the tools and infrastructure provided vechain, plair will able seamlessly adapt the ever-changing blockchain industry. will the first ico launch the vechain platform. while this whitepaper will describe the plair vision and means achieving that vision related esports and tournament gaming, are also focusing game streaming and the development user-created dapps our platform, which will address length subsequent whitepapers. http://www.plair.life market opportunity gaming industry the gaming experience vast and varied, ranging from free-to-play mobile games community-driven massively multiplayer online role-playing games ("mmorpgs") watching others compete tournaments via streaming channels. accessing games has also never been easier thanks the ubiquity smart devices and the internet, meaning most individuals have some relationship gaming, matter how casual. this industry generated billion usd more than the previous year. games played computer accounted for (+.%) this number, console games (+.%), and mobile games whopping (+.%). the whole segment expected grow reaching revenue billion usd. these values culminate +.% between now and for total revenue billion usd. esports the number esports fans expected reach approximately million total roughly half them are occasional viewers and half them are esports enthusiasts. esports will have over billion fans which nearly one third all gamers. gamers not just want watch; they want play well. global esports revenue expected grow from anticipated attract more mainstream audience. this increase expected fueled viewership projected grow each year from with over million amateur esports players across the globe, this market offers huge potential for further growth and development. plair will secure position the leading force driving esports forward and integrating blockchain into this industry. tournaments organizing esports tournaments key component for top multiplayer online battle arena ("moba") and first-person shooter ("fps") games, which have earned combined billion usd date revenue. moba, fps, and mmo players spend more gaming-related expenditures than the average gamers. globally, free-to-play users were converting into paying customers rate and .%. many gaming studios have capitalized this. for example, once riot started organizing and approving team tournaments, the game's annual revenue increased from million usd whopping billion usd the end http://www.plair.life fantasy sites, prize pools, and tournament revenues amounted roughly million usd, and this expected grow usd million the end the enormous growth potential these markets shows that have huge opportunity capitalize the growing interest esports enthusiasts who want more involved the esports action. growth expectations the esports market expected generate billion usd global revenue. capturing the current market would produce estimated usd platform volume for plair the end from competitive matchmaking alone. below the estimated potential volume plair the minimum value play game usd per player. this price may depending the spending habits the players, and are conservatively assuming monthly active players participate ten games per month. the potential platform volume based the current data that exists for just four games: game streaming the gaming content industry has generated billion usd while the audience was approximately made million people, from curious and occasional viewers enthusiast ones. twitch and youtube broadly monopolize the industry with the former getting the lion share with the later falling just behind with decent capturing the market plair aims take advantage glaring gaps the aforementioned markets developing decentralized user-generated esports platform ("plair platform") which will allow players http://www.plair.life test their skills, compete, and earn plair token ("pla") vs. and/or team vs. team matches popular online games such league legends, dota counterstrike: global offensive, player unknown's battleground, and fortnite. most traditional tournament platforms have not yet chosen enhance their performance with the integration cryptocurrency and cryptographic tokens. tournament platforms that have adopted blockchain structure are usually built for "hardcore" gaming. plair ("plair") aims build platform that friendly for users who may brand new esports, while also providing great overall experience for amateur players more experience levels. terms the game streaming industry, empowering the gamers from the very way they broadcast the content they create the way they get paid exchange, plair should perceived real contender from innovation and economic perspective. simply reaching market share .%, plair would ensure volume million usd, based streaming platforms revenues. http://www.plair.life problems streaming and tournament dissonance currently, there stark disconnect between streaming and tournaments gaming, where gamers are required visit separate platforms either play tournaments watch pro players stream. combining both tournaments and streaming into single unified platform will allow for players make more money for views their streams and establish fan following our platform. this will create more streamlined experience for members the community who are looking both without having separate platforms accomplish it. with hundreds millions players worldwide, the amateur gaming market undoubtedly underserved. however, there are few platforms available that allow amateur gaming enthusiasts interact with each other and get rewarded doing so. this has created massive opportunity capture and expand upon the amateur gaming market. gaming has undergone rapid growth over the last few years. during this period, substantial money has flowed through tournaments well content providers. but there clear winner, and true cohesion among the players, content providers, and the viewers has yet formed. unfortunately, the current tournament model primarily focused professional esports players and large prize pools that are not easily accessed amateur players. this has caused hundreds millions amateur esports players feel left out with nowhere go, and thereby neglects countless opportunities cultivate widespread community gamers. underutilized engagement opportunities content providers are also seeing lot benefits from the large amount users watching games that are streamed through twitch youtube, but they often don't engage the players beyond the point mere viewership. monetization the average esports viewer poor. although users often watch and pay content creators, viewers themselves not get rewarded for watching the content. most gamers spend their time playing online desktop games and viewing content casual environment, and they are looking for ways rewarded for watching and playing matches against friends small tournament platforms that are centralized and heavily controlled the industry operating companies. this can often lead non-payment tournament winnings due the fact that many tournaments are unofficial and unapproved. even tournament approved esports platform, players are subject centralized governance the platform itself and are therefore ultimately subject such rules payment. this means that the platform decides not deliver the rewards, there not much the players can about it. centralized regulation gaming tournaments means players are left without agency. fiat prioritization another weakness lies various platforms taking fiat currency instead cryptocurrency. this can often lead issues such as: chargebacks http://www.plair.life centralized governance payment system third-party involvement with merchant payment solutions average, esports fans compete four live tournaments every six months. this can frustrating for players who want play more frequently. plair's decentralized online platform will provide environment for gamers compete, watch, and communicate without the problems associated with the current market offerings. plair will also provide means monetization esports viewers and content creators where publishers, companies, communities, and developers all gain from centralized platform with decentralized methodology. llamas, stephanie, and ravon james. esports_market_brief_update__superdata_research. new york, new york

monetized value broadcasting gameplay will gain viewers and players broadcasting content the platform http://www.plair.life development phases phase the first phase development, plair's focus will capture and promote the amateur esports industry within the gaming circuit. so, plair will build automated decentralized matchmaking and tournament systems that use blockchain technology both kyc verified and give users ownership their personal data, resulting fast creation and filling high-quality instances and tournaments that are governed through decentralized systems. the plair platform encourages healthy competition with true results and system that cultivates honest staking power the amateur esports market. the platform creates crossplatform interoperability between identity management and matchmaking (vevid+ai) that enables robust community tools and esports services (team development, coaching, organizational tools, etc.). through statistical and behavioral analysis tools, amateur players will empowered best position themselves for breaking into the professional esports scene, and they will able recruit other members coaches through the platform. the matchmaking services and community tools can still experienced noncompetitive environments for participants looking for more casual interactions the community. users interact with the platform, their data protected via distributed data vending vechainthor blockchain service), but they are still free submit interactions with users (via text video) the tribunal for formal review user's behavior way that certified the blockchain. this solution bolsters proper moderation across platforms individuals based kyc information without ever revealing true identities the participants. phase users will able earn pla winning tournaments, verifying matches, and participating the tribunal system. they can also trade pla for goods and rewards within the platform. plair will combine machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data give users the best matchups when playing. phase the plair platform grows user base, the introduction phase will begin. phase plair will utilize blockchain technology create decentralized streaming network. this phase development, pla will take additional utility being able utilize intellectual property tools and additional community building functionality. pla will also able acquired through watching, participating, and lending resources streams and video solutions. phase the plair platforms decentralized resource grows through their user base, the platform will enter phase phase gamers can tap into cloud computing resources rent, play, and stream video games with the combined computing power the participants. this long term goal that best applied thriving ecosystem users before launching the beta given the resource necessity and economic disruption such services could endure. this phase development, plair will also provide sdks and resources that allow additional gaming dapps built the plair platform. http://www.plair.life will elaborating phase and phase the plair platform separate whitepapers, which will released later date. http://www.plair.life competitive landscape within the gaming ecosystem there are few competitors doing what plair will doing. amongst these competitors there disconnect these platforms when comes players versus viewers. right now the gaming ecosystem very fragmented. plair plans bring lot these together under one larger gaming ecosystem built for players, viewers and content providers. overview there are few other online amateur esports tournament platforms the market today. among those, there are only flawed solutions the problem and none these cater the player's full expectation. problems such confusing user interfaces and potential fraud have prevented current platforms from reaching their full potential. some also lack certain quality and features for good gaming experience. some have features others not and vice versa. plair here change that. plan build full gaming ecosystem that properly supports our users. most platforms such first blood focus only tournaments. this gives the feeling "hardcore" esport professional tournament for amateurs, which can become mundane too heavy for some. plair does not believe this model. plair believes that order become successful platform, need include more community features well allowing users the rare opportunity interact with celebrities and professional gamers. this makes the platform fun and keeps users coming back for more. below are some comparisons with centralized and decentralized esports tournament platforms: http://www.plair.life the plair distinction fully automated all matches are automatically verified our match-verification system. the plair platform has unique relationship between smart contracts and nodes that run users' desktops mine pla through processing match data and reporting game results. match verifiers are randomly selected, and the tribunal pool will activated only match contested. this system significantly reduces the risk fraudulent reporting that rampant similar platforms. playing matches the plair platform web and desktop platform that allows users interact with the plair smart contracts. users can use pla place stake the match they are playing, which will placed smart contract. the smart contract acts decentralized escrow with all rewards settled the automated match-verification system the end match. details are summarized below: http://www.plair.life tournament play design plair will implement concepts such global ranking and match ranking. plair will offer variety match types from vs. bracket-style tournament matches. match result verification decentralized result-verification system beneficial because resilient against game api policy changes, fraud from subjective reporting, and other interferences risks. having decentralized result-verification system will also broaden the game list for peer-to-peer tournaments. game publisher decides make changes their api policy, plair will not affected this because are collecting data through network decentralized nodes that help verify each and every match. all pla holders have the right help determine match outcomes witnessing matches and voting the tribunal pool. match result can either contested uncontested. match contested the opponents disagree with the result the match. match uncontested the opponents agree with the result the match. whether match contested uncontested, needs confirmed two observers. people running the pool node will essentially mining pla within the plair ecosystem into their plair wallets rewards they process game data for the platform. our network nodes automatically connect game apis cross-reference game data make sure that there fraud. all uncontested matches will automatically processed. tribunal pool one the advantages holding pla the ability receive pla compensation for volunteering for the tribunal pool. the event that match contested, two more users will selected random. the plair platform will randomly select members from the tribunal pool. order part the pool, users will need holder pla and install the pool node. the probability that user's node will selected proportional the number pla they are holding compared the total amount pla that has opted run the nodes. plair will randomly select users serve the tribunal. the smart contract from the contested match will provide function that hashes random seed provided plair, the user's address and the match id. the smart contract will use this hash extract random number from the random number will then scaled the desired number selected tribunal users needed. the randomly generated number will compared the user's share pla. the random number less than the pla share, then the user selected vote within the http://www.plair.life tribunal pool. once the selection process complete, required quorum will need vote, otherwise the contested decision will revert back the original result the time the game. for example, the platform randomly selects people part the tribunal and the desired quorum users, then users must vote order validate the contested match. the users selected vote contested match will provided with game data well any evidence the players can produce back their claim. plair takes the tribunal process extremely seriously. hence, all records will maintained and audit using vechains vevid kyc technology. this enables admins the platform analyze moderation being issued fairly and isolate individuals that may causing harm the ecosystem. hosting tournaments another utility pla the ability initiate tournaments the platform. tournaments can competitive matches between individuals teams. these tournaments can array pre-arranged matches (bracketed, charity, free-to-play) handled the same mechanism using pool nodes. the pla tournament-creating function will one the main functions which support our esports ecosystem. purchasing quests there are some game players that may not want participate tournament style gaming. plair will offer these users quests that they can purchase with pla which allows them casually play challenges that pla offers daily basis. these challenges can based off particular types games such player's unknown battlegrounds where may challenge player get chicken dinners day. player successful their challenge plair will give out bonus reward the player for completing the challenge. player's can earn quest and challenge badges which will count toward their reputation score. ranking score (rs) the player's ranking score (rs) will adjusted once match complete. the score will adjusted depending the level difficulty the matches and opponents played. player can earn points for win and can lose points for loss. depending the game, the player's ranking score equation can different but will always maximum points gained lost. for example, player wins match against opponent within the same tier, the player will earn points while the opponent will lose points. however, player manages beat opponent with much higher skill tier, that player can earn the maximum points while the opponent suffers -point loss the same time. player reputation score (prs) plair will create player reputation score (prs) per player. this alternative feature ensure that the users plair are protected from hackers and abusive players and will become more robust metric individual skill and valued participation subsequent phases development. phase all players will increase their prs with more interactions and more games played. http://www.plair.life users gain reputation, new features will unlocked those players who hit certain threshold. for instance, players will allowed create new tournaments with higher stakes. players with high prs will allowed play higher tiered tournaments. players who hack abuse the plair platform and community will subject timed permanent ban they continue engage such activities. given the use vevid the platform, individual bans could ensure users removal across every game well removing the possibilities duplicated accounts. global ranking will include global rank all players the plair platform. this will encourage players increase their skill level move further the global ranking ladder. the plair platform will run events with esports influencers professional players, where would invite the top players the platform take shot them. player skill matching players will matched lobby games plair's machine learning algorithm match players similar skill level. our algorithm will process data points from user's profile well from game apis. may take data such user rank and prs which will allow find best match for lobby matches. lessons and coaching once player plays sufficient games and reaches certain amount prs such tier gold level, becomes veteran player. the veteran player can apply become mentor and coach for the less experienced players. the pla stake that normally put for match will become the payment for the lesson. this will allow less experienced players have the ability move the rank the platform learning new skills from plair's coaches and mentors. players will able rate the coach after the lesson complete. the ratings will help future players looking for help choose coach who best suits them. global ecosystem the plair platform thrives when has waiting user base introduce and adopted solutions that require immense community resources operate efficiently. such, the following are the goals associated with the plair foundation for the longevity the platform: establish value providing unique products and services that meet the current needs gamers http://www.plair.life offer rewards for long term use the platform and provide benefits (or level ups) for contribution the platform establish relationships with gaming studios, publishers, and leading esports franchises create products that service their future product needs create that easy for end users without technical understanding the blockchain even our business model create systems for thriving players stand out and potentially make living esports coaching have the buy from kols these goals will addressed throughout phase and phase development and must established before entering phase only after capturing the current market will the plair platform have the decentralized resources introduce streaming and cloud gaming solutions that are built blockchain technology. inducting vast user base into the network empowers the global plair platform computing power and result, makes the alpha, beta, and live launch practical compared alternative measures solution. http://www.plair.life technology the plair platform will host many features, including: streaming, cloud computing, matchmaking, reporting, and community management that benefit largely from the lack middleman and the presence authenticated use and record keeping. the blockchain offers proof publishing and fosters digital communities and gaming platforms that are immutable and secure. the presence smart contracts within the blockchain enable entire suite new tools and services delivered video gamers without additional middlemen between gamers, viewers, and their payment dues. vechainthor blockchain choosing the vechainthor platform the public blockchain plair, our platform able tap into the necessary tools and infrastructure adapt ever-changing industry. its core, the vechainthor blockchain uses poa that allows plair focus the development services rather than focusing the stability the blockchain. building multi-party payment protocol (mpp) smart contracts, plair able offer services and opportunities that allow advertisers, affiliates, viewers, and organizers produce content and services through their funding and allow users operate freely within the ecosystem. the use distributed data vending (ddv) within plair enables platform where users are fully control their data while being able leverage their passions for profit. ddv allows the owners opt and out opportunities, restrict public data, and truly control their own profiles while providing the plair protocol the ability formulate their encrypted streams. through ddv and vevid, plair can have true log individual input, allowed permissions, and voicing within public domain. using vevid, plair can become completely kyc-serviced platform that operates globally. mandated kyc, plair can truly cross-platform and cross-game analytics and profiles while centralizing community opportunities through decentralized technologies. vevid does not outright eliminate online anonymity; rather, issues arise within community that require individual removal, vevid allows the protocol provide views and offer moderation logs and rulings moderating parties while also hiding user identity. vevid also enables streamlined payment processing and reward distribution services across any content. plair will also able tap into the entire host sdks and tools that enable quick creation and adaptability the plair platform throughout the service's lifetime. many features the vechainthor platform are applicable the development plair, some which are currently not the public eye. addition running our platform vechainthor, plair will leverage the vechain community engaging new user demographic with the vechainthor blockchain. plair and vechain will long-lasting, valuable, and symbiotic partnership that will invariably shape the future blockchain adoption. http://www.plair.life desktop app plair plans create native application that runs players' desktops that will allow multiple plair tools built in. users who run the node will rewarded with pla. phase this node the decentralized match verification network node that helps the match verification process. phase users will offered streaming tools that will allow users share their bandwidth and help plair process the content our system. phase user will have automated cloud gaming tools that will help share their idle computing resources pass extra bandwidth, gpu and cpu power help boost not only plair's systems but user's systems well. platform infrastructure the user interface will online web platform. kyc mandatory throughout the platform outside viewer only instances utilizing vechains vevid tools popular party chrome plugin similar metamask will used help support the easy transfer cryptocurrencies (buying/selling) for users who may not cryptocurrency-savvy. the plair platform will built off css, html and js. machine learning artificial intelligence this based collaborative filtering algorithm using historical big data from players and games. plair will use both machine learning and applied statistical approaches continuously optimize matching results. the system grows with more player data, the platform itself will trained grow, with the ability process complex data quickly order give each user better plair experience. depending the game data available us, may use this help players analyze their playing style and offer automated analysis artificial intelligence. may use variety party tools help build our neural network. our team has variety expertise these party tools such as: tensorflow system for large-scale machine learning mariadb big data storage engines google cloud data analytics service framework and tools plair will stay very transparent during the entire development process. below are the development framework and tools plan use. these include but are not limited to: centos enterprise class computing platform, compatible with red hat
