designed globally distributed cloud computing service with basic-layer platform based the new network (distributed hardware terminals), the acute angle chain and can (content-addressable network). its construction will achieved though the acute angle chain, acute angle cloud and acute angle cloud figure: overview acute angle cloud history the internet october the first node the university california los angeles (ucla) was connected the second node the stanford research institute (sri) the arpanet, marking the inception the internet era. looking back the internet's history, from the very beginning its current high-speed development, can divide it, roughly, into three stages: web. internet, web. mobile internet and web. interplanetary internet. the web. internet began the when the internet was initially opened the public. that point, the technology needed for uploading information was incredibly expensive and had operated professionals. therefore, large amount online information was released and consumed media firms, commercial institutions, schools and authorities. vast reduction cost and impressive increase technological advancement has led our current reality almost every internet user can upload information various forms content. such change has introduced the concept web.; mobile internet. the web.; mobile internet mainly manifested users' participation social interaction, the blog space, community websites, peer-to-peer tools, etc. while developing the web., the founder the world wide web network, tim berners-lee (along with other computer scientists) began conceptualize web.; interplanetary internet. the original intention web.; interplanetary internet was facilitate communication using devices terminals, rather than communicate and aggregate information the internet, thus achieving "decentralization". due the development the internet and further progress telecommunication, people can talk almost anyone, from anywhere the world. blockchain, new trend october st, satoshi nakamoto published the bitcoin white paper peer-to-peer electronic cash system", declaring the inception the value transmission network. bitcoin has many creditable designs such data backup, relative anonymity those involved, and, most importantly, new system that eradicated the need for trusted third parties. however, its own transaction performance and proof work (pow) consensus mechanism gradually revealed some problems. the underlying technology bitcoin known the blockchain. recent years, people have innovated mainly concerning transaction performance, consensus algorithms and safe anonymity the blockchain, such promotion transaction performance graphene and the lightning network; enrichment and improvement consensus algorithm proof stake (pos), delegated proof stake (dpos), and practical byzantine fault tolerance (pbft); improvement transaction safety zero-knowledge proof (zkp) and mixing. promising blockchain ecosystem, acute angle cloud perfectly combines the strengths ethereum and bitshares and solves inherent defects the existing blockchain system. acute angle cloud expected gradually form blockchain economy, promote industrial efficiency and boost efficient and synergetic development society. plans accomplish this the setup basic platform, exploitation various products, and through the development and iteration commercialized and implemented projects. acute angle cloud defines new blockchain economy. acute angle cloud relevance prevention resource waste through virtual machines, the acute angle cloud solves the issue unused hard disk and cpu resources the personal computer (pc). can aggregate and allocate the users' idle hard disk and cpu resources with full cyclic use, forming integrated application chain ecosystem. storage potential through distributed storage technology, the issue storage waste solved. data can automatically re-distributed, enhancing the utilization rate storage space and connecting all the computing devices with the same file system. the principle behind replace address-based content with domain name content. other words, users can find content saved location instead address and the hash the content verified instead the identity the content creator. will enable webpage browsing faster, safer and more robust. cost reduction through blockchain technology, cloud computing, and can technology, the acute angle cloud creates distributed iaas platform. dramatically cuts the high operational and maintenance costs traditional centralized server rooms and reasonably utilizes idle resources and shares the returns with its users. strengths: low user cost, globalization, durable storage and high stability acute angle cloud can used as: virtual machine's root file system server database (cryptographic) communication platform any type cdn long-lasting web acute angle cloud development plan centralized cloud computing service model overview the structure the cloud system has gained popularity recent years, and has unique advantages compared with conventional and locally deployed modes. the cloud service has won the favor enterprises because its many benefits, such round-the-clock supported access, resource sharing, self-service, instant use demand, pay-as-you-go, and can meet enterprises' needs use flexible way reduce the cost use. estimated gartner, international research and advisory body, the global, public cloud services market has massive scalability, reaching us$. billion the figure expected hit us$. billion and exceed us$. billion .:global cloud service market scale even though cloud computing models are constantly evolving, the industry currently divided into three major categories: iaas, paas, and saas. the infrastructure the first tier, the platform the second tier, and software the third tier, namely: iaas (infrastructure-as-a-service) paas (platform-as-a-service) saas (software-as-a-service) with the progression the era live in, cloud computing longer option, but requirement for enterprise development. borrow statement from gartner, "cloud not strategy, tactic." (cloud computing longer strategic issue. tactical issue.) acute angle cloud based the iaas service model there are still two main problems associated with the current centralized cloud computing model: users not own their own data; remote servers are susceptible security breaches. blockchain technology separate the centralized cloud computing model, and allows become decentralized. bitcoin and other decentralized systems explicitly return digital assets end-users, eliminating the need for third-party server, for trust the infrastructure. iaas, the name implies, enables consumers access services from well-developed computer infrastructure over the internet. cloud service market shares cloud service market shares the value iaas services reached us$. billion, with growth rate far more than for the cloud service and for saas. it's expected maintain its rapid growth, with compound annual growth rate expected the development iaas infrastructure relatively advanced, and the rapid distribution after its announcement has reached considerable market size. acute angle cloud vs. traditional iaas platform the basic hardware computer simple; consists computing components and storage components. the working process the computer just conceptually basic; draw data from the storage component into the calculation component and compute. after the results are obtained, the output goes the display and other devices and thus cycle work tasks completed. the deployment hardware terminals global nodes assisting the acute angle cloud gradually complete the transition from cloud fog computing. fog computing paravirtualization frame model service computing between cloud computing and personal computing. fog computing focuses small clouds such personal clouds, private clouds and enterprise clouds, which operate differently from general cloud computing. fog computing focuses quantity which aids its success, and every computing node plays role, regardless how weak its capacity is. fog computing has several major features: low latency and location awareness, broader geographical distribution, applications suitable for mobility, and support for more fringe nodes. these features make deployment mobile services more convenient, which can satisfy broader connection nodes. cloud computing computing model which takes advantage the internet use resources (such storage devices shared computing facilities and applications) anywhere any time, conveniently and efficiently. cloud computing consists four basic parts: cloud platform, cloud storage, cloud terminal and cloud security. from the user's standpoint, can divided into public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud etc. from the service viewpoint, can divided into infrastructure service (iaas), platform service (paas) and software service (saas). the main problems associated with the cloud computing industry are follows: computing needs increase exponentially, and the cost bandwidth remains high, leading increase relevant operating costs. this becomes obstacle for the development global industrial chain. the cost traditional cdn, self-built nodes high and the node implementation slow, which negatively effects users computing needs increase. traditional cloud model's utilization broadband insufficient, resulting large number wasted resources, which also the main reason for the conflict between computing needs and computing power. fog computing adds layer between the terminal and the data center, known the network edge layer. it's like adding another small server router with memory, that can process and save data without having put into the "cloud" directly. this reduces stress the cloud and improves efficiency and transmission rates, while simultaneously reducing time delay. compared with cloud computing, the framework adopted fog computing more distributed, and closer the edge the network. fog computing concentrates information, data processing and data application the devices the edge the network, rather than saving almost most the info onto the cloud (as cloud computing does). the storage and processing the data more dependent the local device, rather than the server. therefore, cloud computing can referred the new generation centralized computing, whereas fog computing the new generation distributed computing which corresponds the feature "internet decentralization" and solves the problem that the cloud computing market currently faces. with psp technology, acute angle cloud can provide shared computing services the enterprises. the acute angle cloud will incorporate blockchain technology build fair and transparent incentive mechanism, compelling members the public participate the sharing and exchange the data resources. opening the shared computing services the acute angle cloud individual users comprehensively makes each common user resourceful node the decentralized shared computing system, allowing them benefit from it. due the cloud service's beneficial features such low cost, instant access, etc., the rapidly growing oo, e-business, and social networking (to name but few) lead the way realizing the benefits transferring from the traditional self-built servers cloud servers. many surveys have shown increase the industries using cloud services. cloud services are still early stage, but the settlement security will result more sectors migrating the cloud. this crossover expected cover government administration, healthcare, finance, industry and other sectors the next five years. .:cloud service usage trend for different industries according global iaas report issued gartner, amazon aws, microsoft azure and alibaba cloud are the top three cloud services the world, with market share .%, and respectively. amazon takes dominating position, but alibaba the fastest growing the three major cloud service providers are actively developing their ecosystems. amazon aws joining forces with other mainstream producers while microsoft azure also supported the linux. alibaba cloud taking advantage the ecosystem which has already been built alibaba, potentially allowing more seamless transition and user experience. ecosystems have been major force driving the growth iaas cloud services. competition analysis: the cloud services that are directly serving individual users remain immature. the acute angle cloud allows everyone crucial point the distributed cloud network and builds ecosystem based the users, giving both competitive edge and commercial value. the concern for security and privacy still the greatest resistance for the adoption public chain. however, blockchain and can technology can solve the issues data storage and user privacy. the cost for centralized, physical storage can reduced, but the cost manpower, operations and maintenance remain difficult curtail. contrast, the distributed cloud storage does not need centralized servers, making the cost significantly lower. the centralized servers can ensure data security, but not well can, which capable further reducing the system's redundancy, and ensures that the files are more secure through blockchain technology. acute angle cloud overview the acute angle cloud, v., based the new network (as the storage nodes) and the can peer-to-peer hypermedia distributed protocol create globally distributed file storage system. operational principle the acute angle cloud each file and its block are given unique "fingerprint", called encrypted hash. can deletes the files with the same hash value throughout the network, judges which files are redundant, and also traces the version history each file. each node stores the content that they want and the relevant index information, which helps locate the source. files can easily located using their hash value. using ipns (decentralized naming system), each file can named with readable name, instead the hash, making easy find. what can envisions, not only turn all the network terminal nodes into browser client, but also make anyone the operator the network and storage server. characteristics the acute angle cloud the acute angle cloud based content addresses, not the domain name address. each file (content) unique; one file connected the can network would given the only encrypted hash value based its computing content. this would change our habit utilizing domain names access the network. supplies "history version controller" (such git) the file, and stores the different versions the stored file multiple nodes. the acute angle chain operating the can network just the hash value table used for storing the internet files. the content (file) address the link will queried while accessing the network every time necessary. uses the ecosystem's reward distribution encourage the user contribute more shared space for storing data. the users obtain the ecosystem's rewards providing available disk space, processing power and bandwidth the network. the users can exchange the rewards for storage space and other services within the ecosystem. the acute angle cloud's reward system allows lower cost data storage the user, and the storage network made more stable setting online time goals motivate users stay online. the acute angle cloud helps build freer and more independent network. phased upgrading the acute angle cloud, problems solved the acute angle cloud, acute angle cloud, committed adopting reward mechanism, through the establishment new network, distribute the acute angle cloud's nodes worldwide and create unified iaas service. this aims realize economic globalization the distributed cloud storage, well providing server services, cdn accelerated services, file storage services and database services for individuals smes low storage price. operational principle the acute angle cloud, create globally distributed iaas service platform through networking, virtualization, operating systems, new network, openstack and the acute angle cloud, v.. computing: set controllers will used the management the virtual machines for the life cycle single user group, and will supply virtual services according users' needs. they are responsible for the operation the virtual machine including set up, startup, shutdown, standby, stop, adjust, remove, restart, destroy, and configuring cpu, internal memory and other information specifications. object storage: swift refers the system that creates object storage large scale extensible systems through built-in redundancy and high error tolerance mechanisms, allowing for storing retrieving files. can provide image storage for the glance, and volume backup service for the cinder. persistent object storage: the acute angle cloud, could incorporate object storage with the advantages high error tolerance, higher security etc. content-addressable and peer-to-peer hypermedia protocols. also provides image memory for the glance, and volume backup service for cinder. image service: the search and retrieval system virtual machine imagery supports multiple virtual machine image formats (aki, ami, ari, iso, qcow, raw, vdi, vhd, vmdk). uploading, deleting and editing the images basic information will supported. identity service keystone. with the functions providing identity verification, service regulations and service tickets for other services openstack, manages domains, projects, users, groups and roles. network address management: supply network virtualization technology for cloud computing, and providing network connection services for other openstack services. the technology will supply the users with interface, and will define: network, subnet and router, configure dhcp, dns, lb, service, and the network supports gre and vlan. plug-in architecture supports many mainstream network manufacturers and technologies, such open vswitch. block storage: provide stable data block storage service for the cloud, and its plug-in driver architecture available for the set and management block devices, such set volume, delete volume, onhook and unload volume the case. lasting block storage acute angle cloud provides stable and persistent data block storage services the cloud when running dashboard web management portal used simplify the service operations for the user, such startup, distribute addresses, configure access control, etc. metering filters almost everything that happens inside the acute angle cloud v., and provides data support for billing and monitoring, well other services. orchestration collaborative deployment method defined module provided achieve automatic deployment under the operation environment cloud infrastructure software (computing, storage and network resources). database service provides extensible and reliable, relational and non-relational database engine services for users the acute angle cloud v.. acute angle cloud global node distribution strategy super network plan overview order speed the deployment the acute angle cloud's global resource nodes and improve the efficiency point-to-point, end-to-end data transmission the chain, the super network project emerged stand-alone application. it's based the acute angle chain and developed the acute angle client, dedicated serving the world. blockchain believers and enthusiasts can invite more users easily join in. both new and existing users can concurrently build blockchain-node network architecture that covers wider area and more densely-distributed network, finally realizing self-healing cloud computing storage network. addition, order reach consensus with the acute angle cloud early adopters, conducted user survey samples), before the super network plan was officially launched. the following are some the findings: you support the creation the super network? heavily support support not support indifferent what you believe sn's purpose be? necessary for accelerating the deployment global nodes, making the ecosystem more powerful and stable necessary, but there needs balance between and the acute angle series against having indifferent the more point-to-point nodes there are the network, the faster the data transmission will be. the super network plans serve blockchain enthusiasts around the world with its low threshold, high participation, and easy-to-use interface. super network plans follow the open, transparent, and tamper-proof features associated with blockchain technology, allowing more users easily get involved. the (ecosystem's generic token) reward distributed the resource contributors through additional incentive mechanism that can used within the cloud's ecosystem. the super network plan will inspire more users enter the blockchain world. the acute angle series hardware products (along other equipment) will serve new network devices and jointly serve resource nodes the acute angle cloud ecosystem. users with other devices, can not only participate the construction the acute angle cloud's ecosystem easily and receive the token reward, but will also receive aac rewards the total amount aac, coming out the acute angle foundation reserve). this will help acute angle cloud build blockchain network architecture with nodes that cover wider geographical area and larger distances. will also lay the foundation for the integration the resources gathered the acute angle cloud, into cloud computing storage network that anyone the world can rely on. new network overview the new network made global devices that make the super network. help collect large amount idle resources from computing devices, will build complete acute angle cloud ecosystem and provide users with safer and more convenient data storage services. the new network open all users who have devices but are not fully utilizing the hardware and computing resources them, they can share these idle resources and get rewards return. users can activate the super network installing the acute angle client and exchanging aac for certain amount purchase activation code. the activation bound that single device, and the device becomes node registered the acute angle chain. the new network devices join the acute angle cloud's global node layout strategy exchange for rewards. thus, complete blockchain, full-node network created linking blockchain users, assets, applications, etc., and the acute angle cloud's global node coverage expanded, while accelerating the point-topoint data transmission efficiency. call more users around the world use their devices, join the super network program and share the "dividends" brought about blockchain technology innovation. after the super network application successfully activated, the user can select the devices' idle disk, test the network environment, well other operations complete resource sharing and become new node registered the acute angle chain. the joint construction the acute angle cloud's ecosystem rewarded with token rewards. new network advantages uses idle computer resources low operating threshold blockchain attributes computes resource sharing safe and transparent token reward distribution acute angle chain overview the acute angle chain decentralized public blockchain platform, used developers quickly, easily and safely distribute tokens, smart contracts and blockchain systems. the acute angle chain committed building blockchain network system global information, which values interconnection and trust exchange. the philosophy and technological mission the acute angle chain build unobstructed blockchain world. background and importance blockchain decentralized network capable achieving peer-to-peer value exchange, which referred value internet. helped acute angle chain, can create decentralized and value-driven world mutual cooperation and peer-to-peer exchange where individual directly connected another part community society. first, build safe and stable modular blockchain network allowing use smart contracts and digital assets. this stage, introduce the acute angle hardware capable intelligently testing, monitoring and running suitable environment. the acute angle can ensure that contracts running the acute angle chain are safe, thus preventing events such dao. the acute angle cloud can meet different industries' storage needs, including insurance companies, electronic files, digital currency, trace origin, and personal credit record. the blockchain network constantly evolving, easy use, low cost and susceptible customization. with the acute angle chain, connect user information and might even get through other networks (possibly non-blockchain) for data interaction, thus building cyberspace multidimensional data correlation. through multidimensional data such personal credit, assets, production and consumption data, can better integrate community consensus, individual behavior and value exchange. carrying value the ecosystem, the digital currency issued the acute angle chain and named after aac. using the aac can allow share cdn services, idle hard disk resources, original resources and other basic blockchain services. design philosophy the acute angle chain puts stability, security, scalability and ease use among its design priorities. introducing modular virtual machines, value exchanges, and bifurcation mechanisms, create blockchain network that easy use, low-cost, and moderately customizable. theory, the acute angle chain can achieve tps available performance optimizing the block intervals, block capacity, and consensus algorithm. the new network, which one the core parts the acute angle cloud, globally distributed, hardware terminal system that aggregating all the hardware devices individuals around the world and designed based the edge calculation technology fog computing build web interplanetary internet. everyone who uses hardware device that not saturated and has sufficient computing capabilities join the super network program will become resource node for the acute angle cloud. with the development its global nodes, the acute angle cloud will increase its distributed cloud space and its capability achieve fully functional distributed cloud computing network system. believe that through the adoption blockchain technology, innovation will able solve the crisis trust between people, and create new network relationships, better integrate community consensus, individual behavior, and value exchange. stability stability necessary ensure the existence the acute angle chain. the blockchain incorporates distributed features for intermediation, and the decommissioning the network usually complicated and uncertain. therefore, use block design tools abstract and simplify the blockchain. building stack-type smart contract running webassembly (wasm) encoding format, draw two main benefits. firstly, optimizes the performance the virtual machine and directly improves the contract execution efficiency and reduces the interference caused the system coupling. secondly, weakens the correlation between the blockchain network and the smart contract running status even the contract execution has problems, the virtual machine runs abnormally, the block and chain's network stability can still guaranteed. safety proof work (pow) has contributed tremendously the safety the bitcoin network. however, due the increasing difficulty computing, almost all the rights were concentrated the miners and mining pools. through professional cooperation, they have fact become highly centralized "central servers." their combination exceeds the computing power, can theoretically control most bitcoin transactions, such the ddos (distributed denial service) attack are familiar with. addition, the high power consumption equally plagued criticism. the proof stake (pos) mode still developing compared pow. these developments are mainly based security and applications. the pos model has major advantage terms security over the pow model, but the premise attract enough holders fully get the advantages that security. delegated proof stake (dpos) improvement pos, and equivalent pos terms security. theoretically, can improve block response and increase network stability and security. addition, the acute angle chain innovatively proposes smart sandbox mechanism. contracts issued any person must first tested smart sandbox. the acute angle chain will conduct full-path, automated testing and continuously monitor its operational status. the health level deteriorates, flaw found, the network will judge its own discretion and avoid problematic contracts that may cause damage the blockchain ecosystem. extensibility extensibility put forward solve the information island problem incompatible blockchains. firstly, believe that upgrading and forking are effective approaches for network evolution, with main chain and some sub chains taking shape after forking. technically, main chain and sub chains are completely equivalent, but are arranged with different identifications the basis community consensus. each sub chain may customized for different commercial applications and value exchange protocol (vep) constructed among sub chains, which works similar gateway and via which, sub chains can interact exchanging information and value. this can form blockchain ecosystem multiple applications. furthermore, non-blockchain online data incorporated into the acute angle chain ecosystem, supplemented smart contracts, respond events the real world. usability acute angle chain decentralized public blockchain platform. developers can use the acute angle chain release tokens, smart contracts and blockchain systems simply, quickly and safely. the acute angle chain committed building global blockchain network system that allows for the exchange information, interconnects value and trust. the philosophy and technical mission the acute angle chain build blockchain world without obstruction. working principle acute angle chain connects numerous forks via value exchange protocol (vep) and even gets through other networks (maybe non-blockchain) make data interaction build cyberspace interconnection and multidimensional data correlation. contract creation and lvm smart contract implementation traditional smart contracts limit the input and output data the chain and can only support some simple application scenarios. the acute angle chain, besides allowing for data the chain, also allows for interaction with data and off the chain itself. further supports the update data and off the chain simultaneously. it's commercial applications the real world are varied and very complex; this complexity reflected the data structure and the logic. complete turing programming language and virtual machine are needed create and execute smart contracts. wasm (webassembly) portable, underlying bytecode technology whose stack-type virtual machines are custom-designed and optimized for blockchain environment and can run smart contracts speeds close native machine code. the benefits wasm lie industry standardization and extensive support. programmers can develop smart contracts familiar languages such c++, golang, and rust, greatly reducing the cost learning and improving development efficiency. therefore, the acute angle chain selects wasm the execution code the smart contracts. the life cycle contract blockchain network can divided into five stages: select programming language and create source code; )the compiler assembles the source code into wasm bytecodes; the smart contract registered with the acute angle chain; request the contract open api; )upgrade destroy the contract; the above life cycle, tokens need consumed for registration, request, and upgrade smart contracts. the one hand, because the implementation the contract must consume cpu, memory, hard disk and network bandwidth, the resource providers need rewarded. the other hand, also uses economics raise the threshold network attacks and thus reduce risks. the open apis smart contracts are shown users restful apis. the contents http requests are encoded json format. users can generate and send requests through the browser mobile phone app. acute angle chain's restful api plug-in receives and recognizes requests from smart contract's api, and one, passes the request the middleware the wasm virtual machine. the middleware translates the request content into the byte code the wasm, then calls the corresponding api the equivalent contract, and finally returns the result the api execution the user. the entire process shown figure consensus mechanism due its distributed nature, the blockchain needs consensus mechanism that functions properly. currently, widely used consensus algorithms mainly include: pow (proof work), pos (proof stake), pbft (practical byzantine fault tolerance) and dpos (delegated proof stake). from safety and practicality standpoint, the acute angle chain uses improved dpos consensus mechanism. result-delegated proof stake (r-dpos) not only inherits the advantages dpos need consume additional resources distribute rewards but can also decide whether validate the agent's the node's smart contracts according the network's transaction status. the token associated with the acute angle chain can not only traded for the blockchain basic services such contract release and network bifurcation, but also participates voting and has the opportunity become proxy node and provide token rewards. the acute angle chain named this token "aac". each aac holder called equity person and allocated the corresponding voting weight based the number aacs held. the agent node selected the equity holder. the first winners, agent nodes with the most votes, become deputy nodes, which turn authenticate the transactions. the work order determined the number votes. the agent node can accumulate rewards works normally. works abnormally does not work, will punished. the election conducted real time and unending. new users can participate the voting process any time, and users who have already voted can also withdraw their votes any time change them. therefore, the elected agent node not permanent, nor they have fixed term, and may surpassed and replaced others any time. addition, have made some optimizations the consensus algorithm prevent the agent nodes from being fixed and avoid the network from gradually becoming centralized. account model the blockchain network, the account address was designed provide safety. the address creation follows the following steps: public key, private key follows: private key-->public key-- >account address. all three items use the secure hash algorithm (referred sha), which can ensure safety. hash the extraction information with less output than input and fixed length. the hash with strong encryption irreversible. i.e., the private key information cannot deduced using the account address. the detailed generation process the private key, public key and account follows: the creation private key, public key and account can divided into two kinds accounts based the byte length the account address, main account and sub-account. value exchange protocol(vep) vep refers standard protocol between different blockchain networks. mentioned above, the applications that can loaded network are limited, but when different networks connect form larger network, this leads exponential increase value. how single network nodes trust other nodes first? the biggest advantage the blockchain network provide reliable information, and such reliability embodied the distributed account ledger and consensus. blockchain network community that agree consensus this develops mutual trust relationship between nodes, which needed for taking blockchain network the node and forming connections among several blockchain networks. vep creates rules for cooperation. registers the information each chain and provides services the chain letter list for query and connection requests. vep supports two kinds application circumstances, cross node interaction and cross chain contract request. the former develops interaction between contracts indirectly checking the status data saved the node external data and tries generate new information. for example: unpaid loans due accordance with the contract will affect the individual credit. loan record can saved the blockchain while the credit data can saved the blockchain individual identity information may come from external public database. while the latter refers mutual invocation between contracts. simple case that the total value always constant after exchanging the tokens the two chains. acute angle platform application scenarios scenario supply chain finance: supply chain finance refers financial service with the lowest risk that controlled information integration under financial institutions (generally refers banks) managing capital flow and logistics medium and small sized enterprises. due large number participants, different kinds information are saved each link, which means that commodity information supplier stored the warehouse information the supplier, shipment information grasped the logistics company, capital information distributed the bank system, and transfer information grasped core enterprise. because information asymmetry and non-transparency information required collaboration, the effective supply chain credit system hard established. due high cost credit establishment, the financial institution has operate prudently responding risk control. thus, some high quality items are often missed. acute angle platform able help enterprises and financial institutions reconstruct the credit system and establish more efficient supply chain finance. endorsing the core enterprise, the blockchain platform for warehouse, logistics, digital bill and enterprise credit can developed through acute angle chain, which can realize commodity, warehouse, logistic and accounts receivable commonly witnessed the and down stream enterprises and financial institutions the supply chain. the issuance, approval, transfer, splitting and acceptance digital bill shall triggered each participant supply chain through contract, with trigger condition based change data status warehouse, logistic blockchain and core enterprise database, and prepared the contract each participant. the behavior compliance violation the rules will all recorded the credit blockchain, which cannot tampered. acute angle hardware series overview the acute angle hardware series one the components the new network. establishes reward for users through smart contracts based
