important understand which technologies, communities and decentralized ledger technologies (dlt's) will separate themselves from the rest, pushing through the noise constant ventures entering the crypto-sphere. instead "one chain rule" however; believe the future will instead the formation global backend generation blockchain mesh consisting every chain, technology and service created thus far. united network different tech from different chains fully communicating one entity executing synchronously. future where one powers software run their vehicle, buys groceries, signs contracts instantly using different chains will amongst us, constantly evolving fit users' needs the fly. this conversion will completely unbeknownst end users swaps will done case case the backend, not seen, realized, even chosen the user. stakenet (xsn) building integrated decentralized ecosystem create suite effective investment tools for investors and the world's first truly decentralized cryptocurrency bank. the frontend consumer interface, stakenet.io, scheduled for release june the stakenet blockchain powered its own native coin xsn, which can used pay for all the services and products within our ecosystem. the stakenet ecosystem will comprised the following elements: trustless proof stake (tpos): tpos stakenet invention. while crypto investors currently use offline storage such ledger trezor for mere storage, tpos transforms these cold storage devices into profit generating devices. rewards flow the coin owner while the coins remain offline. tpos fully operational and available for everyone who owns xsn. this technology will available for cross chain purposes upon implementation ccpos, described below. decentralized exchange (dex): xsn will create crypto's first truly decentralized cryptocurrency exchange run masternodes. these masternodes will rewarded through trading fees and will act similarly stakenet.io that once xsn cedes control, the masternodes will run the network and cannot shut down xsn any third party. masternodes with multiple sources income: xsn masternode owners will have three sources income: regular blockrewards, dexs' trading-fees and fees for running tor-network services. investment agility due cross chain proof stake (ccpos): another xsn innovation under development ccpos. with this technology aim enable users stake xsn and receive rewards any other coin. herewith individuals will enabled with flexibility switch rewards the fly that new "hot coin", they desire. profit-sharing, buy-back-burns and revolving stake bonus (rsb): all profits will given back xsn coin owners one way another. some options being explored are coin buy-back-burns and air drops existing coin owners. other options will distributing the service-fees all involved parties. least xsn will reward coin holders via rsb mechanism, which proof burn technology for service- and business-provider who use the xsn network. convenience due new multi-currency wallet: stakenet multi-currency wallet will enable users stake and earn rewards from one location, rather than currently where wallet required for each specific coin. cold storage exchanging from hardware device: users will have the ability trade ledger and lightning network compatible coins through our dex without the coins ever leaving the security cold storage. tpos marketplace: stakenet.io will host merchant marketplace where coin owners can hire merchants trustlessly stake their coins using tpos, while the coins remain ledger trezor hardware wallet, any other cold storage. furthermore, will also possible your own merchant without any restrictions. security: stakenet will initially centralized but will thereafter run entirely masternodes. this decentralization removes the risk obstruction being shut down third parties. furthermore, our tpos consensus ensures the maximum level network security along all existing pos solutions. privacy: xsn building crypto's first internal tor network run masternodes. whereas tor has been utilized crypto coins like xvg, those methods are fundamentally flawed due exit node relay detection. our tor masternode network won't have this vulnerability and will allow truly obfuscated transactions. moreover, the stakenet blockchain utilizes coinmixing and will encrypt transactions due the zk-snark protocol. coin metrics: consensus: pos tpos coinage: enabled, algorithm: block time: seconds difficulty retargeting: minutes swapped supply from posw xsn: xsn blockreward distribution: masternodes,

that this community still the early stages expansion and continuously expanding market which offers great opportunities for traders all around the world. presently, there are over cryptocurrencies, above markets and total market cap nearly billion per statistics available coinmarketcap.com (date: june the prices popular virtual currencies such bitcoin and ethereum soared record highs amid increased investor interest. there are now hundreds cryptocurrencies choose from with more appearing each passing day. choice paralyzes this adds cost, complexity and the need for advice. given that cryptocurrency can high risk, has extreme volatility, and can difficult buy and store safely. effective and diverse portfolio coins can complex problem especially, when you like store them safe place and claim their individual features for passive income. stakenet, with the ticker xsn, trustless proof stake (tpos) blockchain that addresses the issue cryptocurrencies for nontechnical people providing simple user interface access all the features our generation meta network. stakenet allows users stake various cryptocurrencies one single wallet, trade decentralized exchange, which entirely provided masternodes and empowers its users execute atomic swaps between different blockchains. stakenet focuses technology, that ensures and truly decentralized and secure network. that's why created the tpos consensus, due this xsn holders can earn staking rewards for protecting the blockchain, while their coins remain offline coldwallet. because stakenet based the bitcoin.core blockchain architecture, it's also complete segwit activated and can use all the bitcoin achievements, such the lightning network. aim develop tech, that really pushes the boundaries our trustless profitdriven economy, that xsn stays relevant and can store value. purpose stakenet stakenet aimed truly high secure and profit driven inter-chain ecosystem for almost every cryptocurrency. therefore, stakenet will enable meta network cross chain agreements and contracts. this network will powered the stakenets native coin xsn and managed the stakenets masternodes. based this interchain architecture, will create one single secure and intuitive platform access the features and services every blockchain within our ecosystem and trade all these coins our decentralized exchange. stakenet will that one blockchain unite all beneficial chains into one single ecosystem blockchains. our vision vision statement should reveal what company our case what community hopes and wants achieve the long term. keeping smart and simple, the easiest way express our vision is, use the following words: "restoring trust crypto's store value offering profitability, privacy, security inter-chain-ability" our goal for stakenet create the world's first trustless, profit-driven economy with the use tpos, the highest level network security and with the help masternodes, the highest level providing network services for truly decentralized world. our mission stakenets mission make the xsn framework ecosystem for cryptocurrencies, access all their features from one single place, that can't hacked, shut down, corrupted abused. all all, like sum our mission that way: "creating truly decentralized, private and trustless profit-driven economy for cryptocurrencies" already accomplished the fundamental for such ecosystem the creation trustless proof stake consensus bitcoin.core based blockchain architecture. are now pushing boundaries expand our ecosystem the xsn services and products, enable internet blockchains and make crypto assets more accessible and secure for the average user around the world. our core objectives the idea stakenet achieve these five following main goals: security using trustless proof stake and our decentralized exchange. immediacy over lightning network and masternodes. innovations creating xsn sidechains and new technologies. profitability from xsn services and applications. privacy using state the art features such inter tor network and bulletproofed algorithms. our roadmap for genesis coin swap from posw xsn: from the march till the may the posw blockchain swapped the xsn blockchain. the posw blockchain shut down and longer supported since the may. all nodes have been shut down. trustless proof stake (tpos) and masternode implementation: the new blockchain architecture stakenet minting proof stake blockchain, which also enables cold staking with the help merchant node. this course, the stakenet masternodes were also implemented the network; provide the current network services, such instant send, and enable further functions, such hosting the stakenets' decentralized exchange xsn information site launched (xsncoin.io): https://xsncoin.io/ the new website for all information and resources related xsn. excalibur segwit update: segregated witness, called segwit, the name used for implementation the transaction format the bitcoin.core blockchain architecture. the implementation this new protocol the stakenet blockchain architecture will fundamentally for many more functions within the stakenet ecosystem. launch staking platform (stakenet.io): https://stakenet.io/ will stakenet's own staking platform. with the help this platform, users can stake various coins from one single place. furthermore, stakenet.io will provide services such masternode hosting, managing pooled masternodes and enable atomic swaps between different coins. cold storage staking from nano ledger ledger the world's leading cryptocurrency hardware provider. stakenet one the few coins and tokens (to date) that are supported the ledger blue and nano hardware wallets. the integration the offline staking features with the help trustless proof stake will implemented soon. lightning update: the lightning network dependent upon the underlying blockchain architecture. using real bitcoin.core based blockchains and using their native smart-contract scripting language, possible create secure inter-chain network different participants. the implementation this ability will fundamental for the generation meta-network, provided stakenet. advisory board team expansion: stakenet still the expansion phase. will continue involve qualified and talented individuals the development process, just did with frank amato who current block capital co-founder and former executive director morgen. zeus xsn multicurrency wallet: allowing our network hold databases and run full nodes multiple chains will able securely send, receive, and confirm transactions separate chains from our own. these party chains will held our second layer which, will communicate with first layer nodes allowing our users hold multiple wallets one place the xsn multi currency wallet. masternode watchtowers: watchtowers have important job. they are backbones our cross chain ecosystem and are fundamental for our trustless cross chain swaps. masternode lightning channels: there will requirements for xsn masternodes have light channels open totaling minimum amount xsn per ip. expect masternodes online, this will give our network robust backbone provide instant transactions occur and liquidity our lightning network. launch decentralized exchange: our masternodes will hold decentralized hashing tables dht's, which will the precursor allowing our network used dex; holding and executing buy/ sell orders service. all required tech can done in-house the xsn chain, while xsn accepted fee for powering these services. auto updates: due the rapid rate technological advancement, soft- and hard-forks are natural part any emerging network. will incorporate optional auto update system for our users, that allows core team update nodes automatically. stakenet will secure that auto update system with state-of-the-art technology ensure stability and reliability and protect the master nodes from malicious updates and man-in-the-middle attacks. this way our investors can passively run nodes without having constantly concern themselves with mandatory upgrades during initial periods rapid network development. merlin autonomous swaps executed masternode quorums: once zeus place, will begin programming our second layer trustlessly handle cross chain light swaps utilizing masternode quorums. now, human merchant needed convert your tpos stakes into new currency. with merlin this will autonomously done the network with human needed. enhanced privacy: utilizing lightning network and inter tor network will able give our users the option when converting wealth publicly privately real time. these can also combined with emerging tech such bulletproofs and zk-snarks. chain scaling (sharding): chain scaling technique that allows the network divided into several shards. this sharding mechanism can improve the chain capacity and throughput, allowing dapps and high functionalities. cold storage exchanging from hardware wallets: once cold staking xsn from hardware wallet enabled, the next step will executing cold storage exchanging. this allows users trade and convert coins with the security provided hardware devices. dapps build xsn blockchain: dapp abbreviation for decentralized application. the backend code our dapps will running the stakenet's decentralized peer peer network. the dapps frontend code and users interface can written any language that can make calls the backend. the stakenet's dapp framework will enable parties develop powerful tools provide their service and for stakenet. enable cross chain proof stake: cross chain proof stake enables users stake xsn and other lightning compatible coins and receive rewards entirely different coin within the stakenet ecosystem. offering this service, stakenet enables its users flexibly and autonomously switch staking rewards, they desire. xsn hardware wallet: xsn will dedicating hardware division solve the problem and bridge the gap between the blockchain digital world and the real world. these devices will more than just wallet they will the user's medium access the features all supported blockchains. key characteristics trustless proof stake: trustless proof stake minting pos consensus validate, move and secure blockchain, even your coins are stored cold wallet. masternodes: masternodes are powerful nodes which acts manager and service provider for the stakenet ecosystem. instant: due the lightning network, transactions can processed within milliseconds seconds. virtually unlimited transactions per seconds: with lightning, xsn will empowered execute millions billions transactions per second. nearly fee-less: using off-chain technology, lightning ensuring exceptionally low fees for the stakenet ecosystem. private: xsn provides enhanced privacy features, like bulletproofed algorithms and internal tor network run masternodes. secure: using trustless pos consensus results the highest level security among existing pos networks. revolving stake bonus: the rsb mechanism proof burn technology for generated profits within the xsn ecosystem. atomic swaps: this technique allows any xsn user swap assets between different blockchains instantly and anonymous. cross chain: using cross chain pos and cross chain masternodes, holders can passively proliferate their xsn and receive rewards other coin. blockchain architecture stakenet trustless pos blockchain, which provides truly decentralized, highly secured and profit driven inter chain meta network for cryptocurrencies. stakenet powered its native coin xsn and managed its own masternodes. history coin swap from posw xsn created the stakenet blockchain. the new blockchain architecture based the bitcoin.core and has been modified needed the development team. poswallet poswallet was online staking wallet serving more than the most common pos altcoins along with block explorers and faucets for each coin. the initial market supply posw was capped ... the previous team decided reduce the final supply burning coins from the developers address, that the initial supply was reduced only posw with interest rate per year. after hack poswallet.com the old team left posw. summer the coredevs took over the development putting together completely new team. they rebuilt the underlaying blockchain architecture from scratch and have expanded their features and use cases, finally wipe out all connections left the former posw blockchain. from that day on, xsn was born and finally launched its completely new dedicated blockchain the march bitcoin.core fork table stakenet was created build ecosystem, that allows easy and secure offline staking and cross chain communication. for this purpose, the basic characteristics bitcoin, dash and peercoin were assumed and slightly modified. xsn uses the same core bitcoin, improved dash masternode architecture and adjusted coinage, like peercoin for the validation new minted blocks, down xsn blockchain metrics stakenet cutting-edge utility blockchain and ecosystem created provide truly decentralized, highly secure and profit-driven interchain meta network for cryptocurrencies. this economy backed stakenets own coin named xsn. utilizes the algorithm, has powerful masternodes providing the network services and secured trustless proof stake (tpos) consensus. all this results the highest level security amongst existing proof stake networks. consensus the consensus decentralized digital currency fundamental for the validation the newly generated blocks and moving the blockchain. expressed simple way; it's software component that the validator blockchain uses vote whether story about the past true not. for this proof, stakenet uses proof stake (pos) consensus. the pos consensus, the block generation done with special transaction, called coinstake. this transaction the coin owner pays himself, thereby consuming his coinage (up h), while gaining the privilege generation block for the network. stake output (pay stake owner himself) kernel input stake input stake input the first input the coinstake transaction called kernel. doing so, must satisfy specific hash target protocol, turning the generation pos blocks stochastic process. the hash target that the coinstake transaction must satisfy defined target per unit coin age that needs reached, before its subsequently consumed the kernel. contrast proof work solutions, the hashing operation done over limited search space instead unlimited search space. therefore, the block generation time within the stakenet seconds, while the difficulty retargeting set minutes avoid such long adjustment periods like the bitcoin blockchain. the daily chance for staker find and validate block within the stakenet blockchain is: number coins you hold number all masternodes total supply percentage share all staking coins (,:,) usually between and algorithm each information bit within blockchain has undergone process known cryptographic hashing. for this purpose, stakenet uses the algorithm. this cryptographically algorithm, which uses chained combination the following eleven hashing functions. all these differ their output size. the implementation defines for the output sizes and bits. #include "sha/sph_blake.h" #include "sha/sph_groestl.h" #include "sha/sph_keccak.h" #include "sha/sph_luffa.h" #include "sha/sph_shavite.h" #include "sha/sph_echo.h" #include "sha/sph_bmw.h" #include "sha/sph_jh.h" #include "sha/sph_skein.h" #include "sha/sph_cubehash.h" #include "sha/sph_simd.h" the enhanced complexity chained hashing solutions, like the algorithm, provides higher level security and longevity for store value for digital currency compared other single hash solutions, which all have one single point failure. someone breaks the single hash the entire network threatened till hard forks another cryptographic hash. this scenario less critical for because all eleven algorithms needs broken the same time threat the network. masternodes while staking node defined active electronic device that attached the stakenet network and responsible for validating the blockchain, masternode full node the network that provides several services. each masternode within the stakenet blockchain needs collateral xsn. this was made avoid wild growth the nodes. thanks the masternodes, the stakenet blockchain becomes ecosystem which single entity can governance the entire network. the masternodes and their collateral requirements empower the xsn blockchain perform highly sensitive missions truly trustless way. selecting randomly masternodes solve task, these nodes act like oracles, that not the entire network needs get done. believe that previous masternode networks are not even doing what possible. because that will empower the stakenet masternodes become much more, than just coin mixer, instant sender governance provider. with the help periodic masternode challenges our nodes will step step evolve into more and more powerful nodes, that provide high end services, such hosting decentralized exchange. since the stakenet blockchain uses its revolutionary trustless proof stake (tpos) consensus, significantly more independent stakers secure the network and many more masternodes can online than with previous solutions. the daily chance for masternode node get rewarded with share blockreward is: number masternodes you hold number all masternodes governance stakenet decentralized autonomous organization that run through unbreakable rules encoded and maintained our blockchain. stakenet doesn't have centralized leader; instead created management mechanism, that takes credit for the needs all involved individuals. the stakenet selfgovernance will ensure that every proposal made the community democratically legitimatized itself. stakenet masternode owners have voting rights one masternode equals one vote. treasury the treasury cryptographically sealed public address that holds money automatically allocated the network. exactly the block rewards the treasury. it's used fund any related xsn project such further coin developments, marketing campaigns, bounties and other related use cases. centralized entity owns have access the money the treasury. obtain funds from the treasury, proposal must submitted and voted democratically the masternodes. it's effectively owned one and everyone the same time. supply the stakenet initial supply caused the swap from posw xsn. therefore, xsn were created within the genesis block. right after the swap ended, unswapped xsn coins were sent the following burning address: xmpebhrsmzethtyfyyjdnrjmcaunbc. ... blockreward breakdown the stakenet blockchain was truly fair launched with empty blockrewards for the first days, respectively for the first blocks, avoid asymmetric gains and offering everyone fair chance swap their coins and set staking nodes and masternodes. the pos block rewards will decreased step step every blocks, which timeslot around days, xsn each, down xsn. pos phase fair launch start date: .th mar. pos phase xsn pos phase xsn pos phase xsn pos phase xsn pos phase xsn pos phase xsn pos phase xsn pos phase .infinity.] xsn pos phase estimated start date: sep. since the total block reward for xsn will stabilize xsn, the supply theoretically unlimited. therefore, stakenet burns every transaction fee within the network and building businesses that provide more value xsn. either burning the profits those thus decreasing the supply our coin sending this money the treasury fund more projects, it's ensured that all profits within the stakenet ecosystem will end benefiting xsn. this proof burn mechanism fulfills the purpose counterpart the increasing supply. ... blockreward distribution the stakenet blockchain powered two types nodes: staking nodes and masternodes. believe that network security and network services are equally important have robust and powerful infrastructure, not discriminate any for their work. that's why the staker and masternodes are equally rewarded, each with the block rewards. this way don't incite false disbalance the blockchain. finally, the blockrewards are sent the treasury fund the further development stakenet. benefits bitcoin.core blockchain architecture because xsn based bitcoin.core, all the achievements bitcoin development, like segwit and the lightning network, can integrated the stakenet blockchain architecture without much effort. segwit segregated witness, called segwit, the name used for implemented soft fork change the transaction format the bitcoin.core blockchain architecture include variety functions. because most them are very technical, the following pages will summarize the benefits all these features for the stakenet ecosystem. should noticed, that segwit much more than just solution for the scaling problem segwit the smallest common denominator for any cross chain communication. this sum based bip and the current bitcoin.core. ... linear scaling sighash operations some transactions the signature hashing tends scale more quadratically than linearly, depending how these are structured. just doubling the block size transactions, you would consequently also double the amount data that needs hashed for the verification which may cause extremely longer validation time within the block generation process, especially when some these large transactions are designed maliciously. segwit solves this problem adjusting the calculation the transaction hash for signatures, removing the quadratic scaling hashed data for verifying signatures. due this change, each byte transaction never needs hashed more often than two times that the same functionality achieved much more efficiently. benefit: removing the quadratic scaling hashed data for the verification signatures, also large transactions can generated the stakenets meta network without facing the previous difficulties with the signature hashing, even those transactions are lager generated maliciously. ... signing input values before segwit was enabled, hardware wallet needed full node copy all input transactions verify the total amount being spent and sign the transaction. thus, was also necessary hash all those data ensure that false data were fed, executing withdraws from hardware devise was not particularly cheap. segwit solves this problem only hashing the input value explicitly which makes easier and safer for wallet sign the spending transaction, matter how large complicated is. benefit: hardware wallet user need pay less transaction fees for executing secure and fast withdraws. keep mind, stakenet will provide its own multicurrency hardware wallet ... increased security for multisig without segwit, multisig payments were protected due pay-to-script-hash (psh), which secured the bit hash (hash) algorithm. however, this encryption can violated well-resourced attacker, who tries find collision address through brut forcing. segwit prevents this fraudulent act using hash only for payments directly one single public key, while using improved bit hash for the psh. benefit: this feature the segwit implementation will ensure extra security for everyone paying multisig address smart contract within the stakenet network the cross chain ecosystem. ... script versioning every change the bitcoin.core script was developed ensure improved security and improved functionality. however, the script design only enables backwards-compatible changes, caused softforking, implemented replacing one the ten extra op_nop opcodes with new one. this procedure sufficient for most changes but slightly hacky (for example, op_cltv usually needs accompanied op_drop) and cannot used enable such simple features joining two strings. therefore, segwit implements version number for scripts enable even opcodes that would have required hard-fork used non-segwit transactions, just increasing the script version. benefit: making changes script opcodes easier will cause advanced scripting all bitcoin.core based blockchain architectures that supporting sidechains creating even smarter contracts using merklized abstract syntax trees (mast) can achieved much easier stakenet. ... reducing utxo growth the unspent transaction output (utxo) database maintained each fullnode blockchain review whether new transaction valid fraudulent. ensure fast efficient network, this database needs very quick query and modify. this challenge becomes even harder the more users are using the blockchain, because every new user needs have least one individual utxo entry. segwit improves the situation adjusting the signature data reducing the utxo group size least benefit: reducing the utxo size, the maintenance and the query the utxo database are reduced, which will counteract future limitations performance problems and improves the current situation for everyone, who runs fullnode within the stakenet ecosystem. ... efficiency gains when not verifying signatures bitcoin.core based blockchains not check signatures for transactions prior the most recent checkpoint default. furthermore, even some spv clients don't check signatures themselves all, because they trust the validation other nodes. however, the signature data essential proportion the entire transaction. due segwit, every node that not interested signature data can skip those data avoid downloading save resources. benefit: because more transactions are proceeded using segwit addresses, everyone who running pruned spv node the stakenet network needs less bandwidth and disk space operate. lightning one the main objectives introducing cryptocurrency was make payment processing faster and cheaper. however, mining operations started become expensive, transaction fees for bitcoin also started raising. version the technology that meant make cryptocurrency payments faster and cheaper, called lightning network, second layer solution enable off-chain transactions bitcoin.core based blockchains and expected game changer the evolution the crypto currency. solving the transaction malleability problem, segwit eliminates major barrier implement such second-layer solution, like the lightning network, top blockchain. the second-layer dependents upon the underlying architecture each blockchain, using their native smart-contract scripting languages allow for massive increase the network capacity moving the bulk transactions off chain for quick processing. once deployed across all nodes, the network will speed transaction processing and decrease their associated costs. the lightning network allows bitcoin.core based blockchains open payment channels directly between two nodes. the parties can then conduct transactions without having broadcast them the blockchain, avoiding delays and costs that result from recording those transactions each time. once the channel closed, only the resulting balances are recorded the blockchain, not the full transaction history the channel, and only then fees (can even nearly zero) were paid. there required time transaction limit required close payment channel, they can potentially remain open for even years. the major problem some criticism see, how the sidechains within the lightning network work. they move the coins second-layer system, not rely the highly congested blockchain. previous solutions, all transactions were needed process trusted third party, without having broadcast them across the entire network, which saves lot resources and time. stakenet solves this problem processing and managing these transactions trustless and decentralized masternode network called watchtowers, which provide lightning channels for the stakenet ecosystem. expect masternodes online, this will give our network robust backbone provide instant, private transactions occur and liquidity our lightning network. ... transactions for the future the advantages using the lightning network cross communicate between all blockchains within the stakenet meta network can summarized very well using the following four criteria. instant payments: lightning-fast instant payments across the entire blockchain without any limitations caused the block confirmation times. due smart contracts, the security the transactions ensured without the need on-blockchain transactions, that payment speed milliseconds seconds can achieved. scalability: allows the processing millions billions transactions per second across the network. this capability outperforms all previous legacy payment rails and attaches payment per action/click now possible without custodians third-party services. low cost: using off-blockchain transaction setting profits exceptionally low fees the lightning network. this enables completely new use cases such instant micropayments. cross blockchains: cross blockchain transactions will possible both chains are connected due compatible second layer protocol are supporting the same cryptographic hash function their own. given that, possible execute trustless transactions between different blockchains. ... powered blockchain smart contracts lightning decentralized network between several nodes which use smart contract functionality the blockchain enable instant payments between all participations. how does work? lightning dependents upon the underlying architecture each blockchain, using their native smart-contract scripting languages create secure network and allow for massive increase the network capacity moving the bulk transactions off chain for quick processing. bidirectional payment channels: first, two individuals open ledger entry the blockchain, which requires both participants for further actions. then, both parties need create transactions which refund the ledger entry their individual allocation without broadcasting this the blockchain. this entry can closed each party any time without completely trustless just broadcasting the most recent version the blockchain. they've updated their individual allocations, only the most recent version valid, which ensured smart contract. lightning network: due the creation network these two-party ledger channels, possible find path across the entire network. because all the nodes along these paths are not trusted, the payment ensured and secured using script which enforces the atomicity processing via decrementing time-locks. blockchain arbiter: because the blockchain itself acting arbiter and intermediary, even possible conduct off chain transactions with the confidence on-chain transactions. it's just like making legal contract with someone else without going any notarian, because the smart contract ensures that one can cheat. the court will only take actions the event non-cooperation prevent fraudulent behavior. trustless proof stake tpos stakenet invention and fully operational and available for everyone who owns xsn. while crypto investors currently use offline storage such ledger trezor for mere storage, tpos transforms these cold storage devices into profit generating devices which also secure the network validating the blockchain. the staking rewards flow directly the coin owner while the coins remain offline. furthermore, trustless proof stake allows people offer staking business, where merchant can stake other people's coins and generate commission-based income from the rewards created, opening new opportunities for businesses arise from our invention. background proof stake its very core, the modern banking system based simple paradigm trust. give our money banks and they provide with services return (deposits, loans and investments). while could perform these services ourselves, has proven much more convenient use this centralized, trustbased system. mitigate the potential for abuse presented such global centralized system, decentralized blockchain based assets, such bitcoin, have been introduced. secure decentralized network and ensure users cannot double-spend their funds, bitcoin utilizes proof work (pow) algorithm, which requires miners prove through distributed consensus large pool people who are geographically segregated agreeing transactions blocks that are valid/invalid added/rejected the blockchain have spent certain amount computational resources make attack the network uneconomical. the computing power required carry out the cryptographic calculations only ever increases, the difficulty increases, thus consuming greater amounts electricity. the long run, this would counterproductive the health cryptocurrency, miners would have sell substantial portions their coins for fiat currency foot the electricity bill, devaluing the price the cryptocurrency. thus, can deduced that pow networks are not financially ideal only miners can receive block rewards and transaction fees return for precious resources, whereas regular users not see any rate interest from holding their coins. this where proof stake (pos) networks come in. pos typical computer algorithm through which cryptocurrency achieves their distributed consensus. also better alternative the pow algorithm because achieves the same distributed consensus lower cost and more energy efficient way. the transaction confirmation mechanism shifts from burden proof the expenditure resources over total stake held, where transactions are confirmed simple nodes who hold large balances, and the greater the balance the user holds, the more likely they are receive fees and block rewards. while this significantly reduces the number resources required confirm transactions and effectively allows the average user see positive roi balances held, this system still requires user maintain connectivity always, have high-bandwidth connection, and for their wallets unlocked during any time, frame which all any the conditions are not met, the user skipped the network and does not receive their fair share stake rewards. previous pos solutions fully understand the meaning trustless pos, developed stakenet, necessary deal with the historical developments different blockchain variations. starting with the blockchain-family, based bitcoin.core, the consensus mechanism the pos, so-called minting, developed peercoin, will explained first. after that, the nxt's created pos variant, the so-called forging, presented with which was possible for the first time stake offline lending the own balance another node. make this possible, the nxt blockchain architecture has been redesigned from scratch and based its own core, the nxt.core. based the pos solutions peercoin and nxt, further variation the staking was then developed bitshares, the so-called delegated pos, which also enabled offline staking via democratically elected delegates. once you understand all these things, you can finally understand why trustless pos special. peercoins' minting pos the peercoin development team had the goal find consensus algorithm for digital currency that does not require much energy the previously known pow. for this purpose, the basic characteristics the bitcoin.core were assumed and, some cases, slightly modified. the pos the new type blocks special transaction called coinstake (named after bitcoin's special transaction coinbase). the coinstake transaction block owner pays himself thereby consuming his coinage (in bitcoin the coinage used only for the prioritization transactions) while gaining the privilege generating block for the network and minting for pos. therefore, new minting process introduced for pos blocks addition bitcoin's pow minting. pos-block mints coins based the consumed coin age the coinstake transaction. the protocol for determining which competing block chain wins main chain has been switched over use consumed coin age. the block chain with highest total consumed coin age chosen active chain (in bitcoin the chain with the highest accumulated pow chosen the main chain). the main criticism peercoin the use the coinage for the validation the blocks, because unspent coins can become extremely old the peercoin blockchain. result, there incentive temporarily deprive your coins the blockchain, resulting fewer stakers online protect the network. nxts' leasing pos nxt pos cryptocurrency, constructed from scratch opensource java. nxt's unique pos algorithm does not depend any implementation the coinage concept used other pos cryptocurrencies. total quantity billion available tokens were distributed the genesis block. since the full token supply already exists, nxt redistributed through the inclusion transaction fees which are awarded account when successfully creates block. this process known forging and akin the "mining" concept employed other cryptocurrencies. nxt transactions are based series core transaction types that not require any script processing transaction input/output processing the part network nodes. these transaction primitives allow core support for asset exchange, storage small data, digital goods and account control features. there are two different types nodes the nxt-network. the normal nodes and the hallmarked nodes. hallmarked node simply node that tagged with encrypted token derived from account's private key; this token can decoded reveal specific nxt account address and balance that are associated with node. the act placing hallmark node adds level accountability and trust, hallmarked nodes are more trusted than non-hallmarked nodes the network. the larger the balance account tied hallmarked node, the more trust given that node. you like stake offline, you need lease your balance trusted hallmarked node. these accounts with leased forging power generate blocks more often and earn more transaction fees, but those fees are not automatically returned lease accounts. with bit coding, however, this system allows for the creation nearly trustless forging pools that can make payouts participants. the nxt blockchain ecosystem, the trusted hallmarked nodes are responsible for block validation and all full nodes are responsible for the network services. the historic progression the nxt network has shown that hallmarked nodes with high leasing balance have become more and more powerful over time. for example, individual nodes control over the waves network, which backend nearly based the same nxt.core. bitshares' delegated pos delegated proof stake (dpos) was created new method securing pos cryptocurrency's network. dpos attempts solve the problems both bitcoin's traditional pow system, and the pos system peercoin and nxt. therefore, dpos implements layer technological democracy offset the negative effects centralization. the fundamental feature dpos that shareholders remain control. bitshares argues, that they remain control decentralized. flawed voting can be, when comes shared ownership company the only viable way. fortunately, you not like who running the company you can sell, and this market feedback causes shareholders vote more rationally than citizens. every shareholder gets vote for someone sign blocks their stead representative you will). bitshares, anyone who can gain more the votes can join the board (in lisk for example only the top eos only delegates are board). the representatives become "board directors" which take turns round-robin manner, signing blocks. these delegates are the only authoritarian individuals within the blockchain that can produce and broadcast blocks. producing block consists collecting transactions the network and signing with the delegates signing private key. delegates are also responsible for creating all network services. the biggest problem with dpos that the delegates can also get together groups. for example, the complete lisk network determined groups. the delegates have the power and decide how much they give their voters from their blockrewards, dpos blockchain ecosystem turns quickly "eat die" mentality with less privacy. introducing tpos one the main criticisms pos system has been that only maximally safe when all the coins are online and authoritative staking nodes are avoided. all previous staking and offline staking solutions could not meet these conditions. stakenet has devised solution the problems being faced users decentralized networks today: trustless proof stake. tpos essentially allows users own stake stakenet and use any other node the staking for them using their high bandwidth, continuous, connectivity, while not having share any spendable balance private keys with the node. your funds are yours and yours alone. they will safely and securely grow over time and protect the network even while you sleep. this feature was created with the intention allowing users securely stake xsn coins cold storage form hardware device and produce, validate and move blockchain the same time. increasing security for both the network and the user. stakenet was created make ecosystem that allows easy and secure offline staking increasing security for both the network and the user. for this purpose, the basic characteristics bitcoin and peercoin were assumed and some cases slightly modified. xsn uses the same core bitcoin and adjusted coinage, like peercoin for the validation new created blocks, down the trustless staking realized the invention so-called merchantnode. the requirements set merchantnode offline staking are zero. contrast all previous solutions, the merchantnodes have neither advantage the block generation and the blockrewards, nor decisive influence the blockchain. they have only the right validate the blockchain for you. just imagine you are putting your money inside virtual bank that cannot fail, get robbed, bankrupt, become insolvent shut down. just imagine you can withdraw move your funds any time, day night, questions asked, and withdrawal limits imposed. with stakenet you not send over your money, you send the right grow your money for long you like. purpose xsn tpos contract special agreement made our blockchain, which allows owner given address ("owner") give staking permission separate address ("merchant"). the owner this merchant address does not have permission move funds the tpos address, only the right stake the balance that address. the owner can move his funds out the tpos address any time, giving him complete control his funds during and throughout the execution this contract. technical documentation the tpos contract the contract special transaction with op_return that holds data specifying the terms. the contract created user sending xsn himself. this transaction will also broadcast the terms the contract the network. this xsn needs made lowest priority when user spends xsn. cancel the tpos contract the user simply needs move all his funds into new address just unlock and move the xsn, which includes all contract information. required information the tpos contract required information the contract are follows: tposaddress address owned creator contract (this balance will stake via tpos) merchantaddress owner this address will have the ability stake the balance "tpos address" commission, (value between tells the protocol how split staking rewards minted

the required fields and clicks "stake" the backend executes this for steps: generates the new tposaddress for the owner generates the tpos contract using the entered merchantaddress broadcasts the contract the network send the amount xsn the tposaddress the owner for staking staking business the stakenet blockchain was created the world's first truly trustless, profit-driven economy where everyone can offer tpos services party other individuals, who use the xsn blockchain. therefore, the xsn tpos protocol includes commission features, which makes possible for everyone run staking business. the surface, the commission simple. merchant provides service and charges fee for said services. however, our case this entire negotiation handled directly the xsn blockchain. the tpos protocol itself smart and knows exactly how split the new minted coins. all done without any human involvement through series cryptographically signed messages broadcasted when the contract first created. engineered this feature avoid predicting market rate demand but allow the two parties settle among themselves split from this will also allow alternative forms services arise, such willingly giving the merchant all the rewards exchange for certain goods. use case say merchant wants gain competitive edge and offer added services top their regular staking. so, they could instruct the owner input commission the time their tpos creation, then agree send the reward currency the owner's choice address their choice. the owner could not only staking his assets while offline but also exchanging securely and safely, without lifting finger. the exchanged rewards could hypothetically translated any form, like btc address, eth, even fiat (directly into bank account) and could used means "cashing in" owner's local currency. once these services are established, will drive large amounts traffic and attention our currency will the first and only one with this unique functionality. world with increasing regulations this effect will even more dramatic. seller ratings since the staking rewards would control the merchant, this example hidden exchange would have maintain small degree trust. believe this will easily mitigated giving the merchant rating based the quality service. any dishonesty underperformance would cost the merchant more the long run than they would gain, like the effect standard seller rating are all familiar with before making online purchase. this model works because the merchant will never enabled make off with significant amount fund. the worst scenario steals few small rewards but completely ruins his reputation doing so, and the owner not comfortable with the service can simply cancel the tpos contract and redeem his funds this discretion. comparing tpos with previous pos solutions "one the main criticisms pos system has been that this only maximally secure when all the coins are online and authoritative staking nodes are avoided." you can see now, stakenet the only staking solution, which ensures the maximum decentralization, privacy and security non-authoritarian network providing high end services ensured through masternodes for the entire ecosystem the same time. stakenet masternodes normally, launching masternode highly technical process and generally goes way beyond the scope non-technical user's abilities. stakenets masternodes platform will solve this issue providing simple implement masternode hosting service that allows users launch masternode with incredible ease and advanced technical ability required. masternodes bonded validator systems can simply termed the servers cryptocurrency. stakenet masternode can any computer that runs virtual private server (vps) and has the stakenet wallet with xsn collateral number coins required run the masternode. unlike normal nodes that help the miner generating new coins, stakenet masternodes are utilized for verifying transactions, voting system mechanism, etc. way, the masternode serves the stakenet blockchain well other blockchains that will integrated via cross-chain support. for users, who not understand the complex mechanisms cryptocurrency trading and still want have passive cryptocurrency income, owning masternode means that they are involved and making gains even when not trading. stakenet masternodes are dedicated hardware nodes that reside servers around the world ensure network decentralization and needed redundancy. masternodes serve critical role adding selfgoverning, service-providing layer the network well supporting the stakenet vision and mission statement performing network-related functions. trustless proof stake essentially allows users own stake xsn and have merchants the staking for them using their high-bandwidth continuous connectivity (to ensure maximal rewards distribution) while not having share any spendable balance private keys with the merchant. your funds are yours and yours alone and will safely and securely grow over time even while you sleep. how xsn masternodes work? each masternodes will store exact replica the stakenet blockchain, thus allowing average users use thin spv web, phone, and pc/mac wallets. statistically speaking, the average user will tend want use thin wallets for greater usability. achieve the mass adoption, have planned reduced barrier entry will need introduced our users. masternodes help eliminate the requirement for running copy the blockchain user's machine wallets will connect masternodes directly and securely. masternodes will require set amount stakenet coins collateral, fully redeemable should the owner ever wish take their node offline. this reduce the financial viability performing malicious attacks the network setting malicious nodes well guarantee that only stakeholders the stakenet network can vote proposals, thus ensuring their quality. the stakenet project regards user anonymity and financial privacy core value. for global payment network ready for mass adoption, payments between users must confidential and untraceable, public address used store funds cannot reveal user's balance. illustrate this point, failing will result vendors' inability set prices and negotiate effectively both suppliers and customers will able see their transaction history, what they charge and what they pay. this clearly undesirable outcome that seek prevent. masternode config xsn core allows controlling multiple remote masternodes from single wallet. the wallet needs have valid collateral output coins for each masternode and uses configuration file named masternode.conf which can found the following data directory (depending your operating system): windows: %appdata%\xsncore\ mac os: ~/library/application support/xsncore/ unix/linux: ~/.xsncore/ masternode.conf space separated text file. each line consists alias, address followed port, masternode private key, collateral output transaction and collateral output index. example: >aliasip:portmasternode private keycollateral output transaction idcollateral output index independent securing entities (ise) the network get cor defined above, too. the silent mass the coin holders gets cor with the above formula. let assume hypothetical coin with coins available. the attacker managed accumulate it, are the independent entities and are divided the common holders. the stake the attacker and his influence the network thereby is: .). the attacker this scenario already has the active stake the network. take consideration that most pos ecosystems don't have independent security entities attack becomes very plausible scenario. but what the motivation behind that? course, any attacker would harm himself doing any attack like this, but would probate instrument killing potential rivals early stage where the money needed for attack like this nothing that really matters. look the formula can determine two possibilities defend against attacks. the first would increase the activeness the broadly distributed masses the coins. but then psychology kicks and those people (take the enthusiasts for granted) will not willing keep their machines running all year (e. power costs) they were just looking for that investment give them their new muscle car fast. also, the populace will never willing pay for pure payment system and its security (at least not directly). the second possibility the installation ises, but these would consume coins and could lead high inflation due limited coin supply the exchanges. all all, pos already has excelled pow, but also becomes clear; need motivate the average person keep his coins online secure the network! ... delegated proof stake the most obvious idea solve that problem integrate independent entity perform validation and signing new blocks. that entity needs trustworthy and reliable. delegated proof-of-stake (dpos) tried achieve this porting the principle democracy pos coin ecosystem. dpos the power seen held the populace like real world democracy. but, reality just consensus empower the richest and suppress the network. the more coins you own, the more votes you have select delegate (even yourself). other words: the more coins you own, the less democratic the entire blockchain. those coin owners elect two types entities: the delegates, which propose and realize change requests affecting the network total. they don't receive any compensation for their duty. change implemented depends the final vote the coin holders. the witnesses, which perform control tasks and sign new blocks. there defined upper number witnesses and they are elected all coin owners. the winners the election are chosen the best ratio up-votes from different voters (the more the merrier). witnesses are compensated for their duty receiving share transaction fees. the compensation set the delegates. does this really solve all the problems pos ecosystems? for sure doesn't. based the democratic principle only works out flawlessly ideal world. the world itself not ideal, dpos inherits all flaws modern democracy should better say politics? most its security features can easily annulled: the election process the witnesses relies the idea, that witness that gets voted wide spectrum the populace coin owners must trustworthy. all crypto currencies are dependent anonymity their actors (mainly marketing feature) the determination the different actors just their wallet address and the coins held there. the voting process shall prevent the voting adverse actors and thus the witness with the highest count votes automatically selected. how break it? you're attacker, you just need split your coins different wallets and your vote gets more weight. the system can't determine that all those wallets belong the same actor must assume the witness you voted for the best interest the populace. the election process delegates relies the idea, that delegates are elected the populace coin holders. let oppose this with real world example: common election any major western country has participation quota some have more, some have less, and are talking about government elections here! now ask yourself: will the populace willing actively take part the election process witnesses and delegates system the average person uses just for payment? will they monitor those technical proposals? will they recheck which blocks their elected witnesses sign? how shall the populace determine those nameless delegates and witnesses are performing they should? how break it? there need break something which broken default. the reason the human mind and its integration the modern world. dpos ecosystem will perfectly work community mainly consisting enthusiasts which are willing spend much time controlling their delegates and witnesses. crypto currency ecosystem aimed the populace with the build-up see the world today will tend have the same centralization power like any modern democracy paired with lobbying and hidden interests. you don't believe look the newspaper and current scandals politics. dpos advantages: adds two pseudo independent entities for controlling duties and signing new blocks perfect system for ecosystem dominated enthusiasts featuring common sense and deep knowledge dpos disadvantages: danger attack enhanced because only small number entities needs corrupted tends get centralized time goes security the network directly attached the witnesses and delegates shares the same flaws with modern politics the populace that ecosystem (coin holders) may not willing spent time elections for payment system sum up: dpos nice idea and will for sure work you have enough enthusiasts your ecosystem. real world application interaction with the populace will not work out and will even more exposed attacks. ... trustless proof stake trustless proof-of-stake (tpos) type consensus which implemented xsn (stakenet) for the first time solve all the shortcomings pure pos and dpos crypto currencies. aimed activating the populace secure the network using coins offline (cold storage) wallets and eliminating the need vote election processes. its core stakenet also pos based crypto currency. the pos consensus the block generation done with special transaction, called coinstake. this transaction the coin owner pays himself thereby consuming his coinage (up h), while gaining the privilege generation block for the network. the first input the coinstake transaction called kernel. doing so, must satisfy specific hash target protocol, turning the generation pos blocks stochastic process. the hash target that the coinstake transaction must satisfy defined target per unit coin age that needs reached, before it's subsequently consumed the kernel. contrast proof work solutions the hashing operation done over limited search space instead unlimited one. therefore, the block generation time within the stakenet seconds, while the difficulty retargeting set minutes, avoid such long adjustment periods, like the bitcoin blockchain. pos based ecosystem need deal with the problems identified that context and need find way mitigate them. stakenet and tpos this by: implementing ise which called the treasury. the block rewards are passed the treasury which cryptographically sealed public address. this always-online wallet reasonable amount coins always online and staking thereby securing the network. this poses additional hindrance for attackers trying achieve majority. tpos coin holder can keep his coins cold storage but can pass the staking rights merchant node. thereby all coins affected tpos contract are counted "hot" and can actively take part the process securing the network. contrast dpos the populace the ecosystem profits handing over their staking rights merchant node because the merchant node rewards them for doing with part the staking rewards the merchant node. this psychological effect because humans tend interact with things they can benefit from also the process signing tpos contract much more easily achieved than voting delegates and witnesses. centralization coins prevented dividing each block reward three parts. staking nodes receive masternodes receive and the treasury receives possible attacker now has participate the staking nodes and the masternodes accumulate coins passively. the treasury out his reach. each masternode needs collateral xsn coins recognized. this shared distribution actively reduces the free float xsn coins every masternodes bind million coins. you assume that the coins are bound the treasury and currently masternodes exist, you already set upper limit free float coins roughly total least coins are always-online masternodes and the treasury. achieve cor the free float coins using the merchant nodes and their reward scheme have cor the whole ecosystem consider this the lower limit needed secure the network! tpos advantages: coins cold storage are actively securing the ecosystem cold storage coin holders will still receive rewards for holding their coins danger way less compared pow/pos dpos populace the coin ecosystem gets motivated participate reward scheme tpos disadvantages: stakenet the first implementation this idea tpos not accepted the populace shares the same risks with normal pos crypto currencies security summary attacks pose real problem for all pos based crypto currencies and its variants. everyone stating his system totally immune against that attack scenario not telling the truth. stakenet identified the shortcomings other pow and pos ecosystems and did its best mitigate them. course, can't assure you total security, because actor company the sector can that. but are convinced that stakenet and its trustless proof-of-stake the best technology available currently build safe and sane ecosystem for everyone including the whole populace! also, every security expert knows today, that security application depends the hardware/software and not even more important the social aspect the users that system. you can have the best firewall and encryption one the users successfully attacked social engineering (like phishing). therefore, stakenet relies technical security but also pays attention the social aspect because even simple phishing campaign for the coins the users your network can the first indicator attack. finally, stakenet the only solution that allows users delegate the right grow their funds without needing hand over custody over them. this groundbreaking technology and cannot seen anywhere else. using dedicated blockchain, stakenet records each user's balance and stores forever until they choose move around. the stakenet blockchain cryptographically secure meaning that one can access anyone's funds unless they have their private key (unique password). furthermore, the stakenet network fully decentralized meaning not owned any party who can choose arbitrarily change the rules. cross chain communication the value blockchain its concept immutability. this strength however brings real world complexities difficult manage use cases, blockchain was not conceived adapt easily and faces challenges working with rigid models limiting its agility. for new breakthrough adopted, coin must often change its "rules" and undergo what called "hard fork". large network this can very damaging requires consensus amongst all nodes run new software, possibly fragmenting its community and sometimes changing its history. there also nothing stop forks from occurring again and again any point the future, diluting coin's value and market capitalization. there may solutions however using recently developed technologies and advancements. this abstract will discuss few. can achieve these goals, would give teams better and smoother model conduct operations. through this mechanism ccpos, stakenet creating programing protocols that themselves will interact with the 'rules' separate chains other than their own. this ability would allow communities utilize new technology, inventions and advancements ensuring they are able adapt and adopt easily well remain competitive. how get there? requirement and first step towards chain participating this cross chain "meta network" will the ability autonomously swap fluidly back and forth between assets trustless instant manner. will first transform our chain into multi-currency wallet which will enable hold, send and receive balances and will provide with our solid foundation. this foundation will allow smooth transitions into cross chain capabilities and thereafter this functionality will enabled onto our chain known decentralized exchange (dex). atomic swaps atomic swapping might the closest thing magic have experienced thus far. allows any user one blockchain 'swap' his asset with peer has never met completely different chain trustless, instant, and with little fee involved. also the closest solution protecting privacy while acquiring and trading assets. there catch however atomic swaps still require assets "hot" and nature all information associated with these transactions are required public for work properly. this step the right direction peer peer system much more secure than centralized point exchange, but still not perfect system. not difficult spot identities market, and with that being considered figure user may not want spend transact any more than necessary these platforms. xsn will have compatible off chain network our own, our features can utilized provide extra value this network. this where our chain comes into play instantly atomic swapping into xsn tpos address, your newly swapped funds will automatically safe offline and gain interest, without the need perform extra steps sending, receiving, activation any kind. rewards gained from these addresses can also exchanged into different currency your choice. for example, alice owns bitcoin but desires have xsn instead generate passive income, she would need sign exchange, which provides trusted trading services third-party. however, with atomic swaps, bob owns xsn and likes take his profits bitcoin instead, then bob and alice could make trade without any need trusted third party due the trustless atomic swaps feature, provided stakenet. prevent any fraudulent behavior, our atomic swaps utilizes what known hash time-locked contracts (htlcs). htlcs enforce that the entire atomic swap process truly trustless ensuring both trading parties fulfill the requirements the swap. htlcs forces the recipient payment acknowledge the receiving payment within set timeslot generating cryptographical proof, call proof payment. otherwise the recipient risks losing his right the claim the set trading conditions execute the swap. our trade example between alice and bob, consequently both parties need submit their transaction their respective blockchain (alice the bitcoin blockchain, bob the xsn blockchain). for alice claim bobs' xsn, she must produce number that only known her generate the cryptographic hash value provide her proof payment. for bob claim alice bitcoin, must specify the same number used alice, generate the cryptographic hash provide his proof payment. entitling htlc linking two blockchains together, the lightning network can entitled linking payment channels between the involved blockchains. transact with each other, alice and bob must linked through these payment channels., which are provided the lightning network. cross chain proof stake atomic swap essentially proof user proving has transferred funds from one account another and thus its contract terms are satisfied. verification mechanism the other end observing making sure the first user does act honestly and true his promise. all good the contract can execute, not they are able refute cancelling the contract. using this method, user could also move funds himself proving owns stake the chains currency. this proof could broadcasted chain (and verified using atomic swap functionalities) that our user does indeed possess stake the chain. the second chain's protocol might then allow for appropriate response considering this 'proof stake'. this could the form unlocking privileges, rewards access special features. ownership the first chain could even used "fuel" for its sister chains, creating hierarchy while avoiding fragmentation. this would increase the origins (st chain's) value greatly any new advancements can adopted into the ecosystem, using the stability, infrastructure and community from the original chain. what would result intra-network blockchains call "inter chain clusters". interchain cluster these clusters have interdependent traits one another, giving additional value users within given network. they still would however able communicate, sync, and partake all other features allowed through those running lightning network. the lightning network analogous "internet" allowing communication different blockchains, this would like 'lan' group local chains having special rules relative one another, but also able communicate the outside world. because lightning nodes are custom built each chain, one could reprogram and construct rules from scratch with specialized interdependence mind. long the new chains have code both lightning compatible well cluster compatible will allow room for flexibility all other aspects building and programming for experimentation and invention. this will allow new technologies quickly integrated framework will exist satisfying all pre-requirements needed allowing developers room operate quickly and freely. should stress that this goes radically beyond the concept icos being run the ethereum chain for example, new projects wouldn't restricted being token-based solutions the same chain. instead, they'd have their own chains, and subsequent chains for secondary purposes, with virtually unlimited flexibility. they'd 'tethered' our main chain holders, masternode operators, and core team members will all benefit. why has this not been done? one the main limitations atomic swaps the user must have blockchains his own well that which intends interact with verify the terms his contract are met. needs both, can physically refute terms are not met allow execute sees nothing wrong. this method causes limitations however human needed for this entire process function. for cross chain proof stake possible requires complete autonomy the part the protocol. our case utilizing masternode functionalities both monitor and verify will solve this issue. allowing masternodes contain databases party chains, (specifically our sister chains) while watching for and verifying specific actions allows autonomously cross chain communicate via the protocol. addition ccpos this would also enable ability for users "light-swap" (atomic swap without having entire blockchain) directly our protocol, without the need party centralized service. delegating ccpos responsibilities masternodes would also provide added income stream new fees and rewards would exist associated with these cross-chain verifications. sister chain increases popularity and demand, roi main chain masternodes would rise proving your stake chain would the only way unlock given actions chain utilizing our masternodes would the only way accomplish this proof. maintaining agility world open source, can difficult protect new innovations from being forked, spun, and implemented new and sometimes better models. diverge from traditional ownership (patents, copyrights, ... must learn preserve value this new environment. better could this done through engineering protocols themselves respond original decentralized master chains. the result would not centralized control but hierarchical control (hc) with masternode owners from origin chain determining the direction, development, and purpose the given inter chain cluster. platforms will soon rise eclipsing bitcoin, and ability for chains adapt and evolve will critical, those that cannot will fade, replaced and forgotten. will see chains begin combine into greater cohesive bodies where its core lies decentralized system growing proportionately with breakthroughs and advancements the greater field cryptocurrency. rather than combat disruption will position ourselves adopt disruption our community will secure future value and exposure new trends simply holding our asset, and our masternode owners will also benefit their added service verifying these cross-chain proof stakes would increase fees, rewards, and overall roi giving definitive value moving forward. xsn businesses stakenet building businesses that provides even greater value xsn. either burning the profits these businesses thus decreasing the supply our coin sending this money the treasury fund more projects, it's ensured that all profits within the stakenet ecosystem will end benefiting xsn. the stakenet team building platform which users would able keep their holdings safe, stake their major pos (proof stake) coins, and trade coins via decentralized exchange (dex) all one single place. for existing solutions get staking rewards for your pos coins, you need run the wallet(s) and keep online continuously which most users find unpleasant. xsn solves this problem providing secure environment store your coins and stake them the same time, you not have keep your computer running. the picture below preview the user's graphical interface access our businesses and manage his funds. businesses include the "xsn cloud" the "xsn decentralized exchange" powered the stakenet masternodes whom will directly earn all the fees from it, effectively owning exchange where you will trade your coins truly decentralized, secure and anonymous way. also, the "xsn dapp framework" (decentralized application) that will enable third parties develop powerful tools provide their services and for stakenet, the "xsn hardware wallet", allowing you store and operate with your coins safely within our very own hardware wallet. because the stakenet economy powered our native currency, xsn will used pay for all these services within our ecosystem. xsn coin xsn digital money that powers the stakenet economy. can used pay for all the services and products within our ecosystem. created with the future mind, uses the most secure pos blockchain with our trustless proof stake consensus and lightning network compatible, allowing instant and virtually fee less transactions with output billions theoretically infinite transactions per seconds. xsn has cross chain (between different blockchains) capabilities. so, will able interact with any other coin. this opens wide broad opportunities. for example, our cross chain proof stake (ccpos) technology will allow you stake xsn and earn the rewards bitcoin (btc) trustlessly, with intermediates risks involved. due the lightning network, you will able seamlessly pay anyone any currency just having xsn, e.g. automatically pay invoices btc using your xsn. our objective for xsn the only coin you ever need own and the most secure one always being able operate with trustless environment. you can generate xsn staking your coins, providing merchantnode enable trustless cold staking for others running masternode. summary, you earn xsn securing providing services the stakenet network. xsn cloud this expansion anticipation the launch our official "staking service" platform stakenet.io, where you will able trustlessly stake xsn, regular stake major pos coins, host masternodes and execute atomic swaps via our coming decentralized exchange built with xsn masternodes. the future will move towards platform centered, trustless utility and cross chain developments. introducing "xsn cloud", the new generation coin staking. believe proof stake coins are the future, created suite staking tools you can capitalize on. profits from 'xsn cloud' will burnt sent the treasury further benefit xsn. multi currency wallet: storing your coins online wallet and benefit from group staking. you will receive staking rewards, matter how much coins you are staking. pooled staking: your coins, stored the xsn cloud, will automatically stake. earn staking rewards every few minutes matter how many coins you have. pooled masternodes: share ownership and rewards masternode even you don't have enough coins for it. hereby wipe out all barriers enable you earn profits. masternodes service: setup and maintain your masternodes. notice, you are still always control your coins, while earning profits for providing network services. tpos marketplace: find the best merchants stake your coins trustlessly. stakenet.io will monitor merchant contracts and let you rate them based your experience. monitoring services: monitor all your masternodes (even the ones you are not running with us) and your trustless proof stake contracts. make sure your masternodes and tpos contracts are working properly, you will notified via email case something goes wrong. xsn decentralized exchange the power and implications decentralized exchange are often overlooked. the ability morph assets instantly from one chain another trustless manner gives massive power the individuals given system well the system itself. think how difficult convert assets our current financial model, let alone done peer-to-peer nearly impossible. this point exchanges have been swapping assets tailored specifically for accredited institutions oversee central authorities they have been financial vehicles and not much more. due utility traits tokens and the fact that ownership never conceded, the entire definition "exchange" changes. when user executes exchange for example, will empower him instantly with all features and functions that come with the resulting swap. when sleeping, working, cooking, driving etc there will certain chains that enhance different human experiences. given individuals net worth will constantly evolving form accommodate its owner the most efficient way possible. xsn sees the future wealth new light alive, intimately involved enhancing our lives real-time way that has never been realized yet. understand there will different utility needed different situations and rather than compete with new tech, will engineer ourselves integrate new chains easily into our system. cryptocurrency exchanges are the backbone the crypto currency market. they provide liquidity and the ability trade your coins. the main problem with the current centralized exchange structure is, they are generally run from one central server one location. also, you are forced provide personal information, that's required for set account. coins that are sent centralized exchange are longer your coins. you simply get normal ticket represent your deposit coins tokens. owners not benefit from any utilities features the coins. they even not earn any staking rewards. furthermore, security can big issue for centralized exchanges, because they can hacked easier shut down the governance. all your coins hold centralized exchange can lost any time. these present unnecessary risks that stakenet aims solve with its own upcoming decentralized exchange, also known dex. when using stakenets dex your coins never leave your position and you have unlimited access them any time. so, you benefit from all utilizes and features your coins and tokens offer you, including staking rewards. you remain anonymous you not need submit any personal informations create account. the dex cannot shut down any third party, even stakenet cannot shut down once it's and running. all trades are done peer peer basis and require centralized middle man process the transactions. this means more security for all users and lower fees. you are maybe asking yourself: aren't there lots dex's out there? and you right there are some dex's but all them have one week point centralization. they are run several servers several locations, but all these servers are still owned one company. contrast all previous solutions, the stakenet dex will the first the worlds running entirely masternodes and not just supported masternodes. so, won't have any those week points limitations. while centralized exchanges have control over your coins, stakenets dex will empower users trade simply and easy while maintaining absolute control over that coins, therefore using stakenets dex not only much safer, it's also cheaper, faster and more reliable. furthermore, all current dex's are just built from technical point view and not from trading perspective. silly things happen, like orders are violated and simple order types that exist more established markets are not options, for example stop-limit orders. stakenet aware the trader's needs, our dex will offer you all state the art order types and all needed tools for technical analysis. xsn decentralized application dapp abbreviation for decentralized application. the backend code our dapps will running the stakenet's decentralized peer peer network. the dapps frontend code and users interface can written any language that can make calls the backend. the stakenet's dapp framework will enable parties develop powerful tools provide their service and for stakenet. imagen world, where you get payed for providing content the stakenet ecosystem without anything left do. imagen world, where people use your self-developed application based the stakenet blockchain and reward you with tips. imagen world, where bank needed grow your money. that world not far away. cryptocurrency and blockchain became more than just store value. paradigm shift the way price software models has approached. first, bitcoin made trust the value immutable and fungible encrypted piece code. now its time sneak the future: interchain ecosystem supported dapps. although there consistent definition dapp, dapp essentially characterized these four properties: decentralized. all records the dapps operation should stored encrypted blockchain, which avoids exclusive rights truly decentralized. protocol. the community needs agree hash algorithm and consensus proof the store value. for example, bitcoin use proof work and sha, while stakenet uses proof stake, trustless proof stake and the algorithm. open source.: ideally, dapp should managed autonomously. all changes must made only consensus majority. therefore, necessary that the codebase open source. incentivized. nobody works only for the idealism. that's why the validators, which protect the blockchain need rewarded block rewards, known cryptographic coins tokens. the ever-increasing adaptation the blockchain will make many previously known business areas and activities obsolete. even looks strange, especially the financial services, like banks are threatening replaced trust-less and decentralized networks near future. the xsn dapps will play important role advancing this decoupling the traditional banks and financial services. xsn hardware multicurrency wallet the xsn hardware multicurrency wallet securely programmed device that stores your private keys the cryptocurrencies you own. this private key needed, sign your transactions and well recover your address, known wallet.dat. using hardware wallet execute transactions, your private keys are always isolated from your wallet, even you are connected the internet. advantages hardware wallets general: private keys are never exposed your computer. the hardware immune computer viruses. your hardware requires you confirm transaction your device hardware wallets are encrypted with pin, which adds another layer security. the software open source which allows users validate the entire operation the device. hardware wallets can store multiple cryptocurrencies. special features only provides the stakenet multi currency hardware wallet: cold staking xsn and receive cross chain proof stake rewards any other currency you desire cold storage exchanging from our hardware wallet convert assets with complete security provided hardware wallet. the use hardware wallet can clarified once more the following scenario: let's say you inadvertently download malware onto your computer. once you open your stakenet desktop wallet, because you not use our hardware wallet, your coins are risk because your private keys are now exposed the hacker. here are three ways how the attacker might steal your xsn coins: your wallet isn't encrypted, the hacker can set remote command send your xsn specific address his choice, soon you open your desktop wallet. your wallet isn't encrypted with very strong password, the hacker can try encode your encryption brut forcing. this just matter time for him. your wallet encrypted with very strong password, still can watch your screen see you accidentally reveal your private keys your wallets password the screen. once sees this, can steal your xsn. all these options will not threat for you, you use the xsn multicurrency hardware wallet. keep mind, our hardware wallet will enable you store more cryptocurrencies then just xsn. that way provide you solution ensure the safety all your funds. xsn will dedicating hardware division solve the problem and bridge the gap between the blockchain digital world and the real world. these devices will more than just wallet they will the user's medium access the features all supported blockchains. xsn future use cases future use cases and business cases for the stakenet are theoretically unlimited. below are two more examples stakenet service briefly addressed xsn rental market place rental marketplace integrated with the internet things(iot) technology allows peer peer connectivity between landlords and tenants enabling them rent out acquire houses rooms best possible rates without deduction any service fee hidden charges. furthermore, works medium dispute resolutions ensuring both parties agree and act certain set defined rules. xsn service hiring job market built xsn network platform that allows customers find quality services from across the globe. uses and smart contract technology address dispute resolution and ensure the client delivered what they have paid for. revolving stake bonus citizens the globe, are most likely familiar with process called 'inflation'-- common effect governments and their ability print and increase the money supply. although, its meaning may get distorted through its use politics, simple understand every holder the currency the time this money creation (by choice not) transferring value from their personal holdings the time this money creation (by choice not) transferring value from their personal holdings the destination these newly created monies end up. collective transfer wealth and extremely efficient form taxation. the opposite inflation (deflation) can just powerful, simply working reverse. provides efficient method transferring wealth from one singular point all holders the currency that time, form "reverse taxation". deflation the method using which stakenet rewards its coin holders, executing this via the rsb mechanism. rsb "revolving stake bonus" will build and support xsn businesses network business whose proceeds are sent their respective and assigned burner addresses. the scope these operations will limited properly incentivize businesses perform the 'proof burn'. unlike modern nation states, where governments are the sole executors the national monetary policies, xsn's monetary policy based hard-coded rules and consensus via our masternodes--any decisions how inflation used left the ones with large stakes. group people, whether elected otherwise can unleash tragedy the commons. the possibilities that arise from this proof burn model are limitless, with the very highest ones being prioritized and pursued strategic partnership and adoption level the early stages. this made possible due xsn's unique economic model via our rsb coupled with treasury and api integration, creating powerful multi-layer financial protection and growth for its holders. over the next few years will see boundaries pushed the disruption these self-governing communities have not just their respective organizations but greater society. there, then, can suite applications built top these addresses-- analyzing real time-- the health and statistics the ecosystem. holders will track exactly how much value these bonuses provide directly from within our wallet and which organizations are providing them. there are many models and layers you can build this framework, let's start with popular one financial services. all profits will given back xsn coin owners one way another. some options being explored are coin buyback-burns and air drops existing coin owners. other options will distributing the service- and transaction-fees all involved parties. least xsn will reward coin holders via rsb mechanism, which proof burn technology for service- and business-provider who use the xsn network.

important understand the effects that blockchain will have the world traditional financial services especially hedge funds. are living one the most disruptive eras growth human history, with massive amounts wealth being generated relatively short periods time. hedge fund model perfectly positioned capitalize hyper-growth industries, they have appropriate risk assessment and diversification models benefit from these gains taking place. our treasury (~.% the total xsn market cap month) controlled our masternode holders could, theory, behave individual client chosen hedge fund. through our budget/ proposal system, fund managers would accept principal from our masternode holders and provide transparent portfolio with auditable gains and losses. once their proposal approved, (the community) assign them burner address, which they use send their agreed upon proceeds. there would little incentive for fund manager 'run away' with our budget since work with reputable names rsb provides transparency and trust. for the fund manager, this will result larger budget approvals for that given individual firm time goes on. there will also reinventions these funds along with all other financial service models. one that could soon start see 'anonymous' hedge funds, where the individual identities are concealed but their brands are reputable, verifiable, and public. just like immutable blockchain being released the wild, could see portfolios released getting popular whose origins are not traceable but results famous. stakenet ventures common problem arising amongst treasuries the oversight. difficult find model (outside delegating core team members themselves) that allows ongoing diligence after budget paid. this causes inefficiencies, delays, and losses for investors. this current structure also limited shorter terms (months vs. years) and problematic for projects requiring long-term development and growth. firm bit more dynamic hedge fund deals with long-term business development, equity distribution, and higher risk/ reward ratios. focusing development that services the stakenet community, however, will strengthen our long-term position and growth coupled with more traditional treasury operations. using equity distribution mechanisms the blockchain, coupled with smart contracts, ownership can distributed accordingly end users via the rsb burn, passing the value the average users. stakenet services staking services, pools, masternode hosting etc. will easily integrate with our rsb model and will the first arise. our proof concept will our very own xsncoin.io, whereby integration our api into the wallet, will not only able provide information the rsb address, but also statistics relating servers, nodes, and other relevant operations users and investors directly, real time. imagine having interface where you can see data each bonus address, showing you not only the health and statistics the given business but also the rewards providing the holders the currency well. incentivized prizes why the free market efficient? because individuals are racing get prize profits. they will put time, energy, and pain get them. can use this economic principle and put steroids offering 'x' amount from our treasury whoever solves given problem, adds feature, builds service that helps our community. the prize big enough, there will multiple teams competing against each other, building entire businesses just obtain the prize alone. could track the progress everyone from within our rsb interface, giving real-time data and statistics they race against each other the finish. stakenet community know, how important committed community is, will introduce you right now community based services for the stakenet ecosystem. xsn

currency, because the controversy inherent both. digital art frequently snubbed the traditional art world. when artists first started using computers instead palette and brushes, critics were less than impressed. such elitism unsurprising; impressionist paintings were almost universally loathed before they were beloved. thankfully, highbrow opinions digital art are changing, albeit slowly. the rise digital currencies unfolding similar manner. first, digital currencies were considered worthless. next, they were deemed the purview criminals. now, firms are falling over themselves fund the
