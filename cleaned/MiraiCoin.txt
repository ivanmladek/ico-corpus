t'-'t,!co white paper ... mirai: a-look into the future mirai payments: decentralized payment integrations mirai ar: decentralized augmented reality platform abstract mainstream adoption issue that relevant for all cryptocurrencies this point time. are the cusp the blockchain revolution. where all industries will affected blockchain technology and none will remain unchanged. there are obstacles that have slowed the momentum adoption. this whitepaper details the development paths that mirai will follow effort achieve mainstream adoption. mirai will apply key strategies designed further this goal, based around the conviction that mainstream adoption will come from ease use and the underlying blockchain technology need never considered the end user. this tenet will applied the development the mirai apps for android and ios. the apps will fully functional with zero knowledge blockchain cryptocurrency. mri will used, bought earned the same manner that other games might offer gold gems. incentives the form mri and social rewards will available every user, through the option create and add content the platform. again, the focus here ease use, with drag and drop assets and intuitive editing tools. this includes the ability link websites, images and videos into content. for those not afraid delve deeper, advanced editing options will also available. for developers, coding options will available allowing for the creation mini games, interactive displays and app extensions. all levels, there incentive contribute the network and earn mri. table contents abstract

roadmap............................................................................................. mirai look into the future there doubt that blockchain technology increasingly gaining traction the business world. there are clear advantages for companies that adopt blockchain technology providing enhanced security, transparency, increased speed, efficiency, greater automation and reduced costs. some the largest and most respected companies the world are now developing blockchain networks. yet blockchain based cryptocurrency has not enjoyed the same level positive sentiment. the prevailing views cryptocurrency range from 'too difficult' 'too volatile.' opinions are also colored the volume reports cryptocurrency fraud, theft and other illegal uses. testament the resilience blockchain technology that cryptocurrency has not only survived, but still moving towards mainstream adoption. there are currently approximately million bitcoin addresses with non-zero balance existence. many users own multiple non-zero balance addresses. even with the unrealistic assumption non-zero address per user, the current number bitcoin users stands the global population. removing lost addresses and multiaddress users, this figure could low .%. with current global adoption between clear that there massive potential for exponential growth adoption rates and value. there large core group cryptocurrency enthusiasts that believe the future cryptocurrency decentralized system that cannot controlled any one country entity and cannot stopped laws central authorities. these people believe that responsibility for individuals money, should rest with that person alone. from this core group has grown much larger group early adopters. businesses, investors and speculators that see the potential cryptocurrency. this group heralds the beginning mainstream adoption, but there are still major obstacles: the perception blockchain technology something that difficult understand. the perception that the main purpose cryptocurrency enable fraud and illegal activities. this paper describes mirai coins strategies for reducing the effect these obstacles and provides look into the future mirai coin. core values it's core, mirai payment coin, developed with the potential gain position amongst the top alt coins. this core value remains unchanged. mirai will continue function payment coin with fast and stable network built masternode and proof stake protocols. development will continue accelerated pace with focus website, app, api and payment platform integrations. business business (bb and business consumer (bc tools will developed for easier blockchain integration and advanced statistical analysis. the final goal provide suite tools and applications that require almost zero technical knowledge launch, use and understand. this branch development will named mirai payments. mirai coin information mirai coin blockchain based masternode and proof stake coin. blocks are generated every minutes with reward coins per block, reducing over time. masternode holders are rewarded coins) the block reward for supporting the network and processing transactions. this network will invaluable creating stable transaction processing base for mirai ar. proof stake rewards users that hold mri their wallets. this also expands the capabilities the network providing additional transaction verification. proof stake rewards holders, proportional the amount they hold. the proof stake reward amount fixed coins (reducing specific block numbers). holders more coins receive rewards sooner with minimum staking time (maturity) hours. coin supply mirai very low supply coin. the current supply mirai coins. these were sent unrecoverable burn address effectively removing them from circulation, leaving current true circulating supply coins. the maximum supply mirai million coins. coin supply expected reach million coins million circulating) the year mirai supply over time dual development paths mirai launches its vision for the future augmented reality with the creation this whitepaper. the mirai development team will expanded enable dual development paths that complement each other. this will allow for the integration key features from mirai payments through augmented reality apps which will created under the brand name mirai ar. features from the mirai (payments team will applied mirai ar, while mirai will provide greater volume and liquidity mirai coin. *mirai payments and mirai will simultaneously use mirai mri currency. augmented reality augmented reality the merging the physical world with the digital. relatively new technology, that has previously been impeded the technological limits mobile devices. until recently mobile devices didn't have the spatial awareness map out surface planes which one the basic requirements providing seamless augmented reality experience. augmented reality came the forefront with the release and viral uptake pokemon go(c). pokemon go(c) however, barely scratched the surface what technologically possible with augmented reality. the potential applications for augmented reality are not just limited games. fact augmented reality has the potential revolutionary and disruptive blockchain technology. augmented reality enables mobile devices function hand held portal, offering freedom from the constraints the screen dimensions. with wearables such augmented reality glasses, this freedom expanded. estimated that the global augmented and virtual reality market revenue could reach high billion with augmented reality receiving estimated market share. augmented reality games one the most popular applications augmented reality the field mobile gaming. all the creative markets, the majority new projects consist augmented reality games. augmented reality education education through augmented reality offers unprecedented level interaction. various studies performed the education industry have shown that interactive augmented reality applications have decreased learning times much while increasing applied skills and retention over for non-creative markets, augmented reality education second only one other field: the automotive, aerospace and manufacturing industry. augmented reality manufacturing recent statistics show that the manufacturing industry leading the way terms both augmented reality application development and spending the augmented reality sector. this not surprising considering the results several studies performed the industry. aircraft manufacturer was able decrease the maintenance time required identify and replace specific faulty parts aircrafts from hours just hours with the addition augmented reality support application. other studies indicate similar results. augmented reality entertainment and events the entertainment industry, augmented reality can used tool enable enhanced interaction through visual cues, information and additional media. augmented reality retail very promising field the application augmented reality the retail sector. spending research and development experiencing massive growth this industry. augmented reality the retail sector offers all the benefits the internet providing sales information and advertising opportunities with the additional benefit being available site retail locations with the use geo-tagging and visual markers such codes and specific image recognition. augmented reality social media augmented reality social media provides unprecedented level interaction and personalization. social media content can posted online and also location. photos from location could shared other users, either can see those images augmented reality when they visit the same location. this also impacts the retail sector with the ability view media location retail venues such ratings and images being visible above restaurants and cafes augmented reality. augmented reality advertising the benefits augmented reality the advertising industry are well recognized. placement advertising material and interactive displays key events augmented reality provides unique opportunity combine location based advertising with detailed statistics and targeting normally only associated with online advertising. advertising billboard location the real world requires knowing statistics passing traffic, but data limited and static. augmented reality billboard can targeted specific market (ie. year old, male and results the advertising campaign easily tracked provide customer acquisition cost. note: the above sectors that show potential for augmented reality development are means exhaustive list. there are hundreds sectors that can benefit from augmented reality
