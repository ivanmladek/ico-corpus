decentralized blockchains, there has been number new coins created where now there are many coins choose from, instead the 'traditional' choices bitcoin ethereum. due this growth the digital currency market, there necessity include higher level distributed ledger technology, which able handle the high volumes without lag. lcechain has created system which can handle large amount transactions. lcechain innovative digital platform that scalable and which provides secure, decentralized technology. this guarantees the high level security, leveraging permissionless mining and transactions secured least hash power one time sent the head chain prevent double spending. the platform can also issue cross transactions and confirmed few minutes. the number cross transactions any one time will act increase the response speed. intro since bitcoin first arrived the global stage, the area blockchain has advanced quite considerably. ethereum was the second generation and allows for blockchains run smart contracts. the industry has moved yet again, proof stake style platform which step from the proof work technology. under the lcechain platform there will ability issue block rewards and use less hash power overall. block rewards will issued proportionate basis which will decrease the overall energy needed for mining and make the platform economically efficient. this builds from where the last generation digital currency platforms left off and will allow lcechain have dominant level the industry. the future, the old way transacting will become obsolete customers will choose the service which allows them facilitate their transactions the cheapest cost the fastest time with the highest level security. the scaling major problem for traditional blockchains present. under the lcechain system, this will eliminated and the platform will have the ability scale appropriate allow for any number users make transactions the same time. icechain through using the newest technology including using shards, lcechain will able scale need and also able handle any amount distribution. using this model, lcechain will able offer high-throughput blockchain users are already looking for; something safe, fast and cheap (if not free) transact on. since the platform will run distributable network, will allow the ich coin integrate into common purchase transactions, offering decentralized and fast service. icechain tech the design principles which form the basis the lcechain network are that the platform able scale needed while not compromising any level security and without costing users more transaction fee. security, scalability and decentralization are the core the lcechain model. cross shard transactions will able created seamless manner which will give high level quality within the experience users. all this, ecosystem that will driven incentives and able support wide variety alternative platforms provide users the ability use one account for all their transactions. security will maintained the same high level regardless how large the platform scales. the contemporary functioning blockchain technology offers two basic functions every block found chain. there the ledger that includes the current ledger, and the confirmation that required approve the transactions from within the ledger and mine blocks order reach the desired difficult levels that creates the proof work. ledger has the main benefit offering large area where data can stored which would include the ledger being date and continuously making notations all new transactions when they happen. included this would the source, execution code, destination and amount the transaction. only finite amount information capable being saved into any single block, which what causes the longer time waits the blockchain. transactional results will create confirmations the ledger prior the block being mined order reach the necessary proof work. this system that creates belief safety that another user could not attach the system fork mining, since would cost the user far too much money and such not viable plan. more hash power needed for the computation than for the rest the tasks needed complete the process. with this mind, lcechain operates under type 'divide and conquer' approach that will separate the above functions over two separate layers. this will allow for high level scalability while the security levels are appropriately maintained throughout the scaling. using elastic sharding layer, smaller shards the blockchain can listed the layers. this means that the shard numbers increase, the processing ability also increases, creating increased systems capacity through concurrent operations both layers. the lcechain network has head chain which will act confirm the blocks the chain without processing any the transactions and have such high level difficulty that people will not try revert transaction would not gain. additional shards can supported the platform that capable independently processing different transaction subsets. icechain positioning the design put forward lcechain allows for new approach the blockchain market, considering the single and multiple blockchain system relationship. when the entire head chain reaches hash power, the lcechain network will reposition itself single blockchain, therein morphing required, when necessary. this possible due not having any shards mining, and multiple pools weaker miners working together, and adding many minor blocks together allow for the head chain size infinite. the head chain hash power becomes the lcechain system will independently operate multiple blockchain system since each lcechain shard independent blockchain operating together multiple blockchain system. this also allows for the highest level decentralization. the lcechain network will have much higher level decentralization than other existing blockchain systems, with equally higher level security. this benefit allocating only hash power the head chain and integrating sharding technology that facilitates increase capacity relation the number transactions being processed. this helpful allowing scalability the network any time that needed without the need compromise efficiency and time. also creates higher than average decentralization levels compared normal blockchains, and offers better security through maintaining half the hash power within the head chain. main features the lcechain network: lcechain maintains horizontal scalability option, running each node full node which creates the same security against attacks what traditional blockchain offers. lcechain network was designed from the outset with this scalability feature mind, will run smoothly and will offer high throughput. the lcechain network safe and well protected hash power distribution. sharding sharding happens with data partitioned from larger database several smaller databases. the commonly used sharding method for centralized systems for meeting scalability. example, cross-shard transactions are supported lcechain and the platform uses the technology meet their scalability requirements. when this type sharding not planned for the outset, however, there issue maintaining the same level security that previously existed. without planning for scalable security the outset, the system becomes weaker and more prone risks when multiple transactions hit the platform the same time. sharding challenges include scalability and cross sharding, security issues like single shard takeovers. there can trade-off for older platforms that did not plan for security scalability, order successfully create blockchain. where there need for larger storage capacity there can seen exist transaction speeds that are slower than average. lcechain planned overcome this issue from the outset, and such can assured that will not transpire this platform has older platforms. scalability blockchain can scaled different ways, including through the use multiple blockchain, sharding through lightning network. lightning network, would ineffective for random user try and reach sporadic target; transactions are tracked with lightning channels that are not transparent they could be. this because they are tracked inside the channel instead within the main blockchain. third party sites are also normal requirement this method, such paypal, off-chain solutions like this. there are enough centralized payment methods present that does not seem feasible create another. scaling completed multiple blockchains splitting transactions between several different blockchains. this acts create less demand for transactions and also creates less hash power power each blockchain. this type system, person could gain enough hash power create double spend attack. trading off security for scalability not viable option, and multiple blockchains act limit performance ability for cross chain transactions. cross chain transactions require users maintain addresses each network, which further security issue, and there are key concerns relating private key management across multiple platforms. decentralization necessary expenses are reduced through decentralized trading and storage, giving everyday people the chance gain from technology just like business large group would. decentralization also creates the security for the entire blockchain that inherent good blockchain platform. when smaller mining pools link together create mining pools, proportional block share rewards can enjoyed any miner, the same time frame that larger mining pool would gain. centralization benefitted this design blockchain which risk the decentralized proof work format blockchain that envisioned. collaborative mining style formations create difficult algorithms which are effectively hard enough share the hash power across the miners equally, which allows for the system evenly spread. this controlled through the head chain and ensuring that least the overall hash power spread across the entirety the network. this acts prevent any type double spend attack attack malicious miner. security features security issues are prioritized through decentralized ledger, vulnerabilities the transactional platform can secured and eliminated. order keep every node sync, peer peer blockchain has the requirement needing updated regularly. proof work based blockchain there will the total hash power needed for completion the double spend order reverse any transaction. create attack like this requires the platform less decentralized than what possible the lcechain network. when blockchain appropriately decentralized will create situation that would not economically efficient for person attempt double spend attack. the lcechain network has both head blockchain, and several minor blockchains, that all operate different levels difficulty and with different levels incentive. miners can then choose which blockchain best for them considering their desired hash power. this creates open market economics model that allows the blockchain act goods seller, i.e. the block rewards, and makes the miner buyer. this benefits all parties and allows all pursue their own interests. all lcechain system transactions are protected through the operation consensus algorithm across the head and shard networks, while proof work system will operating across the head chain. the same time head chain first proof work algorithm running within the shard networks. this type proof work system operates the main blockchain networks well, such bitcoin and ethereum, that have the first proof work additional head chain unique shard network platform compared lcechain. lcechain operated determining which one two shards will allowed survive through having node compare the corresponding chains and only allowing the longer one survive. this type system would much more difficult attack since would require manipulating least the overall hash power survive. the lcechain platform there are minor blockchains that operate the network system with total head blockchain target longer than seconds duration and block target durations seconds. this will facilitate the system being able operate and around the level any single shard, therein creating even mining. trying run super full nodes ends being higher priced when there high level throughput the blockchain. tps given each transaction bytes requirement would created for over .gbps network bandwidth, which most users could not achieve. traffic would also create pull the central processing unit, storage, memory and overall network capability, which not conducive blockchain values nor any good for maintaining decentralization. lcechain network will tackle this issue through the implementation several 'trust' nodes that will cluster order run like super full node. each node will only able validate small subset the chain and the grouping subsets that cover the head chain. one node crashes will not emergency because the other nodes will still running and continuing validate blocks the ability any two nodes being able cluster. miner incentives will encourage cluster formation that will have the result encouraging miners work together. head chain shards solving random block information will conducted over high number blocks that will intensive memory use and create inefficiency downloading random blocks. transaction will classed either being cross-shard transaction that has their input and output addresses contained different shards, will in-shard transactions. the in-shard transactions have less difficulty since the shard stores all the information together, and requirement synchronize cross shard transactions they increase amount. the cross shard transactions will supported allowing any user able issue cross shard transaction any point time, that will have minutes confirmation and able scale linearly shards increase numbers. with the lcechain solution user will not have make several accounts across all the different shards order manage their cross-shard transactions since only one account will needed for account management complete smart contract. smart wallets will facilitate cross-shard and in-shard transactions seamless manner, allowing the user have in-shard transactions. cross chain transactions the lcechain design cross-shard transaction becomes manageable token conversion and transaction performance. sub-chain will offer the other chain, that can make cross-chain cross-shard. smart contracts will made possible through the evm the most popular choice present. off chain transactions will accommodated for whenever transaction must have access information that off the blockchain. smart contract data will sharded when needed and remain specific nature. the overall account management made easy the ability have one account having access any shard and users will able run primary account containing the user address default shard, running secondary account that manages every address the user shard. the primary option will the most popular account chosen and will only moved temporarily another address second account necessary. the remaining balance the secondary account will moved back the main account. the overall process will easy and the shards will able automatically detect what user's primary account is, with seamless running that will unnoticed the user. team members daniel ling founder chao liu project lead developer huy dang blockchain developer david lun software developer monica tang
