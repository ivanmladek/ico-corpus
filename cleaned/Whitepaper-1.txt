....................................................................................................................................... sources ............................................................................................................................................ the problem the blockchain investment space needs simple and transparent platform for the secondary market for safts and locked tokens. the existing secondary market for private round tokens entirely operates gray area. its current structure creates number issues and risks for all participants involved: very fragmented, hard-to-access, opaque, sometimes chaotic. operates via secret chats telegram/whatsapp/skype [], personal meetings, syndicating pools, redundant and often unreliable intermediaries [][]. this creates high-risk environment, wherein all bona fide participants face the threat encountering legal problems, aml-related accusations, fraud [], and theft assets [], well opaque intermediary chains []. all counterparties face these issues due complicated market structure described below. sellers: large amounts locked investments around funds from investment entities are already locked []. investors are often need faster cash out/ liquidity/ portfolio rebalance. buyers: high risk and limited access private rounds private rounds the most game-changing projects are largely occupied limited number funds and investors, lot blockchain funds and family offices are struggling get access these rounds []. though many investors would eagerly pay premiums enter well-performing projects that are close tge (token generation event)/token distribution, procedure exists for doing so. when sourcing transactions the secondary market, investors are forced waste time and face number risks associated with non-transparent network unverified intermediaries []. low transparency the deals the existing otc market often results high fees included into transaction price. projects: risk token dump and uncontrollable secondary market limited number investors frequently hold more than two thirds tokens for sale, which creates inevitable risk dump after public trading starts mitigate this risk, projects have experiment with lock-up structures the existing secondary otc market for locked tokens spontaneous. projects have control over it. the volatile nature still-nascent blockchain investment market means that locking their investments for year more creates unnecessary challenges for potential sellers and buyers. the solution silverway the first platform enable the professional investors buy and sell private round tokens transparent marketplace, well provide aggregate otc market data past and active transactions/offers support informed investment decisions. the marketplace collects buy and sell offers from investment funds and other professional investors and facilitates direct transactions between sellers and buyers. addition that, paid users also get access comprehensive market data for monitoring, analyzing, and tracking otc market dynamics. the company's key goal institutionalize the private token sale market segment, making more transparent and safe invest in. using the silverway platform will safeguard market participants from the major risks related otc crypto trading and bring benefits the market whole. benefits for sellers liquidity management and portfolio rebalancing: any part the private sale allocation can sold the platform any time regardless the lock-up period. this provides far more flexibility for locked tokens portfolio management. realized gains can re-invested distributed lps (limited partners). potentially higher sell prices: effective selling prices can set higher than the currently-dominant gray market due the liquidity premium and removal cumbersome intermediary chains. higher prices give sellers more opportunities for effective risk management. sellers can auction off private round tokens when demand high. benefits for buyers access private rounds top/best-performing projects: the transparent procedure will allow wider range interested investors enter the top projects' private rounds, which are currently mostly occupied the largest funds. strategic buyers will get access allocations such projects the secondary market without the risks associated with today's market. portfolio diversification: strategic buyers can expand their investments adding top projects across any market segment. such diversification enables investors build more risk-resistant portfolios. investment opportunities are less restricted geography fund size. benefits for projects increased number institutional token holders: having many institutional investors beneficial for project. with more qualified investors joining the project, its dependence public token trading greatly reduced. protection token price from dumps: secondary tokens are usually purchased with premium the private sale price, additionally mitigating the risks associated with unfavorable token price dynamics. attracting strategic buyers the secondary market, the project forms new layer committed investors, including long-term holders. additional income: projects will receive share the transaction fees, without any direct costs operational involvement. fundraising platform for launching projects (coming soon): conducting primary fundraising through the silverway platform's community institutional investors, projects will able reduce their operational and time costs. benefits for all market participants market growth: large number new investment funds and family offices will able enter the market and increase their capital allocations blockchain projects purchasing safts/locked tokens secondary market. direct transactions: for large proportion the deals conducted its platform, silverway directly matches verified professional investors the buy and sell sides. simplicity and effectiveness: simple and user friendly platform with only relevant information well-structured deal pipeline that allows for better and more secure deal matching and closure transparency and certainty: market participants longer have deal with opaque intermediary chains, secret chats, and lose time when looking for allocations and reliable counterparties. risk reduction one-stop platform, silverway takes care all associated risks. all the transactions are anonymously matched with the counterparties' identities, which are revealed privately only after proof-of-intent submission. the market the crypto market crowded with large number exchanges and otc brokers. however, its lucrative private placement niche remains underserved. silverway will help significantly increase the presence institutional participants, liquidity volume, and funds turnover the blockchain investments market. since protocol labs introduced saft (simple agreement for future tokens) the structured legal contract the token sale market has promptly shifted the private placement model. the end private sales had taken over the market volume average, and the most sought-after projects []. sharp market drop november along with uncertainty regarding further market dynamics, made most projects the last year postpone the launch their token generation events. the other hand, projects that conduct placement via the recently introduced initial exchange offering (ieo) vehicle mostly either align the cliff and/or vesting period the ieo date even extend past it. moreover, they tend alter the selling conditions not favor funds and other institutional investors, effectively increasing the total lockup horizon and, result, the market size frozen capital. fundraising, acc. unlock, public trading (indicative) the typical scheme blockchain project's private round lock investments for months. for instance, ton network (which alone made placement worth bn) suggested multi-stage private rounds with lockups months, since the mainnet launch date was scheduled for december the earliest. matter fact, the ton mainnet launch was postponed (most likely will launched oct- per the token sale agreement), which extends the effective lockup period for more than two years for the first private round investors []. according silverway research, the total volume locked investments has reached the impressive amount []. the large amount frozen capital the market, along with high volatility, leaves investors with assets that are not traded and, thus, illiquid. attempts overcome this drive the current gray market locked private round tokens, conducted through large number otc chats. otc market overall, positive dynamics have been observed terms growing attention from established traditional investors toward the blockchain space. there growing interest crypto assets from institutional investors supported evidence from diverse areas the financial industry [][][], including hedge funds trading liquid assets [], well from vc/pe funds increasingly investing blockchain projects []. alongside uhnw individuals expressing interest crypto, firms like state street, morgan stanley, and goldman sachs also set shadow crypto trading desks []. since december institutional investors have been entering otc crypto markets [], times driving surges the net imbalance between otc buys and sellers []. the positive market dynamics april also prompted increase otc trading activity binance []. according cryptofunds research, crypto assets under management hedge, venture, and funds reached april []. market size evaluation estimates the size the otc market vary drastically, since, being relatively unregulated, undergoes little the way strict quantification. for instance, april the bitcoin otc market was estimated either three times larger times smaller than the exchange market. however, evaluating the size the otc market for locked tokens and safts much more complicated, since the otc desks prefer work with the most liquid digital assets, and almost impossible monitor all closed deals and their final terms otc chats and groups. the absence institutional-grade trade facilitator for these type investments leaves locked private round assets traded labyrinthine market that lacks trust between participants. silverway's in-house research reports substantial tam with current estimated size over []. this data was aggregated from multiple industry sources, including cryptodiffer, hypernum, icobox, icorating, tokenschedule, icodata, smithandcrown, icobench, satis, tokendata, icodrops, coindesk, medium, and broker research well private discussions with the most active investors the market. total volume token sales agg. volume locked-up funds from private sales institutional market players this estimation falls line with other research. for instance, the crypto intelligence platform inwara reports that despite sharp decline public sales, private funding saw growth vcs dedicated blockchain funds went long blockchain projects, which the end collectively raised ~$. []. worth bitcoin processed per day, the tabb group estimation []. digital asset research estimated the market hold bitcoin trades per day []. moreover, according circle research, the alone there has been more than -fold increase the number reg offerings filed with the sec []. this kind investment subject -month lockup and only available "accredited investors." such offerings collected ~$. bn, quadrupling the amount raised this trend, being concurrent with the growing number cryptofunds [], indicative rise investor-grade token sale products. transparent customer universe the current list active market participants includes investors and private equity funds, well least crypto hedge funds) and hundreds projects []. the undoubtable advantage this market relatively easy access all its participants. there need overcome client's knowledge gaps, since all market participants are highly motivated and their own interests ultimately collaborative. companies that have over million assets individuals that have net worth over million, that have consistently made over per year income. competitive landscape there significant interest otc deals with safts and locked tokens, but there platform that addresses all investor requirements. the token-trading market currently represented by: hundreds exchanges that trade only listed tokens and derivatives; large number otc brokers/desks that trade liquid crypto and crypto/fiat pairs; fundraising platforms used for primary token sales; platforms for whales and syndicating pools participate limited number private sales; otc telegram/ wechat/qq brokers. the demand for new otc service paradigm also supported the increasing number otc desks launched crypto asset exchanges recent months, despite the bearish market []. these include such projects coinbase prime [], poloniex [], and huobi otc. the latest jump the otc bandwagon were bittrex [], bithumb's ortus, and coincheck []. circle trade, founded february was one the earliest otc platforms and trades "very limited" selection cryptocurrencies "aligned" its "regulatory licensure" []. however, circle executed otc trades with different counterparties with total volume billion []. some the publicly available lists otc desks: the first compilation reddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinmarkets/comments/unls], list bitcoin brokers and liquidity providers the cme group [https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/bitcoin-brokers-and-block-liquidity-providers.html], and list otc brokers sfox [https://blog.sfox.com/-bitcoin-otc-brokers-you-need-to-know-adccc]. list ico pools for can found here [https://hackernoon.com/the-ultimate-list-of-ico-pools-in-the-bear-market-q--ffcdfab]. nonetheless, despite the large number brokers and other intermediaries, there still aren't any institutional-grade platforms dealing with the secondary market safts/locked tokens. silverway leverages its unique founding team experience enter into market segment that hasn't yet been rationalized penetrated institutional player. the private token sale market often has high entry threshold: many projects prefer deal with large funds []. therefore, lot professional investors have limited access private sale rounds and are looking buy private sale tokens, sometimes with significant premiums. taking into account the nature the market and the very fast-changing environment presented both the market overall and particular projects, buyers are looking for access the best-performing projects (e.g. the projects which are close tge mainnet launch). the other hand, many investors are also looking for ways sell their locked tokens order realize price premiums, get additional liquidity diversify their portfolios, just cash out faster. thus, all counterparties are inherently interested secure direct deals without redundant intermediaries. legal side developed cooley [], the simple agreement for future tokens (saft) model was widely employed throughout way for projects avoid potential regulatory concerns while raising funds. inspired safe contracts used startups, saft specifically addresses unregulated "direct presales" pre-functional platform tokens, that are sold before the platform complete. numerous saft-like instruments that allow projects avoid compliance pitfalls and security regulations for token sales have been deployed since then. most safts are restricted accredited investors and many are registered with national regulatory bodies under official fundraising regimes, most commonly regulation the united states []. while their owners are likely eager partially liquidate their investments, most projects require explicit consent from project side for the transfer future tokens third parties. sanctions for breaching lock-up can even lead agreement termination. nevertheless, investors not abstain from trading their locked tokens the secondary market effort make their investments work. excerpt typical saft's lock-up section: the lack transparent saft trading procedure creates legal complications and prevents legitimate investors from trading, thus creating niche for gray-market schemes, such backdating funds' capitalization tables. the silverway platform aims provide compliant institutional-grade solution for otc trading non-listed tokens. silverway will apply its best efforts compliant with projects' saft terms. case saft transfer from one institutional investor another, silverway plans approach the project teams and solicit their written consent. simple agreement for future equity. the silverway platform the silverway platform

the silverway token used for fee payment and additional platform purchases and subscriptions. will launched standard token known decentralized platform, possibly erc token ethereum mainnet. the token ties the platform's services together and allows silverway's investors leverage platform growth, tokens are burned when they are used for fees services, contracting the supply and driving the price up. token applications currently, there are three planned main uses for the slv token: fees for deals made using the platform; proofs-of-intent for deal participation; data analytics subscriptions. main channels value transfer are represented the right. all economic interactions between the platform and its users are depicted the next diagram. token utility value all fees and service payments may performed the user's currency choice. however, users are incentivized use slv tokens, the case fees and proof-of-intent payments. the discounts diminish quadratically over time, providing additional incentive use tokens fast possible. simplify the discount calculation for platform users, the initial quadratic function replaced with closely-resembling step function: year year year year year and further token burning and value every time token redeemed, the smart contract burns fixed percentage the redeemed sum, while the rest passed silverway. this mechanism ensures that token value dependent platform usage. protect the platform's users against volatility, prices are set either common currencies (for services/proof-of-intent) percentages the total sum (for fees), and then recalculated into platform tokens.therefore, the token dynamics may expressed the following system: where: the burn rate set constant values, which will determined later time, subject change decision the board directors. essentially, each period the amount slv earned the platform equal while the token valuation simply reserve rate-discounted sum all upsides (service and fee discounts) that token holders can receive over the platform's lifecycle. token distribution ticker: slv smart contract: https://etherscan.io/token/ xccddfaeddbffde total supply: slv minting: distribution: early
