introduction ono social network based blockchain technology which focuses the value attention and offers free, decentralised social platform new generation users. ono based the belief the value attention. far ono concerned, there exists many valuable human social activities within social media ecosystem and ono recognises the inherent value both the supply-side and demand-side human cognitive and social energy. the ono team believes equality. far ono concerned, since everybody born equal human beings, the means available for them obtain incentives and gain attention social platforms shall also equal. principles the internet gave birth the large-scale private social platforms including facebook, twitter, wechat and weibo. these platforms which are controlled centralised companies, many millions users are contained within them. the platforms manage the users and create all the rules about the content posting policies the platform and they siphon off vast amounts wealth which are generated not them, but the content creators. the revenue facebook reached billion usd, which was from advertising. .content creators, who are the only contributors facebook's data, gain nothing this billion usd. the ono team plans establish financial report illustrations facebook http://tech.qq.com/a//.htm?qqcom_pgv_from=aio decentralised social network based the principles freedom, equality and social public governance, which, the value attention properly defined and the content creators can fully reap the true rewards the value they create. far the ono team concerned, attention and time are the most precious resources future society and also are the resources most valued the community ono. the act placing the social media content within the community has more value than the content itself. addition, the time and energy that was spent creators also considered part the overall value the content. the power the attention users directly impacts the value the content; hence, the attention the users will incentivised well the act content creation. the quantity blockchain technology and digital virtual currency users grew exponential way. the number active digital wallet users have increased from million the beginning the current number million. additionally, users with interest towards the area blockchain and cryptocurrency also grew the past year.. the exponentially increasing number users reflects the massive user demand for blockchain solutions. the sudden popularity cryptokitties.ushered turning point for new blockchain golden age. key issues look out for getting the result observation from google trends tools http://trends.google.com cryptokitties https://baike.baidu.com/item/cryptokitties/?fr-aladdin since the blockchain came into being, the "trust mechanism" has been replaced the "consensus mechanism" and the "encrypted algorithm" gradually, which why the blockchain widely and warmly welcomed. hence, the central nodes must adopt the trust mechanism. additionally, centralised management structure must applied towards all related businesses, but this might lead the overwhelming power central nodes and give rise series corruption problems. current centralised social platforms, the same problems might occur, which could harm the interests users and become problematic issues. ono not only takes into consideration the problems inherent centralised hierarchies, but also takes into consideration the many and varied failed experiments caused boatloads uncontrolled factors totally decentralised organisations. that's why the ono team has decided add little top-down wisdom into bottom-up system, order correct the mistakes and uncontrolled factors the bottom-up system. first, deluge low-quality content *insufficient incentives centralised platforms siphon off vast social energy and attention, which created content creators and platform users. furthermore, the lack incentives for users generate high-quality content worsens the situation lack drive for content creators, which results the loss high-quality content and exceptional users. example: large number internet celebrities are dissatisfied with the reality this condition insufficient incentives. therefore, the loss internet celebrities continues. for example, some bad events occurred zhihu. wukong q&a decided create affiliation with www.toutiao.com and signed contracts with many former internet celebrities zhihu. it's worth mentioning that the price for www.toutiao.com hunt and employ these former internet celebrities zhihu very low.. *bad money drives out good people most centralised content-based platforms, data flow the only criterion define the value the network; and the rigid demand for the long-term development the content-based platforms neglected, which gives rise boatloads clickbait, sensationalist headline writers and vulgar content. for example, bai jiahao, uc, www.toutiao.com and other wechat official accounts are despised users because sensational headline writers vulgar content. second, insufficient safety and lack care for users insufficient safety centralised social platforms, the safety the information belonging users cannot ensured and this information risk being stolen. some platforms even take advantage the data belonging users for massive financial gains. public opinion monitoring report "war for talents" event between wukong q&a and zhihu http://www.iimedia.cn/.html omment "sentimental headline writers" media for party affairs: criticising "go sleep with you crossing big parts china" case: each year, the information from over million users sold the black market. this information detailed that can obviously shown have come from various social media platforms.. *restricted freedom the centralised platforms, via centralised algorithms, completely control the distribution content, and siphon off the social energy for financial gain. ordinary users will never listed the "hot search" "trending topics" even they produce quality content. unless users pay promotional fees, they will face restricted exposure and visibility. some platforms are even manipulating public opinion with "zombie" users who write fake responses engage the controlling and restricting the activities legitimate users.. the centralised platforms conduct black box operations, ban users will, and arbitrarily handle the accounts and content users without any reason, for which, the users cannot safeguard their legal rights.. case: more than the users weibo's most-searched hashtags (with most usage rate) are stars and internet celebrities who are signed with weibo. however, star account with over million fans does not purchase robotic shocking: data million users are sold and circulating black market http://new.ppeye.com/article--.html. any solution for restriction flow weibo? http://www.zhihu.com/question/ kuaishou angrily dissing weibo for kuaishou official weibo being banned post for seven days: not simple behind http://www.techweb.com.cn/internet/-/.shtml users write fake posts, the likes under single weibo post will under so, what's the real network flow for the most searched hashtag.? third, sense belonging and sense participation lack sense belonging and sense participation the platforms, such weibo, wechat, www.toutiao.com and zhihu, the relationships between the platforms and the users are relatively separated and isolated. the roles between them are opposite each other, therefore, conflict interest always occurs. fourth, questions shall more valued than answers the progress science not only enriches mankind's knowledge, but also expands mankind's ignorance. while forging new knowledge, the progress science also triggers more questions. when artificial intelligence keeps storing and evolving the future knowledge, can predicted that besides answers, the computers could give one nothing. good questions are more scarce compared good answers. pain points content creators unable monetise content uncovering secrets: secret dirties weibo water army that you don't know http://www.sohu.com/. squeezing profits many centralised social media content platforms, content creators cannot obtain incentives, and the profits made the network flow are completely absorbed the platforms. centralised social media, only the top users can truly benefit financially from the network flow other channels. most ordinary users who are enhancing the market value the platform are unable gain any profit. complicated and non-transparent profit-earning procedures even people we-media who can monetise their content will face number problems centralized platforms, such non-transparent prices and extremely complicated trading procedures. fact, content managers for internet celebrities centralized social media platforms have use exploitative system gain advertising revenues. most managers adopt this exploitative method, the profits are actually quite small.. example: the offer essay given internet celebrity zhihu rmb; however, the third-party organization and the service provider will charge fee more than rmb, thus the third-party companies gain high commissions. key issues faced developers high distribution and promotion fees the false annual income million rmb for internet celebrity advertisements: they earn just little actually http://tech..com///ccbeur.html the current distribution markets for software app platforms, developers will pay high fees release their software into these app stores. the high fees will further squeeze the remuneration from excellent small and medium-sized developer teams, which results them receiving almost nothing. example: the mobile app market platforms have high fee commission structure for developers. the app revenues into the pockets tencent and apple app stores. also, the app stores might ask for legal documentation for the software. additionally, the platforms will charge extra fees for publicity and promotion. user demand high-quality content ono, behaviour the users will define the value, and ensure the quality content. the meantime, the incentive mechanism within ono will promote continuous production high-quality content and attract more users, who will continue with the production more high-quality content, thus forming synergistic and healthy feedback cycle. safety and free social experience the data ono will stored the blockchain. self-governed blockchain social network dapp, free from the corruption problems generated centralised platforms. the algorithm ono will compute the personal preferences predict behaviours users, order prioritize the individual preferences the users. ono will notify users the likes his/her friends that they focused but which they are not aware of. can even recommend these users some content that the users dislike right now but might want take look the future. the hot search and incentive algorithms ono are totally open-source and open the public, which indicative fairness. the network, all users can experience complete safety and freedom. demand for equality and respect gather large number users the platform the core community culture. the preferences and attention users foster the culture the community ono. equality and respect are not empty promise the community ono. the value attention each user can reasonably quantified, and the users can gain remuneration the shared community network the form the token onot token. needs content creators simple, transparent and effective remuneration-sharing mechanism ono, any user releases any high-quality content, ono will automatically distribute remuneration via the poc algorithm, and the users can directly incentivised onot, without any other further action. ono will share remuneration with all relevant users which have contributed the creation that content the social network. users may continuously receive remuneration generated from that high-quality content payment for their efforts. needs developers ono will have free extremely low issuance sub-accounts, low commission and constant support within the network. the relationship between ono and the third-party development teams within the platform symbiotic. the developers building the platform ono will become integral part the social network system ono. they will build the thriving social ecosystem together with all the users the social network. the third-party dapps would use onot for payments, provide more usage cases for onot and increase circulation onot. meanwhile, ono will also continuously offer network support great dapp developer teams. the first year, ono will not charge any distribution fee; then the distribution fee will progressively increased the next four years from and then fixed which far lower than the average level the industry. all distribution fees will paid onot. the solutions ono the underlying philosophy the social network ono combine core social values with the original vision the creation the internet. the concepts freedom, equality, social public governance and diversity are the healthy components diversified social networking ecosystem. starting the ono team started creating r&d products. the first which was era, the which created value-based social network, and then cryptodogs based ethereum. all these social networks the ono team have built were able successfully meet their goals. ono built the realisation that order establish decentralised social network, firstly, needs protect and respect the three main interests users: equal dignity, equal rights and reasonable remuneration for usage; secondly, shall provide easy-to-use and enjoyable product experiences which will exceed all expectations. ono replaces the centralized and exploitative "ownership" business model with onot and blockchain-based social network rich virtual products order balance the allocation economic benefits between content creators, the users who give their attention and the platform providers. intends provides solid, highly principled foundation for the building decentralised, community co-governance and diversity-centric social network. the ono team believes that solve the above-mentioned key issues for users, complete content ecosystem needs based common goals, along with reputation mechanism and virtual commodity economic system for distribution resources. with variety symbiotic mechanisms these two independent ecologies will create continuous feedback loop within the consensus and developed ecosystem. content ecosystem: reputation mechanism the reputation mechanism the most important mechanism the ecosystem ono. order guarantee that high-quality ecosystem can established, ono creates reliable assessment mechanism, punish the users who conduct malicious behaviour, such destruction and harassment. the reputation mechanism will applied the media content system and referendum system. the content system, the content released particular user liked, reposted, commented and shared, the reputation the user will up; not, the reputation the user will down. the reputation fluctuates according the quality content released the users. the content released users with high reputations will first put into the recommended zone. when the reputation user falls dramatically, all content released this user will collapsed and other people will not able see the content. the referendum system, users will assess whether the execution results proposal executors comply with expectations and will make the final evaluation executors. the executors are able offer high-quality services and will also accumulate their reputations step step. the proposals these executors other executing referendum will preferentially displayed. however, the case the executors breaching the contract whose executing results could not reach the standards, their reputation will undermined. when their reputations are undermined certain extent, the executors' projects will collapsed and they will unable participate the competitive bidding. distribution mechanism the distribution content ono combined with user behavioural assessment and reputation mechanism. all activities users such reading, reposting, replies, shares, likes and dislikes content will recorded. ultimately, all this data will combined with the reputation mechanism, and open rules will adopted evaluate the quality content. the high-quality content will shown the homepage the network. the feature real-time fluctuations reputation provides users transparent way operate the network, thus ensuring the healthy development the content ecosystem. incentive mechanism with open sourced algorithmic incentive mechanism (see for details), ono encourages users create high-quality content, participate platform building, active the social network and obtain onot token incentives. third-party developers can also develop mini apps based the open platform ono provide diversified experiences for users and obtain onot incentives. the entire token ecosystem will utilise smart contracts establish openness and transparency and also ensure the interests all creators. users ono and/or holders onot which did not actively participate will not receive any onot incentives. consensus ecosystem referendum (see for details) order establish equal rights, the philosophy ono provide equal and continually amended and developed "common programme" system, subject compliance with all prevailing regulations. eventually, planned that all users can equally participate the proposal and voting model. the growth and prosperity the ecosystem will shared common goal among users, platform developers and content creators. the referendum one the most important components the social network ono. expresses the goals freedom, equality and social public governance well reinforces the guiding principle ono: "the interests the users are more important than anything else". the referendum, all users ono with unique digital identities can publish proposals for the ecosystem's infrastructure, platform management and dispute resolution matters. the premise the continually amended and improved "common programme" based community consensus. for the avoidance doubt, while the views the community would acknowledged, ultimately community members are not connected with the foundation (or its affiliates) any manner, and the right vote does not entitle onot holders vote the operation and management the foundation (or its affiliates) their assets, and does not constitute any equity interest the foundation (or its affiliates). the various successful proposals which have obtained community support will published transparent fashion. all procedures the referendum, the ono team will major participants. the "common programme" will considered the definitive guide for the prosperity the social ecosystem. all users would have equal chances get their voices heard. all procedures and data referendum activities will recorded using the blockchain open and transparent way. developer ecosystem box (see for details) order deliver diversified product experience, ono will cooperate with third-party developers build out the developer ecosystem. box the app store ono. order ensure the diversity the social network, ono supports third-party developers participate and develop various types dapps, rich applications and small number games and on. the users can use their onot tokens purchase virtual goods from box. and the developers can obtain onot tokens via selling applications and distributing application revenues. the distribution application revenues will conducted according the "developer revenue distribution mechanism" different phases and recorded the blockchain, ensure that the revenues are open and transparent. order promote the developer ecosystem, ono has head start developing several mini apps, modelled usage cases. for example, the end-to-end encrypted chat-based instant messaging app and the adventure location-based map app are just two usage cases. order promote the prosperity the developer ecosystem, ono will nominate the members the developer community from the submitted proposals the referendum, support the third-party developers with tokens from the incentive pool, thus reducing the development costs and risks the early stages ono. further, eosio based blockchain, ono will encourage dapps developed for the eos mainnet and other eosio based sister chains develop specific versions for the ono community, using the unique economics the ono community. such dapps should relatively easy migrate, since the platform very similar the eos mainnet environment. chapter two ono dapp ono new type social network based blockchain technology, aiming create ecosystem based the value attention with the main principles freedom, equality and social public governance for users. the users ono can freely share and obtain valuable content, chat for study and communication and participate building the ecosystem. while creating network activity, will provide the users with incentives, users will obtain onot the incentive manner laid forth referenda. onot virtual commodity trusted and held all members the community ono. embodies the value virtual goods, social traffic and attention, which transferable, shareable and precious. onot can used and circulated the social content market, referendum market, mini app market and transactional market order realise its commercial viability. ono uses blockchain technology record and verify the content release details, payment transactions, consumption and purchase, well referendum activities. all the operations will recorded the blockchain ono, ensure that operational data authentic and unable altered. the forms the social network ono the social network ono consists one fundamental ecosystem and two cyclic ecosystems. the fundamental ecosystem refers the instant messaging app and the rich content stream which satisfies the primal social engagement needs human beings. one the cyclic ecosystems refers the referendum structure which concerned with giving equal rights participants. the developer ecosystem delivers diversified app experience the users. the fundamental ecosystem when combined with the other two cyclic ecosystems, aims give the users free and open infrastructure and equal opportunities with shared governance, which respects the dignity individuals and reflect healthy human-centric experience. ono product architecture ono product architecture diagram ono product system .id system ono provides complete system, and users need complete the registration using their telephone numbers. after logging into the social network ono, ono will assign each user with unique digital identity and native digital wallet. the onochain blockchain network will encrypt user data ensure user privacy. the meantime, order ensure the authenticity the users communities, more detailed information has provided order participate the building the social network. .my story story the module for users push social media content into the circle friends. the content creators and the friends the creators can personalise the operations including: release story, focus friends, check stories friends, repost, reply, save, dislike, like and reward. the content posted users can set private content, open content content that only visible friends. once the content released, one can delete it, but the creator judgment executor has the right collapse it. the creator can edit, collapse and amend the levels permissions granted others. the content posted all users are recorded the blockchain ono. this ensures that the content traceable, immutable and unalterable. all content ono will encrypted. the creator has the right amend the levels permissions. the encryption key algorithm ensures that only the users with the corresponding permissions can view the content. chat (see figure one) the chat system the most basic function ono. ono uses encryption algorithm ensure end-to-end encryption for the chat content, thus ensuring the privacy chat data. none the servers nodes will decrypt save any chat content. the chat data temporarily stored encrypted form upon sending. once the chat data delivered all the receivers, will forever removed from all servers. the decrypted chat content will only stored the local user devices, i.e., the senders and receivers. .friends the system friends the basic social function ono. the users can add friends random recommendations, searching for accounts, searching for nicknames, scanning codes, importing address books and checking surrounding people and on. the friends will shown single list, facilitate users checking and selecting chat dialogues. .content distribution users can release content into the social network ono. the forms content include words, images, videos, expressions, positions and on. ono will support richer forms distribute content, including links, long text, q&a, and buying and selling and on. .interactive functions the interactive functions ono mainly include reply, repost, like, dislike, save, reward, don't look the moments friends, don't look the post, and sharing within the website and beyond the website. replies: the users can post replies content, order interact with the author and other observers. the data will accumulated and stored the data the primary content list. repost: the users can repost and spread the content released other users. the more frequently the stories are shared, the more attention these stories will receive. like: the users can express their likes high-quality content, which will influence the distribution and incentives related the content. the more likes the content obtains, the more potential there will for bigger exposure and more incentives will gained. *dislike: the users can show dislikes the content that they detest. order protect the interests the creator the content and avert malicious clicking bad replies, onot will consumed when expressing dislikes. the dislikes will influence the distribution and incentives content. the content with lots dislikes will collapsed, that other people not have view it. save: the users can save the content that they like, facilitate more convenience. the saved content only visible the users themselves. *reward: any user can tip any content onot, incentive the content creator. ono will have authority charge any these user-given tips. the content creator responsible for all aspects their own content and needs responsible for other resultant obligations legal otherwise. *don't look the moments friends: the users can choose not look the information any person. after making the choice, the users will not see any the posts content that person. don't look the post: the users can choose not see the post any other user. after making the choice, the users will not see any information that particular user. sharing within and beyond the website: ono supports users with the ability share content the communities, chats and environs ono under the condition that sharing allowed the original content creators. ono supports the sharing any open content any other app users, and the page views from these other platforms will also calculated into the viewership data the original posts. .my exploration (see figure two) exploration the module for users release stories and broadcast them the public. any user can see the content released any other user the exploration section. all users will release content according the guidelines set forth the common programme. the content which violates the common programme will collapsed and the content with disputes will solved all users through referendum action. some content exploration will focused two principles, reputation and distribution mechanism, both which will influence the distribution, recommendation, order and hierarchy the placement the content. all data belongs the content creator. the creator enjoys all interests and bears all responsibilities related the content. the creator can edit, collapse and amend levels accessibility permissions. when the content published the creator the exploration section, other sharing actions can occur such repost, reply, save, like, dislike and rewards towards the original content. all content will recorded the blockchain ono, ensure that the content traceable and unalterable. .my box (see figure three) box the name the app store which developed ono and reflection the diversified social network ecosystem ono. box consists two parts: one the various functions released the ono team for the goal system-wide prosperity, the other are the mini apps freely researched and developed third-party developers based the ono open platform. ono tries connect the users the social network ono with the developers the ono developer ecosystem via open platform. the goal allow users freely make purchases and app installations. additionally, there will various plug-ins and other features built into the ecosystem order let developers create rich and diverse product experience. *functions the platform ono given that the development social network needs diversified content and structure for support during development, ono will continue explore new ways express content and will continue enhance platform infrastructure according the referendum. currently, ono can support the following kinds media: words, audio files, images, position and links; and subsequently, will openly support long text, video, and live broadcasts and on. the meanwhile, ono will provide rich operation statistics govern the platform. ono will make available sdk for its open platform, for the usage third-party developers, among which, all the interfaces will open-source. order display the functions the mini app open platform, currently, the ono team has developed several mini app usage cases for the users and developers test and experience. *mini apps developed third-party developers the fairness principle remuneration sharing the open platform ono will attract the most talented developers. any third-party developer can provide users with rich third-party applications based the open api ono. .referendum (see figure four) the referendum, which will established secondary smart contracts, important component the social network ecosystem ono and its foundation principles are: freedom, equality and social public governance. ono has its guiding principle: "the interests the users are more important than anything else." the referendum will place where one can find questions and answers important matters. ono built according the belief that good questions will help bring about different and diverse opinions. will stimulate the imagination all members and also generate intellectual curiosity about known and unknown areas knowledge. this decentralised, chaotic and most uncertain place, that the most valuable and most essential questions and answers life shall generated. the smart contract module the referendum includes: the voting pool, execution proposals agency, proposals, voting, winning support, voting all people, publishing results, budget, fund-raising, open bidding and supervising executive actions and on. *participant order make sure that the voting action the community adheres the common programme and has the ecosystems' best interests heart, all users participating the voting must possess unique digital identities ono. *voting pool: the system voting pool will contain amount free onot which set aside given the best proposals and also stimulate the valid voting users participate building the ecosystem and creating developer applications for the community. the onot for supporting proposals will gathered special pool onot for these proposals. the voting pool each proposal unique and for special use. for the proposals entering into vote all ecosystem participants: when the result declaration term expires, the voting poll will immediately execute the incentive strategy after deducting the fee payable, onot the voting pool will used incentivise the voters, and the other will put into the "executing pool". for the proposals not entering the voting all people, when the result declaration term expires, the voting pool will immediately execute withdrawal after deducting the fee, all onots the voting pool will returned via the original routes according their corresponding proportion. *executing pool: executing pool onot pool specially used pay the fees the executing team winning the bid after open bidding. the executing pool each proposal unique and for special use. the process distribute onot recorded the blockchain ono order ensure that the process open and transparent. after the settlement all fees and completion the execution process, there are still some onots the pool corresponding tokens, the rest the onots will immediately returned the users participating the fund-raising. during the execution, there any factor leading the failure execution, the rest the onots will immediately returned the users participating the fund-raising. *proposal: the premise not violating the common programme, any user ono with unique digital identity can present proposals for the infrastructure the social network ecosystem, platform, governance and dispute resolutions regarding ono. the proposed tools cover all functions the content release. *supporting and winning support: any user can transfer onot any amount the voting pool with any proposal, support the proposal and help the proposal win more attention other users. within the valid period gain support, the proposal reaching exceeding support standards can deemed the winning proposal and will listed referendum; otherwise, shall considered the failed proposal and listed into section non-passed proposals. *referendum any user with unique digital identity can participate voting. after the voting process complete, the user can obtain onots the voting pool used incentivise the users participating the voting. the voting open, transparent, unique and unalterable. within the valid period voting all people, the proposals winning more than affirmative votes will declared and may executed; otherwise, they will deemed failure. *declaring result: when the voting period expires, the proposals will published the "executed" section "non-passed" section. within the valid period result declaration, any user with digital identity ono can publish complaint towards any proposal "under execution"; however, the user must pay the same quantity more onot the voting pool the proposal publish and launch the second round voting all people. *budget: when certain proposal passed via voting all people, the designated agent will compose the proposal budget within valid period time and declare the result. *fund-raising: when the budget declaration the proposal has ended, judgment will made according the result decide whether any fund-raising shall needed order meet the budget requirements. within valid period time, the budget conditions are met, the proposal deemed successful and listed into "open bidding" area. within valid period time, the budget conditions are not met, the proposal considered not passed. when the fundraising launched for the proposal, the tokens exceeding the needed quantity the fund-raising will returned the originating source upon the settlement the proposal. *open bidding: when the fund-raising fulfilled, the proposal will enter the open bidding procedure for the executing team execute it. any user with unique digital identity ono can participate the competitive bidding. third-party developers with good qualifications will nominated preferentially. *supervising execution: order ensure the success the proposal executing well transparency, fairness, valid judgment criteria and processes, all the users supporting the private fund-raising will participate the evaluation equally; and the results voting shall become the executing conditions fulfilled the executing team. the tokens the executing poll will paid the executing team for the three phases succession, with and respectively. *punishment for breach contract: order make sure that the community adheres the common programme and has the ecosystems' best interests heart, the developer who breaches contract will unable obtain the final payment and will also lose reputation. the serious and continuous breach contract will lead the extremely low reputation the developer and the developer might removed from the rolls forever. .transaction transference transaction transference important aspect token circulation ono, used facilitate sending tokens between users. any user with digital wallet can transfer, send gifts and make transactions any other user. the sender can customise the fee which needs paid each transaction. the process token circulation, all transactions will recorded the blockchain, and they cannot altered. .advertising column the development the advertising system one the foundations the entire value ecosystem ono. also important onot value application scenario. the continuous development the advertising system great benefit the overall valuation onot. (see economic system and the advertising system ono) the early stages development, ono will place the advertising bar just below the content that users post. the future, all personal pages belonging ono can freely defined and placed advertising columns, such personal homepage, publishing content, and all other personal pages. users can independently choose whether open the advertising column and decide what kinds advertisements pay attention to. users who open the advertising column can obtain extra onot incentives. advertisers can pay onot automatically match independently purchase exposure time for any advertising. the ono advertising system will developed and maintained the founding team and third-party teams. .content implanted into the market, which the second-level market that matches the advertising market efficiently and transparently. content creators can put their own ads sell their own content the market, and advertisers can bid against each other buy the space. figure one figure two figure three figure four chapter three technical framework the technical framework ono can divided into the following six parts: status authentication system one the basic services the ecosystem ono, the identity certification system provides many basic services including account registration, content confirmation, identity certification, limit management and on. after the user registers account the system, the identity certification will made. the user going through identity certification will obtain more authority ono, such participating the referendum and ecosystem building and on. content storage system the content produced users the system ono are the core products these users and also the core assets the attention economy ono. therefore, ono must ensure that the content users stored safe manner. the content data created users ono will encrypted before upload and storage. each piece content will have its own specific content encryption key, ck, generated the creating user, and available for decryption only those whom has specifically granted access. the encrypted data will stored decentralised distributed hash table (dht) storage network, for example, ipfs. the byte bit) hash the data will stored the blockchain. users with the proper authority can access and decrypt the content through smart contracts other access control mechanisms, which will ensure that only authorized users can access the data. the storage providers are unable obtain the content encryption key, and are thus unable view data belonging users. course, once user has properly accessed the data, not possible fully secure from copying retransmission. ipfs example decentralised and distributed storage system, aiming connect all computer data into the same filing system. ipfs adopts content addressing techniques, with which, the users not have worry about the location the server nor consider the name, path and route file storage. each file stored one more ipfs nodes, and accessing users will transparently locate and access the data and its corresponding decryption key based the permissions and hash values stored the blockchain. the hash value derived from combination the content the file, the creator, the time creation (or upload) and certain other factors. just one bit altered, the hash value will totally different, that the has function used has the property that single bit change will general change half the bits which compromise the hash (true for sha, sha and blake). when ipfs requested the hash file, will employ the dht find the node where the file stored, and then extract the file and verify the data the file. the ipfs network unfixed, fine-grained and distributed network. can adapt the requirements any content delivery network. currently, ipfs under development. ensure good user experience, its early stage, ono employs highly efficient central development server architecture. the contents the users will encrypted and stored central database. fully protect the reliability operation and safety user data, high performance read and write operations are ensured; furthermore, the interactive experience the social network ensured. the ono team will investigate and test ipfs and alternatives, and deploy the fully distributed storage system when determined stable, reliable and high performance. our current expectation create modified ipfs system, operated the onochain block producers, ensure reliable performance. this system will further decentralized when confidence the technology and operation achieved. consensus mechanism and incentive mechanism consensus mechanism the ecosystem that ono establishing has large quantity data concurrency. presumed that the users logging the platform daily will about five million, and then, might estimated that the blockchain needs run more than transactions per second. (the formula: the number active users ,,: users* operations per user each day (post, comment and forward) ops/day ,,///second= ops/second for active users, ops/second the existing pow (proof work) consensus mechanism (as used bitcoin and ethereum) unable meet these high transactional needs. pos (proof stake) blockchains are, general, not sufficiently distributed meet our goal for tamper resistance, and achieve our conditions acceptable user experience and decentralised system, present dpos+bft the best solution. delegated proof stake (dpos) consensus mechanism based multiple independent validator nodes which are competition, and which are incentivized not collude. under the dpos mechanism, voting used appoint witnesses which sign new blocks the chain. with the implementation decentralised voting mechanism, dpos quite democratic, which helps ensure honest and unbiased behaviour the witnesses the pseudo code dpos mechanism realised follows, for round dlist_i

tolerance (bft) mechanism for distributed systems error detection and correction. distributed system can tolerate the occurrence any fault (these faults might include hardware error, network congestion and delay, hacker attack and "bad actor" nodes), one can say that the system has reached byzantine fault tolerance. although early the lamport has proven the theoretical feasibility byzantine-fault-tolerance, there was practical and highly-efficient algorithm realise until when castro and liskov published "practical byzantine fault tolerance" this was the first transfer bft theory into solution can achieved practice. ono will adopt consensus mechanism dpos+bft strengthen the security dpos and make tolerate byzantine faults. this powerful and castro, liskov al., "practical byzantine fault tolerance" http://pmg.csall.mit.edu/papers/osdi.pdf decentralised solution and can effectively solve the technology problems that the platform ono faces. the appearance the eosio software enables the implementation the vision ono. eosio blockchain operating system designed for commercial distributed applications. the processing capacity its dpos+bft-based underlying architecture logic now (july achieving transactions per second, which can take cleanly about active users, and can conceivably reach millions transactions per second. can support multiple distributed applications, perfectly applicable the ono dapp and additional extensions. the ono team will continuously work track and adopt performance improvements the eosio software and architecture improve the performance, staying well ahead the demand. only the appointed nodes which have performed block verification work will entitled earn producer reward onot, and such rewards shall their only direct compensation from the chain. the onochain preview platform will come online october test-net for detail development purposes. after tuning, testing and full load testing, the production network will deployed early after which all blockchain features will implemented. onochain will use the eosio software, used the eos mainnet, with customization and modification tune for the ono environment. among the changes onochain expects make, compared with the eosio default and the eos mainnet: end user charge for ram all ram costs are borne the system optimize block window for ono dapp account recovery built-in recovery mechanism for lost stolen keys governance via sps, ono team and referenda token interchange between eos and onot with eos mainnet. initially, multiple independent onochain block producers will selected and appointed the ono team, ensure stable functionality the chain. due time, producer selection will migrate the voting mechanism described above. the ono team will operate more than one such producing node, ensuring decentralization and independence the producing nodes. avoid doubt, the ono team may operate multiple non-producing blockchain api and test nodes, but will receive rewards for such nodes. incentive mechanism compared some blockchain businesses, pow not only the consensus mechanism, but also the incentive mechanism used encourage active miners keep doing work. given that the ono dapp social network app, within the system ono, the users who create value and who have high output are the ones who are more critical the ecosystem ono. the same time, the cost run the dpos+bft system extremely low. it's different from traditional blockchain cryptocurrencies that has need incentivise the miners beyond the modest onot they earn. ono uses the contribution degree prove the poc (power contribution) mechanism. poc will used define and quantify the contributions users and distribute the matching onot. the active behaviours users include but are not limited to: being co-partner building the social network, joining the developer teams, being content producer and software user, etc. more details "chapter four economic system". end-to-end encrypted instant

growth. the open platform ono provides large number basic components. using the basic components offered the platform, the developers can create customised community applications satisfy the demand different users and obtain rewards for doing so. the basic components ono consist components and functional components. components can subdivided into view container components, navigation components, sheet components, map components, multimedia components and canvas and on. the common functional components include payment components, database components, network components and on. advertising algorithm the advertisers will gain access certain distribution channels placing bids. the advertising system ono provides multiple payment methods including cpa (cost per action) and cpc (cost per click). according the pacing. algorithm, the advertising system ono optimises the distribution rate advertising budgets. the pacing algorithm will learn compete with other advertisements which all point the same target audience and which will try offer optimal pricing. the rules this algorithm are follows: final bid (per impression) optimal bid (per impression) ctr where optimal bid the advertising system operation and maintenance team: get (aaf the open advertising column content creator and user: get (aaf summary the future, the advertising mechanism ono may become more complicated. but its core operations, that is, the incentivisation advertisement consumer, the advertising system maintenance, and the open advertising content, combined with the onot mechanism, will not change unless required modified through voting. chapter six execution preface recently, users from all over the world are questioning and protesting against facebook for leaking private information nearly million users. this abominable act clearly exemplifies how social network can misused. not only sells users personal private data for profit, can even involve greater schemes and conspiracies--changing the political climate, controlling the thinking people, and destroy people's lives. difficult paradox because this, users will have the following concern: will ono like facebook other centralised platforms? will they peep users? sell and leak user data.? the answer negative. any centralised for-profit organisation should not interfere with the data rights users. when centralised platform exploits the rights users, they are definitely engaging wrongdoing. ono free, decentralised social network; its mission restore user rights themselves. therefore, ono and the ono team would never peep users, sell leak their data. americans believe that facebook's data leakage unacceptable http://tech.qq.com/a//.htm order ensure user experience and efficiency, early user content will stored through small number centralised solutions. the same time, order the true safety content, when the technology mature enough, the contents will transferred ipfs and the original centralised server copy destroyed. ensure openness and transparency, all the coding will gradually open source, thus eliminating user concerns. but then, there will another question that cannot overlooked: will the ono social network completely free social network without any regulation? can one post any content they want even malicious nature? the answer also negative. social network, along with its purpose and significance, not merely simple developer tool chat software--just previously mentioned the economic system, functions gold mine for human culture; bears people's non-material cultural intangible assets, producing long-lasting and deep impact humanity. the original intention launching social network such ono define attention value, encourage more quality content, reduce vulgar and low-quality content not exploit the attention users harm them any way. fact, from the long-term significance human civilisation, producing and propagating inferior content also kind evil itself. ono tries create kind civil governance content execution solution solve this paradox. the values undergirding ono the white paper previously stated: through "referendum", the ono social network's governance system would have democratic features. so, what cannot changed? order create free and prosperous social network environment, ono will maintain kind unchangeable resolution from beginning end, that is: ono uses the community consensus baseline; all the social network members are equal and should all respected and happy; with the ultimate vision being have prosperous social network ecosystem. these are the values undergirding ono, these values exist naturally and cannot affected any will and will never changed. the execution ono "liberty consists the freedom everything which injures one else." declaration the rights man and the citizen, fourth article, imagine that ono non-regulated, fully free social network. any person can use ono for evil purposes they like. then, the user experience ono will even worse than that underground network--criminal, discrimination, and extreme discourse, groundless content and terrorism, anti-humanity, and other types content that are extremely negative the point where its dissemination hurts society would running wild. would eventually come point where the bad outnumbers the good, lead hatred, war, other worse consequences. fact, this not the true definition freedom. freedom comes with its established responsibilities, duties, and respect for rights people. its basis not harm. the right for people realise express their will, but without doing harm. ono will absolutely not tolerate any behaviour that hurts the rights its people. this kind content will hidden. users that engage malicious behaviour will reported and punished. thus, another question arises: who decides which content violation the rules? who will come manage the content ono? from beginning end ono committed decentralised and democratic governance. the values ono not support any centralised methods-- centralised evaluation and execution will lead great amount bad user experience. this why the super partners' role born. this type election system where certain highly regarded community members will chosen "super partners". super partners (see chapter ono partners) are chosen through referendum where all members ono participate, representing their will. chapter seven the dac ono small country has fewer people. though there are machines that can work ten hundred times faster than man, they are not needed. the people take death seriously and not travel far. though they have boats and carriages, one uses them. though they have armour and weapons, one displays them. men return the knotting rope place writing. their food plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure; they are happy their ways. though they live within sight their neighbours, and crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way, yet they leave each other peace while they grow old and die." chapter tao ching, translation gia-fu feng (feng jia feng jia-fu, and jane english (-) vintage books, https://terebess.hu/english/tao/gia.html#kap the dac (decentralised autonomous community) ono distributed, autonomous organisation running continuously within the ono social network. the dac operation mechanism ono divides operational tasks and distributes them publicly, that operations can implemented transparently and without management. participants not need employees part the dac ono. after using the partner system for period time, the ono team discovered the importance the organisation's governance mechanism. truly decentralised social network requires that the founding team well the technology itself decentralised and promoted the community. management and governance should decentralised well. centralisation will result corruption and abuse people's rights the short term. the long term, centralised organisation will rely top-down management which will result narrower and narrower design; conversely, decentralised organisations will bring the consensus human thinking and the formation natural co-governance which will lead the development and prosperity its ecosystem. lao tzu said the tao ching, "yet they leave each other peace while they grow old and die." the "small country, few people" chapter the tao ching consists acknowledging the significance differentiation roles and communities society, but opposes the imposition centralised, wide-scale values. the intention that addition acknowledging top-down wisdom, also recognises contextual rights that are created communities from the bottom up. federalism more idealised for equality, collectivism, consensus, and autonomy. "letting communities self-organise combined with some outside governance" contains the fundamental meaning decentralisation. when larger and rigidly controlled structures are involved public governance and which are brought into being through the consolidation power, they not know how let communities self-organise, the abuse rights extremely likely. freedom, equality, social co-governance and diversity are the values the social network ono. the vision ono similar that lao tzu's approach public governance and coincides with the concept the dac. the dac ono thus born. what dac? the dac organisation has the following characteristics: management discretisation autonomous voting mechanism decision-making process transparent, decision-making reversible there administrative overlord; any distributed autonomous institution must have mechanism expel the founder, and should not under the exclusive control any one individual. therefore, administrator roles can automatically change hands maintain vitality. for example, the governance mechanism wikipedia decided kick out its founder from the wiki foundation. come and freely. join any time and leave voluntarily any time. the sub-organisation has the same characteristics the main-level organisation. therefore, subordinate relationship exists between the many layers within the organisation, but they should mutually cooperative. the organisations are symbiotic and form mesh-like interconnected web. each point the web forms non-linear fashion and able influence other points without needing through strict hierarchy. dac incentives ono historical data shows that traditional social media spends less than its revenue each year operational expansion, can seen from past case studies. obviously, investment operational promotion can increase the number new users more quickly, increase the activity the social ecosystem, and promote the development it. this activity has long-term benefits for the social network ono. dac operational incentives pool ono therefore, amount onots issued for smart contracts every day, that is, total onots will flow into the dac operational rewards pool ono and dedicated dac operations. (for example, the remuneration and costs incurred community partners, volunteers will paid through dac operating expenses allocated through ono). early dac operational incentive pool management ono since the dac operations ono has not yet been formed, the dac operation pool ono temporarily being managed the nome tech pty, the main body the founding team. jointly planned and used the super partners, the founding team and all the dac organisations ono. all decision-making processes, operating conditions, operating costs, and final proposal results will published. the flow expenses will also recorded and tracked the blockchain. order prevent collective corruption, users have the right monitor and influence the use dac operating expenses ono through referendum. different organisations dacs ono the dac community partners ono community partners are class dac organisations that are part the dac operations ono. mentioned above, dac operation ono upholds the principles decentralisation, creating, developing, and governing the community and promoting social networking. the community partners are not full-time part-time employees ono, but participate the prosperous development ono autonomous, cogoverning dac style. theory, the number community partners everchanging, autonomous and infinitely variable. community partners consist the most well-respected members the community ono, and they take initiatives assume the responsibility establishing the community ono addition they are counsellors for the founding team regarding the operational needs ono. based the values ono, and order grow the community and social network ono their organisational goal, community partners need use their ability build relationships with their group members and keep the community active, creating autonomous, prosperous and active ono network. they need have ongoing discussions about the environment within their communities. although the founding team not obligated participate the governance the dac ono, will its best support the community partners fulfilling their organisational goals with friendly attitude and collaborative spirit. for example, resources such materials, founding team incentive sharing, online media traffic, dac operating rewards pool funding, etc., are provided assist community partners forming autonomous and prosperous community. dac community volunteers ono community volunteers form type dac organisation that part dac operations ono. mentioned above, the dac operation mechanism ono upholds the principle decentralisation, creating, developing, and governing the community and promoting social networking. the community volunteers are not full-time part-time employees ono. instead, they participate the prosperous development ono through the means autonomous and coordinated dac activities. theory, the number volunteers the community ever-changing, autonomous and infinitely variable. community volunteers act based the core philosophy and values ono. they are willing guard the main system returning value content creators, answer questions from new users about participating the processes ono, help more people understand ono, and better understand how ono can meet their respective needs. although the founding team not obligated participate the governance the dac ono, will its best support the community volunteers fulfilling their organisational goals with friendly attitude and collaborative spirit. for example, resources such materials, founding team incentive sharing, online media traffic, and dac operations incentive pool funding are provided assist them the dissemination the values ono. dac tone partners ono the tone partner the abbreviation the founding partner the early social network building ono. this refers the first people who joined the social network ono addition the developer team ono. the tone partners will the first participate the building content mechanisms, creative support, active contributions, and popularisation users who might potentially like ono before the social network ono fully open the general public. the social network ono grateful the tone partners for their early trust, commitment and support. return, ono will award the tone partners with series incentives within the social network, including but not limited onot. the tone partners will joining three stages. they are: the first phase; the second phase; and the third phase. total million onots will used for incentivising keynote partner participation. dac co-contributing partners ono the co-contributing partner abbreviation for the joint construction partner the social network and refers person who, addition the developer team ono, provides early financial support, development and assistance the social network ono. the social network ono expresses its gratitude the partners ono for their early trust, commitment and support. return, ono will incentivise the co-contributing partners with range things the social network, including but not limited onot. according the degree contribution, co-contributing partners are divided into several levels. co-contributing partners will enjoy series exclusive rights within the social network, including exclusive mission incentives onot, marker the value created the co-contributors. the cocontributing partners have the right retract their support for the social network ono any time. when their support retracted, all the partners' special rights, including the incentivised onot, will have returned. unlimited possibilities: the dac ono mentioned above, the dac ono will continue grow with the development the social network ono and onot, and will also produce unpredictable changes. the future, there may more secondary dac organisations belonging the dac ono. let reiterate here that the core values ono will always the same. special members the dac ono: super partner super partners are the loyal guardians the values the social network ono and are the managers the social networking content which needs collapsed. not only that, the super partners are obliged pass the values ono others, plus develop and assist more community partners and volunteers. the mission the super partners maintain the security, freedom and decentralisation the social network ono, properly manage harmful content, prevent abusive behaviour from spreading, and transmit the values ono. this will the prerequisite for the development the social network ono. the super partners should be: loyal, kind, self-controlled, humble, possess long-term vision and embody firm beliefs, and serve all humanity. punishment and consequences the social network ono, the content ecosystem important component. the importance optimising content quality and reducing the influence harmful content obvious. ono can use the reputation mechanism promote the birth high quality content with "invisible hands" curb the proliferation low-quality content; individual dispute cases can resolved through referendums but there still problem inefficiency judging the content the common program. when there content that obviously does not conform the boundaries the social network common program ono and needs immediately collapsed, everyone requires the super partner complete this work extremely short period time prevent the social network from being contaminated. ono provides super partners with efficient and collaborative working method. super partners can perform actions against harmful content through web-based management background/mobile management back-end tools. communication and incentives undoubtedly, the role the super partner will assume critically important responsibility and will also attract large amount onot incentives. however, worth mentioning that the super partners need reasonably allocate the obtained onot according operational requirements. order ensure the safety users the social network ono and sustainably develop the super partnership system, the super partners' real-life information and operations will required publicised. any one user may impeach super partner they not work evil. definition super partner super partners have the following characteristics: the total number super partners numbers more than persons, who are selected through the public election system; the super partner does not need belong any enterprise entity, only decentralised dac organisation; super partners are special type dac organisation. although they are dac ono, their incentives are not derived from the dac operation rewards pool ono; the super partner similar administrator the social network; the difference between this management mechanism and the traditional centralised platform/existing decentralised platform (.) that the super partner's authority mediated through the common program. clearly, the power the user community over the super partner can effectively exhibited, i.e., through complaints, impeachment, veto, and general elections. and, most importantly, the super partners and all users are community interests rather than antagonistic relationships. super partners also have certain rights: content management/third-party application management/participation operations, markets, technology iterations, etc ono. super partner roundtable proposal the referendum, virtually every user can participate promoting the prosperity the ecosystem ono through referendum vote. however, actual experiments, has been found that the democratic mechanism ono has non-negligible efficiency problem, which will lead long process from decision-making action and will hurt the user experience. super partner roundtable proposal that balances democracy and efficiency came into being. representatives public opinion without prejudice the common program and public interest, the super partners have the ability bypass the referendum within their jurisdiction and vote through the super partner roundtable. all the proposals and voting results super partners will published the social network ono and the official website. the founding team will never participate this proposal form and voting. founding team's early one-vote veto the founding team retains veto vote the selection the first generation super partners. this done prevent the collective corruption the super partners, and there may awareness impeachment rights the early users the social network ono. user rights are most important aspect users can reject proposal passed any super partner through referendum. needs reiterated that the power the super partner always effectively mediated the public consensus. users can vote for the super partners that she wishes elect from previous elections, complain about super partner that she disgruntled with, impeach him/her, and reject any the super partners' proposals. the first generation super partners: trial period the first batch super partners emerged april this time, the social network ono had not yet been launched and they cannot voted through the referendum. but the white paper section says, "the social network ono requires super partners." early trust and support are important components for social network. thanks the first batch supporters ono, the first generation super partners partnered with communities that have contributed the early building ono. people and volunteers submitted applications. community partners and volunteers can apply become the first generation super partners. this position can voluntarily retracted but not transferable others. this stage, there will super partners who embody the values ono and are willing contribute the early building the social network ono. order ensure that the process truly open and transparent, ono will publish this data and selection process. options addition the community partners and volunteers, the super partners also set alternative list. alternative super partners are also selected the community partners/volunteers. when the super partners the trial phase are appointed removed, the alternative super partners will fill the vacancies. trial period due the special nature the first generation super partners, the super partners exist the trial phase before the first super partner election. during this trial phase, any super partners who have not fulfilled their duties will removed. appointment and removal mechanism ensure the safety users the social network and for the sustainable development the super partnership system, the super partners' real-life information and operations will required published. any one user may impeach super partner they not work evil. publishing schedule according the open and free user ecosystem ono, order ensure that the work the super partners open, transparent, and verifiable, the daily work the super partners will published, such the number teams and workers, amount work completed, awarding bonuses, etc. all users ono will able clearly understand the working ability and output each super partner based their work documentation order determine which the super partners will receive their vote during the next general election. the same time, ono will regularly organise weekly and monthly meetings the super partners. each super partner will report their work, including but not limited the team-building situation, the problems encountered and the necessary collaboration. the meeting will publicly published. the purpose the meeting create joint strategies for the team ono and the super partners build and improve the super partner system. formal super partner mechanism data shows that traditional social media companies recruit more than employees each year content review specialists. has been learnt the super partners section that necessary collapse inferior content. reducing inferior content can improve the quality user content and the same time increase the social activity the network. this also has long-term benefits for the entire ecosystem ono. from this can seen that the super partners will assume enormous operational pressures and will also responsible for the development the social ecosystem ono. the same time, with regard the continuous development ono the future, multi-lingual global super partners will likely participate not only this form but perhaps they will create secondary dac organisation establish cross-cultural effort. super partner incentive pool ono portion onots, i.e., total onots, will issued via smart contracts daily basis, which will flow into the super partner incentive pool ono and will dedicated supporting the development the super partner ecosystem. distribution super partners are part the dac organisation ono, but because they have fixed total number and are elected, they have considerable influence. the ono team believes that greater responsibility and higher degree involvement the decentralised, self-organised system ono will mean that super partners will have act with complete transparency. therefore, the work the super partners will quantified and the distribution method onots will decided accordingly. this distribution model should based the consensus the super partner dac ono. its allocation will through trial period until reaches the consensus the users. the ono team believes that short-term chaos and confusion will unavoidable just like the experience anarchy, but undeniable that this practical process necessary. all decision-making processes, operating conditions, costs, and proposal results will published. the record expenses will also recorded and tracked the blockchain. order prevent collective corruption, users have the right monitor and influence the distribution and use the super partner incentive pool ono through referendum. election mechanism ono has detailed procedures for the super partner election. candidates: ono based freedom, decentralised user intent, statement the general election, from fixed point time and ending the next election, candidates may have the intention apply for public information line with the rules the election any channel, and publish campaign statements and

target ,,users chapter ten challenges and strategies for the social network ono, the main challenges are two-fold: capacity and efficiency. the capacity issue will grow the number social network users grows for ono. with the increase the number users, the speed and amount content managed will experience explosive growth. increasing content will put pressure storage; ipfs peer-to-peer distributed storage network, suitable for single upload multiple downloads, which characteristic the social network. can ease the pressure data volume surges; however, the exponential level data volume increases, the download speed will still problem considered. are considering use ipfs, something similar, some modified version it. will use the onochain preview network test performance and scaling before deciding the final storage system. the efficiency problem also huge challenge. based the characteristics the blockchain, the drastic increase data volume will lead inefficient chaining and will result poor user experience. the social network ono adopts the dpos-based eosio software, trying solve the ever-increasing pressure efficiency. however, when the number users extremely large, the speed the consensus algorithm still constraint factor, better algorithm required support high concurrency scenarios. will make certain modifications the eosio software, tune for our use case, and expect achieve the necessary performance parameters. fortunately, the increasingly open operating strategy ono will synchronised with iterative techniques, enabling the implementation ideal community step-by-step. will continuously track and implement performance and other enhancements eosio, from the main repository, the eos mainnet, and other eos based sister chains. dpos+bft implemented eos long-awaited, high-quality solution described the previous section, can effectively solve performance problems and support high-concurrency data network. experience from the eos mainnet, launched june shows that can achieve transactions per second. expect this improve gradually over time, and will stay current with improvements. onochain will launch cooperation with experienced, capable block producers which have experience from the eos mainnet, ensure stability and that the top technical skills are applied. the initial producers will globally distributed, independent and highly decentralized appointees. this time, the content creation infrastructure ono has been completed and more optimised version will released eos. once completed, registration will officially opened all users. through the foreseeable future, ono will operate the eosio dpos architecture. should new blockchain technology emerge and prove more effective, will consider and possibly migrate that new technology. the ono technical team will continuously evaluate and implement technical solutions. the team will make choices which are based open source and open standards, and which will always allow migration better solutions. chapter eleven core team ono founder ceo chief economic ecosystem successfully graduated from nanjing foreign languages school, university california, riverside (ucr), coventry university
