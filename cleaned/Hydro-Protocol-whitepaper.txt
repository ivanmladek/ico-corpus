decentralized exchanges offer trustless non-custodial trading, improved transparency, and ability share order books. despite these advantages, decentralized exchanges today account for negligible percentage the overall cryptocurrency transaction volume. reasons for lack adoption include high technical barrier entry, performance and usability issues, availability, and lack incentives for coordination. hydro middleware layer top incentive system for decentralized exchanges. background problems and challenges usability and performance issues completely on-chain decentralized exchanges are slower and more expensive than centralized exchanges. empirical evidence suggests that the majority users won't trade away significant degradation performance for improved security. susceptibility arbitrage the off-chain maker, on-chain taker model performs better than purely on-chain exchanges. however, they are still susceptible arbitrage, front-running, and order collisions. technical barrier entry successful exchanges are often built and run operation focused teams, for whom the technical difficulties building high performance hybrid exchange become barrier entry. related work there are multitude projects related decentralized exchanges. the landscape can roughly represented decision tree with few branching points: compatibility scalability projects such bitshares can offer real-time, on-chain exchange. however, standalone solutions typically not have the ability trade assets other blockchains with native efficiency. hydro designed support least erc tokens the ethereum network. price discovery mechanism projects such kyber and airswap offload the responsibility price discovery reserve managers, who themselves presumably rely either set formulas price oracles. hydro built power decentralized exchanges that come with built-in price discovery mechanisms(i.e limit order matching engines). availability certain projects are completely reliant future work solve scalability and cross chain support. this discussion limited the subset projects that works without (but can still benefit from) the arrival technologies such raiden, plasma, cosmos, and polkadot. hybrid model limit the scope discussion efficient, order book based solutions which work with the ethereum network today, one solution that works the called "off-chain maker, on-chain taker/settlement" model. etherdelta one the first implementations such hybrid model. open protocol extracted from this model. hydro protocol hydro designed around the following assumptions: canonical order schema the elemental unit exchange order (i.e. buy sell amount rate). decentralized exchanges can ether use proprietary order schema, openly shared one. one advantage having everyone use canonical open order schema that these orders can match against each other, resulting cross-exchange liquidity sharing. additional concern that the smart contracts used decentralized exchanges have permission hold and transfer assets, and could potentially contain loss-inducing bugs. fragmented system the order level increases the possibility accidental loss theft. help establish canonical order schema, hydro built top the open order protocol incentive share open order makes possible share liquidity. but not evident why decentralized exchanges would want share liquidity. open, permission-less orders are easier arbitrage, and more likely result order collisions (more details this later). usability problems aside, unclear why the first batch decentralized exchanges would give their main barrier entry and proactively help bootstrap potential competitors. hydro introduces incentive system that encourages decentralized exchanges cooperate and share liquidity. common framework although there are thousands cryptocurrency exchanges with wildly different operating characteristics, they are quite similar features and technical implementations. hydro provides set middleware components lower the cost creating hybrid decentralized exchanges and marketplaces. scope hydro set middleware components top incentive mechanism. resides between the dapp layer and the order and settlement layer the hybrid decentralized exchange stack (figure (figure hydro protocol scope) shared liquidity model crucial question for decentralized exchange "who has permission match order?" the typical answers lies two extremes: open: anyone can match order the benefit the open order model that enables the possibility global liquidity pool. the drawback that open orders can only canceled on-chain, and thus are more susceptible arbitrage and order collision. closed: only single address (the exchange itself) can match order the exchange has exclusive permission match orders, then can provide instant cancellation and protection from front-running. however, this type order cannot shared. hydro takes intermediate approach: manages set permission lists, each representing alliance exchanges that can share liquidity with each other. also keeps ledger liquidity provided and taken for each actor the system. addition, hydro provides pool membership and governance features, and handles the distribution transaction fees. protocol token (hot) top the liquidity ledger, hydro distributes protocol token periodically incentive for providing liquidity. token distribution hydro distributes hot tokens each account the system periodically according the follow formula: ttv where set percentage tokens distribute out the reserve. remaining reserve tokens transaction volume provided during this period for current account ttv (total transaction volume provided during this period all parties) token usage tokens issued cryptocurrency exchanges are typically some form membership bonus, including reduced fees, airdrops, and vip features. although these tokens are technically decentralized terms ownership, they are economically centralized. the worth the typical exchange token completely tied the business performance the issuing exchange. hot roughly equivalent decentralized version such membership tokens. users obtain tokens providing liquidity, and can choose stake tokens particular liquidity pool obtain membership benefits. note that although hydro's middleware layer provides the mechanism for membership benefits, left the exchanges decide which benefits offer. equilibrium will come from competition over user loyalty. token consumption prevent frequent jumping between pools and replenish the token reserve, frictional fee charged for the following actions: the act joining new liquidity pool for exchanges costs hot tokens. for individual traders, staking hot tokens join pool (in order receive benefits) free, but percentage consumed withdraw. note the distribution mechanism does not distinguish between normal traders and market makers. liquidity providers receive hot tokens addition what they earn from the spread. this beneficial side effect, any hydro based exchanges inherit the ability attract liquidity providers. justification for existence the purpose the hydro protocol token act force the formation shared liquidity pools. the answer "why not just use ether" that the value these tokens correlated with the total size the hydro liquidity sharing network. ddex the hydro team building and operating sample implementation such hybrid decentralized exchange. ddex (decentralized digital exchange) exists for the following purposes: showcase that hybrid decentralized exchanges are (barely) possible today, and will get better over time drive real world usage and feedback for the protocol layers bootstrap liquidity which can used eventually the formation federated liquidity pools summary decentralized exchange protocols inevitably will become cornerstone the entire blockchain ecosystem. however, there are both technical and economical challenges the path widespread user adoption. hydro provides incentive layer and time-saving middleware framework for operationally focused teams looking build decentralized exchanges and marketplaces today. appendix https://github.com/xproject/whitepaper/blob/master/x_white_paper.pdf
