numeraire: cryptographic token for coordinating machine intelligence and preventing overfitting richard craib, geo|rey bradway, xander dunn with joey krug https://numer.ai february abstract machine learning competitions are susceptible intentional overfitting. numerai proposes numeraire, new cryptographic token that can used novel auction mechanism make overfitting economically irrational. the auction mechanism leads equilibrium bidding behavior that reveals rational data scientists' confidence their models' ability perform well new data. the auction mechanism also yields natural arguments for the economic value numeraire token. motivation common approach verify accuracy machine learning break the dataset into train and test sets. trained model can tested for accuracy the test set, which has never seen. however, maintain statistical validity, this test set should only used once. when data scientist accesses the test set multiple times and uses that score feedback for model selection, there's risk training model that overfits the test set. this hurts the model's ability perform well new data. figure overfitting curve where the test error continues decrease with more submissions from data scientists, but the error new data increases. this overfitting problem called adaptive data analysis []. models resulting from adaptive data analysis range from slightly degraded completely useless []. for numerai, adaptive data analysis occurs when data scientists' models have overfit historical data, the cost live performance. machine learning competition there incentive overfit the historical data because performance that data dictates winnings. overfitting becomes intentional. what numerai really needs not collection great backtests that work well historical data, but collection great models that work well new data. currently, the state the art solution holdout reuse limit the amount information exposed when using the holdout set []. while sufficent for scientific discovery, this solution heavily degrades user experience and rankings machine learning tournaments. propose new system for data scientists communicate their beliefs about the quality their models. data scientists will compete the new tournament staking new crypto-token, numeraire (nmr), their predictions. the auction mechanism for resolving these stakes will reward correct predictions model's ability perform well new data. with numeraire, data scientists will now able express their confidence their models' live performance. their expressions confidence help emphasize the right models and improve the performance our hedge fund. cryptographic tokens numeraire erc ethereum token []. ethereum tokens are represented smart contracts that are executed the ethereum blockchain. the source code numeraire's smart contract publicly available all minted numeraire are sent numerai. the ethereum smart contract dictates there will never more than million numeraire minted. numerai will send million numeraire data scientists based their historical ranking numerai's leaderboard. after the initial distribution, the smart contract will mint fixed number numeraire each week until the maximum reached. performing well numerai's machine learning competition, data scientists will earn numeraire ongoing basis. when data scientists are confident the predictions they have made, they send numeraire the numeraire ethereum smart contract. the receiving contract will hold the data scientists' numeraire for some holding period with sufficiently large judge performance new data. after has passed, numerai will send message the contract with information which data scientists' predictions performed well new data. those data scientists whose predictions performed well earn dollars based the auction mechanism, and their numeraire are returned. those data scientists whose predictions did not perform well new data risk having their numeraire destroyed. the irreversible destruction these numeraire will publicly verifiable the ethereum blockchain. https://github.com/numerai/contract auction overview every tournament has staking prize pool, which some fixed number dollars. the auction mechanism allocates the prize pool among data scientists. data scientists can submit bids the auction. bids are tuples (c, where confidence defined the number numeraire the data scientist willing stake win dollar, and the amount numeraire being staked. for some time locked the ethereum contract, inaccessible anyone, including numerai. after has passed, variant the multiunit dutch auction used determine the payouts. auction mechanism the auction mechanism multiunit dutch auction with some additional rules. performance evaluated after time the performance evaluation metric logloss suitable metric for binary classification problems like numerai's machine learning competition. model considered have performed well logloss numeraire worth more data scientists with large because they can use earn dollars with higher confidence. data scientist with has expected value dollars e(c, this data scientist, the value all numeraire the net present value all future stake payouts numerai. the purpose this auction get accurate probability estimates, not maximize numeraire staked. the auction need not revenue maximizing, but self-revelation important. while weakly dominant strategy second priced auctions bid truthfully, second priced auctions are more susceptible collusion and first priced auctions are more robust this []. for this reason, and for simplicity, use dutch auction (first priced) rather than ausubel auction. references dwork, feldman, hardt, pitassi, reingold, roth. generalization adaptive data analysis and holdout reuse.
