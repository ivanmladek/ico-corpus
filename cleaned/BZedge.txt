community assist adoption the name freedom and liberty for all. trade should controlled solely the buyer and the supplier. however, operate society where there are far too many middlemen and hidden costs that destroy our economies, forcing smaller medium business crumble under inflated taxes and pressing end consumers pay inflated prices. this cycle, turn, fuels poverty places predominantly controlled the elite. bzedge believes, that with its technology, businesses will equipped take back control, drive growth and breed success. bzedge committed achieving these goals and realizing this mission, with powerful community following, backed strong development team. fork details and methodology bzedge forked from bitcoinz and intended provide generation, technologically agile blockchain. will provide growth and added value the community with low supply, fast block times, and freedom pursue advanced technological improvements. all btcz holders, prior the fork, can acquire their bzedge

addresses. road map, strategy and incentives outlined bzedge provides its users with fast, secure, and anonymous (zk-snarks privacy) transactions, and equihash provides proof-of-work architecture with low transaction fees benifiting both the community and businesses alike. transparent shielded transactions conclusion acknowledgements bzedge white paper version voluntary contribution table contents

upon its origin points value and asset-based cryptocurrency. enjoys structure freedom that allows for the rapid development cutting-edge technology and lowered barrier entry for business services. gone are the laborious decisions which take weeks instead hours. gone are the limitations white papers. say, "hello" strong and powerful ecosystem with the freedom for both on-chain and off-chain software implementations that will bring cryptocurrency new level and increase value for users, investors, and holders alike. roadmap, strategy and incentives bzedge will have organisational structure facilitate contracts and agreements bodies interested sharing and developing crypto technology portfolios. members the community are reminded that the coin technology free software, and both the code and the blockchain may forked there sufficient development potential and passion providing alternative for the community. this, essence, provides strong voting mechanism, making the decisions the developers and the roadmap mutable. bzedge white paper version conlusion bzedge blockchain cryptocurrency developed and maintained the community with members from around the globe combining ideas make this project success. the belief financial freedom through decentralized, fast, low-fee, and private transactions keep the fulfilment the project alive. table contents introduction fork details and methodology bzedge's technologies and ideas allow growth for future development and improvement alternative governance methodologies. the business applications bzedge range from worldwide transactions purchases small medium businesses. bzedge will strive usher new era for businesses and also propel beneficial change for consumers. proof-of-work technologies transparent shielded transactions 

thirst for currency with limited supply, and worldwide system-wide consensus model that provides effective voting role for all participants. the original mantra satoshi nakomoto was cpu, vote. bzedge seeks further and improve upon this vision. z-cash one the most innovative coins, with superb, extremely intelligent and articulate developers. z-cash incorporates the fundamental technology bitcoin, adding layer privacy, where transparent coins are essentially dissolved when they enter shielded pool transactions invisible public blockchain observers. the transparent bitcoin-like funds are essentially minted afresh when funds move from the pool back the transparent pool. this development provides privacy transactions, but also erases spending history for coins, since, like fresh banknote, they have previous spends. just like fresh banknote from bank, your legitimately received coins will free competing claims. bitcoinz generation coin, incorporating the technology above, yet following similar maturity path years per halving. bitcoinz aims full decentralization, with final coin production billion. bzedge generation coin, based the preceding coin technology, incorporating strong privacy features, the strong fungibility the currency units, and circulation level make the currency units workable magnitude terms value. bzedge accelerates the maturity period revising each
