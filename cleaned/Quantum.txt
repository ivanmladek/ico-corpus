medium exchange using cryptography secure the transactions and control the creation additional units the currency. cryptocurrencies are subset alternative currencies, specifically digital currencies. bitcoin became the first decentralized cryptocurrency since then, numerous cryptocurrencies have been created. these are frequently called altcoins, blend bitcoin alternative. bitcoin and its derivatives use decentralized control opposed centralized electronic money/centralized banking systems. the decentralized control related the use bitcoin's blockchain transaction database the role distributed ledger. source: wikipedia.com www.quantumproject.org overview cryptocurrency and digital asset markets are relatively small compared traditional finance markets and not allow large institutional investors enter this new and fast growing ecosystem. one the main reasons preventing large players from entering the crypto revolution are illiquid order books and wide market spreads. this prevents sizeable cash flows from entering and exiting the markets efficient and cost effective way and leads scepticism among traditional money managers. support this fast growing ecosystem various crypto currencies and digital assets, the crypto economy needs professional and large provider liquidity across all crypto related markets. this will lead faster and more stable growth the entire crypto economy. year trading volumes www.quantumproject.org quantum project the aim the quantum project bring institutional grade liquidity cryptocurrency and digital asset markets. this will achieved creating liquidity pool funds and allowing crypto community participate increasing the depth various order books. the liquidity pool will funded issuing quantum tokens that will sold and traded various crypto markets. quantum token quantum tokens will issued the ethereum network and will freely traded open market. ethereum open-source project which allows creation smart contracts and provides users with secure and fast transaction system. presale period all issued tokens will made available early adopters during presale period. the conditions the presale, including the start and the end date, will published the official project website. all funds collected from the sale quantum tokens will injected into the liquidity pool and used provide liquidity for different exchanges any other crypto markets created the future. www.quantumproject.org issuance tokens quantum tokens will issued and distributed among presale investors later than days after the presale period completed. the amount tokens issued will final and based the amount funds collected during the presale period. all instructions how take delivery quantum tokens will sent email addresses specified investors during the presale period. trading tokens the quantum project will promote and add quantum tokens many marketplaces possible. this process will start soon tokens have been issued. buybacks, data quoting any other market actions performed the issuer will executed open market and will announced the official project website. token buybacks any income generated from the liquidity pool will used buy back tokens the best possible price available open markets. this operation will executed monthly basis and publicly announced the official website the project. www.quantumproject.org destruction process all tokens that will bought back the quantum project will sent black hole address and will get destroyed forever. the black hole address will published the official project website and will auditable real time. this process will decrease the amount tokens existence and increase the value all other tokens still held token holders. liquidity pool the quantum project will reserve issued tokens able support further development and increase the size liquidity pool the future boost the ability make markets they grow larger and more liquid. the increased amount funds the liquidity pool will also speed the destruction process all tokens existence and add more upside potential the growth the value single quantum token. www.quantumproject.org risk management the quantum project will use advanced risk management models mitigate any potential loss funds the liquidity pool. all models have been back-tested since the inception bitcoin and will modified meet all risk profiles any currency digital asset that will start trading open markets. any funds waiting deployed the market will held secure multi signature vaults. www.quantumproject.org
