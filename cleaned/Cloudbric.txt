traffic conversion accurate traffic detection end-point security technical overview secure web gateway cloudbric (clb) cryptocurrency wallet threat database data protection user authentication resources cloudbric whitepaper current cybersecurity reality the world shifts more interconnected and internet driven society, the need secure private online data becoming increasingly paramount. the open flow information between various online channels makes both users and organizations highly vulnerable cyber hacking. critical online data breaches are now reaching record highs with millions personal records being stolen each and every year. cyber attacks are also expanding their reach into new and emerging markets, such cryptocurrency assets and exchanges. the past year alone, multiple cryptocurrency funds, worth over hundreds millions, were hijacked online criminals. this makes protection for digital assets found within the cryptocurrency market new top priority for all users. order counteract the growing cybersecurity concern, users must take action safeguarding private data flowing across all communications protocols (i.e. email, websites, mobile devices, cryptocurrency exchanges, etc.). however, the implementation and management multiple security solutions can extremely difficult task due fundamental issues present the market, which ultimately inhibits users from fully embracing the widespread adoption cybersecurity. issues facing end users the information security market whole need major paradigm shift with emphasis efficiency, transparency, and trust. this due variety issues that users face within the cybersecurity market. oversaturation security solutions the need secure data across numerous online channels has led the oversaturation solutions made available users. currently, there are more than solutions offered the cybersecurity market worldwide, which makes the selection process for each security solution overly complicated. users are usually left their own devices properly test, judge, and select from sea providers that offer similar solutions. also, the management these diverse solutions can quite burdensome users are forced adapt drastically different security platforms, software, settings configurations, pricing, etc. the idea taking layered approach cybersecurity, outlined above, simply inefficient and outdated. studies show that some organizations use different vendor made security solutions order solve host information security related issues. deploying more security solutions does not necessarily lead higher security. fact, utilizing excess solutions could leave users even more susceptible hackers users must cognizant system upgrades and security bugs found each respective software. cloudbric whitepaper for many users, cybersecurity very foreign and complicated subject. this leads vendors taking advantage users' lack knowledge flooding the market with overabundance security solutions. security providers should longer look profit off user naivety and instead should focus building consolidated solutions that allows users truly feel secure online. centralized threat intelligence data another issue present the information security market the lack transparency over threat intelligence data. providing servicing end users, cybersecurity vendors are able collect vast amounts emerging cyber threat information, such attack patterns and behaviors, malicious addresses, identification malware infected files, etc. however, threat intelligence data compiled through security servicing not made accessible for public use. vendors typically privatize this information and use for their own personal gain. for instance, cyber threat data used help develop new market solutions, issue pertinent software updates, create industry reports and analytics, etc., all which can valuable sources revenue. the other hand, users who help generate this data for vendors are left with little compensation and are forced continue paying for vendor made services. this uneven centralization threat data and lack compensation must come end. rather than profiting from the security community, cybersecurity vendors must become active leaders behalf the community making security intelligence open and accessible all. also, users should encouraged and incentivized secure their digital assets promote more trusted online society. uncertainty security performance lastly, the current organization the cybersecurity market makes very difficult discern the effectiveness various vendor made solutions. mentioned above, the market highly saturated with excess information security vendors and solutions. the only way for users properly distinguish vendor performance through direct testing these solutions. however, this can extremely resource intensive and costly ordeal. users typically need invest both time and money order learn about particular security solution, measure its respective performance, then decide whether will easy manage and deploy. however, general end users and small businesses may not have the necessary resources and capabilities test multiple security solutions all once. this leaves enterprise organizations the only target audience that can enjoy access the full spectrum security that every user needs. additionally, cybersecurity vendors tend excessively promote their security capabilities, but many lack industry experience high performance working products become trusted security vendor. this especially true within the ico arena where many fraudulent companies and vendors with limited security expertise run rampant. cloudbric whitepaper proposed solution cloudbric's primary mission revolutionize the cybersecurity market making information security

adoption cybersecurity best practices for the community. potential service providers can directly utilize cloudbric labs data via custom api, which can purchased using clb tokens. proceeds from enterprise api purchases will used replenish the existing security rewards token allocation pool for end users. cloudbric whitepaper roadmap cloudbric whitepaper appendix deep learning technical overview these days, the technology market gradually becoming more and more enamored with industry buzzwords, such artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, etc. proper utilization and integration these technologies for specific purposes extremely difficult task. however, the benefits and market disrupting capabilities technology staggering, which why cloudbric's research and development team has been focused developing patented in-house deep learning engine focused cybersecurity detection. despite having one the lowest false positive rates for web attack detection the market, cloudbric always wondered there was even better way further improve its accuracy rate. cloudbric also realized that human intervention could sometimes better detect cyber attacks with the naked eye through constant traffic monitoring. however, since difficult logistically expend human capital resources constantly monitoring online traffic, cloudbric's research and development team ultimately decided build one the world's first deep learning modules specifically designed for intelligent detection and differentiation online traffic data. development history cloudbric's deep learning technology was developed cloudbric's internal team machine learning developers and phd scholars from the korea institute science technology (kaist), korea university, and the massachusetts institute technology (mit). order properly train the newly developed deep learning module, the team first had overcome how feed deep learning machine with web traffic data. the past, deep learning machines were successfully designed accept data pixels. this made the feeding image data very convenient since all images are already comprised thousands pixels. however, all online requests, communications, and web addresses are presented via cloudbric whitepaper system letters and phrases. this left the r&d team with tough task repurpose alphabetical characters into deep learning machine for properly conceptualize the data and make sound judgements. the cloudbric team came the conclusion that web traffic must converted more easily digestible form data for deep learning machine grasp. explain better how the conversion works, each letter and symbol the various components that make online traffic was first converted into image. the deep learning machine was then programmed discover specific patterns regularities/irregularities within these corresponding images. from there, the deep learning module was trained differentiate between patterns found legitimate and malicious online traffic. traffic conversion put this simpler context, cloudbric researchers were able convert specific pattern online traffic known "dbfc" into the image shown below. figure deep learning image conversion the deep learning machine would then trained find the relation between other images pieces online traffic benchmark. afterwards, based its findings, the machine would accurately decide whether "dbfc" legitimate traffic malicious traffic. cloudbric whitepaper figure basic structure cloudbric deep learning the initial onset cloudbric's development, there were lack other deep learning modules out the market that could properly convert characters into sets distinguished images. cloudbric was able accomplish this feat testing two open source machines based convolutional neural network (cnn) structures that were apt for this task. cloudbric tested both machines and found out that both have their advantages and disadvantages. for instance, one machine would easier train, but performed with less accuracy than the second machine. cloudbric ultimately chose utilize the faster module for web traffic detection because the latter machine was unable process the extraordinary number web traffic logs being updated continuous basis. after the appropriate machine selection, the research and development team ran into another problem. when they tried apply this machine specifically geared towards web attacks, the team quickly realized that certain characters attack urls could not included the conventional set letters (which recognized machine). this meant that the cloudbric team had find way for the machine accept any characters without any restriction due the fact that web sites could built variety languages. cloudbric whitepaper this led the team implementing patented technology, which helps read cyber attacks utf- hexadecimal format, and then feed back into the deep learning machine. this allowed the deep learning machine accept any utf- based characters, which eventually enabled the team train the module geared specifically for web traffic recognition. accurate traffic detection regards machine accuracy, the cloudbric team came with primitive, yet effective solution known incremental learning. instead having single machine doing all the work, the cloudbric team will initially establish four deep learning machines that have each been trained with four weeks worth cyber attack data. the team would then assign weights each these machines depending their error rates. type period trained data machine week week machine week week machine week week final result where defined as... log machine weight machine week week output machine error rate the period and the final result above are subject change depending the accuracy the cloudbric testing results. however, current internal deep learning testing results have shown stunning accuracy rate increase compared the standard logic-based cloudbric web application firewall (waf) engine. for the sake comparison, cloudbric's waf engine regarded one the lowest false positive rated wafs the market industry analysts. summary, cloudbric had overcome three main hurdles order develop its proprietary deep learning engine convert web traffic characteristics pixels, seek efficiency the chosen machine, and improve machine accuracy standards. the cloudbric team was able overcome these obstacles early which paved the way cloudbric whitepaper for the integration cloudbric's patented deep learning engine, vision, into all pre-existing and planned cloudbric security solutions. end-point security technical overview although cloudbric plans expand security servicing for its reverse ico project, cloudbric's current security-as-aservice only provides server-side security for end users. this includes security solutions, such waf, cdn speed optimization, ddos protection, ssl encryption, etc., which mainly used protect particular web server and not applicable for the end-point devices. the cloudbric team understands that most general end users rarely interact with web server, while mobile devices and pcs are part their daily lives. the cybersecurity market currently does not integrate these two worlds (web security and mobile device security) under unified solution, which what cloudbric hopes make possible through its reverse ico venture. secure web gateway there are various ways breach the security end-point device. however, utilizing cloudbric's extensive resource database and partnering with established end-point security providers, cloudbric plans take down each these security risks and provide universal platform that will protect all user end-point devices. addition, the integration cloudbric's deep learning engine can applied better detect new and unknown malware sources, virus infected files, spam and phishing urls, etc. this will ultimately packaged into consolidated end-point centric client known cloudbric's secure web gateway. the secure web gateway client will downloadable client available for both and mobile phones. this client will function automatically enabling virtual private network (vpn) tunneling, which can connect users through cloudbric's extensive network service nodes strategically located all around the world. while cloudbric already has approximately active service regions open, one key milestone the cloudbric reverse ico will exponentially expand these service nodes (open service regions accommodate speed, stability, and performance from all user regions. the secure web gateway will not only protect end-point devices from day-to-day threats, such automated prevention spam/phishing url site visits, downloading malware infected files, e-mail scanning protection, etc., but will also ensure the security user owned cryptocurrency assets. cloudbric whitepaper cloudbric (clb) cryptocurrency wallet security has always been issue with cryptocurrency wallets. while online wallets are fast and easy use, all information transferred via the open internet. these types wallets only provide one method user authentication, and even two factor authentication (fa) enabled wallets are usually done online. this means that simple packet sniffer could easily gain unauthorized access these credentials. cold hardware crypto wallets try solve these security issues; however, the inconvenience the wallet being offline and the possibility losing the actual device itself too high risk for many people. cloudbric will look develop more secure cryptocurrency wallet (initial development for early utilizing the backbone its secure web gateway technology better store and prevent the risk unwanted transfers fraud addresses. the secure cloudbric clb crypto wallet will available both smartphones and pcs. addition, key feature the clb crypto wallet will the fact that the private key for the wallet will never revealed. instead, there will twelve user authenticated passphrases that would activate the wallet the user. once activated, users have the option setting secure password using biometrics re-access the wallet. not only would the clb wallet password protected, but mobile devices will also have the advantage utilizing fast identity online (fido) authentication methods. addition, the clb wallet will use end-to-end encryption (eee) communications, which means that stolen data packet would little use potential cyber criminal. lastly, the emergence crypto asset thefts has left lasting impression the entire cryptocurrency market. however, utilizing cloudbric's secure clb wallet, users will able deposit, store, and transfer their cryptocurrency with confidence. cloudbric's secure web gateway client, alongside its deep learning module, will able better detect and prevent the transfer user owned digital assets fraud cryptocurrency addresses. the database for compiling the list fraud wallet addresses will also powered cloudbric users from around the world contributing malicious addresses cloudbric labs part cloudbric's security rewards program. threat database the mere presence spam and phishing websites will always existence, long users have the ability interact with websites using sensitive information. one would assume that this day age, identifying and avoiding spam and phishing websites would easy task. however, the sophistication and accuracy new age counterfeit websites, especially within targeting cryptocurrency users, reaching new peak. cloudbric whitepaper many users are falling prey scam cryptocurrency exchange websites that look and feel like the original, but with very subtle and hard spot differences. for instance, these phishing websites replicate trustworthy website page page, but may sourced from unencrypted protocol (no ssl applied) could have very subtle character nuances the address url. users are not careful, these scam websites could lead the cryptocurrency theft the inability access one's exchange account. conventional solutions adequate job preventing access spam and phishing websites. for example, users will report the identification scam website email address and browsers/email clients will institute update block access these sources accordingly. however, the diversity these spam/phishing databases and the slow updating these databases have always been problem, especially when hackers launch new attacks. cloudbric's decentralized threat intelligence database (compiled cloudbric's security system and real time user contributions) plans become the go-to resource for spam and phishing address prevention. cloudbric's secure web gateway will utilize this growing database block access malicious email phishing attempts and/or scam websites. addition, cloudbric will also prevent transfer funds fraud cryptocurrency address listed the decentralized threat intelligence database. additionally, cryptocurrency wallet addresses are extremely difficult memorize they are series arbitrary numbers and characters, which means that most people simply copy and paste respective addresses use code for fund transfers. once users download the cloudbric secure web gateway client, the security client will automatically run simple check against the threat intelligence database soon users copy and paste recipient cryptocurrency wallet address (for third party wallets). the outgoing wallet address was reported malicious fraudulent the cloudbric community, the secure web gateway client will immediately notify the user about the possibility fraud and prevent the transfer funds. this will allow the cloudbric users have more reassurance that their funds are being protected even the event human error. furthermore, files existing personal computer would follow the same logic. cloudbric's secure web gateway will able scan and properly read the binary codes system files order crossmatch with the decentralized threat intelligence database for malware infections. malicious file that matches the binary the decentralized threat intelligence database was downloaded from particular website email address, then this information would also turn added cloudbric's database. all information from cloudbric's threat intelligence database will made accessible through cloudbric labs interactive tools and security resources for all users. cloudbric whitepaper data protection user authentication personal information has always been concern end-point devices. people typically store valuable information their computers and mobile phones since they assume that all information personal devices are safe. this far from the truth. information, such personal contacts, stored passwords, credit card numbers, and even personal vacation meeting schedules, can easily exposed once device connects the open internet. mentioned earlier, cloudbric will place priority establishing extensive network cloudbric service nodes (data centers) around the world. these service nodes will act proxy between end users and the rest the world. since the basic concept the cloudbric secure web gateway tunneling traffic through virtual private network, all traffic going and out the end user's device will flow through one these global service nodes. each node will monitor all internet connected traffic from device and allow users control the
