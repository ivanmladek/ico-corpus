"the received wisdom that economic inequality fated endure and even get worse makes all us, little way, marxists. but what the model organization that weber and his inheritors economics and sociology found the most adapted competition and management modern life has become obsolete? what power dispersing, coming dwell new forms and through new mechanisms host small and previously marginal players, while the power advantage the big, established, and more bureaucratic incumbents decays? the rise micropowers throws open such questions, for the first time. holds out the prospect that power may have become remarkably unmoored from size and scale." moises naim, the end power from boardrooms battlefields and churches states, why being charge isn't what used executive summary loyalty trust. trust

retailers joining the platform exceeding the supply from the customers who redeem the tokens for purchases trade them the open market, which will create ascending path least resistance. market overview preface bitrewards designed for all types retailers, but our sweet spot e-commerce because they readily adopt such services and are easy scale. the e-commerce market has grown consistently every year, and, according statista data, the market will increase more than the over the next five years (from billion billion the rapid growth e-commerce, the automation purchase processes and delivery have made this market extremely competitive. today customers are more price sensitive, expect more from brands, and compare prices regular basis. customer loyalty, measured repeat purchases and referrals, the key driver profitability for online businesses, even more than for offline companies, according series joint studies online retail bain company. user acquisition today one the most costly activities any retailer. statistics say that the average conversion traffic into purchases e-commerce comes however the real figures are and less. and clear why: our attention span today seconds less than that goldfish. businesses spend increasing amount resources wrestling for customers' attention, and this only half the task: they also have retain their attention. studies show that acquiring new customer anywhere from times more expensive than retaining existing one. and customers are also easily switching brands, particularly when the competition click away. retailers must invest their customers' loyalty. lots data shows that loyal customers stay longer, buy more and more often, cost less process, help price competition, tell their friends about their experiences, and provide valuable feedback. loyalty management market loyalty systems retail are designed reward customers for their past purchases other useful actions and provide them with incentives for making future purchases. rewards program enables activation, retention, up-selling and referrals, along with providing strong value offer the customer. typical loyalty management system comprised operational parameters, such transaction types, program design and funding options. further includes value parameters such redemption options, redemption thresholds, and earnings rates. and businesses are actively adopting loyalty programs: small businesses plan using customer loyalty program (belly) executives have dedicated budget for customer experience (leapfrog marketing institute) the market for loyalty programs growing and will reach billion ("loyalty management market" report marketsandmarkets). there's approximately another billion digital gift cards, and least billion referral solutions. top that, more than billion loyalty points are issued globally each year. according deloitte report, enrollment loyalty programs across various industries reached billion memberships and has more than tripled since despite this rapid growth, customer loyalty rewards programs are not realizing their full potential. according the bond loyalty report, north american consumers belong loyalty programs

encouraging loyalty not easy game. lot customer issues can result problems for loyalty rewards providers, including: account inactivity with many loyalty programs, the need take additional action and non-transparent reward schemes are perceived negatively customers and lead adoption decrease and customer inactivity. according cinteractive, consumers not sign for loyalty program due the inconvenience and time required complete registration. low redemption rates according the bond loyalty report, the percentage customers who were active members was only percent. out these members, never redeemed their received bonuses and rewards. also, according this report, loyalty and rewards program members who not make redemptions are times more likely defect from one program and join another. source: the bond loyalty report low client retention existing loyalty programs give insufficient motivation encourage repeat purchases. according colloquy "customer loyalty beyond report", the top two reasons why consumers stop participating loyalty program are: the program did not provide offers that were interest (%), and was too hard earn points for rewards (%). increased costs for customer service retailers who want set their own in-house loyalty program, need not only invest time, money and effort, but also arrange solid customer support service specifically aimed the loyalty program, which incurs training and sometimes hiring employees, the implementation internal practices and procedures, reporting, and analysis. the more sophisticated the loyalty program rules are, the higher the cost customer service. low motivation offered rewards according cardlinx's card-linking industry survey, consumers prefer cash-back payments part rewards, while only prefer programs connected with the accumulation bonuses, points miles. the same time, loyalty programs are still one the most effective solutions generate more revenue among existing customers. according the talech retail technology report, customers say they want loyalty programs. the outlined problems could solved integrated loyalty system, which would provide customers with convenient tools earn rewards and redeem them for valuable purchases. with the emergence blockchain technology, creating such system has become possible. our hypothesis that the new approach rewards and loyalty with the use blockchain

bitrewards operator receives the wallet address, the system transfers the tokens from its stock this wallet. the address unknown, the operator creates new account, transfers the tokens there, and the customer receives notification with the details the created wallet. using the link, the customer installs the web mobile bitrewards wallet, and can transact with it, choose transfer their tokens their other wallet. after the completion the operation, the bitrewards network operator produces bill fiat currency the address the retailer for the amount which the operator spent the transaction. payments for purchases through the bitrewards operator: the event customer makes purchase full, part, using bitrewards tokens, the retailer sends request through api for the sale the bitrewards tokens. response the request, the bitrewards network operator returns the wallet account number and the amount fiat currency, which will paid for the given amount tokens. after receiving the tokens, the operator transfers the fiat money the retailer. using the current infrastructure ethereum, the transaction processing can take minute. after the release the raiden network and lightning network protocols, the transaction will settled matter seconds. maintenance fiat and cryptocurrencies reserves the bitrewards operator the bitrewards operator needs maintain minimum reserve bit, fiat currencies, and eth tokens and will convert the collected during ico cryptocurrencies into fiat its own discretion, required for the performance the bitrewards network project. prevent any sharp fluctuations the bit' tokens rate, liquidity smart contract will created the basis bancor.formula. for the maintenance the necessary level bit reserve, the bitrewards operator buys sells bit the open market, through the liquidity smart contract. for the maintenance the necessary level fiat currencies eth, the bitrewards network operator its own discretion buys sells fiat currencies the open market for bit. option direct transactions bitrewards decentralized system. retailers can make operations with the purchase and sale bit independently, without the bitrewards operator. the retailer creates its crypto-wallet designed for the payment rewards and the receiving tokens for purchases from the customer. the retailer makes all necessary transactions purchases and sales tokens and fiat currency the open market, and/or with the liquidity smart contract provided bitrewards network. liquidity smart contract bitrewards tokens are designed appreciate over the course time. crypto assets markets can volatile, and the market price bit can depend the general market conditions and expectations. since bit' main purpose the means payment, important that the token's rate against crypto fiat currencies does not change rapidly and has liquidity all times. order provide for this liquidity and mollify the market fluctuations, bancor formula product bprotocol foundation) based smart contract will created. will allow for the buying and selling bit and will also used increase the market demand and supply when the token rate fluctuations leave certain corridor. the special liquidity smart contract will hold reserve tokens the bitrewards system and means. anyone will able buy sell bit simply sending eth the contract's address. this solution able provide for the liquidity tokens and solves the problem "double coincidence wants", when buyer and seller have match the time and place for the transaction occur. liquidity smart contract always acts, one the parties either selling buying. the contract also abides efficient market rules: upon the selling the asset, the price goes down, and upon the buying the asset, the price goes up, therefore the liquidity smart contract changes the market price the asset, available the transaction, depending the transaction's amount. therefore, the liquidity for any party interested buying selling bit will provided for all times.

currencies. retailers can store their bit, eth and other cryptocurrencies, which they use for transactions and pay for bit from this wallet. the retailer's cryptowallet will open-source software, which installed the retailer's servers. for convenience, the docker image, which contains all necessary settings, will created. for maximum security, the private key for the retailer's crypto-wallet will reside the retailer's servers. the less secure, but simpler way use bitrewards api that stores the keys. needed, the retailer can open two crypto-wallets cold (for large amounts) and hot (for current transactions). the "cold" wallet should shielded from online connection and managed manually. the "hot" wallet should connected the other software the retailer (cms, accounting software, etc.) through private api. auxiliary parts the system: mobile sdk for the integration the bitrewards crypto-wallet into the merchant's apps. triggered notifications system (email, sms, push, messengers). corporate personnel loyalty system. customers customer's loyalty program dashboard with integrated cryptowallet and access the merchants' websites customers receive notification bit awarded them the merchant's website their preferred notification method they can sign login the loyalty program via facebook and other social networks, email phone, and receive immediate access the cryptowallet which they can see the bit that have been added. the customers can access the wallet via the website any bitrewards network merchant, from the bitrewards website, extensions for chrome, internet explorer and safari mobile app. the bitrewards wallet allows the customers pay with cryptocurrency for purchases from any retailer the bitrewards network. the cryptowallet will give unique ethereum-address the customer. will allow the storing, acceptance and sending bit, eth and any other erc tokens. will entry point the world cryptocurrencies for many people. other cryptocurrency types will added the later stages. the bit amount equivalent exceeds the customer's wallet, they will offered set twofactor authentication (fa) via google authenticator sms. default, the crypto-wallet will store private keys the bitrewards network servers encrypted form. the encryption key will created from the access key the customer, with which they login the bitrewards app (facebook access token password hash). the key will deciphered only the presence the active login session the key owner. for advanced customers who are concerned about the security issue the third-party wallets, there will following options available: transfer bit, eth and any erc tokens any external wallet (including hardware wallets). downloading private key from the bitrewards system. this case, the encrypted private key will deciphered and provided the customer for storage their computer external carrier, and the private key will removed from the bitrewards network base. from this time, the customer will need apply the private key for any action the system connected with movement btw, eth any other tokens. desired, the private key can imported the system again. soon the lightning network and raiden network technologies become available, the bitrewards wallet will integrated with them and become part these networks. this will allow bitrewards crypto-wallet users significantly reduce even cut down zero the commission for money withdrawal, transfers retailers, other participants these networks. the introduction lightning raiden will also allow transactions carried out instantly (time confirmation regular ethereum-transaction about seconds, and the lightning network/raiden network less than second). the bitrewards services will not take additional fee for payments through the lightning network and the raiden network. the cost these additional services will offset the increased rate bit. the bitrewards wallet single access point and the payment service enabling any non-tech savvy user pay cryptocurrency the website any retailer the bitrewards network. the customer can transfer any cryptocurrency fiat currency this wallet and convert into bitrewards, which retailers will accept. are also talking payment services providers, who have shown significant interest using the bitrewards infrastructure for the combination fiat and cryptocurrency payments. mobile applications the mobile apps the ios and android platforms, which replicate the functionality the web apps will also have the following features: crypto-wallet merchants' special offers scanning and storage loyalty cards (making plastic cards redundant, the inconvenience which one the main reasons customers stop using loyalty systems) gift cards geofencing bitrewards network bitrecommendations ai-driven decentralized recommendations system. bitrecommendations the world's first decentralized crowdsourced recommendation system, which designed suit the needs e-commerce and uses the blockchain for quality control and security the data. how works for merchants: merchants send the encoded data about the activities their users the bitrecommendations system, and sends them access cutting-edge recommendation system free charge. bitrecommendations system offers product recommendations ("you may also like") and rewards recommendations with the possible ways showing users the appreciation for their actions via thoughtful reward: cryptocurrency, cup coffee, ticket event. bitrecommendations learns the using data from thousands merchants and processing millions data points per day, which ensures the top quality recommendations all times. all the data received from merchants stored the decentralized file system ipfs. the metadata, including the ratings data quality, stored the ethereum blockchain. this type structure makes the system eternally operable and available the clients. bitrecommendations somehow ceases work, with the support bitrewards dao, new system can always created use that data. merchant tries cheat and sends fake data, will detected, and this information will the ethereum blockchain. merchants can see the previous user activity every user that's why bitrecommendation provides the scoring the user's reputation, which allows the merchants offer loan post-payment for the purchases. bitrecommendations the eyes and brains online stores the recommendation system necessary component the loyalty systems the merchants enables them incentivize higher order value and repeat purchases thus improving the roi. efficient recommendation system must contain huge amounts data. this poses problem for small and medium-sized businesses because they can't acquire the necessary amount traffic and sales collect that data. dmp data not enough data management platforms, which aggregate data from various sources, are designed provide merchants with the profiles their users social graph, interests, disposable income, etc. this information useful but insufficient make high-quality forecasts e-commerce because user habits and consumption patterns are hard figure out yet they contain data, which crucial for decision-making. for instance, it's impossible predict what color the device customers will prefer basing their assumptions the data about their age and attraction certain car brand. bitrecommendations decentralized dmp designed collect, store and process the retail data using deep learning algorithms. the control the quality and security the data provided for the blockchain. every merchant source huge amounts data about their shoppers. this data remains unused. the best-case scenario that the data gets sent google analytics where marketing specialist will through its aggregated copy. bitrewards will give merchants solution, which will easily enable them have all the user data their disposal, including: general data types (viewed items, added order items, order amount); industry-specific data types about the user interests (colors garments, gadget screen sizes, food calories, etc.). this data will collected and stored the merchant their servers. merchants will receive turnkey solution, which can deployed any server: every hours the data encoded and sent into ipfs; the merchant sends the ipfs-address containing the specific data and metadata the bitrecommendations smart-contract (number the unique per period, merchant id); the merchant can send this data the smart-contract any other organization, which bitrewards dao has entrusted the private keys necessary avoid the dependence the centralized bitrecommendations software. soon the data received the smart-contract, bitrecommendations runs several processes: checks the reputation the merchant. the reputation unreliable, the weight the data set "low", simply ignored; downloads the data from ipfs the bitrecommendations servers; starts the lock-up period weeks the beginning the operations) and processes the received data via moderation subsystem. the main purpose moderation determine whether not the data accurate and came from reliable sources. another purpose attach the appropriate weights the data. solve this problem, deep learning and are applied; after the lock-up period, bitrewards credits the merchant with bitrewards tokens for the valuable data and reduces the rating and repayments case fake data; the accurate data used for deep learning algorithms. machine learning: product recommendations the following dataset sources will used for the recommendation system learning: third-party dmps (oracle bluekai, krux, mediamath, etc.); user activity data shared the merchants, described above. bitrecommendations system based the data and machine learning algorithms. provides api any merchant, developer, service provider. the api allows any merchant receive highly precise product recommendations starting from day one the operations, even with low user traffic, because the application algorithms, which make decisions after learning thousands other merchants and millions data points. the payment for the api accepted bit tokens only. machine learning: rewards recommendations bitrecommendations api also empowers every merchant with the knowledge about the reward preferences their users. based the assumptions made the system regarding the preferable reward, e.g. coffee from starbucks, massage, ticket for favorite band, the system suggests the choice which has the potential for the maximum roi. bitrecommendations analyses the rewards that were given the loyalty systems different merchants, aggregates the received data, and makes predictions about the future rewards. machine learning: financial scoring the purchasing activities and habits every user become available all bitrecommendations participants (in encoded, anonymous, and de-personified way). therefore, the financial scoring ultimately becomes available. will used for the following use cases: offering after-payment loan the users who service their liabilities reliable way, which can derived from the historical data and stored the blockchain; offering user-specific financial and insurance products; offering the incentivizing discounts only those customers who are motivated them; avoiding unnecessary discounts for those whose purchasing history suggests that they were buying other stores without the discounts. application the blockchain technology and the crowdsourced nature the platform will allow the merchants achieve new level intelligence and economic efficiency previously unaffordable for the small and medium-sized business. bitrecommendations business model bitrecommendations api will offered the majority the participating merchants free charge. the platform operates the principle reciprocity: merchants get bit tokens for the provided data and pay bit for using the bitrecommendations api. the ratio the price and reward will designed that the store makes equal larger amount bit shares the data about the activities all its users with the system; some merchants prefer not share data about the activities their users, they will have pay bit tokens use bitrecommendations api. the hosting and updates the bitrecommendations system are paid for from the proceeds coming from bit tokens turnover commission, which will introduced one year after the beginning the operations. application blockchain and risk mitigation decentralization bitrecommendations system makes invulnerable from the untrustful members the system and ultimately from bitrewards operations. however, will keep its open protocol available for the new members: any e-commerce business will able connect and benefit from the data collected from the thousands other stores. all the data received from the merchants stored the decentralized file system ipfs. the metadata, including the data quality scoring, recorded the ethereum blockchain. this makes the system genuinely trustless. should the bitrecommendations system fail work, under the procedures dao bitrewards, new team will hired, and new system using the aggregated data will implemented; merchant tries cheat and provides fake data, this will detected, and the score that merchant will downgraded leading the payment less amount bit for their data. potentially, the scoring can down zero when the data that received from this merchant not used the system, and the merchant does not receive remuneration for the provided data. this case, the merchant will have pay order use the bitrecommendations system. merchant score stored the ethereum blockchain. virtue using bit tokens, bitrecommendations can offer this cutting-edge data-driven recommendation service for valuable members the system, completely free charge. bitrewards dao after the token launch, will create the decentralized autonomous organization, bitrewards (dao). the objectives dao: run bitrewards business the most efficient way create favorable conditions for the adoption bitrewards platform the large numbers merchants create favorable conditions for the bit token price appreciation the mandate dao: management the bitrewards foundation. remuneration persons and organizations developing new integration for the bitrewards system and increasing the demand for bit. remuneration persons and organizations that connect new stores the bitrewards system and thereby increase the demand for bit.

ecosystem and strategic decision making sources funds the bitrewards foundation: the total number issued tokens; from the funds raised during the token launch (depending the collected amount) the sources funds for bitrewards foundation may change the future. technically, dao will implemented the wings platform. dao management scheme: member dao individual legal entity that has made transactions with bit. the different types membership (weights) are defined the amount and features operations with bit during certain period time, preceding the estimation the type the membership. the majority the decisions the dao are made voting (simple majority). any member the dao can put forward proposals. the proposals include description the action, amount, purpose and conditions for transferring funds from the dao accounts (if applicable). addition the usual members dao, can have super users. super user rights: conduct everyday operations and management dao within the standard nature its business; instantly transfer any amounts between dao accounts smart liquidity contract bancor technology change the composition the basket currencies dao accounts; put forward high priority proposals (including withdrawal funds from dao accounts), which are automatically executed week after the date the proposal, except for cases when least participants are vetoing the execution the proposal (veto power dao participants). change the operational and other rules the dao according the procedure paragraph. super users are appointed removed voting (with majority). the beginning dao operations, the bitrewards team will act the super user. the event that the bitrewards team runs the business unsatisfactorily loses the trust the dao members for other reasons, this may change, and dao can elect other super users. about the open source bitrewards software: the entire source code all bitrewards products will publicly available under special license. the license will allow the usage and modification the source code only for personal noncommercial purposes (experiments, etc.). usage modification for commercial purposes will prohibited. the license can changed the decision dao. also, dao may grant special rights use and modify the source code any individuals and organizations its own discretion. the objectives this type license are: enable the members dao resume the bitrewards platform operations any time, and also continue its development the bitrewards team fails fulfill its obligations. exclude the creation bitrewards system's clones, competing with bitrewards and working with other cryptocurrencies, which may potentially reduce the demand bit. bitrewards operator the bitrewards operator's goal will service merchants and provide better level service their
