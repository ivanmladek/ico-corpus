bitnew-chain btn tech-white paper next-generation decentralized application platform for commercial applications march overview motivation with the popularity bitcoin, entrepreneurs and developers began recognize that the blockchain technology behind bitcoin has vastly greater potential than simply the basis for new digital currency. within just few years, dozens new decentralized applications (dapps) have been built upon the blockchain technology, including encrypted messaging (bitmessage), decentralized exchanges (bitshares), trustless gambling (peerplays), cloud computing (golem), and social media (steem). one challenge for dapp developers this new blockchain economy the difficulty actually building new blockchain application from scratch. order solve this problem, the idea smart contract platforms was developed and implemented. smart contract platforms, such ethereum, can thought decentralized platforms for developing and running decentralized applications. unfortunately, current smart contract platforms still have various limitations, such limited scalability, limited privacy and high usage fee/gas rates, which seriously hinder their widespread adoption. furthermore, most current smart contract platforms lack built-in resource segregation support, all computing and storage are performed on-chain, which prohibitively expensive for large commercial applications. governance over blockchain itself also chaotic, which makes impossible quickly reach consensus urgent issues updates. here present bitnew-chain (btn), next-generation decentralized application platform for commercial applications that addresses all aforementioned problems. bitnew-chain (btn) aims build nextgeneration decentralized platform with several key improvements. btn designed with higher scalability, more flexible fee/gas model, less storage/computing constraints, and better governance protocols. all core functionalities, such decentralized storage and computing, are integrated into unified platform. therefore, commercial applications such decentralized games and iot systems can built smoothly using the btn platform without dependency any other third parties, which makes btn ideal platform for dapps. figure overview btn sw/hw structure key design objectives next-generation decentralized application platform, btn designed meet the following key objectives, which are critical for commercial applications: decentralized application designed btn highly efficient and customizable for decentralized application. leveraging blockchain and other decentralized techniques, btn resolves the most fundamental and time-consuming parts decentralized application development, allowing developers focus application scenarios and customer needs. based btn's core functionality and standard interface, developers can delivery commercial dapps with only hundreds lines code. decentralized hardware support btn aims build decentralized ecosystem for both software and hardware. providing standard interface and hardware specifications, btn simplifies the development decentralized hardware, allowing any partners produce btn- compatible hardware. scalability scalability always bottleneck for commercial applications. currently bitcoin can only process nearly transactions per second (tps). however, commercial applications such uber, airbnb and facebook need handle tens millions daily active users. support such real-world scenarios, btn built support millions transactions per second with low latency. resource segregation on-chain storage and computation are expensive for current smart contract platforms such ethereum, every full node needs store blockchain data and perform computations. pursue balance between security and efficiency, btn divides both data and computation into two categories, namely on-chain and off-chain. storage: critical data should recorded the blockchain, which will downloaded and identified all full clients. non-critical data, such text and images, not need the same level consensus monetary financial transactions. thus, non-critical data can stored off-chain and referenced hash-based content address. btn provides built-in support for such decentralized storage, which allows users control the balance between redundancy and reliability. computation: computationally heavy tasks are prohibitively expensive run on-chain due cost constraints. similar storage system design, btn allows users delegate non-critical expensive computation off-chain with the help built-in verifiable computation support. other features flexible transaction fee model popular web services, such google and facebook, are free for end users. however, most current smart contact platforms require users pay for the services. btn will provide more fee strategies for developers, who can offer free services for end users gain more widespread adoption and usage. advanced governance protocol blockchain based techniques are evolving rapidly. however, the currently chaotic state governance for decentralized systems will limit the development new technologies. the well-known segwitx upgrade for bitcoin failed due lack governance protocol. fact, many bitcoin improvement proposals (bip) will never realized due the same reasons. btn designed with clearly defined voting and update mechanisms for feature enhancement and bug fixes. privacy enhancement bitcoin stores pseudonymous transactions public decentralized ledger, with clear relationships between the addresses senders and receivers. appears totally secure, the originator the transaction difficult track because there real-world identity attached the address. however, much information can still deduced through public data, such web trackers and cookies. once the connection between the pseudonym and real-world individual made, the secret revealed. btn designed provide higher level privacy, building truly anonymous decentralized platform. cross-chain communication addition having powerful main blockchain, btn also designed facilitate cross-chain communication for further extension. parameter btc btn confirmation time with comparable security under satoshi

assuming scalable millions average size tx) transactions per second. cent fee for transaction adduming tps resource segregate blocks) yes figure btn cross-chain communication advantage btn architecture twotier network full nodes are servers running network that allow peers use them receive updates about the events the network. full nodes are very important the health the network they provide clients with the ability synchronize and quickly propagate messages throughout the network. provide better service for the btn ecosystem, btn adopts two-tier network design. addition the main network (analogous ethereum), btn adds secondary network, known the btn masternode network. with economic incentives, btn masternodes will have high availability and provide required level service the btn network. figure btn architecture two-tier network masternode network the masternode network consists masternodes, which are full nodes except that they must satisfy the following requirements serve qualified masternode: have bond deposit satisfy btn hardware specification provide the decentralized storage service: btn-fs provide the decentralized computing service: btn-dc provide the privacy improved transaction service figure btn masternode manufacturing specification summary, the node must store btn and provide required services clients the network run masternode. when active, masternodes are paid the form dividend return. masternode reward program full nodes require significant amounts traffic and other resources that carry substantial costs. result, steady decrease the amount these nodes has been observed the bitcoin network. encourage more users participate the masternode network, btn provides masternode reward program which pays approximately the total block reward all masternodes. the reward paid each masternode proportional its deposit. each masternode can deposit most the total btn circulation, which prevents the centralization masternode network. thus, the masternode reward program allows the masternodes pay for the expense and earn return investment. privacy improved transaction privacy improved transactions employ similar strategy the dash private send. privacy improved transactions utilizes the fact that transaction can formed multiple parties and made out multiple parties merge funds together way where they cannot uncoupled thereafter. main network the btn main network blockchain based network like ethereum, which acts the backbone the whole system. consensus mechanism: delegated proof stake (dpos) btn utilizes delegated proof stake (dpos) the decentralized consensus algorithm, which has shown promising performance. dpos, token holders elect block producers, who are responsible and rewarded for generating blocks. the elected producer will given opportunity produce blocks proportional the total votes they have received. the voting process continuous, therefore, producers have incentive carry out their function the highest standard they risk losing their votes. btn delegates mining nodes. exactly one producer authorized produce block any given point time. the start each round unique block producers are chosen. the top total approval are automatically chosen every round and the last producer chosen proportional their number votes relative other producers. the selected producers are shuffled using pseudo-random number derived from the block time. hybrid mining based dpos consensus mechanism and masternode reward program, btn adopts hybrid mining mechanism, namely delegated proof stake (dpos) prove masternode (pom). dpos ensure the efficiency the main network while pom encourage more masternodes participate. economic model unlike ethereum, btn utilizes ownership model like eos. holding btn tokens gives users proportional share network resources, such bandwidth, storage, and processing power. this means that someone owns btn tokens, they will always have access the network bandwidth, regardless the load the rest the network. furthermore, since the network will have zero transaction fees, there network development cost, except for the initial purchase btn tokens. however, btn tokens can course always sold order reclaim the initial investment desired. decentralized storage subsystem: btn-fs btn has ipfs-like subsystem (btn-fs) for decentralized storage. btn-fs indexes the data through file content hash rather than path/url. the main improvement btn-fs over ipfs the manipulation the file reliability. btn-fs allows the user set the reliability requirements the file based the desired balance between redundancy and reliability. based the economic incentives masternode reward program, stable and reliable decentralized storage services will provided the masternode network. decentralized computing subsystem: btn-dc similar btn-fs, btn has truebit like subsystem (btn-dc) for decentralized computing. btn-dc has both solvers and verifiers, which are randomly selected from the masternode network. solvers are compensated for performing computation and verifiers are compensated for detecting errors solutions submitted solvers. the event challenged solution, the computation performed on-chain decide whether penalize the solvers the verifiers and security deposit will charged from the misbehaving masternodes. btn-dc also allows the user choose the reliability requirements the computing. turing-complete virtual machine: bvm btn utilizes virtual machine independent architecture for smart contract system. thus, multiple virtual machines can supported and new virtual machines features can added over time necessary. currently, btn has two stage plan for btn virtual machine (bvm) development: the ethereum virtual machine (evm) the facto standard for smart contract. thus, the first version bvm planned op-code level compatible with evm, allowing existing evm contracts run bvm with little modification. for further versions, btn planned emulate evm dynamically retargeting evm opcodes subset bytecode, which can bring btn code execution performance close native code and support more programming languages. cross-chain technology the long term, believe the cross-chain communication protocol will converge one protocol there was for and http. btn will switch that standard thanks its easy update feature. currently, btn designed support cross-chain communication with two approaches: cross-chain transaction validation cross-chain transaction validation achieved light client validation approach. block headers compatible blockchains can saved btn-fs with high reliability, making easy generate proof message existence and proof message sequence. cross-chain token exchange cross-chain token exchange will implemented using the atomic swap mechanism. the compatible blockchains can thus easily exchange tokens with btn. governance btn token holders are the network owners and managers, managing the network through delegating their rights block producers. the delegated block producers are given checked authority propose hard forking changes the underlying protocol other administrative operations. with the continuous voting btn holders, the block producers refuse make changes desired the token holders then they can voted out, which guarantee the influence token holders. btn eco-system btn aims build next generation dapp platform for commercial applications. therefore, btn has proposed technical blueprint with commercial applications instilled throughout the design. addition these advanced techniques, the success btn also relies widely commercial adoption and sustainable ecosystem. will pursue this goal concurrently striving two directions: open cooperation and business application. open cooperation blockchain rapidly evolving field, with new ideas and techniques emerging daily basis. order build one the best dapp platforms, btn will seek cooperation with the blockchain community, including: cooperation with blockchain projects other leading blockchain techniques are still under active development, which needs the collaboration the entire community. thus, btn treats other blockchain projects collaborators instead just competitors. btn will cooperate with other technique-driven projects, such qtum, accelerate the arrival the dapp era. cooperation with leading company large companies have billions users and well-built infrastructure. btn will actively look for cooperation with such large companies achieve synergies and mutually beneficial relationships. build alliance for btn compatible hardware speed the construction btn decentralized hardware ecosystem, btn aims build alliance for producing btn compatible hardware. for example, setting the minimum hardware specifications masternodes, the performance the btn network can guaranteed. addition producing qualified hardware with partners itself, btn also welcomes other manufacturers produce the qualified hardware contribute the btn ecosystem. business scenario btn intended ultimately become the support the next generation decentralized businesses. with numerous potential applications, btn will focus fields that may early adopters dapp solutions and help our partners build commercial applications. internet things btn supports light nodes delegate the computation/storage heavy tasks the btn masternode network, which reduces the computational requirements for devices connected it. relying the btn network, iot devices can work without any centralized servers. gaming gaming one the largest industries for the internet. blockchain increases trust and security the gaming industry. blockchain's decentralized system ensures that particular individual entity has centralized advantage any stage the gaming process, which greatly improve the financial transparency. btn will provide ideal platform for decentralized gaming development. cloud resource sharing blockchain technology can also used create verifiable resource sharing platform, allowing users share unused resources. this allows for the creation cloud computing market distributed cdn, where any user can participate with their desktop, laptop specialized server. finance blockchain has drawn lot attention financial services industry significantly reduces intermediaries and improves the efficiency. applications, such cross-border payment, supply chain financing and insurance are all highly attractive fields disrupted blockchain. artificial intelligence blockchain has the potential transform artificial intelligence (ai). there are many opportunities for blockchain+ai applications. projects like the decentralizded autonomous organization (dao) will accelerate the development self-upgrading, and may able accumulate wealth the future. btn will provide platform for those blockchain+ai experiments. btn roadmap btn tech-white paper release. btn will gain support from first batch application developers.
