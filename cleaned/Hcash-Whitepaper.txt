cryptocurrency distributed ledger which links block-based and blockless blockchain systems the utxo-based blockchain system (e.g. bitcoin []) and account-based blockchain system (e.g. ethereum []) has opened the door brand-new world for us. although the impressive success bitcoin and ethereum has certainly proven the value blockchain technology and its massive potential the future, also see some inherent problems blockchain technology along the way. since there has been quite few highly-promising distributed ledger systems that are not block-based gradually coming into our view, such dag (directed acyclic graph) []. with doubt, decentralized digital world dawning, and bitcoin ethereum has the potential become the base currency block-based distributed ledger. iota byteball [], the other hand, may fulfil similar role system based dag technology. nevertheless, despite the ability traded unrestrictedly some centralized exchange platforms, these tokens, due the fundamental differences the underlying systems, can only circulate within their own blockchains, and would not able move freely from blockchain-based blockless system vice versa. our intention create new decentralized and distributed ledger system that will bridge the gap between blockchain-based blockless systems, thereby allowing value and information circulated freely between different blockchains. addition, just bitcoin serves the tools exchange for goods services blockchain-based system, also need type asset the newly invented system that can reflect the value goods services objectively. the new store value, call "hypercash" (hereinafter referred "hcash") whitepaper v... ii. introduction our vision, hcash will create new platform that can connected different blockchains (such bitcoin blockchain and ethereum blockchain), thereby allowing value and information circulate freely among systems, and redefining the value blockchain. below schematic diagram the hcash platform. hive: composed blockchain and dag systems hcash platform designed the sidechain for both blockchain-based and blockless systems, can achieve free flow value and information between the two. here, hcash the medium for cross-platform value exchange, while the platform itself carrier for cross-platform information interflow. based these design features, hcash has taken into account the reading information from blockchain-based (including utxo and account based) and dag based distributed ledger the initial stage system design. address system order implement another important feature that will discussed later, hcash designed purposely have both public and private addresses compatible with zcash (t-addr and z-addr) whitepaper v... and byteball address systems (whiteball and blackball). therefore, the near future, expected that people can directly send and receive zec (or similar) gbyte (or similar) from blockchain dag system and vice versa the hcash platform. meanwhile, would also possible achieve fully-encrypted communication based zero knowledge proof technology between hcash nodes and clients, well range other exciting new features. about directed acyclic graph directed acyclic graph (dag) finite directed graph with directed cycles. that is, consists finitely many vertices and edges, with each edge directed from one vertex another, such that there way start any vertex and follow consistently-directed sequence edges that eventually loops back again. since the path from starting vertex ending vertex directed graph might not form cycle, dag not necessarily tree, but any directed tree dag compared directed tree, dag special but more general directed graph. below simple illustration directed tree, dag and directed graph. the big data industry, dag usually used for big data framework, such the execution engine hadoop, storm and spark. whitepaper v... the following graph shows the operating architecture spark: there dependent relationship between each rdd object, which forms dag. the dag scheduler will split the graph into multiple "stages". the rules for partition are simple: scanning through from back front, whenever the dag scheduler encounters narrow dependence, will added into current stage, whereas wide dependence needs shuffled. after completing the division stages, dag scheduler will generate taskst based each stage and submit the taskset taskscheduler. the taskscheduler responsible for the scheduling specific task and execution tasks worker nodes. recently, with the development blockchain technology, there are some emerging blockchain systems that used dag the underlying data structure, such iota []. iota's core data structure, called 'tangle', dag that designed resolve existing issues the "internet things" (iot) industry, such massive data storage and distributed computing, well providing good solution for the micropayment the iot industry. whitepaper v... traditional blockchains (such bitcoin and ethereum) are using the binary tree data structure such the merkle tree: hcash attempts establish channel between the systems that are based two completely different data structures, that can compatible with current mainstream blockchain technical standards the bottom level while allowing new blockchain technologies able communicate with current blockchain systems. although the challenge undoubtedly great, hcash's technology development team consists renowned cryptographers from world's famous academic institution well experts from blockchain, big data and cloud computing industry. therefore, are confident that with the support from all these experts, the team will overcome the obstacles and meet the original design goals the system. hybrid: pow pos achieving consensus across digital currency communities has always been difficult problem solve. all know, the struggle upgrade bitcoin via protocols has been affecting the development the community over the past two three years, while the over-centralized governance system adopted zcash similar has certainly deterred active participation across the whitepaper v... community. currently, none the decision-making process used this crypto-economics can preserve the system's ability adapt the face technical challenges and accommodate the ideological differences among community stakeholders without compromising the integrity blockchain's decentralized value proposition learning from predecessors and incorporating partially the philosophy decred and dash, hcash, for the first time, introduces the concept instant-open-governance, which allows all coin holders participate major decisions the community through pos mining mechanism, including protocol updates and upgrades. most importantly, the mechanism adopted hcash more advanced than the traditional voting method the sense that provides smoother execution. once the vote passed, all decisions will recorded the blockchain and enforced, thus avoiding the problem consensus among miners, mining pools, exchanges and wallet service providers. the introduction pow mechanism prevent pre-ico investors from occupying excessively large portion rewards pos distribution mechanism. also, pow the security mechanism that has been proved the most effective way protect blockchain-based system. although will inevitably consume large amount energy, believe the tradeoff still worthy consideration the security benefits brings system. moreover, possible combine pow with pos mining process enhance the overall security the system. first, the mining process would begin traditional pow manner where miners would compete solve cryptographic problem. according this implementation, the blocks being mined not contain any transactions (they are more like templates instead), the new blocks that are added the blockchain will only include header and the winning miner's reward address. this moment, the system will switch pos. based the information contained this header, set random validators selected sign the new block. here, the chance validator selected would depend the number coins she holds. the more coins validator has, the higher the probability him/her being selected. once these selected validators have completed the signature the block, the template will become complete block. some the validators are not available for signing the block, they will selected sign the next block and new set validators will selected until the current block gets the correct number signatures. the transaction fee will distributed among the miner and the validators who participated the signature the block. for pow [], qualified block can expressed as: whitepaper v... f(nonce) element with order where let the generator (p), then mod the system parameters (p, and the verification function (that is, the public key the trusted third-party are distributed verify the signature the message. whitepaper v... give each user unique identity user (with identity ia) would select secret key and calculates mod would then send and reliably and obtains certificate from let (ia, (ia, v)), where st(.) the signature generated the protocol follows: select the random number where calculate mod which preprocessing step that can done before appears; sends (ca, solves (ia, with the public key and verifies the identity and public key and send random number between and where security parameter; verifies calculates mod and sends verifies mod the equation holds, then can recognized that the identity legitimate. the security based the parameter where chosen large enough that the probability guessing correctly small enough. the suggested value for and the suggested lengths for (that is, |p|) and (that is, |q|) are bits and bits respectively. this protocol zero-knowledge proof that does not reveal any useful information about the verification process. whitepaper v... hcash will draw from the technique zero knowledge proof from zcash. will not only used achieve bi-directional encryption the process asset transfer, but also deployed many other areas that have high demands transactional privacy. hcash has incorporated real-time communication function into the client, which can not only support cross-platform token transfer via black address but also achieve high privacy day-to-day peer-to-peer communication through the technique zero knowledge proof, well realizing cross-platform encrypted communication such from hcash client byteball client and vice versa. hard: quantum resistance currently within the blockchain systems represented bitcoin, sha- hash calculations and ecdsa elliptic curve cryptography serve the most basic security protection along the bitcoin network. however, with the advancement quantum computer technology, especially within shaw's algorithm typical representative the quantum algorithm), related operations can achieved from the index level the polynomial level theory. problems that are difficult for classical computer the foreseeable future can certainly solved practical quantum computers. post-quantum cryptography, also known quantum-resistant cryptography, able resist the attacks quantum computers. the development such encryption technology takes more traditional path, based difficult problems specific mathematics fields. through researching and developing algorithms, the post-quantum secure encryption technology can applied the network, and provide the highest level data security. the application post-quantum cryptography does not rely any quantum theory phenomenon, but its computational security can defend against any form quantum attack that currently known. ibm researchers proposed encryption scheme called learning with errors (lwe)[][], which means learn with error. takes long time find the nearest lattice, can resist attacks from the quantum computer. ring-lwe-based public key encryption scheme: related parameter selection and operation rules. the main parameters the program are whitepaper v... the maximum number polynomials the encryption scheme. the guarantee efficiency and security standard, should large modulus, which positive integer. the value related the specific case. the value should large enough ensure that the security high, but the greater the value the more system resources will consumed and the computation will increased well. small modulus, usually small positive integer. let q[x] ,the two polynomial and the ring are expressed follows f(x) f(x) +... fn-(xn-),g (x) g(x) ... gn- (xn-),k define the following operations: f(x) kf(x)+ ...kfn-(xn-) private key generation this scheme, the encryption public key (x), the decryption private key (x) and (x). the selection method follows: f(x) *g(x) mod f(x) *fq(x) mod h(x) fq(x) the public key (h(x),g(x)),and the private key (f(x),fp(x)). encryption process the scheme, the random error polynomial introduced when encrypting, e(x) psa, psa gaussian distribution with the parameter and the plaintext converted the polynomial m(x). the ciphertext is: c(x) h(x)*m(x) g(x) *e(x) decryption process the received ciphertext (x), and the steps for decrypting the ciphertext using the private key (x) and (x) are follows: a(x) f(x) *c(x) f(x) *h(x) *m(x) f(x) *g(x)*e(x) =[f(x)*fq(x)+f(x) ]*m(x)+f(x)*g(x)*e(x) mod q() (x) (x) whitepaper v... (x) (x) (x) (x) (x) mod (x) the decryption process steps and (), there may decryption failure. when the coefficient step not the interval step coefficient not the interval p), there will decryption failure. but long the selection the appropriate parameters, the possibility decryption failure still very small. also can use the algorithm similar ntru avoid decryption failure. hcash will develop ring-lwe key exchange protocol that works with openssl achieve post-quantum secure blockchain. handy: limited blockchain with unlimited transaction the dag technology itself not based blocks. therefore, not subject the constraints block validation time (for example, the validation time for bitcoin and ethereum minutes and seconds, respectively). due the need take into consideration the interaction between hcash and dag-based blockchain system, the system has incorporated some the advantages and strengths dag its design. thus, the validation time for transactions the hcash system almost instantaneous. also, dag not based blocks, there so-called block size limit dag. theory, the amount transactions that can accommodated per unit time fairly large (htps, hyper transaction per second). the same time, hcash needs account for interaction with block-based blockchain systems. consequently, possible for hcash realize mass number transactions per unit time under limited block volume, thereby truly fulfilling the function "hypercash". haven: limited token supply the total supply hcash fixed. about millions tokens will created, and will distributed through the following six channels: million (%) will created via pow; million (%) will created via pos; million (%) will issued for ico and given the community for free; million (%) will issued for pre-ico sales. whitepaper v... million (%) will reserved for the development team hcash fund, million (%) will reserved for hcash-dao. hcash has both white and black addresses, which corresponds the transparent address zcash and whitebyte byteball, and the z-add zcash and blackbyte byteball, respectively. hcash users can convert their white addresses black addresses vice versa their own wallets, provided that the total number hcash remains unchanged. the default definition the system, the million tokens generated pos mechanism will all the dark address, and this part the coins are called hiddencoins. similarly, the million tokens generated pow mechanism will also the dark address hiddencoin default when new blocks are found. except for the hcash above, all the remaining coins will the white address, including the part for ico and free distribution, early investors, and the coins held development team and hcash foundation and hcash-dao. the coins either white address black address can sent upon request during conversion between different systems transmission between different users. whitepaper v... iii. development roadmap hcash focusing building new technical standards and redefining value, the technical challenges faced the team are unprecedented. the expected development roadmap for hcash shown below and only for reference: hcash and hshare since takes time implement hcash code and develop various features listed above, after the end the ico, all the investors will get hshare first sort placeholder, which developed based existing mature utxo model. after the hcash main chain launched, the holders hshare can redeem any hshare they have any online exchanges with hcash official team for hcash rate hshare hcash. after about months, all redemption and replacement will completed. then, the hcash team will use technical means destroy all hshare permanently. hshare's open source code can found under hcash's github page everyone can read and review the source code and check the total number hshare issued consistent with the number hcash stipulated the white paper. whitepaper v... iv. project risk and risk management regulatory risk present, although some governments, such japan, hold positive attitude towards blockchain technology and cryptocurrency and have established favorable policy support the growth the industry, there are still many uncertainties the regulatory level due conflicts between the decentralized nature public blockchain and the policies existing centralized governments. governments adverse the proliferation the use cryptocurrencies local commerce could issue laws and regulations deeming the use cryptocurrencies regulated activity. for example, recent weeks, countries such china and korea have issued regulations statements prohibiting token sales, while other countries like the u.s. have sought bring the sale tokens within the regulator control securities offerings. this could result holders hcash being unable use their coins the future without further regulatory compliance. the management team will use the following ways manage the regulatory risk: the team will set separate public relation department that will actively communicate with relevant government authorities and industry practitioners, design and carry out its digital asset issuance, trading, blockchain finance, blockchain applications and other business under existing legal framework. the operation hcash project neither involves transactions using fiat money nor interferes with the exchange between hcash and fiat money carried out third party exchanges. hcash team focused only technology. market risk the ultimate goal hcash achieve the free flow value and information within the blockchain ecosystem. however, since the blockchain industry still its infancy stage development, the project will face variety market tests the future. the operation team will use the following ways manage the market risk: the hcash operation team will attend industry meetings regularly and hold press release project progress from time time communicate and discuss with relevant developers whitepaper v... regarding current market needs and prospects. this can ensure that the project able respond voices the community and market. technical risk the goal hcash stablish new set cross-platform technical standards, which very difficult task terms technology development. therefore, the project puts high demand top-notch technical talents and requires extensive research involvement and engagement. these requirements cannot satisfied, will definitely affect the progress the project and even eventually lead the failure the whole project. the operation team will use the following ways manage the technical risk: the operations team will work closely with top domestic and foreign universities and research institutions build joint laboratories that focus the development innovative blockchain technology. the hcash foundation will also regularly allocate funds support the construction hcash community and carry out in-depth collaboration with other blockchain and crypto communities, ensure that the technical risks the project are controllable. financial risk financial risk refers the significant loss investment raised through ico and pre-ico sale. for example, hackers other malicious groups organizations may attempt interfere with hcash distribution hcash tokens variety ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial service attacks, consensus-based attacks, sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing, addition, the team may not able complete the development progress within the schedule because personnel and financial problems and on. the operation team will use the following ways manage the financial risk: all the digital currency raised through ico pre-ico sale are stored multi-signature wallet with cold storage and managed the directors hcash foundation. using multisignature, the risk project funds being subject expropriation and/or theft can effectively reduced. whitepaper v... disclaimer this whitepaper has been prepared hcash team for the sole purpose introducing the technical aspects the hcash and its associated platform and
