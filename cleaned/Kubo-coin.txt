kubo black paper kubo coin introduction ever since satoshi nakamoto unveiled the first feasible blockchain-based payments system the world one eschewing trust and reliance centralized entities, the world has not been the same. perhaps more significant than bitcoin itself the underlying technology which supports it. until nakamoto's intervention, the byzantine general's problem, the key challenge that described the difficulty getting network participants trust each other without relying central authority, had remained painful obstacle developing trustless networks where power was distributed evenly. block chain technology's capacity enable systems that serve not only the function money, but reputation, prediction markets, effective machine-tomachine communication, and much more, has birthed entire new industry which set revolutionize modern economies, workplaces and even social relationships. china, leading investor the technology, considering applying the technology towards citizen data. malta, commonly called the 'block chain island' for its welcoming attitude towards the technology, seeing innovators flock it. us, considered some lagging, accelerating the creation regulatory framework and steadily encouraging institutional investment. despite the potential the technology becoming ever clearer with every passing day, the opposition stiff most vocally from established financial institutions who have denounced tool for criminals and the black market, passing fad that likely end disaster for the many investors who have put their money into it. however, things are turning around for the cryptocurrency market. the once ridiculed and criticized technology has now been adopted the naysayers, and the prospects the technology lifting impoverished social classes higher status and saving the global economy trillions dollars has become the goal several projects and teams almost every continent. the kubo project has been undertaken with the intention bringing block chain's inherent benefits the retail market and micro-payment arena, serving bridge between the vendors who are looking emerging technologies www.kubocoin.org boost their growth client base and sales and the yet inaccessible method integrating block chain into existing business services. the team highly aware that small and medium enterprises, apart from the billions poor unable access global financial markets, are those that stand gain the most from decentralized technologies. this black paper, cover the issues that existing payment systems suffer from, and how decentralized mechanisms can improve upon almost every which way. also detail the kubo platforms, its services, and how plans create convenient and effective ecosystem for retailers and vendors alike. the cryptocurrency market the cusp revolutionary growth taken the year when cryptocurrencies chiefly bitcoin became household name, then ought known the year the bear market and institutional investment. one might think that the market has been suffering from painful period, though reality the future remains brighter than ever. what has changed? upon closer inspection, not much. there some truth the idea that the market resembles the dot-com bubble insofar that has been primarily word mouth and hysteria that the market has grown highs bitcoin. but not the price bitcoin that matters, and not the price that will determine the survival the market. no, what has changed that the technology has convinced the wider market and established financial institutions that can indeed greatly upgrade legacy systems and usher new age for the economy global stage. this, along with the rapid improvements such technical features such scalability and security, has bolstered confidence the market and consequently drawn names like goldman sachs and jpmorgan. has seen over billion's dollars institutional investment flood into the market through the otc markets and the rise high-quality crypto projects the digital asset ecosystem that comprises the crypto market. this development supports the long-held belief that the cryptocurrency will mainstream before and revolutionize the way the daily end user pays for goods and services. www.kubocoin.org the influx institutional funds only one factor the argument that the market turning point. perhaps even more sound the rapid research and development put into the technology existing corporate giants, like microsoft, ibm, amazon, alibaba and countless others. the point here clear: these companies not want lose any ground the market, and the thought that fading companies, like walmart (which has struggled against amazon, can regain some market share integrating block chain's strengths into their respective businesses.) square recently announced their plans adopt and support the use the lighting network their highly used mobile fiat payment platform cash app. block chain then has become matter survival more than embellishment, necessary mutation required the survival the fittest that the modern capitalist economy. the only question that remains one regulation, but even that seems growing more lenient, indicated the approval institutional funds and removal national crypto bans nations such india. setting aside the moodiness investors the market and the unimportant feature that token value versus the usd dollar, the road forward beginning make itself clear: block chain technology that slowly being integrated into numerous industry verticals. has been accepted legitimate financial instrument and appears divesting itself reputation easy money and loose applications. the limitations payment processing systems and the opportunities cryptocurrency current global transaction systems have done well serve our needs. few short decades, have gone from relying predominantly paper-based records that would take many weeks perform international transactions (if all) completely electronic transactions that take few weeks maximum. however, still not perfect, and does bring with several problems that are endemic system that depends centralized authorities. the fees associated with making these transactions are high and the transactions themselves are delayed more often than one would like. www.kubocoin.org worst all, however, the abundance fraud and general lack security. fraudulent debit and credit card transactions increasing and could hit whopping billion not only does this remove major pain point customers, but also saves financial institutions enormous sums legal and restitution costs. true that cryptocurrency transactions cannot currently match the rate visa, but not far-fetched think that will soon able so. scalability solutions, like that the plasma network and bitcoin's lightning network, are already well underway terms development and have been tested perform expected. block chain technology and decentralized currencies, digital assets, has the chance push economies, especially developing economies into new era unprecedented prosperity and fluid interactions pp, pb, and bb. the opportunity exist alongside, not entirely replace, traditional financial systems one that results benefits for all parties and ripe for the taking market that about explode into the mainstream. history kubo kubo began call action ceo fernando sibilio when saw the mistreatment the failed wave project kubos. the kubos community was disarray due the original project leader and dev team abandoning the project and dumping large quantities pre-mined tokens the open markets the process. this caused for tanking the project's valuation and loss community trust for the foreseeable future. months leading into the community takeover that would result the creation kubo coin, the kubo team surveyed and gathered feedback from various crypto projects and community members craft the best methods implement various use cases and build transparent and fundamentally sound project. thus oct.,, the kubo coin project was started make difference and set standard with various use cases and promise keep the original community from kubos and all new investors/supporters that the project will recruit the forefront all developments and adoptions within the digital asset ecosystem. www.kubocoin.org kubo core values integrity our actions tell the world what kubo and what stand for. act ethically and responsibly everything and hold ourselves accountable for our actions. bring respect and honesty our investors and our business partners and always strive support the security and well-being the entire kubo community. treat all those encounter with kindness and compassion and constantly strive better understand and respond the needs our diverse community. transparency the kubo team has been and will continue completely open and honest with our community. the team's wallet information and the purpose for the funds that they hold publicly shared with the community. our team always happy answer questions about the plans and progression the kubo project well inquiries about the team that working hard make kubo one the most prominent and prestigious successes that cryptocurrency investors have seen thus far. excellence when comes kubo, only the best will do. team, are working create and engage meaningful alliances enhance access services and technology that will assist the development new pathways help pave the way for global adoption digital currencies. the kubo team works cohesively with each other bring experience, knowledge, and advancing technology the forefront provide our community with the highest quality project and product possible. devote ourselves continuous improvement, excellence, professionalism and innovation our work. kubo wants fill the gaps kubo coin's primary focus will building ecosystem for retailers and vendors, with the goal giving them seamless, instantaneous and inexpensive payment alternative fiat transactions. secondary focus being native currency for two exchanges owned and operated the kubo www.kubocoin.org team allow for quicker paths liquidity and increase the number potential clients for the vendor ecosystem the exchanges develop and attract traders. and lastly tertiary focus being native currency peer peer escrow platform due kubo coin's takeover the epic coin project and epic trader platform will allow the unrestricted transfer funds and payments over secure private channel similar fiat based escrow but over the block chain epic coin. begin with, the ecosystem will developed for the asian and african markets, with the and european markets soon follow. asia stands lucrative market for cryptocurrency-based transactions, the region has abundance individuals who lack the basic documentation possess bank account and, result, cannot participate global financial trade and markets. the region's economies consist lot small and medium businesses operating cash transactions and, certain extent, e-wallets which invariably leads large amount funds being locked these wallets and detracting from liquidity. cryptocurrency payments avoid this problem while still providing secure and easy means transfer funds from clients and revenue for the business owners. this also applies many developing nations the african continent where the adult population lack have highly limited access bank account. and those that have the luxury banking institution pay high fees and lack proper insurance secure their fiat deposits and withdraws. kubo stands empower and grant means payment, transfer, trading, and ease access robust vendor ecosystem that covers the globe. kubo's solutions several use cases have been envisioned for the kubo project. the following only the beginning kubocoin's grand vision create new method interaction the retail market and the digital asset ecosystem whole: payments processing system powered the ethereum platform kubo's payments system will powered the ethereum network. the latter, popular choice for those wishing launch their own icos and have their tokens listed, will allow effortless transfer crypto funds, and permit exchange for other cryptos and even fiat currency thanks third party service providers such www.kubocoin.org metamask and ether delta. kubocoin, the product, viewed the team alternative traditional payments systems. the comparatively lower fees for sending tokens across the ethereum block chain essentially function discount for vendors and merchants, who stand profit more due the cut merchant fees paid credit card companies such visa mastercard. this allows for vendors and merchants give cheaper retail prices items and services that otherwise would more expensive cover fees and costs while also trying gain net profit. vendor ecosystem all cryptocurrencies thrive its ecosystem. without its users and stakeholders, the token effectively dead. think the many hundreds tokens that have become nonexistent since the market began the early kubo will focus developing strong ecosystem retailers and vendors who can support each other what will basically digital marketplace where the two entities can form relationships with each other and discover new business opportunities. maximize the reach and effect this ecosystem, the kubocoin project partnered with the block chain solution company aeryus that will providing kubo the software and hardware ramp merchants across all physical locations and online commerce while providing easy set and run point sale system similar square. kubo will also boast the added bonus digital mobile wallets that substituted not only typical debit cards but payment pathway for kubo investors through the aeryus one app and kubo's mobile exchange app (tcx hub mobile). merchants can set and run business and enjoy the low fees (.% compare -%) associated with using kubo their primary payment option the aeryus chain payment platform while also still being able operate with fiat. this freedom gives kubo and its partner aeryus advantage over similar projects the crypto space alongside the bonus that kubo can provide exchange and escrow services any vendor and its clients without leaving the kubo ecosystem. thus, creating "turn key" package for kubo offer and convince vendors stay and grow within the kubo vendor ecosystem. www.kubocoin.org debit cards and atm network integration one challenge the industry the active use cryptocurrency which remains the reach only the tech-savvy and early adopters various crypto projects the space. this demographic roughly constitutes million potential users that are spread across the crypto projects the space. thus, crypto debit cards provide the pre-existing investors new format use their digital assets the same fashion they use fiat-based bank cards and debit cards. this also allows for retail investors that will enter into the cryptocurrency markets and its developing platforms with little background experience and knowledge have familiar payment method with crypto debt cards that would also double secure and safe digital asset wallet. that end, kubo also making atm integration priority tandem with crypto debit cards for crypto transaction experience that matches the current set with debit cards and traditional atms globally. coupled with mobile app both the ios and android operating systems, this can make the use crypto day day life realistic possibility thanks the growing crypto adoption and options made available investors and consumers. the kubo team will move integrate with industry leader general bytes fulfill the atm need compliment the crypto debit cards kubo seeks provide. currently, general bytes has over atm machines globally, fiat pairs, crypto projects, and have handled over transactions since its inception. these key features would provide the kubo project all the atm needs and proven system hardware handle the current and potential consumer demand and out the crypto ecosystem. kubo the exchange token listings for the new exchange tcx hub and elo exchange will available purchased either btc kubo and both exchanges will low listing fee exchanges. this set new trend against the current high listing prices top exchanges that create high barrier entry and cripple the growth many projects the market. kubo tokens used pay for listings instead btc, will burned from circulation and serve burning protocol for kubo requested the community. this will introduce new deflationary policy and over time will help decreasing the overall supply kubo without forcing www.kubocoin.org mandatory burn event causing panic the side the community investors. continual development kubo's various use cases occurs and increasing demand for the token existing and new investors pours in, the ideal result increase overall market price and market cap valuation gradually over the life the project. currently, the available markets for trading tcx hub are btc, eth, ltc, kubo, and true usd fiat market that restricted residents that have passed the kyc verification process. similar markets will made available for elo when goes live with focus the asian markets. the future, doge market will implemented increase the listing options for all projects that pay get listed the exchange. this will increase the number potential investors that will see kubo over time but also allow for numerous partnership opportunities for the kubo team and project the crypto space with various projects and block chain companies. with every new community and partnership, the reputation both exchanges and kubo will increase and thus open more opportunities for kubo used designed. all the while, the total transactions the kubo network will stand another indicator for future investors see growing and strong ecosystem various platforms. listing fees for exchanges: kubo payment option kubo per market (btc/eth/kubo/ltc/doge) kubo for true fiat (usd)*** kubo per wallet update*** kubo per fork/algo swap*** btc payment option btc per market per market (btc/eth/kubo/ltc/doge) *** only kubo can used acquire any fiat pairing currently listed will listed the future tcx hub and elo exchange. also, all updates and forks for projects listed will need pay for changes kubo tokens. these tokens will www.kubocoin.org also burn the same fashion listings fees are burn when paid for kubo. epic trader platform conventional exchanges like coinbase, bittrex, gemini, etc., require you put your trust centralized exchange, who hold your funds and private keys. they were become victim hack, and unless they have way cover those losses, you would lose your digital assets and essentially lose your money. they have ridiculous fees for their services and often take ridiculous amount time fund your account. with the volatility cryptocurrency, missing opportunity purchase crypto asset minutes, hours, days can possibly cause you miss out potential profits. however, dealing the peer peer level isn't like that. peer peer trading directly with another human being, meaning you cut out the middleman and secure the best deal possible directly with the person you are transacting with. our main goal epic establish international peer peer network, where users interact directly with other users and utilize epic safeguard. currently the platform supports payment method options available: paypal paytm alipay wechat pay western union bank transfers. when user creates for selling his her cryptocurrency, they will able select many payment options they would like receive payment. when buyers select ad, the seller's payment information will displayed allowing the buyer send the fiat funds directly the seller. this enables faster payment times the fiat payments not have through our platform first. after payment sent, the buyer will notify the sellers selecting have sent payment" button within the trade transaction. the seller will get email text notification saying payment has been sent for that particular ad. once the seller confirms payment has been received, will release the cryptocurrency the buyer selecting the have received payment" button within the trade transaction. for any reason the seller refuses release the cryptocurrency, claims not have received payment, the buyer has the power supply payment proof our support team. must include timestamp, payment amount, and must match the account information provided the seller. since the cryptocurrency locked for the duration the trade, the support team www.kubocoin.org epic can verify the buyers support ticket and manually release the cryptocurrency the buyer. how does kubo stand against competitors? block chain the underlying mechanism which validate payments not new idea; after all, bitcoin itself the progenitor all such projects. however, kubo differs from other projects that has concentrated focus the retail market something that has been reported grow with compounded annual growth rate until the use cases retail ecosystem, two native exchanges, atm integration, debit cards, point sale system, mobile payment system and escrow platform gives kubo edge over other projects that are simply working towards creating payment mechanism for consumers and vendors only. important note that all the use cases for kubo become not only valid payment option but project and brand that can bring stakeholders together and create systems that make the process approachable for all and competitive against the current competition emerging market. kubo, set push the use crypto potentially billion people the planet, opposed the many projects that not seem taking the path push mass adoption and make crypto use reality day day life. kubo token metrics the kubo token economy functions finite supply kubocoin (kubo), with larger maximum supply planned facilitate token possession among wider group stakeholders. this also offers some protection against price manipulation and
