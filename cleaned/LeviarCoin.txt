consumers spent billion mobile games driven blockbuster hits like pokemon and clash royale. the mobile games market has started mature and now more closely resembles traditional games publishing, requiring ever higher production values and marketing spend. leviarcoin leviarcoin.org source: superdata the first year for virtual reality was sobering, especially for manufacturers dedicated hardware. high price point, the absence strong content line-up, and difficulties with properly delivering through retail cooled consumers' expectations the oculus. expect firms with more experience

and implements the ring signature technology which allows you sign message behalf group. unlinkable transactions using variation the diffie-hellman exchange protocol, receiver has multiple unique one-time addresses derived from his single public key. after funds are sent these addresses they can only redeemed the receiver; and would impossible crosslink these payments. double-spending proof nobody able spend the same money twice even all his signatures are anonymous. every signature contains key image. these key images are used prevent double-spending. blockchain analysis resistance leviarcoin leviarcoin.org non-repeating one-time addresses and mixed keys ring signatures make the whole blockchain resistant analysis. egalitarian proof work the proof work mechanism acts voting system. cryptonote brings this equality with its egalitarian proof work, utilizing built-in cpu instructions, which are very hard and too expensive implement special purpose devices, but perfectly suitable for ordinary pcs. adaptive limits decentralized payment system must not depend single person's decisions, even this person developer. leviarcoin leviarcoin.org leviarcoin features integration api leviarcoin daemon and drmob system communication achieved sending and receiving encrypted commands the default port. anti-fraud/cheat system and drmob anti-tamper technology and digital rights management over blockchain (drmob) scheme. well protect software integrity, designed prevent players online games from gaining unfair advantage using third-party tools. blockchain immutable, changing the history requires too much effort compared benefits high availability, virtually infinite scaling blockchain cheaper use than known drm servers everyone holds copy blockchain and one "owns" leviarcoin leviarcoin.org problem the losses suffered because software piracy directly affect the profitability the software and mobile gaming industry. because the money lost, publishers and developers have fewer resources research and development new products; having less revenue justify lowering software prices, they are forced pass these costs their customers. consequently, software publishers, developers, and vendors are taking serious actions protect their revenues. using pirated software there increase the chances that the software will not function correctly will fail completely. also worth noting that the use pirated software also drives the costs for legitimate users which gives legitimate users even more reason help fight piracy reporting siia those organizations and individuals who are not "playing the rules." leviarcoin leviarcoin.org solution the solution want give users, publishers and developers blockchain drm management software. accomplish the task, based cryptonote technology, developing brand new features that help audience protect its software and make revenues trading xlc. integration api integration api set new commands bundled into the leviarcoin daemon. its main purpose create encrypted connection the drmob layer and directly serve required data the user. this example better understand the purpose and how easily developers could use these commands: ./leviarcoind --iapi command *yourapikey* args initial available commands will be: getnewkey: the only command that works without providing valid key, the system will generate new key associated your address. leviarcoin leviarcoin.org returns json object: "success": true, "code": storetransaction: accepts base encoded string (max bytes) that will encrypted with your key and stored blockchain returns json object: "success": true, "code": "id": "fdcbaccbfdaaeebfc" readtransaction: accepts "id" order retrieve previously stored transaction. returns json object: "success": true, "code": "data": "previously_stored_data" anti-fraud/cheat system and drmob layer every software and gaming company dreams make their products and data secure possible using activation servers, drm servers, anti-cheating software, etc. but these protections too much times get hacked bypassed, for almost all softwares and games, fact, you leviarcoin leviarcoin.org can find illegal keys and/or cracked executables (like exes, apks, ipas). our final goal, creating this tool, make available software and mobile apps developers, library prevent these frauds. leviarcoin leviarcoin.org issuance coins xlc coins are generated with every new block, the initial amount xlc and will grow the limit million. the generation gap every block seconds, estimated coins generation the first days:
