offers opportunity numerous people realize new world and new ecosystem asset trading. however, two questions must answered first. are there any ecosystems services present moment that enable full utilization virtual currency? so, are such services abundantly available? currently, core issue for participants cryptocurrencies that there lack practical uses ecosystems that fully utilize virtual currency. numerous blockchain projects now only focus decentralizing technology, speed, and on, rather than constructing ecosystem that actually creates significant values. this ultimately reveals the current limits that blockchainbased virtual currencies (cryptocurrencies) face. tmtg project aims use blockchain technology construct satisfactory ecosystem that provides actual values now and the future. also aim focus constructing ecosystem designed exchange virtual currencies with fiat currencies and tangible goods, rather than only focusing decentralizing technology. will continue our research ways eliminate many uncertainties possible overcoming diverse technical limits allow participants enjoy the benefits this ecosystem safely and easily. will now proceed with explanation ecosystem being built tmtg, well the visions, policies, and team members behind this project realize our goal. introduction: our vision the emergence blockchain technology with decentralized distributed ledger has led the introduction virtual currencies with various purposes, along with platforms called 'virtual currency exchanges', where such virtual currencies are purchased and traded. many are looking forward world built upon blockchain-based virtual currencies, and they are investing real money purchase these virtual currencies through virtual currency exchanges. although there doubt that blockchain will open new world, there still lack virtual currency that can offer real and tangible value. exchange volume bitcoin each fiat currency other krw (korea) eur (eu) gbp (united kingdom) [f.] the exchange volume bitcoin each fiat currency source: coinhills essence, virtual currencies must able provide useful values their participants. tmtg project aims for hyperconnected society and construct ecosystem that achieves effective values real things through decentralized block chain. the first step, tmtg project will establish ecosystem which virtual currencies can directly traded with actual goods. this the vision the tmtg project. introduction: tmtg project background recently, around kinds virtual currency have been developed and launched, but only very small number developers have managed develop their currency's use with proper plans. each virtual currency has its own purposes, but the use actually unclear. have contemplated how virtual currency could bring value the everyday lives many people. result and solution our deliberation, focused gold, precious metal used everyday lives, with its value recognized worldwide monetary and property asset. this was the beginning the tmtg project. our aim establish digital trade ecosystem that allows real tangible assets, such gold, easily traded with virtual currency digital environment. this ecosystem will constructed with blockchain network. prospect the survival cryptocurrencies the future coins launched worldwide: approx. types coins chance coin survival: only about types coins will remain the market [f.] prospect cryptocurrencies the future presented experts introduction: tmtg project the core tmtg project composed three main elements. tmtg tokens mdg tokens digital gold exchange tmtg token the virtual currency tmtg stands for "the midas touch gold" and its concept based the character midas from greek mythology. tmtg coins will serve the medium for maintaining and activating the dge (digital gold exchange) ecosystem, which constructed part tmtg project. this token not pegged any tangible asset including gold, but only works means purchase other cryptocurrencies the dge platform. tmtg tokens are utility tokens, not linked any asset price, and are used only means purchasing virtual currency the dge platform. mdg token mdg token only tradable the dge platform, with mdg pegged gold. mdg token representative real gold, the price the token determined the price gold the time purchase. mdg tokens can purchased the dge platform with tmtg tokens. dge: digital gold exchange dge stands for "digital gold exchange" and online exchange where tmtg tokens can used purchase mdg tokens (digital gold), which can reimbursed actual gold. dge can accessed anywhere with online network conduct trades convert digital gold real gold. dge plays pivotal role the ecosystem built part tmtg project. will designed enable tmtg tokens and other safe virtual currencies exchanged with real goods well. achieve this, will need technical expertise, and must establish fairness, transparency, and stability our core values. platform structure tmtg not security tmtg mdg tmtg utility token used for currency circulation the dge dex platform. mdg pegged actual gold, storing the value gold token. the dge platform will start with gold, and eventually expand handle other precious metals such diamonds, white gold, and platinum. any user with proper kyc verification can buy mdg using tmtg the amount specified rules and regulations. platform structure dge platform with club membership service tmtg token deposit million membership level dge has entered exclusive partnership with korea gold exchange offline gold supplier officially back the digital gold. dge platform will open other suppliers gold well. for suppliers join the dge platform and obtain membership, they must deposit certain amount tmtg tokens the dge vault (i.e. tmtg). membership levels shall based the deposit, and the services and benefits will varying accordingly. membership level deposit service fee digital asset this figure subject change. platform structure dge platform for exchange increase flexibility and heighten responsiveness, dge implements (crypto-crypto) exchange. the exchange built the dex platform for better security and transparency. while conventional exchanges (fiat-crypto) are generally built with the traditional model, the dge platform based dex construct its own exchange. new frontier exchange dge takes step ahead the cryptocurrency competition establishing the first (product-crypto) exchange. while there are several factors and calculations that must considered these exchanges, the complex math will handled dge behind the curtains, and the users only need access the service obtain their goods. starting with gold, the dge exchange will continue expand. platform structure about the digital gold exchange platform the dge platform allows users store and transfer their assets securely. mutual trust and reliability the trade without intermediary made possible through its simultaneity. the platform designed allow transfer assets stored within the service external and blockchain, allowing transfer between users and mediums. this expansion functionality made possible through the digital gold exchange which dispersive platform for data exchange and

platform structure transactions official market price gold and token conversions and transactions can made very quickly. conversion rates are based official market prices gold exchanges all over the world well the virtual currency exchanges, not statistical market prices. trades are completed immediately with accurate values for both parties. authentication required once order make trades real goods (gold). conversions trade with other value entities tmtg can also transferred and traded for mobile gift vouchers and gift cards affiliated with the token. smart contract the dge platform
