masternode, coin stake [total (st year) masternode, coin stake [total (nd year) masternode, coin stake [total (thereafter) minimum stake age hours transaction confirmation blocks difficulty retarget minutes masternode requirement saga masternode reward stake reward sagacoin's low transaction fee one the reasons why should adopted. sagacoin's minimum transaction fee saga per bytes transaction data. less than bytes per coin transaction, usually only saga required for the transaction fee. fast block time sagacoin has block time seconds. that's faster than bitcoin. this makes the confirmation transactions faster, thereby giving room for more capacity transactions. big block size sagacoin has maximum block size, that's bitcoin's block size. this block size enables sagacoin have twice many transactions compared bitcoin single block. with faster block time and bigger block size, sagacoin has more transactions compared bitcoin. this makes possible avoid high transaction fee. the masternode feature sagacoin helps handle the spreading transactional data. masternode essential element cryptocurrency they handle the spreading transactional data. what makes coin decentralized. this helps sagacoin use one server distribute new data. masternode specific type decentralized server that used perform certain tasks coin's blockchain, such adding privacy function. cryptocurrency full node computer wallet that keeps the full copy the blockchain real-time, just like bitcoin full nodes and always and running. masternodes are not standalone but they are always communicating with other such nodes make decentralized network. the masternode feature also makes sagacoin resistant sybil attacks which where imposters disguise themselves several servers that they can manipulate the blockchain they want. sagacoin performs every single transaction using darksend. this keeps payments private and cannot tracked anyone. privacy guarantees are designed benefit legitimate users who not want disclose their financial details the public. sagacoin utilizes advanced scrypt hashing protect blockchain network. scrypt algorithm was specifically designed make costly perform large-scale custom hardware attacks requiring large amounts memory. sagacoin features payment sent received worldwide easily. its low transaction fees and block time make much cheaper and faster compared ordinary remittance money transfer service. sagacoin transaction can executed approximately minutes seconds. proof-of-stake type algorithm which cryptocurrency blockchain network aims achieve distributed consensus. proof-of-stake, person can mine validate block transactions according how many coins she holds. thus, anyone can become miner. this makes more decentralized comparison proof work. staking not only provides extra coins holder but also secure the network move forward even there single miner for pow. quarter launch launch sagacoin dec block explorer dec block explorer dec block explorer

the main purpose atomic swap allow for the exchange one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency without the need for trusted third party. traditional cryptocurrencies trusted third party such cryptocurrency exchange, necessary perform swap cryptocurrencies order prevent one party from sending currency without receiving currency return. atomic swap system uses hash time-locked smart contract that party must deliver the currency swapped within specified time, else the transaction will cancelled. this preserves atomicity that either the swap will take place, currency will swapped. now, there timeline for implementation atomic swap for sagacoin since still very new concept. however, are working researching and finding the best implementation methods. are very excited have this great feature future. once implemented, you will able swap saga btc vice versa. sagacoin aims one the popular cryptocurrencies that widely use payment transactions. order reach this goal, have implement payment gateway that consumer can pay goods services using saga. our plan implement self -hosted payment gateway for saga used early adoption saga payment, and later will apply listed those popular cryptocurrency payment gateways that available plugins for e-commerce platforms such wordpress, zen cart, magento, and others. make simple, will design such way that can used people that are not tech-savvy, and easy integration into online store. sagacoin has very special masternode reward, the reward calculated based pos (proof-of-stake) instead pow (proof-ofwork). each pos block generates different amount sagacoin based the coins staked. there only one masternode winner for each pos block, the winner designated hash calculation similar pow. therefore, masternode could earn rewards three continuous pos blocks, and masternode could also earn nothing thousand pos blocks. sagacoin has pos block reward the first year, allocated masternode and for coin staker. the pos calculation based formula:- nsubsidy ncoinage coin_year_reward for example: total coins staked block saga, therefore saga rewarded masternode winner and coin staker get saga. the reason behind halving avoid the scarcity the cryptocurrencies the miners and investors are abundant rate and are growing like skyscraper. but the height increases, there high chance complete demolishment with little quake. was introduced into cryptocurrency mining improve the stability the system and give out plentiful opportunity for everyone. sagacoin's rewards halving (pow and pos) first time the second year, and second time the third year. coding following: static const int year_blocks static const int year_blocks (total seconds per day seconds sagacoin block time seconds) total days per year days blocks per year. there are estimated total pow blocks per day blocks per month pow blocks per year. and estimated pos blocks per day blocks per month. here the table total estimated blocks generated monthly and halving time:month est. pow blocks est. pos blocks total blocks accumulated dec jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep (st halving) oct nov dec jan feb mar apr may jun (nd halving) since sagacoin calculates reward halving pow blocks only, the actual halving date should earlier than one year which stated our specification. according our table above, the estimated first halving should happen september instead december and the estimated second halving will jun full pow block reward saga, first halving saga and second halving saga. pos block reward also reduces from masternode coin stake) masternode coin stake) first halving, and masternode coin stake) second halving. important notes: actual total pow blocks pos blocks blocks from apr apt (from block block ,), which less than estimated (pow) (pos) blocks. this because pow difficulty and coins maturity pos. sagacoin pow and pos coin. initial pow block reward saga, and pos reward. more details can found under the halving section. sagacoin has estimated total pow blocks per month. hence estimated total saga per month with pow difficulty but have actual average saga monthly only over the past months due high pow difficulty, will use saga the estimated pow mined coins per month. thus, estimated pow halving amount calculated based saga (first halving second halving ,). very difficult estimate pos coins generated because pos difficulty and total saga locked masternodes (coins locked masternodes not stake). according our actual past months statistics, have saga the first month and average incremental saga per month. estimated pos halving amount calculated based incremental saga (first halving second halving sagacoin has total premined from maximum coin supply, which saga reserved for developer fund, coin development such marketing, exchange listing fee and etc. and most importantly ensure staking well for masternode reward the early stage. so, highlighted the table below the estimated and actual coins
