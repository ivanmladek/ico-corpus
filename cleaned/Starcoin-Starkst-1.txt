(fyi, bitcoin also features smart contracts despite more limitations compared ethereum.) blockchain payment gateway system technology erc tokens erc tokens are those used the ethereum blockchain platform. for reference, coins arising from ethereum are separately called 'tokens'. ethereum uses ether monetary unit. tokens are created through smart contracts. smart contracts are not only used for the creation tokens, but also for the transactions involving tokens. also, they even allow look through transactions people possessing tokens. means can track the whereabouts money. own tokens, you need send ether smart contract. that prerequisite for receiving tok ens. the other hand, you can create your own tokens building smart contract you want. people create tokens with similar purposes mind, problems may occur when they need exchanged just like when exchange currencies during the travel. solve such problems, was invented serve standard. erc guideline follow when someone intends create his own tokens. may here are many tokens complying with erc. examples include eos, filecoin, ban cor, qash, bankex, and on. thus, can expect higher possibility commercialization whe adopt erc standard. blockchain payment gateway system technology applying blockchain the platform that allows users make online payments for online and offline transactions. mediates transactions that exchange tangible/intangible goods for any means payment with corresponding value. the most important function mediation validate the transfer value. means that safe and accurate transfer the value agreed concerned parties should guaranteed irreversibly. the exiting system, this kind guarantee made through delegation authority order [nation-public agency-financial institution/assurance agency-mediator] and through their act guarantee. therefore, this type contract guaranteed nation and its' people, who mandated their sovereignty their nation, top mediator. the existing system functioned well under the boundary nation and its laws. however, the century, the existing system started expose its vulnerability. first, centralized assurance system driven financial institution started lose its stability. also, the development internet strongly activated international transactions the private sector. when subprime mortgage crisis took place financial institutions, which were the pillar system supporting the currency that nations directly guarantees, lost its stability. many people had growing doubts about the currency-based system and the status currency itself. the nick time, bitcoin was developed alternative respond such doubts. blockchain payment gateway system technology blockchain basically ledger, disclosed transparently under distributed network. cryptocurrencies are the currencies whose transactions are recorded the ledger. because each node that composes the network maintains all transaction records, nobody can cheat each other. that is, provides secured transaction record system all users without centralized assurance system. are apply such characteristics pg. means all transactions will transparently disclosed, well accurate and safe without centralized agency's assurance. for this goal, are making into blockchain. first step, record all transactions starkst blockchain. depending the type star transactions, starkst with the corresponding value will transferred. the for star transactions will linked with starkst blockchain, can record all transactions accurately, safely and firmly. next, will make itself into blockchain. details are the following section about star. star our original plan was use starkst payment method for pg. however, there were not only barriers laws and policies, but also critical problems with its usability. just like other cryptocurrencies, the value starkst determined the market force the exchange. means that the value changeable according market conditions. when the value rises, all users will receive benefits, but when falls, starkst owners may not able make transactions they want. proposed star with fixed value order solve such issues. the value star corresponds centralized currencies one one. starkst owners can transfer into star any time and fix the value that has. also, chose star payment method for pg. result, our customer, who wants make transactions through our pg, can fix the value their payment method the time they choose to. going back the origin, can customers believe star? independently issue and operate star. means, "centralized." mentioned above, made star into blockchain order resolve such problems. blockchain payment gateway system technology first, star transactions will recorded starkst block chain. then, star will transformed into coin the blockchain. for that, create new blockchain. that exclusive block chain generate and operate star. star transactions, that is, transactions, are all realized through this block chain transmission. result, can prove our customers that the value star accurately and safely transferred. flowchart starkst and star star wallet purchase kst store kst exchange performance etc. goods transform buy and sell kst charge gift

transaction across the border can't help but subject intervention and surveillance the countries well the arbitration international financial agencies and the separate agreement financial institutes each country. international treaty provides the basis for because the function definite guarantee international trade. with the development the internet, the amount private transactions beyond the border has grown immensely. however, mentioned earlier, previous payment tools had overcome tremendously high walls countries useful. for government organizations and companies, may relatively easier climb over these walls with the help policies favorable them. for individuals, however, such policies come across even greater obstacles. because these policies are made countries with the intention promote exports and protect the domestic market. would like propose based blockchain. resolves the guaranty issue international transactions easily overcome the walls countries. also, the cost for mediation fee which used reserved for multitudes intermediary agencies can saved minimum connecting suppliers with consumers the form psuedo-pp. blockchain payment gateway system business model
