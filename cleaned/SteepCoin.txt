itself means steepcoin runs without having central server. the storage server decentralized and distributed-divided into various servers run each user connected the network. blockchain technology the steepcoin project based own blockchain, steepcoin network generates own steep coins. the steepcoin core based bitcoin, peercoin, novacoin, dash darkcoin), blackcoin protocols. profitable pos reward system this unique system pos rewards, where the distribution rewards not percentage but fixed amount like pow mining. www.steepcoin.net steepcoin transaction are anonymous all the transactions have done can seen, but not know who the owner the steepcoin address the owner does not tell it. each steepcoin user can actually choose whether not his name will appear, but even the user wants keep his identity secret, all his transactions are still recorded and can monitored through blockchain. the steepcoin not controlled institutions governments the steepcoin uses the blockchain database not controlled party, but open the public that impossible for someone fake transactions blockchain. all transactions are recorded live, transparent, and spread across multiple servers. those who want change falsify the steepcoin transaction data must hack multiple servers the same. lowest transfer fee the transfer fee steepcoin blockchain very low and steep for the transfer. www.steepcoin.net smart-conract smart contract computer protocol intended facilitate, verify, enforce the negotiation performance contract. proponents smart contracts claim that many kinds contractual clauses may made partially fully selfexecuting, self-enforcing, both. the aim with smart contracts provide security that superior traditional contract law and reduce other transaction costs associated with contracting. differences bitcoin and the steepcoin the world cryptocurrancies, bitcoin and the steepcoin are not much different, the difference opportunity and price. have one bitcoin you have prepare more than the steepcoin has bigger opportunity because the price still very cheap and you have chance for the price ico which not you get the bitcoin before. www.steepcoin.net specification ticker

steep steep steep peer-to-peer purely peer-to-peer version electronic cash would allow online payments sent directly from one party another without going through financial institution. digital signatures provide part the solution, but the main benefits are lost trusted third party still required prevent double-spending.we propose solution the double-spending problem using peer-to-peer network. the network timestamps transactions hashing them into ongoing chain hash-based proof-of-work, forming record that cannot changed without redoing the proof-of-work. the longest chain not only serves proof the sequence events witnessed, but proof that came from the largest pool cpu and gpu power. long majority cpu and gpu power controlled nodes that are not cooperating attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. www.steepcoin.net the network itself requires minimal structure. messages are broadcast best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain proof what happened while they were gone. www.steepcoin.net algorithm widely used hashing algorithm created dash core developer evan duffield. x's chained hashing algorithm utilizes sequence eleven scientific hashing algorithms for the proof-ofwork. this that the processing distribution fair and coins will distributed much the same way bitcoin's were originally. was intended make asics much more difficult create, thus giving the currency plenty time develop before mining centralization became threat. this approach was largely successful; early asics for now exist and comprise significant portion the network hashrate, but have not resulted the level centralization present bitcoin. www.steepcoin.net the name the chained proof-of-work (pow) algorithm that was introduced dash (launched january "xcoin"). was partially inspired the chained-hashing approach quark, adding further "depth" and complexity increasing the number hashes, yet differs from quark that the rounds hashes are determined priori instead having some hashes being randomly picked.the algorithm uses multiple rounds different hashes (blake, bmw, groestl, jh, keccak, skein, luffa, cubehash, shavite, simd, echo), thus making one the safest and more sophisticated cryptographic hashes use modern cryptocurrencies.the name not related the open source gui server that provides graphical interface unix/ linux users. www.steepcoin.net hybrid proof-of-work helped give birth nakamoto's major breakthrough, however the nature proof-of-work means that the crypto-currency dependent energy consumption, thus introducing significant cost overhead the operation such networks, which borne the users via combination inflation and transaction fees. the mint rate slows bitcoin network, eventually could put pressure raising transaction fees sustain preferred level security. one naturally asks whether must maintain energy consumption order have decentralized crypto-currency? thus important milestone both theoretically and technologically, demonstrate that the security peer-to-peer crypto-currencies does not have depend energy consumption.all coins and confirmations are verified through proof work mining. they you layer the proof stake chain. where blocks are generated from the coins you store your wallet. www.steepcoin.net simply storing them for hours then keeping your wallet open and unlocked you receive fixed rewards these coins the block reward while the coins used are staked and unavailable until the block matures. these chains work well together they can confirm transactions across the two and speed the network whole. this also adds another layer security. one cannot attack just the proof work chain you need attack control both chains simultaneously. which means you are still required have the network hashrate well minimum stake power requires one invest substantial amount the currency they are trying devalue. the steepcoin pos method work based blackcoin pos protocol with fixed pos rewards per block. with the pos protocol possible attack vectors are reduced minimum and the incentive support the network having full node running continuously clearly increased. this will allow steepcoin and pos continue scale for mass adoption while plugging and mitigating potential risks. www.steepcoin.net masternodes full nodes are servers running network, that allow peers use them receive updates about the events the network. these nodes require significant amounts traffic and other resources that carry substantial cost. result, the bitcoin network steady decrease the amount these nodes has been observed for some time and result block propagation have been upwards seconds. many solutions have been proposed such new reward scheme microsoft research and the bitnodes incentive program. these nodes are very important the health the network. they provide clients with the ability synchronize and quick propagation messages throughout the network. will propose adding secondary network, known the steepcoin masternode network. www.steepcoin.net these nodes will have high availability and provide required level service the network order take part the masternode reward program. www.steepcoin.net anonymous features darksend believe important have standard trust-less implementation for improving the privacy it's users the reference client that provides high degree privacy. other clients such electrum, android and iphone will also have the same anonymity layer implemented directly and utilize the protocol extensions. this allows users common experience anonymizing funds using well understood system. darksend improved and extended version the coinjoin. addition the core concept coinjoin, employ series improvements such decentralization, strong anonymity using chaining approach, denominations and passive ahead-of-time mixing. www.steepcoin.net the greatest challenge when improving privacy and fungibility crypto-currency doing way that does not obscure the entire blockchain. bitcoin based crypto currencies, one can tell which outputs are unspent and which are not, commonly called utxo, which stands for unspent transaction output. this results public ledger that allows any user act guarantor the integrity transactions. the bitcoin protocol designed function without the participation trusted counterparties, their absence, critical that auditing capabilities remain readily accessible the users through the public blockchain. our goal improve privacy and fungibility without losing these key elements that believe make successful currency.by having decentralized mixing service within the currency gain the ability keep the currency itself perfectly fungible. fungibility attribute money, that dictates that all units currency should remain equal. www.steepcoin.net when you receive money within currency, should not come with any history from the previous users the currency the users should have easy way disassociate themselves from that history, thus keeping all coins equal. the same time, any user should able act auditor guarantee the financial integrity the public ledger without compromising others privacy. improve the fungibility and keep the integrity the public blockchain, propose using ahead-of-time decentralized trustless mixing strategy. effective keeping the currency fungible, this service directly built into the currency, easy use and safe for the average user. www.steepcoin.net stealth payments and stealth address stealth payments anonymity technique that protects the privacy the recipient. the concept was invented peter todd based earlier work bytecoin, and with feedback from other developers. it's powerful tool for allowing one accept steep coins using public steepcoin address while preventing passive observers from knowing your transaction history. stealth address type steepcoin address and related scriptpubkey/transaction generation scheme that allowers payees publish single, fixed, address that payors can send funds efficiently, privately, reliably and non-interactively. payors not learn what other payments have been made the stealth address, and thirdparties learn nothing all. (both subject adjustable anonymity set).sx provides commands for working with stealth transactions, and for understanding the mechanics behind them. www.steepcoin.net stealth address consists scan key and optional spend keys. single spend key useful for wallets that don't wish decrypt constantly check for received payments which can compromise security. the scan key allows wallets check for received payments but not redeem the secret key and recreate the stealth address. receiver generates address and private secret and then sends this address someone who wants payment from. sender uses the address and "nonce" generate the address he/she can send funds to. sender communicates the nonce the receiver and using this nonce and the secret key generated earlier he/she can unlock the address with the funds. www.steepcoin.net tor bundle apart from users performing anonymous steepcoin transactions, the steepcoin network itself will use tor increase its defenses.we will integrate tor onion services the steepcoin core network daemon. tor installed the system, steepcoin will automatically create onion service and act steepcoin node over tor avoid leaking the real address the node. this provides greater network resilience and protection against targeted attacks steepcoin nodes. that moment bitcoin, zcash and other cryptocurrencies have followed the same path. www.steepcoin.net smart-contract the concept decentralized digital currency, well alternative applications like property registries, has been around for decades. the anonymous e-cash protocols the and the were mostly reliant cryptographic primitive known chaumian blinding. chaumian blinding provided these new currencies with high degrees privacy, but their underlying protocols largely failed gain traction because their reliance centralized intermediary. wei dai's b-money became the first proposal introduce the idea creating money through solving computational puzzles well decentralized consensus, but the proposal was scant details how decentralized consensus could actually implemented. www.steepcoin.net hal finney introduced concept reusable proofs work, system which uses ideas from b-money together with adam back's computationally difficult hashcash puzzles create concept for cryptocurrency, but once again fell short the ideal relying trusted computing backend. decentralized currency was for the first time implemented practice satoshi nakamoto,combining established primitives for managing ownership through public key cryptography with consensus algorithm for keeping track who owns coins, known "proof work." the mechanism behind proof work was breakthrough because simultaneously solved two problems. first, provided simple and moderately effective consensus algorithm, allowing nodes the network collectively agree set updates the state the bitcoin ledger. www.steepcoin.net second, provided mechanism for allowing free entry into the consensus process, solving the political problem deciding who gets influence the consensus, while simultaneously preventing sybil attacks. does this substituting formal barrier participation, such the requirement registered unique entity particular list, with economic barrier the weight single node the consensus voting process directly proportional the computing power that the node brings. since then, alternative approach has been proposed called proof stake, calculating the weight node being proportional its currency holdings and not its computational resources.the discussion concerning the relative merits the two approaches beyond the scope this paper but should noted that both approaches can used serve the backbone cryptocurrency. www.steepcoin.net satoshi nakamoto's development bitcoin has often been hailed radical development money and currency, being the first example digital asset which simultaneously has backing intrinsic value and centralized issuer controller. however, another, arguably more important, part the bitcoin experiment the underlying blockchain technology tool distributed consensus, and attention rapidly starting shift this other aspect bitcoin.commonly cited alternative applications blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets represent custom currencies and financial instruments (colored coins),the ownership underlying physical device (smart property), non-fungible assets such domain names (namecoin), well more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled piece code implementing arbitrary rules known smart contracts even blockchainbased decentralized autonomous organizations. www.steepcoin.net what steepcoin intends provide blockchain that can used create "contracts" that can used encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users create any the systems described above, well many others that have not yet imagined, simply writing the logic few lines code. www.steepcoin.net payment protocol will add the steepcoin core payment protocol (originally based bip this payment protocol describes protocol for communication between merchant and their customer, enabling both better customer experience and better security against man-in-themiddle attacks the payment process. the current, minimal bitcoin payment protocol operates follows: the current, minimal steepcoin payment protocol operates follows: customer adds items online shopping basket, and decides pay using steepcoin. merchant generates unique payment address, associates with the customer's order, and asks the customer pay. customer copies the steepcoin address from the merchant's web page and pastes into whatever wallet they are using follows steepcoin: link and their wallet launched with the amount paid. www.steepcoin.net customer authorizes payment the merchant's address and broadcasts the transaction through the steepcoin network. merchant's server detects payment and after sufficient transaction confirmations considers the transaction final. this bip extends the above protocol support several new features: human-readable, secure payment destinations-- customers will asked authorize payment "example.com" instead inscrutable, -character steepcoin address. secure proof payment, which the customer can use case dispute with the merchant. resistance from man-in-the-middle attacks that replace merchant's steepcoin address with attacker's address before transaction authorized with hardware wallet. payment received messages, the customer knows immediately that the merchant has received, and has processed (or processing) their payment. www.steepcoin.net refund addresses, automatically given the merchant the customer's wallet software, merchants not have contact customers before refunding overpayments orders that cannot fulfilled for some reason. www.steepcoin.net the steepcoin integration online game our team foresees the further prospects the steepcoin project integration online sports game steep produced ubisoft corporation. the ubisoft team produced the extreme sports simulator "steep" december that earned "the best sports game year'' game critics award version. the integration steepcoin blockchain ubisoft will make possible use the steep coins gamer reward for completing both the single missions and multiplay online tournaments well let the gamers earn playing. www.steepcoin.net www.steepcoin.net steep hills pos rewards this unique system pos rewards, where the distribution rewards occurs not percentage but fixed amount pow mining. the wave characteristic changes pos rewards varies from steep and allows maintain high volume trading and the same time profitable for our investors, both for short and for long period. the steep hills pos rewards schedule designed such way that the highest awards coincide with such holidays christmas, new year, chinese new year. the main changes the pos rewards are for the first three years mining/staking period (the total estimated mining/staking period years). for starting getting pos rewards steepcoin, you need only sent your steepcoin address some steep and keep your wallet online, after hours your coins start staking and you start getting pos rewards. the more steep coins you have your steepcoin address and the longer they are stored it, the more pos rewards and profit you will receive. www.steepcoin.net www.steepcoin.net .the steepcoin charity foundation nowadays the charity foundation the only place good will and generosity but not place ambition race. the steepcoin charity foundation that unites people with charity, helping the ones who need the most best steepcoin blockchain. our charity foundation will created for children regions local war throughout the world.according steepcoin ico sheme, will buy least all

blockchain, having the own protocol operation with the method operation (hybrid) which the most protected from different attacks. the steepcoin network allows carry out the fast protected transactions with the minimum commissions. own protocol operation allows implement subsequent steepcoin core any innovative technologies the field cryptocurrencies, provide the greatest possible anonymity and security for users steepcoin with clients. creation mobile clients provides the maximum accessibility and use the steepcoin network every spot the globe, practically from any known mobile device working basis android, ios, windows, linux (smartphones, notebooks, pads, netbooks). the system the fixed pos rewards provides the favorable diagram receipt dividends, saving interest the project from traders and maintenance the big trading volumes the long term. adding the payment protocol and implementation technology smart contracts does almost boundless options use steepcoin coins practical sense (the subsequent integration into steam and payment service providers such mastercard, visa example), the platform for implementation your own projects the basis steepcoin blockchain. www.steepcoin.net the organization charity foundation the help children from regions local wars the basis steepcoin blockchain, will allow show all world practical benefits the world community, show, not word and business that cryptocurrencies can bear good and the benefit the world community, and not just used speculative investments, support terrorism, drug traffic and on. unfortunately, recently all can watch large number scam projects the field cryptocurrencies (neogold, coinfido, bitpetite for example and many others). this regard offer you steepcoin ico sheme with guaranty buy back coins right after the termination ico for support bigger protection our investors against potential fraud not unfounded and not make empty promises once were added the mercatox.com exchange, but did not begin sale with the official site. our case, believe our project and are ready work and develop subsequent for this reason redeem least coins back right after the ico ends the price times higher, than the initial cost steep coins. (warrants for purchase are automatically exposed the exchange right after the termination ico, the mercatox.com exchange appears this case escrow). www.steepcoin.net all coins redeemed will transferred our steep addresses will few adresses keep more deep decentralization the steepcoin blockchain) and published our forums, these redeemed coins the same time will reduce quantity coins the free turn the exchanges least twice and the same time will become basis for our charity foundation. the status addresses fund can checked means the richsheet any moment our official steepcoin block explorer which already successfully works and completely synchronized with our network. thus all aforesaid does the steepcoin project attractive both for long-term, and for short-term investments. allows construct the basis our network new strong and amicable community which subsequent will become integral part world cryptocommunity and will take the worthy place the history development cryptocurrencies. www.steepcoin.net .the steep social links contacts: buy steep mercatox.com exchange: the steepcoin ico exchange (buy steep here): https://mercatox.com/exchange/steep/btc the steepcoin official website: www.steepcoin.net join the steepcoin community: the steepcoin official twitter: https://twitter.com/steepcoin the steepcoin official facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/steepcoin the steepcoin official telegram group: https://t.me/steepcoin enjoy the steepcoin promo video youtube: the steepcoin youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucgzsvozdhzhphscceffdg check the steepcoin official forums: the steepcoin main official forum op: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=. the steepcoin cryptocurrencytalk forum op: https:// cryptocurrencytalk.com/topic/-annicosteepcoinico-steepcheap-i-profitable-steep-pos-system-i-powpos/ the steepcoin bitcoingarden forum op: https:// bitcoingarden.org/forum/index.php?topic=.new#new the steepcoin bitsmedia forum op: https://forum.bits.media/index.php?/topic/icosteepcoinico-steep-cheap-i-profitable-steep-pos-system-ipowpos/ www.steepcoin.net contact us: the steepcoin official business email: devteam@steepcoin.net the steepcoin official social email: steepcoinproject@gmail.com the steepcoin skype invite link: https:// join.skype.com/invite/hmygwr steepcoin geography: woshib (francais) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=. sabrina-anto (indonesian) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=. koishikoko (japan) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=. khunglongrua (vietnam) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=. sayedtaha (arabic) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php? topic=.new#new srj (italian) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php? topic=.msg#msg qiman (chinese) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=. mellon (russian) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php? topic=.new#new www.steepcoin.net the steepcoin dev team: vitaliy bolgarov (general core development): bolgarovvitaliy@gmail.com alex leusenko graphic development, social manager): alexleusenko@gmail.com mellon (core development, co-founder): https:// bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u= nasir javed (social manager) nasirgsm@gmail.com thank you for your time, interest and support the steepcoin project. www.steepcoin.net references: nakamoto (): bitcoin: peer-to-peer electronic cash system: http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf bitcoin wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki darkcoin wiki: https://github.com/dashpay/dash/wiki sunny king, scott nadal (): peercoin: https://peercoin.net/assets/ paper/peercoin-paper.pdf pavel vasin blackcoin pos https://github.com/blkmaarx/ blackcoin.co/blob/master/blackcoin-pos-protocol-v-whitepaper.pdf novacoin wiki: http://coinwiki.info/en/novacoin gavin andresen, mike hearn (): payment protocol (bip): https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-.mediawiki vitaliy buterin (), etherium wiki: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki smart-contract wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smart_contract peter todd, stealth payments: https:// en.bitcoin.it/wiki/sx/stealth stealth address: https:// bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions//what-is-a-stealth-address www.steepcoin.net www.steepcoin.net let's make the world real steep together
