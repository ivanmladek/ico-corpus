document allowed without permission page odem technical whitepaper november, overview overview introduction odem, global educational provider, has the world's first blockchain-driven software platform built top ethereum's decentralized ledger technology. odem aims make blended education more affordable, accessible, verifiable, and transferable leveraging blockchain technology and ethereum's erc- based odem tokens (ode). odem's presale and main token event early odem sold approximately million ode (about eth, which was worth about million the time). white paper odem facilitates blended education (and eventually live streamed and online programs) through several core services. platform technology overview odem creates marketplace through open source onchain ethereum-based erc utility token used transact odem digital assets and sets corresponding smart contracts manage transactional data related education programs and credentials. this along with offchain proprietary cloud-based platform provides students, educators, employers, and other stakeholders easy-to-use tools participate academic programs and receive blockchain-based educational certificates. odem platform unlike the onchain dapp, the platform resides central location. built with standard web and html technologies, the platform connected the ethereum blockchain using web javascript library. within the odem platform, users will see: their profile programs events certificates obtained copyright (c) odem duplication any part this document allowed without permission page odem technical whitepaper november, overview calendar message center rewards/payments student's qualifications users will able to: request new program enroll available program list program list event message other users bid programs request certificates verify/deny claims issue certificates white paper ode (erc-) the erc- ode sold the crowdsale will provide access the odem platform through the staking process. the ode economic model based the sweetbridge foundation's discount-token research. the design isolates the utility ode the platform from external market forces, ensuring that use ode always advantageous. the odem staking architecture based adoption the ethereum erc- interface. student stakes desired program committing small amount ode. educators stake courses they intend teach. staking assists the platform assessing levels student and educator interest. participant backs out, their staked tokens are forfeited. using ode eliminates issues associated with fiat, including high fees and lengthy processing times. odem credits odem uses the erc- protocol for creation odem-credits (odem-c). adaptation the protocol will account for more general payload and limit the transfer method. odem-c are digital certificates stored the blockchain that are given users who successfully complete educational offerings. copyright (c) odem duplication any part this document allowed without permission page odem technical whitepaper november, overview the odem-c includes the name the student, educator, program, and institution, the program's date, and the interplanetary file system (ipfs) hash where the physical certificate can accessed with passphrase. odem student education dapp solutions our solution architecture broken down value proposition for the student, our core consumer the odem platform. are creating series smart contract use cases that will made available for use the ethereum blockchain early odem platform use cases introduction accessibility white paper education program staking (eps) when student makes commitment enroll program offered the odem platform. the student will typically stake, deposit, about percent the full price the program. staking helps the platform assess demand and discourages students from frivolously signing for programs. student stakes program and later backs out, the stake will forfeited. educators are also required stake their intention offer odem program. verifiability and transferability since educational diplomas and credentials are still managed almost entirely centralized learning institutions, verification one's education for the purpose either employment continued education completely dependent the physical institutions' centralized authority. odem leverages the trustless nature blockchain technology move the authority education verification onto the blockchain. once mass adoption occurs, allows other decentralized educational providers offer programs and recognized legitimately credentialing bodies. this will create opportunities for new and nontraditional education models recognized and legitimized the search for gainful employment and better transferability for relocation and future education. copyright (c) odem duplication any part this document allowed without permission page odem technical whitepaper november, overview achieve this, odem has created set smart contracts and interfaces through its platform that allow educational certificates any kind created, signed, verified, secured, shared, and managed entirely the blockchain. these applications include: odem's erc certificate created using digital education certification (dec). dec acts blockchain instance student's education certificate representing completed educational experience digitally signed and verified the educator (and applicable, the institution). odem decs are immutable certificates the blockchain owned the student. the core data includes the public key the stakeholders and their transactions live and onchain. the corresponding metadata reflecting this education program captured and managed securely and offchain the odem platform. students can view digital certificates through combination accessing their onchain certification and logging into the platform. odem requires small amount ode for each certificate created the blockchain. white paper students accumulate blockchain certificates, their experiences can managed aggregate through education activity repository (ear). ear secure record individual's educational history verified the educational institutions that the student has attended. should student lose access their educational identity such the case displaced refugee populations, odem has social claims verification process where student's educational records can recreated through process called identity through education (ite). once recreated, the students records become part their immutable ear. independent credentialing verification (icv): allows academic records automatically transferred from the blockchain academic institution's database. education skill badges (esb): digital badges student's accomplishments and on-the-job skills verified employer that are stored the blockchain. training education records (ter): employee's training credentials issued employer that are stored the blockchain. they collectively represent lifetime learning and personal improvement. copyright (c) odem duplication any part this document allowed without permission page odem technical whitepaper november, overview affordability the odem platform reduces the cost education offering short-term academic programs (instead more expensive four-year degrees) and allowing students bid courses and programs. not only can students have complete control over their educational records through odem certificates, they can also receive ode letting employers and other interested parties view their certifications through the education certification viewing (ecv) contract. this allows third parties such employers purchase access students' digital certificates. access fees are shared with opted-in users. odem charges ode fee for viewing (the fee split some between odem and the students). white paper program revenue sharing (prs): using smart contracts automatically distribute revenue odem platform partners, including speaking and literary agents, when their services are delivered through the odem platform. perpetual curriculum royalty (pcr): ode are sent educators when their licensed curriculum used other educators for teaching. smart contracts automatically send ode when third-party educators access licensed material through passphrase. there odem fee associated with this process. education token sponsorships (ets): similar scholarships, ets fund the cost studies for disadvantaged students and use smart contracts ensure that conditions the donations are being fulfilled. professional skills network (psn): informs odem's employment partners students who have completed specific program requirements for potential hiring. currency agnostic settlement (cas): odem will leverage blockchain-based mechanisms use ode voucher for use the platform. ode will used the platform ensure fast, reliable, cross-border, transactions with multiple parties each side regardless currency type. copyright (c) odem duplication any part this document
