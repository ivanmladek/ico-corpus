built the eponymous low-volatility crypto-asset regulated autonomous algorithm with methods proven traditional financial markets. minexcoin asset low-volatility cryptocurrency with predictable and dirigible price development. may employed both means settlement and means saving. the long-term value the coin based its annual growth .%. order reduce its volatility, such supply/demand regulation tools market interventions and coin parking are used. addressed issues cryptocurrency decentralized blockchain-based financial system, immutability, and autonomy being its most celebrated features. cryptocurrencies enable one bypass intermediaries and remain independent from traditional financial institutions. however, neither cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, managed become commonly used monetary asset. merchants and service providers are reluctant accept cryptocurrency payments involves additional risks exchange losses and regulatory issues. instrument capable becoming perfect global payments system commonly used speculative asset. this project devised solution for the fundamental problem question and takes into account the problems and challenges faced the global financial system. under revision and editing. the three whales distinguish three kinds crypto-market actors. the first traders people making short and medium-term investments cryptocurrency order quickly make the profit from exchange margin. the second investors. investors are interested cryptocurrencies means long-term storage and growth their capital. the third users those using cryptocurrencies for routine economic activities like remittances, purchases, etc. believe that users are quite important group they make the cryptocurrency sufficiently liquid. however, existing cryptocurrencies hardly meet their demands. result, the lack merchants and service providers causes the numbers medium and long-term investors grow slowly because minor involvement cryptocurrencies the real economy. the lack long-term investors not interested exchange gambling, turn, enables traders manipulate currency's exchange rates thus aggravating its volatility. this vicious circle prevents any cryptoasset from becoming established means payment. volatility problem high volatility amongst the biggest disadvantages bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies. hinders from becoming means storage and exchange value the global market. seasoned traders may get high profits from speculating exchange margins, yet the risks pertaining uncontrollable price fluctuations scare rookie users and online businesses away from cryptocurrencies. under revision and editing. stability answer stable cryptocurrencies are the solution enabling merchants enjoy all the advantages blockchain technology while keeping away from losses caused major price fluctuations. stable cryptocurrency coin whose price kept within certain range with set financial mechanisms and algorithms. existing solutions employ various means maintain stable prices their cryptocurrencies. digixdao backs every dgx token with equivalent amount gold physically stored singapore vault. for that reason, the token's price correlates with the price gold. chronobank creates its own labor market where each token pegged the average worth work-hour. tether tokens are backed with u.s. dollars kept private company's bank account. makerdao maintains stable price its dai tokens with complex red-tape system hardly comprehensible for those lacking profound cryptocurrency savviness. our opinion, the existing projects all feature several fundamental flaws. they're either pegged unstable asset, and therefore can't considered currencies with stable and predictable purchasing power; backed immovable asset, and therefore are interest for traders and investors; or, while promising some predictable profit their investors, lack transparency; make too hard for average user assess their price growth. minexcoin offers innovative solution which creates autonomous financial system that meets the demands all three kinds market actors. under revision and editing. minexcoin: unique innovative solution there are two factors that make minexcoin unique: low volatility the coin (within five-percent range) achieved autonomously with traditional financial tools; predictable and controllable annual growth the coin's price which correlates with average annual price growth calculated for portfolio most popular altcoins (around percent). thanks its unique features, minexcoin multi-purpose tool equally useful for trading, longterm investment, and routine financial operations. traders, whose speculations often tend destroy cryptocurrency ecosystems, have constructive role the minexcoin's system. encouragement trading activity will become tool that the coin's autonomous algorithm uses keep the token's price within certain range. controllable price surge over time will make the coin profitable asset for investors. coin parking, which the second volatility control tool minexcoin, meets the strategy medium and long-term investment. finally, thanks price predictability, easy conversion and high-speed transactions, regular users and online retailers will able use minexcoin means payment and value storage. minexcoin excludes both exchange losses and service payments. under revision and editing. minexbank: smart algorithms minexcoin tackles the issue high volatility automatically regulating demand and supply exchanges. that, uses certain algorithms that encourage coin holders buy, sell keep their assets depending the balance supply and demand the given time. those algorithms resemble activity central banks that maintain the cost their national currency, they are collectively known minexbank. for the functioning algorithm modifying interest rates "parking" operations, real-time the following steps are completed: determine average weighted cross-rate mnx/$ basket currencies, which are the top for the capitalization level, real-time. correlate average weighted cross-rate mnx the capitalization level and share total capitalization each specified currencies. the formula for determining average weighted cross-rate mnx the basket currencies follows: where average weighted cross-rate mnx/$. under revision and editing. simplified version the formula follows: where the weighted average cross-rate mnx current exchange rate btc mnx ... are current exchange rates the top cryptocurrencies btc. x... are current exchange rates the top cryptocurrencies usd q... current market capitalization each the top cryptocurrencies usd total market capitalization the top cryptocurrencies usd such way get unbiased cross-rate mnx usd. the change this rate influenced not only the price bitcoin, but also prices all other highly liquid cryptocurrencies. addition, real time average weighted rate mnx correlated the change capitalization each currency separately, and the total capitalization these cryptocurrencies. under revision and editing. fact, are locking the mnx rate basket cryptocurrencies; that more unibased marker mnx price, compared locking using cross-rate bitcoin only. set index the estimated value mnx the time, the basis the increase mnx estimated value per year. since necessary calculate the estimated cost mnx with frequency second, the calculation the change price per second calculated formula follows: where the current estimated cost mnx the dollar. mnx' exchange rate the dollar based the results the second round ico the number seconds year the number seconds elapsed since the start trading until the current moment. enable the algorithm compare two indexes and change "parking" operations discount rates case deviation current price from the calculated one. changes "parking" operations rate will carried out taking into account such market figures quantity demanded, quantity supplied and price velocity, rather than using the positive correlation principle. minexbank closed source app, though some its features are accessible users via the official website. minexbank users may browse existing interest rates for parking payments and file request receive interest for coin parking operations. order protect the assets, the bank's reserve stored cold wallets. under revision and editing. hybrid governance present stage, minexbank uses hybrid governance, which implies that the algorithm's decisions are monitored group professional economists. early phases the system's operation, the team reserves the right introduce amendments the algorithm's parameters order promptly prevent emerging risks and guarantee steady work the entire system. once the algorithm fine-tuned, minexbank will become decentralized autonomous organization. final phases, the platform's financial activity will completely free human involvement, and use algorithms set earlier. main exchange while assessing market conditions, minexbank will invoke asset price the main exchange, which the exchange where minexbank stores, buys and sells its assets. the selected exchange will have the most secure all currently existence. prices for assets traded elsewhere will correlate with those the main one thanks trader arbitration. under revision and editing. how actually works the main purpose minexbank stabilize the exchange rate within the range more than the previous day's closure price. the five percent growth owes the practice global stock exchanges. once the values are reached, stock markets halt the trading, thus preventing speculators and misguided investors from dictating their own prices. once the limit values the five per cent range are reached, minexbank has two options: either changes interest rates for parking payouts intervenes keep the price within the preset range. coin parking and intervention are the basic financial instruments used minexbank. parking parking means that coins are voluntarily withdrawn from the market user who temporarily suspends them their wallet. the 'parking' user eligible receive interest. users will able choose the type parking depending the time they undertake store coins their wallets without using them online. there are three kinds parking: day hours): for short-term impact month days): for medium-term impact annual days): for long-term impact. average reference rate for parking payouts will gradually down, yet, thanks minexcoin price's growth, the actual parking revenue will only grow over time. under revision and editing. average basic rates for parking payouts:* *the values are determined default and may altered minexbank algorithms, either way, depending market conditions. user withdraws all money from their wallet, minexbank does not award interest regardless how much time there until parking ends. if, after parking their coins, the user withdraws part their money, the system awards interest for the parking contract concluded first case its amount does not exceed current balance the user's wallet. interventions intervention means that minexbank buys sells minexcoin keep the exchange rate within the predetermined range. initially, minexbank has mnx reserve with option continuously filling that the system could work long-term basis and suppress possible speculative attacks. the initial reserve formed premining coins. once there are more minexcoins the market due additional issuance (miner work rewards), the reserve will have replenished and eventually expanded. the growth will ensured the progressive percentage payments minexbank for each block solved miners. under revision and editing. blocks blocks blocks blocks blocks since block the bank takes the commission both from the awards the miner and from his commission for transactions. after completion the issuance coins, the commission will only from the transaction commission. under revision and editing. incentivizing miners miner reward for each formed block comprises minexcoin. miners will make progressive payments minexbank until block reached. considering the coin will worth more over time, fiat equivalent miner reward, notwithstanding the continuously growing payments the bank, will grow. this will result the increase the system's overall capacity, and therefore, its complexity. market behavior practice, the minexbank algorithm uses simple and efficient pattern. there are three possible options for market behavior (excessive demand, excessive supply supply/demand equilibrium), there are three strategies for minexbank behavior well. under revision and editing. excessive demand case excessive demand, the interest rate for parking payments will decrease. this will cause asset holders enter the market, which turn will cause the price down. case this method fails work effectively enough, minexbank starts selling the assets itself order subdue pressure from buyers. under revision and editing. excessive supply case excess supply, the interest rate for parking payments grows, thus withdrawing the excessive amount from the market. case this method fails, minexbank buys the assets subdue pressure from sellers. under revision and editing. supply/demand equilibrium this case, minexbank does nothing the price remains within the predetermined range. under revision and editing. coin parameters total amount: mnx block rewards: mnx hashing algorithm: mars (equihash based) block size: block time: min revision complexity: days distribution premining: mnx ico (subscription presale bonuses): mnx bounty: mnx minexbank reserve: mnx developers' and advisors' capital: mnx crowdsale summary minexcoin (mnx) based bitcoin's source code. chose bitcoin's code base due its proven reliability. order accelerate transactions, block formation time reduced from minutes. most stable cryptocurrencies use two kinds assets overall turnover: traded token shares and stable coin. during initial coin offerings, investors are commonly offered buy shares, not stable coins. under revision and editing. minexcoin will use single coin employed both means payment and share. this approach further protects minexcoin system from speculator interference. another important advantage for investors that they receive reliably stable asset over the ico, not yet another highly volatile token. minexcoin's ico campaign incorporates two phases: phase one (subscription) set determine applicability, importance and value the very concept creating low volatile and steadily growing asset, and inviting prospective users discuss the matter. cost coins/bonuses for early participants phase one (subscription): under revision and editing. the purpose phase two (pre-sale) determine the market price the coin immediately before entering the exchange. the same price the basic value minexbank's policy, and calculated follows: where stands for market exchange rate (basic value the bank's algorithm); for volume involved investor funds; for absolute volume bonuses accrued early participants; for the amount coins available for the ico. phase two (pre-sale) terms: may th, june th, bonuses for early participants phase two (pre-sale): under revision and editing. all money raised over the first two phases the ico will spent development and marketing the product. the coins are subject distribution among investors the day after the ico's completion. the future minex minexbank's monetary policy serves the main purpose making minexcoin global reserve cryptocurrency. order attain it, minexcoin will have meet the following principles: simplicity and high speed transactions exchange rate stability and predictability against u.s. dollar market cap trillion minexbank will consistently administer the policy increasing mnx price against usd the basis the growth rate annually. once minexcoin issuance over block ,,, its price will reach $,, and market cap trillion. this market cap will allow for using mnx global payment unit the volume available dollars will have comprised trillion the time question, should the existing trend persists. under revision and editing. minex ecosystem the minex systems team intends implement the extended functionality minex ecosystem incorporating such applications minex market, minex exchange, and minex platform. implementation those products seeks expand the coin's sphere circulation, thus driving demand for it. under revision and editing. roadmap under revision and editing. credits for their comments and feedback the authors wish thank: the national economic university kyiv arzhevitin, the
