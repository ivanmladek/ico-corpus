last modified february   scriv network www.scriv.network introduction scriv introduction the scriv network can verify the existence digital data any point time. this data linked with publicly verifiable date and time (timestamp) provide data assurance. this link can verified without the need for centralized service third-party authority. the data assurance the scriv network allows users verify data ownership and its originality. technologies involved hashing hashing the process submitting data the input hashing algorithm which returns short hash identifier (that allows for the data uniquely distinguished) output. this output called "hash." the hash used quickly distinguish datasets without having compare the entire contents. this single process comparison occurs only once and much faster than comparing every bit data. the hashes are different, the data not the same. the hashes match, then, with probability .%, the data the same. the hashing algorithm meets the following criteria: matching data always returns the same unique hash. non-matching data sets return unique hash for each set. however, this condition not always fulfilled completely. when hash assigned non-matching data, unique. scriv whitepaper v... last modified february   scriv network www.scriv.network proof-of-work also referred pow, the proof-of-work system very effective protecting the network from abuse (i.e. dos attack). with pow, complicated operations are solved the client side, and then easily and quickly verified the server side. the primary benefit pow the validation the asymmetry the time expenditure. "the network timestamps transactions hashing them into ongoing chain hash-based proof-of-work, forming record that cannot changed without redoing the proof-of-work." []. masternodes typical blockchain nodes are servers which run decentralized network. these nodes allow peers send and receive updates across the network. the nodes require the ability handle significant amounts traffic and other resources and carry substantial cost with little reward. for this reason that the number bitcoin nodes has decreased continuously. "much the reason for the decrease full nodes the bitcoin network, the lack incentive run one. over time the cost running full node increases the network gets used more, creating more bandwidth and costing the operator more money." masternodes solve this problem. "masternodes are full nodes, just like the bitcoin network, except they must provide level service the network and have bond collateral participate. collateral never forfeit and safe while the masternode operating. this allows investors provide service the network, earn interest their investment and reduce the volatility the currency." ipfs network what ipfs? ipfs distributed file system which synthesizes successful ideas from previous peer-to-peer systems, including dhts, bittorrent, git, and sfs. the contribution ipfs simplifying, evolving, and connecting proven techniques into single cohesive system, greater than the sum its parts. ipfs presents new platform for writing and deploying applications scriv whitepaper v... last modified february and new system for distributing and versioning large data. ipfs could even evolve the web itself.   scriv network www.scriv.network ipfs could seen single bittorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one git repository. other words, ipfs provides high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. this forms generalized merkle dag, data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even permanent web. ipfs combines distributed hashtable, incentivized block exchange, and self-certifying namespace. ipfs has single point failure, and nodes not need trust each other. ipfs ambitious vision new decentralized internet infrastructure, upon which many different kinds applications can built. the bare minimum, can used global, mounted, versioned filesystem and namespace, the next generation file sharing system. its best, could push the web new horizons, where publishing valuable information does not impose hosting the publisher but upon those interested, where users can trust the content they receive without trusting the peers they receive from, and where old but important files not missing. ipfs looks forward bringing toward the permanent web. network structure and operation the scriv network's operation algorithm follows (see fig. user load data verified (pdf, jpeg, zip) the wallet. sha hash generated. wallet checks the scriv blockchain determine this new data has already been established the blockchain the past. new data launch data assurance process user pays assurance fee [see additional rewards]. data saved ipfs network (generation service data). scriv explained scriv whitepaper v... last modified february   scriv network www.scriv.network all required verification data inserted into the next block the scriv blockchain. previously assured data launch verification process search the scriv blockchain for the service data. the algorithm returns ipfs address the data. verified data can accessed the ipfs network through the scriv block explorer when the necessary conditions are satisfied [see "privacy and anonymity"]. scriv network scriv whitepaper v... last modified february   scriv network www.scriv.network additional rewards addition the rewards paid for block generation, miners and masternode operators receive assurance fees. these fees are paid the user. [see "network structure and operation"]. the first part this reward included the next block and paid the miner who found it. the second part distributed equally among all running masternodes. this procedure greatly reduces inflation and ensures that the natural circulation scriv will occur. privacy and anonymity all user-dependent scriv operations are available within the wallet. the scriv network provides fast and secure connection between the user, the blockchain, and the ipfs network. our blockchain built upon the dash source code, and all network transactions and file transfers are secured with high-level encryption. default, public keys are private. however, user can request link his identity his public key. this requires that personal information confirmed. once this information has been verified, the users public key will then appropriately labeled. default, all verified data encrypted before saved the ipfs network. however, also possible save as-is that will

large companies educational institutions. can used lawyers, copywriters, artists, etc. here are some potential use cases: demonstrating data ownership without revealing actual data this can used help protect content creators well retailers who sell digital goods. the content creator can protect his content assigning unique identifier (hash) the scriv network which can then give authorized resellers. the customer can then confident that the reseller owns the rights sell the content checking the assigned hash the scriv network. document timestamping this functionality can used within the sphere law where determining the originality data plays significant role. the scriv network can verify that digital data (documents, photos, videos, etc.) has not been altered modified since being immutably registered and timestamped the scriv blockchain. verifying document integrity the scriv network can used ensure the integrity business documents and contracts. when document registered the scriv network will impossible for changes made without the knowledge both parties. changes are made, the document will fail validation. preventing unwanted duplication and overwriting the usage the scriv blockchain, combination with the ipfs network, protects against unwanted storage duplication and the overwriting documents. scriv whitepaper v... last modified february comparing scriv with
