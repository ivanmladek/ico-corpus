cryptocurrency that rewards network participation via static proof stake. mergecoin rewards "connectivity age" instead "coin age," thus eliminating abuse from exchanges and users that not actively contribute the network. having static reward system, the rewards for participation are proportional the work every active node contributes. this discourages centralization and promotes network health. addition static rewards, mergecoin implements masternode network incentivize large holders, and perform advanced functions such near instant and private transactions. this paper describes the basic coin specifications, features, and capabilities the coin. the paper also describes coin distribution, funding purposes, future growth efforts. table contents what mergecoin mergecoin digital currency that enables instant payments anyone, anywhere the world. mergecoin uses peer-to-peer technology over clearnet operate with central authority (centralisation): managing transactions and issuing currency (mgc) are carried out collectively the mergecoin network. mergecoin the name open source software which easy use. specifications coin suffix: mgc pow algorithm: shad pow period: network

communicating each transaction across all nodes the network prevent double spending (duffield, schinzel, and gutierrez, when private transactions are initiated, masternodes also perform the work necessary make the transactions hard trace. the masternode network will able perform additional functions new developments are commissioned and the bounties executed. masternode specifications coins required: (minimum and maximum) reward: the block reward all fees for transactions contained the block peer validated network uptime private transactions masternodes facilitate private transactions through decentralized mixing service that takes advantage the perfect fungibility the currency. any unit mergecoin has the equivalent value any other unit identical size, regardless the transaction history any particular unit. masternodes use this property automatically break private transactions into multiple identical and indistinguishable transactions, both adding complexity the original transaction and obfuscating the provenance any given unit. block transactions, three users submit funds various set denominations. users pay themselves back the form new outputs, which are randomly ordered. private mergecoin transactions are initiated through local wallet and received the masternode subnetwork. transactions are processed groups three. inputs common denominations are required for example mgc, mgc, mgc, mgc. upon application the mixing pool, receiving masternode propagates the transaction set throughout the network. only one two private transactions are pending, they are held queue until three are the mixing pool. fees are extracted from the individual transactions, then charged collectively further obfuscate the transaction history. private send limited,thus requiring multiple sessions thoroughly delink associated transaction history from significant amounts money. since each session limited three clients, observer has one three chance being able follow transaction. mixed transactions are chained together through multiple masternodes, making traceability exponentially more difficult with each additional chained transaction. users have some control over the degree mixing. more mixing takes more time, but more thoroughly obfuscates inputs. the fee for these transactions grows with each degree, the process more labor intensive for the masternodes (duffield and diaz, this method mixing trustless, integrated, on-chain, on-network service that efficient, effective, and safe. initiated directly within local wallet and completed without leaving the mergecoin network. while some details private transactions are obscured, the system nevertheless retains verifiable integrity spent coins the mergecoin blockchain. what the incentive run masternode? average daily reward blocks per day block reward masternodes) masternodes receive fixed rewards the block reward) which are probabilistically distributed among peer validated masternodes. masternodes recursively scan peer node performance, and only high performance nodes with sustained, stable, high-speed internet connections are eligible for rewards. addition receiving the block reward, masternode receives all fees for public transactions completed block and for all private transaction pools initiated the block. these incentives promote continuous connectivity maintain high performance network. masternode network performance maintenance theory, malicious actors could also run mergecoin masternodes, but not provide any the quality service that required the rest the network. reduce this possibility and discourage people from using the system their advantage, all nodes must regularly ping the rest the mergecoin masternode network ensure they remain active. this work done through selection quorums per block. every new block hash, quorum checks the service quorum quorum are the closest nodes the current hash, while quorum are the furthest nodes from said hash. masternode checks masternode (rank masternode checks masternode (rank masternode checks masternode (rank the masternode network self-monitoring. approximately the network will checked for each block

network also requires minimum six violations order deactivate node (duffield and diaz, proof work static proof stake bitcoin achieved the first distributed blockchain-based transaction ledger and immutable digital currency. achieve this, bitcoin rewarded the distribution computing equipment maintain decentralized blockchain and secure network. there was short period time when this worked well, but now bitcoin rewards the accumulation computing power, and only few consolidated pools maintain the network. the rapid growth the bitcoin network also disastrous burden ecology. the exponential expansion computing power has lead similar rise difficulty, and power hungry mining consume vast amount electricity. this concentration power threatens the distributed model checks and balances, and even governance over core development odds with how solve the growing problems. single transaction confirmation can take excess minutes (blockchain.info, and the technology vulnerable attacks increase the delays. thus, rejected mining and proof work the basis for security and adopted proof stake instead. critics proof work developed proof stake (pos) alternative protocol. pos systems depend upon low-energy, distributed computing network achieve the same ends secure, distributed blockchain. they rely accumulation coin instead computing power the basis for rewards for securing the network. early models proof stake were designed around "coin age," the length time that the coin was held wallet, and "coin weight," the total amount coin the wallet. these have proven necessary but insufficient conditions for rewards because they not reward active facilitation network transactions. theory, and practice, holders cryptocurrencies based the first versions pos could deposit large volumes coin into wallet, take offline, accrue coin age for extended period time, then bringing the wallet online momentarily obtain instantaneous reward. this first version pos rewards users for holding onto coins without actively contributing the integrity the network. this model, exchanges and other large holders coin maintain offline wallets, and only periodically connect them the network generate and sell the stake. this directly increases the coin supply while driving down the market value the coin. contrast, mergecoin uses "static" proof stake system, version (pos spos), which aligns incentives with user behaviors actively contribute robust, fast, and secure network. the reward "static" because always the same the block reward). coin weight still matters, but "connectivity age," the duration wallet maintains active network communication replaces coin age the primary probability parameter for staking. rewards are thus contingent upon active work and the amount mergecoin held wallets maintain and secure the network. addition, mergecoin implements masternodes (duffield, reward large holders coin, contribute network robustness, and perform advanced functions such near instant and private transactions. block reward schedule total mgcs will used for the initial coin supply. these coins are generated the genesis block and will held trust the mergeoin team. year mgcs/block mgcs/year total longer... +... distribution coin many alternative cryptocurrencies start with proof work phase. developers reason that miners become engaged with the coin economy and earn the coin through the work mining. the lesson the mergeoin team has taken from the history cryptocurrency, however, that the pow phase encourages "mining and dumping" which drives down the value the asset from the start. this supposedly "engaged" user base simply uses mining vehicle for quick profit then leaves without contributing ongoing value the coin community that uses it. staking wallets wallets have been developed for general users. daemon wallets have been developed for advanced users. wallets will maintained for all major desktop platforms: windows, mac, and linux. and daemon wallets give mergecoin holders complete control the security their mgc, with controls send and receive transactions. coins required: minimum. (wallets must contain non-zero sum mgcs receive stake rewards.) wallet stake reward block reward for each discovered block. staking probabilistic, and probability distributed according the amount mgc the wallet address (coin weight) and the duration mgc held the continuously connected wallet (connectivity age). valid network connectivity requires that the wallet connected the internet with sufficiently high-speed, stable connection support the blockchain. previous versions proof stake require what known checkpointing. checkpointing centrally broadcasted full node that signed the developer and designed help verify coin stake before accepted into the block tree. mgc, every node full node, and because this checkpoint system needed. removing this partial centralized dependency that existed previous pos versions, all nodes are fully authorized and makes network attack far more difficult. blockexplorer blockexplorer for mergecoin use the insight-api which open source based nodejs: http://www.mergechain.com/ conclusions mergecoin integrates static proof stake (pos v.) system with incentivized masternode/wallet matrix. the result fast transaction confirmation, reliable network security, enhanced privacy through decentralized coin mixing, and reduced price volatility. this technological foundation establishes possibilities for smart contracts, colored coins, side chains and advanced security mechanisms. this combination mergecoin's powerful coin technology with team creative corporate plan brings about compelling opportunities. entrepreneurs and developers can leverage social network engaged customers and investors way that never before has been attempted this industry. references blockchain.info.
