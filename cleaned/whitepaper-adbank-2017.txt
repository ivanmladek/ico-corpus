are excluded from purchasing adbank tokens. this document constitutes description the adbank platform and the functionality adbank tokens. abstract "advertising broken. let's fix it." his document outlines technical innovations both the blockchain and patent pending-pending anti-fraud. the white paper and patent pendings describe artificial intelligence (ai) advancements that the adbank platform's owners will leverage disrupt middlemen the digital advertising space. addition adbank's technical innovations, this document will outline how adbank business plan different from existing strategies and will show how the company plans disrupt the digital advertising ecosystem, through strategy acquiring existing networks. experts agree that blockchain technology has the potential address many the major problems currently plaguing the digital advertising industry. estimated billion will spent worldwide digital advertising, with middlemen taking the investment, and advertisers losing another billion fraud. "just chief marketing officers' (cmo) digital media investment reaches target audiences," stated association national advertisers (ana) ceo bob liodice during his opening remarks the ana's masters marketing conference october "this atrocity represents more than billion marketing waste, inefficiency, and ineffectiveness." liodice's estimate correct, billion (%) the estimated billion that will spent digital advertising will middlemen, not advertisers publishers. when fraud added that amount, the amount investment not going advertisers and publishers billion. technical overview dbank's application blockchain technology, the patent pending-pending anti-fraud technology, and the adbank token will create transparent ecosystem, which will allow payments from advertisers publishers traced. adbank has created and submitted patent pendings new forms fraud detection based artificial intelligence and the blockchain. whereas traditional fraud detection systems are constructed run within whatever advertising network they were designed for, adbank's anti-fraud system will have full access the entire platform, which includes blockchain. these additional sources information allow the find connections between information the advertising system and the blockchain that other systems can't leverage. this means that adbank's anti-fraud can succeed where others fail being built into the very fabric the adbank platform. adbank's patent pendings cover wide range anti-fraud techniques. through accessing advertising databases, user logs, images, rendering web pages, blockchain transactions, and the latest supervised and unsupervised artificial intelligence learning, adbank's anti-fraud system can detect many types fraud. some examples include finding transactional blockchain activity coupled with web pages that fail render all expected ads detect predatory publisher the system, catching unexpected and typical shifts website visitors along with many frequently and atypical mass selling tokens other currency the blockchain indicate publisher that's buying traffic, and selling the profits quickly possible avoid detection. another example, adbank working develop comprehensive collection tools catch mobile application based fraud, whereby malicious app intercepts clicks and emits false app installation notifications that earn fraudulent publishers huge payouts for faking the process ads that drive app installations. the adbank app will detect this activity and send this data back the adbank anti-fraud ai, which will leverage this information, well other sources fraud-detection information catch and ban these criminals. can seen with these few examples that adbank provides unmatched ecosystem built make advertising landscape conducive detecting and eliminating the fraudulent behavior. leveraging blockchain technology disrupt digital advertising clear opportunity that others have identified well. what makes adbank's technical approach unique appropriate application blockchain technology introduce transparency into payments, with anti-fraud ais monitoring the entire process both on-chain and off-chain. business model innovation: adbank unique its' business plan, where its path disruption includes roll-up strategy acquire existing ad-networks and convert them the use adbank tokens. this acquisition and conversion existing networks strategy unique both adbanks core services platform and adbanks business plan. adbank's plans deploy million usd acquisitions may result the adb token having token-transactional volume million usd month. this figure does not include the growth expected and the advanced technology and improved economics generate lowering advertisers' costs. adbank does not intend the biggest network but instead provide the tools allow other networks convert the adb token and realize the same benefits transparency and anti-fraud the blockchain provides. the adbank team located canada and brings together team industry insiders. those veterans include the co-founder/cto, chiron bramberger, who was founding member network that was sold google for million and co-founder/ceo, jon gillham, who operated private-equity company dedicated rolling digital assets. the opportunity the fraud problem igital advertising has become one the fastest- growing and most lucrative industries the world today. however, online advertising broken industry with highly-inefficient business model that prone fraud and abuse. the revenues that can made from advertising are absolutely incredible. marketers spent billion digital ads first quarter alone, the interactive advertising bureau (iab) reported. digital spending also growing dramatically increasing billion between third quarter and the first three months size the digital advertising market value all digital advertising revenues for was projected reach billion according the research firm emarketer. the largest segment digital marketing, mobile ads, projected undergo dramatic growth the next two years. alphabet expected generate billion revenue from mobile ads that figure expected grow billion and billion recode reported. buys are currently divided into more traditional style media buys directly with the publisher's sales team, run using programmatic system (ie. google adwords, facebook, etc.). who profits from digital advertising? espite the vast profits, digital advertising deeply flawed industry because the people who actually create the content and sites--the advertisers and publishers- may getting less than half the revenue. middlemen are taking between and the billion spent digital advertising annually, data compiled for adbank indicated. other estimates have the percentage taken middlemen high those middlemen take many forms including search engines, networks, agencies, brokerages, affiliate programs, and media conglomerates. this layer middlemen exists because the advertising market severely fragmented. even today's world, publishers often have direct method connecting with advertisers. that means participants turn network other middleman who requires them pay for the privilege placing ads networks. the flaws this system are numerous, but the greatest problem that publishers and advertisers have leverage over the middlemen. there little transparency and often means validating advertising views. not surprisingly, such environment lends itself fraud. the incredible extent digital advertising fraud problem digital-advertising fraud far greater than most marketing professionals and entrepreneurs realize. the volume fraud, sometimes known "bot fraud," now large that threatens the future advertising itself. advertisers are projected lose billion advertising fraudsters the association national advertisers (ana) and the white ops analyst firm reported. unfortunately, fraud some segments the industry still growing. highlights fraud detailed ana and white ops report show that the problem still out control. data from the same report indicate that fraud now threatens the profitability some segments digital advertising. disturbingly, another report from the verification company adbox indicates the problem might far worse. adbox's estimate the cost fraud was higher than the numbers white ops and ana provided. the estimates from these reports expose the extent digital fraud and the threat poses advertisers and publishers. highlights the fraud problem include: digital fraud cost advertisers billion the ad-verification company adbox estimated february this was nearly billion more than the number white ops calculated. around all money spent advertisers was lost fraudsters, adbox estimated. the cost fraud will increase billion adbox predicted. that would increase billion just months. estimates bot fraud vary widely, which indicates how hard detect and analyze. around the billion spent programmatic automated, digital advertising was lost fraudulent invalid traffic, industry group called the&partnership reported. estimated all funds spent online video advertising will lost fraud, ana and white ops revealed. around money spent online display advertising will lost fraud, ana and white ops estimated. all web domains were identified fraudulent "cash-out" sites, ana and white ops. the amount fraud from sourced traffic, sites, ads designed drive traffic other sites was times higher than that come from non-sourced traffic, according ana and white ops. the high levels fraud occurred even though advertisers surveyed ana and white ops deployed antifraud measures. fraudulent advertising has become very hard identify. only around billion less than one half the billion worth fraudulent programmatic advertising was under review major advertisers' marketing departments, the world federation advertisers reported. these figures are high because the middlemen have little incentive combat fraud. the typical digital advertising middleman makes the same amount for fraudulent advertising real advertising. this gives unscrupulous middlemen strong incentive ignore high volumes fraud some segments such video advertising. social media built for advertising fraud? ome observers think the fraud problem vast because the present system setup profit from it. daily beast writers alexander heffner and liam dalton even accused facebook and its ceo, mark zuckerberg, "monetizing fraud." "the new media conglomerate the wild west: unknown, unregulated, unlawful," heffner and dalton wrote facebook. they extended their criticism another social media operator: twitter. they stated that facebook's system was set give advertisers the benefit the doubt. the two also make the damning allegation that facebook making serious efforts control fraud. this should concern publishers and advertisers because facebook currently the world's largest social media company. one facebook product, the messaging solution whatsapp, had billion users worldwide july statista estimated. addition facebook itself, which had estimated two billion users june the company also operates facebook messenger which had billion users june and instagram which had million users june tech crunch reported. how and why fraud occurs ost the fraud occurs because the standard method website promotion and finance--paid traffic acquisition traffic sourcing. paid-traffic acquisition exists because smaller publishers lack the resources content attract views their own. they turn paid traffic brokers and often choose the ones that provide the highest volumes traffic. those brokers often use bots algorithms that fool websites into identifying them human visitors. bots can create the illusion high levels traffic, which brokers use charge higher rates. such "sourced traffic" problematic because times likely fraudulent natural organic internet traffic, ana and white ops determined. make matters worse often impossible track fraud because levels can fluctuate. also very pervasive according the available data. "levels fraud are not constant throughout the year," according bot baseline fraud advertising ana and white ops. "fraud invited whenever and wherever digital advertising demand outstrips supply." therefore, fraud occurs and profitable because the supply viewers for digital advertising limited. the demand from digital advertisers always exceeds the available volume viewers, which encourages fraud. advertisers can charge more for limited numbers viewers they have strong incentive pad the figures. levels fraud vary dramatically, which makes harder detect. ana and white ops noted that fraud levels were far higher busy shopping days such cyber monday and black friday. also found spikes fraud during holidays when advertising spending higher. despite that, some advertisers and publishers are getting better fraud detection. large-volume programmatic buyers ads, such the consumer products giant procter gamble, are now capable weeding out much the fraud. they are also learning how identify sources fraud-prone advertising and cutting them off. how digital advertising works for middlemen and nobody else roots digital fraud lie the basic process that most publishers and advertisers are forced utilize. ideally, website publisher should able use services, such google adsense medianet, generate enough advertising revenue pay the bills. unfortunately, this rarely occurs because that publisher competing against tens thousands hundreds thousands other bloggers. adsense and medianet payments are based the number viewers site receives. that process works great for popular websites like the drudge report, which attracted billion views july alone, according similar web's top u.s. media publisher rankings. the report's owner and operator, matt drudge, now very rich man because has large audience and lots revenue pouring in. works poorly for your typical website operator, such blogger who writes about specialized topic like comic books, auto racing, cryptocurrency. such blogger, whose site might receive few hundred few thousand hits each day, may earn only few pennies day from the giants like google. get more revenue many publishers turn brokers and other middlemen. this can lead higher rate views, but rarely generates higher income because the broker often takes the revenue. brokers make money selling space advertisers. understanding the depth the problem complete lack transparency uch middlemen have limited incentive detect combat bot fraud because helps them make more money. the middleman's pay based solely the number views; the more views the brings in, the more money the broker makes. this explains why the world's major advertisers are now buying digital space directly from publishers and bypassing the middleman, cnbc reported february that method works well for giant corporations like ford procter gamble, which can afford hire professional staff contact publishers directly. also great deal for major website publishers like matt drudge because the major advertisers will call them and pay them directly. unfortunately, fails miserably for most web publishers such mother who blogs about child rearing. major advertisers such toyota amazon will have incentive work with them directly. worse, they simply lack the money and resources review all the views they receive for fraud. this situation creates advertising market which there complete lack transparency. only giant corporations can afford the resources necessary attempt verify the authenticity views. almost every other publisher and advertiser the mercy middlemen and fraudsters. these publishers have choice but trust the middlemen, yet they have way ascertaining the traffic provided legitimate. the bind the advertisers are put terrible, they have choice but buy product and means telling that product real. nobody likes the current digital advertising ecosystem obvious reality that nobody likes the current status quo digital advertising, except, perhaps, alphabet stockholders and fraudsters. large advertisers seem just dissatisfied with digital ads the smaller players. even some the biggest consumers advertising such chief brand officer marc pritchard--the man charge procter gamble's (p&g) billion year advertising budget--are disgusted it. pritchard, whose company major consumer all kinds advertising, delivered one the most scathing attacks the status quo january "we serve ads consumers through non-transparent media supply chain with spotty compliance common standards, unreliable measurement, hidden rebates, and new inventions like bot and methbot fraud," pritchard said. that was just one many public attacks pritchard has made digital advertising. back january, pritchard laid down the law digital advertisers the interactive advertising bureau's annual leadership meeting. told digital advertisers that p&g does not "want waste time and money crappy media supply chain," age reported. his full speech can seen youtube. why procter gamble abandoning digital advertising marc pritchard making good his threats putting his company's money where his mouth is. p&g cut its spending digital advertising million during second quarter age reported july. the rationale p&g gave for the cut was "temporarily restrict spending digital forums where our ads were not being placed according our standards and specifications." this was only the latest example pritchard's war digital fraud, p&g pulled out alphabet's youtube, the largest video-advertising digital, march because lack results. pritchard not the only p&g executive who souring digital advertising. chief financial officer jon moeller shares pritchard's disgust with online ads, adweek reported. "clearly, don't need spending money that seen bot and not person," moeller stated. "clearly, don't need spending money ads that are placed inappropriate places and that's why you see significant reduction. the biggest advertising fraud ever reason that procter gamble left youtube might due something called methbot, which pritchard mentioned specifically his video attack. methbots were involved what fast company called the "largest known advertising fraud scheme ever." ring russian hackers called fraud komanda, "afk," was able rake million million day using methbots create fake video views, white ops estimated. the extent afk's operation was vast. created more than fake domains and phony urls, according fortune. this enabled afk fool some major publishers including vogue and espn. afk also operated gigantic "farm" that used bots fool advertisers. those bots watched many million video ads day. the methbots were even able fool publishers into thinking that they were average american families watching video home the heartland, white ops concluded. methbot advanced bot that uses modified code mimic human behavior. the bot's creators gave the nickname "meth" because highly addictive--just like the notorious street drug methamphetamines. methbots also give websites and advertisers jolt false viewership, much like "meth" gives addicts jolt false energy that leads erratic and often destructive behavior. the hackers afk were sophisticated that they were able reverse engineer the quality verification processes publishers used detect phony ads. they also obtained hundreds thousands addresses associated with internet customers and providers make their methbot traffic look real. the biggest losers from the methbot operation were advertisers whose losses are still unknown. one obvious casualty the methbot offensive was proctor gamble, white ops exposed afk december less than three months later, march p&g pulled out youtube completely. the other damage done the methbots unknown but might vast. unknown the methbots are still operation, but white ops experts believe they have become pervasive the advertising ecosystem. "at this point, the methbot operation has become embedded the layers the advertising ecosystem, the only way shut down make the details public help affected parties take action," white ops white paper concluded. what know about digital advertising and fraud hese revelations provide bothersome picture the digital advertising business that highlights potential moneymaking opportunities. important revelations about digital advertising that all investors and publishers need understand include: digital advertising has become one the largest, most profitable, and fastest growing businesses the world. today's digital advertisers have good defense against fraud. even large, well-funded organizations like procter gamble, which undoubtedly have access the latest security technology, are unable cope with high level bot fraud. the level advertising fraud rising, despite the advertising industry's claims have the problem under control. bot fraud was under control, procter gamble would not cutting its digital advertising buys. advertising fraud sophisticated and well-organized criminal enterprise--as demonstrated afk. bot fraudsters are getting more sophisticated and improving their means tricking advertisers and publishers all the time. there might other bot fraud rings that are large, well organized, and well financed afk out there. some those advertising fraud organizations might have the backing or, least, the tolerance governments nations such russia. simple way such fraudsters can get government support simply bribe politicians and officials. white ops' revelations about afk's moneymaking capabilities are true, such criminals certainly have the means buy protection--even from heads state government. advertising fraud might impossible stop control the current, legal, political, technological, and regulatory environment. there appears almost complete lack transparency some segments the digital advertising market such video. even some the largest middlemen the advertising market such google and facebook, have little incentive control prevent advertising fraud. current technologies and strategies for combating advertising fraud are not working. new technologies and strategies for combating digital advertising fraud are desperately needed. many advertisers including giant corporations such proctor gamble, are longer tolerant advertising fraud. increasing number advertisers will simply stop buying specific varieties advertising rather than pay money fraudsters. large percentage advertisers are likely move their spending mediums that are perceived less vulnerable fraud such mobile. fraudsters will simply adjust their bots and strategies target those areas advertising, repeating the catastrophe video. the volume advertising fraud now large that threatens the survival entire segments advertising such video. there alternative digital advertising hese revelations should kept mind because even gigantic advertisers such procter gamble and walmart have choice but use digital advertising. people are not going back reading newspapers, listening the radio, watching broadcast television the same way again. digital entertainment, news, and information are the future for all but the very poor, the very old, and minority groups such the amish and hasidic jews. everybody else gets most their news--and much their entertainment--from the internet mobile sources today's world. any advertiser that wants reach significant number viewers will have utilize digital mediums. this reality puts those advertisers terrible bind. the market dictates that they utilize digital advertising, yet they know they will lose significant amount their investment that medium fraud. some advertisers will able avoid this pitfall short-term basis confining advertising purchases specific segments the market. for example, they might limit exposure fraud purchasing only mobile ads. mobile buys will only short-term fix because the fraudsters will simply shift their resources that medium. large, well-financed criminal organizations like afk have demonstrated that they have the technology and resources get around almost any security measure. related problem the growth social-media which appears more vulnerable advertising fraud than older digital media. major danger social media's heavy use developing nations, where legal, technological, and regulatory defenses against fraud are weak. therefore, new technological solutions will the only real means coping with digital advertising fraud. such means will have simple, easy implement, and provide high level transparency. there massive opportunity digital advertising technology most likely outcome from the advertising fraud plague increased investment advertising technology. strangely enough, such investment seems limited. venture capitalists invested billion advertising technology startups globally the silicon valley business journal and cbinsights reported. that figure was actually down from billion invested observers blamed fear alphabet and facebook, which dominate the digital advertising industry. the two companies control around all online advertising spending, june report from kleiner perkins caufield and byers estimated. venture capitalists are afraid invest money because they are afraid compete with google. such thinking very short-sighted because evidence indicates that many advertisers, including some massive spenders such procter gamble, are very dissatisfied with alphabet and facebook. p&g's exit from youtube demonstrates that wants out the facebook and alphabet duopoly. there definitely market for new advertising technologies that can provide increased levels transparency, accountability, and security. the ideal solution would solution that provides instant verification advertising views. yet the situation bad that less than ideal solutions might suffice. examples less than ideal solutions include applications that keep funds escrow until views are verified, technologies that allow users block ads, crowd-sourced fraud detection, and platforms that automatically refund money view contested. textbook example broken industry igital advertising has become textbook example "broken industry." rife with fraud, filled with disgruntled customers, dominated unpopular monopolists, and saddled with increasingly dysfunctional business model. this status quo will remind many observers newspaper and magazine advertising the back then, newspapers had monopoly small-scale advertising and abused terribly. advertisers were charged high rates based questionable fraudulent circulation figures, given few guarantees results, and often subject fraud. fraudulent practices the american newspaper industry the included counting cancelled subscriptions "circulation," paying homeless people pretend sell newspapers street corners, and refusal verify subscriptions. publishers engaged those practices order raise advertising rates--much like today's digital middlemen. there vast opportunity digital advertising for providers new technologies that can provide transparency, reduce fraud, and improve customer service. companies that provide those solutions will reap large profits from increasingly dysfunctional digital-advertising market. introducing... how adbank works dbank advertising ecosystem built upon ethereum (eth),
