www.dachcoin.live discord.dachcoin.live explorer.dachcoin.live whitepaper introduction: cryptocurrency cryptocurrency digital asset designed work medium exchange that uses strong cryptography secure financial transactions, control the creation additional units, and verify the transfer assets. cryptocurrencies are kind digital currency, virtual currency alternative currency. cryptocurrencies use decentralized control opposed centralized electronic money and central banking systems. the decentralized control each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically blockchain, that serves public financial transaction database. bitcoin, first released open-source software generally considered the first decentralized cryptocurrency. since the release bitcoin, over altcoins (alternative variants bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies) have been created. blockchain blockchain, growing list records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. blockchains which are readable the public are widely used cryptocurrencies. private blockchains have been proposed for business use. each block contains cryptographic hash the previous block, timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented merkle tree root hash). design, blockchain resistant modification the data. "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and verifiable and permanent way". for use distributed ledger, blockchain typically managed peer-to-peer network collectively adhering protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. once recorded, the data any given block cannot altered retroactively without alteration all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus the network majority. though blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may considered secure design and exemplify distributed computing system with high byzantine fault tolerance. decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with blockchain. www.dachcoin.live discord.dachcoin.live explorer.dachcoin.live blockchain was invented satoshi nakamoto serve the public transaction ledger the cryptocurrency bitcoin. the invention the blockchain for bitcoin made the first digital currency solve the double-spending problem without the need trusted authority central server. understanding proof stake (pos) system the proof stake was created alternative the proof work (pow), tackle inherent issues the latter. when transaction initiated, the transaction data fitted into block with maximum capacity megabyte, and then duplicated across multiple computers nodes the network. the nodes are the administrative body the blockchain and verify the legitimacy the transactions each block. carry out the verification step, the nodes miners would need solve computational puzzle, known the proof work problem. the first miner decrypt each block transaction problem gets rewarded with coin. once block transactions has been verified, added the blockchain, public transparent ledger. mining requires great deal computing power run different cryptographic calculations unlock the computational challenges. the computing power translates into high amount electricity and power needed for the proof work. was estimated that one bitcoin transaction required the amount electricity needed power american households per day. foot the electricity bill, miners would usually sell their awarded coins for fiat money, which would lead downward movement the price the cryptocurrency. the proof stake (pos) seeks address this issue attributing mining power the proportion coins held miner. this way, instead utilizing energy answer pow puzzles, pos miner limited mining percentage transactions that reflective his her ownership stake. for instance, miner who owns the bitcoin available can theoretically mine only the blocks. www.dachcoin.live discord.dachcoin.live explorer.dachcoin.live with pos, the attacker would need obtain the cryptocurrency carry out attack. the proof stake avoids this 'tragedy' making disadvantageous for miner with stake cryptocurrency attack the network. although would difficult and expensive accumulate reputable digital coin, miner with stake the coin would not have his best interest attack network which holds majority share. the value the cryptocurrency falls, this means that the value his holdings would also fall, and the majority stake owner would more incentivized maintain secure network. what masternode? masternode simply cryptocurrency full node computer wallet that keeps the full copy the blockchain real-time, just like your have bitcoin full nodes and always running. but masternodes are considerably different their functionality than normal nodes. they are different because they perform several other functions apart from just keeping the full blockchain and relaying blocks/transactions full node does bitcoin/litcoin. some the special functions that these nodes perform are: increasing privacy transactions- doing instant transactions participating governance and voting enable budgeting and treasury system cryptos these masternodes are not standalone but they are always communicating with other such nodes make decentralized network and are often referred short form mn. www.dachcoin.live discord.dachcoin.live explorer.dachcoin.live what does take run masternode? just like full nodes cryptocurrency, masternodes can run anyone. however, there entry barrier place ensure that the system doesn't get malicious. the entry barrier what one needs commit collateralize certain units that particular cryptocurrency run masternode. this done ensure that masternode owner doesn't cheat corrupt the system and the best doing putting this entry barrier where the masternode operator has something stake the whole game. naturally, becomes very less likely that masternode operator will cheat because has stake running the whole system and even chooses will punished the form devaluation their own hodlings. requirements for dach masternode hosting dach coins vps running linux with dedicated adress you can find our dach masternode guide under github: https://github.com/dachcoin/masternode-install www.dachcoin.live discord.dachcoin.live explorer.dachcoin.live introduction dachex platform dachex crypto tracker ultimate platform keep track crypto market and prices. has clean, user-friendly, contemporary design, awesome features and continuous updates. features that will implemented: realtime charts prices (for over cryptocurrencies) portoflio (blockfolio) where user can easily create own portfolio and track their profit featured ico's list (anns) active ico's list (anns) upcoming ico's list (anns) news updates cryptocurrencies categorisation top currencies (as filter) detailed overview page for each cryptocurrency includes twitter/facebook feeds from top crypto gurus includes all big exchanges information day/night mode beginning add different languages (english and german) watchlist banner ads management (gif/png) changelly and/or shapeshift will also implemented (api) search functions more features coming soon www.dachcoin.live discord.dachcoin.live explorer.dachcoin.live utility dach coin memberships being basic member free. accessing the platform generally free and requires registration premium members premium members have access more other options than "basic member" such banner ads management, anns (new coins), dashboard integration, more features will added along the time. premium memberships are primary available with dach and btc. paid listings dach ico's (presales) btc payments also accepted dach launched month after public (one exchange required) btc payments also accepted fast-track listings dach fast track: not guaranteed that your ico's (coin) listed same day btc payments also accepted dach fast track: dedicated day incl. twitter post btc payments also accepted www.dachcoin.live discord.dachcoin.live explorer.dachcoin.live dach specifications coin name: dach coin (dach) coin type: pos max coin supply: dach block time: minute algorithm quark premine: dach maturation time blocks min stake age hours encrypted transactions: yes mine-able: masternode collateral: dach reward distribution block height masternodes pos dach) dach) dach) dach) dach) dach) dach) dach) dach) dach) dach) dach) www.dachcoin.live discord.dachcoin.live explorer.dachcoin.live dach) dach) infinite dach) dach) important links website: https://www.dachcoin.live/ bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=. twitter: https://twitter.com/dachcoin instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dachcoin/ discord: https://discord.dachcoin.live twitter: https://twitter.com/dachcoin explorer: https://explorer.dachcoin.live/ github: https://github.com/dachcoin/dachcoin guide: https://github.com/dachcoin/masternode-install wallets: https://github.com/dachcoin/dachcoin/releases partners mnrank: https://mnrank.com/coin/dach/ mnmarketcap: https://www.mnmarketcap.com/currencies/dach pandabot: http://pandabot.fatpanda.club/ whitepaper version
