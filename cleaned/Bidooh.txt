routes advertising fall into three common categories: using traditional media/network agencies via programmatic agencies direct via publisher the industry still operates mostly relationships, telephone and email. advertisers their agencies still call find, plan and negotiate available spaces and rates. and even when booked, tracking creatives various sizes, paying for the ads and receiving invoices labour intensive. buy tokens bidooh.io this cumbersome booking, delivery and payment process results two things: advertising costs are high minimum term contracts are required typical
