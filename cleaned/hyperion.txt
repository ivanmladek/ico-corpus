the fundamental attributes blockchain technology are being leveraged profound new ways, changing how our society operates, disrupting old conventions, and creating new possibilities. these attributes present foundation for value creation; providing the potential for significant returns investment. blockchain technology provides the technological basis for the value creation most cryptocurrencies, the platforms which they are created and operate, and the networks through which they are transferred. this small hard cap has been selected optimum fund size that can responsibly managed achieve high returns. the fund grows, invictus capital will dedicate increased resources portfolio management. this will ensure that the size the fund, and duty invest responsibly, never exceeds the manpower required so. ihf the token the hyperion fund. the value the token tied directly the valuation the hyperion fund. ihf erc token based upon the ethereum blockchain. ihfs can acquired during the ihf ico, which once-time, closedend offering. cryptocurrencies are digital representations entity organization with value utility within the blockchain economy. the exchange tokens using blockchain protocols has provided new way for people exchange value with one another. these value exchanges have enabled entrepreneurs raise funding the form fiat and cryptocurrencies, providing tokens specific their projects return. operating the ethereum blockchain facilitates transparent, globally accessible ico and provides ihf token holders with simple options for transferring, storing and trading their tokens exchanges. following the ihf ico, the only way obtain ihf will directly from ihf holders exchange. further tokens will publicly sold minted invictus hyperion. this has been mediated through the development new investment protocols like simple agreements for future tokens (safts), token pre-sales and initial coin offerings (icos). these protocols have redefined and democratized early stage investing. ihf tokens issued will represent participant's share the portfolio. the total amount contributed during the offering will directly towards acquisition assets under management (aum). detailed breakdown fund utilization and token distribution available section through blockchain technology, independent investors are now able invest projects from across the globe while they are their infancy investment opportunities that, historically, were only available wealthy accredited investors and first-world venture capitalists. annual management fee collected fund managers. fees are strictly performance-based and constitute realized returns per quarter. when the fund exceeds usd the end quarter, token repurchase and burning (buyand-burns) will triggered. token buying the value returns realized each quarter will effected the open market with the acquired tokens being burnt, thus increasing the token price. buying will executed over the following quarter minimise short term impacts prices. while these developments have provided access wide array novel investment opportunities, they have also exposed people the significant risks associated with early stage investing. coupled with the proliferation icos offer, performing the necessary due diligence make informed investments has become onerous. independent investors are simply unable allocate the time, energy and mental bandwidth required understand and navigate all the new investment opportunities and the corresponding pitfalls. token holders are liberty sell exchange their tokens third parties any time. there are exit fees, broker fees advice fees imposed invictus hyperion. the fund will operate with invictus's hallmark data-driven investment methodology. predictive models and tools such the invictus titan will utilized inform the due diligence, and evaluate the potential of, investment opportunities. even though blockchain technology has transformed the early stage investment landscape, the independent investor still faces barriers. large bonuses discounts are often offered exclusively during private pre-sales investors partners with significant capital and connections the project's founders. through the power syndication, the hyperion fund, administered invictus capital, has been designed function venture fund access these private pre-sale investment opportunities. the size the hyperion fund, result the syndicated contributions made participants, anticipated produces several favourable advantages for ihf holders. firstly, the investing power the fund over that individual attracts applications from entrepreneurs seeking funding that individual would not attract alone. secondly, the size investments that the fund will able make will provide ihf fund managers with the ability engage with entrepreneurs for the purposes performing due diligence and negotiate terms investment behalf ihf token holders manner that they could not alone. the hyperion fund closed-end, tokenized venture capital fund designed provide token holders with diversified exposure the returns, and risks early stage investing the blockchain economy. hyperion will focus early stage investments blockchain technology through safts, private and public token pre-sales and icos. the fund will not invest projects that already have listed token. security extremely important and the smart contract

schwartzkopff, matthew finlayson, bobby jonker, steve williams, olubode adetunji, raymond botha and daniel schwartzkopff behalf invictus capital ceo, invictus capital abstract the hyperion fund provides investors with diversified exposure portfolio expertly-vetted early stage investments the blockchain economy through simple agreements for future token (safts), pre-sales and initial coin offerings (icos). through blockchain technology, independent investors now enjoy unprecedented global access early stage investment opportunities. however, the associated burden perform the necessary due diligence overwhelming, and public analysis tools are non-existent. furthermore, the largest pre-sale bonus structures remain out reach for many independent investors venture funds and high net-worth individuals still enjoy preferred access these investment opportunities. the hyperion fund functions syndicated venture capital fund provide independent investors access these bonuses. the fund will managed invictus capital who will perform rigorous due diligence investments, establish relationships with founders and evaluate the value proposition target projects behalf the hyperion fund. analysis projects will rely extensively data analytics employing array proprietary machine learning tools. the invictus hyperion fund token ethereum erc utility token. the value the ihf token directly represented the holdings and investments the fund. once the holdings and investments the fund has reached value usd, determined invictus capital, hyperion will buy-and-burn ihf tokens the value the returns realized quarterly. performance fee, based returns, will levied. the remaining such returns will either reinvested utilized for further buy-and-burns, depending the total size the hyperion fund. with zero annual management fees, fund managers' incentives are strongly aligned with the interests ihf token holders. ii. investor overview iii. introduction benefits holders invictus hyperion fund (ihf) tokens are clear: blockchain technology and smart contracts have drastically changed the landscape early stage investing. reports indicate that the amounts raised via icos far exceeded that early stage traditional venture capital. further, icos and token pre-sales now provide smaller, independent investors with increased degree access early stage investment opportunities across the globe. oken holders gain exposure investments private and public pre-sales, and icos that are vetted experts equipped with proprietary analysis tools (such the titan tool). yperion caters for higher risk appetites while providing access the possibility higher returns characteristic venture capital. investors should aware that risk correlated with return. usd raised icos oken holders are able trade their tokens cryptocurrency exchanges. the value ihf will affected fund performance and reductions the total token supply through repurchases and burning fund managers. $m. large fund created through syndication creates bargaining power that may leveraged invictus capital behalf token holders negotiating benefits that would otherwise unobtainable individuals. he hyperion fund team have successfully launched ico (crypto) which had one the top ico raises all time its conclusion. anticipated that this experience, network and marketing capacity will significantly increase the odds success for projects hyperion invests in. monthly hrough the fund, participants will gain increased access investing private pre-sales. cumulative fig. the amounts raised icos per month and cumulatively since january (sources: invictus capital and kornilov al) historically, early stage investing--a high risk, high reward venture--has been dominated wealthy first world venture capitalists (vcs). gain access funding, entrepreneurs were required pitch vcs who enjoyed preferential access the high rates return characteristic these investment opportunities. the changing landscape international cryptocurrency regulations, specifically regarding icos, fundraising efforts may proceed increasingly through private pre-sales often involving safts. the hyperion fund thus provides ihf holders access these raises. the hyperion fund leverages the power syndication and industry presence provide the opportunities traditional venture capital the independent investor. however, unlike traditional venture capital investment structures, returns bonus presales begin presales conclude ico begins end phase phase phase private presale private presale public presale ico concludes end phase public presale fig. generalized pre-ico and ico fundraising timeline leading the conclusion ico. bonuses offered relative ico closing price ico decrease with time (source: invictus capital) blockchain investments can realized more quickly, providing increased liquidity and turnover. this especially true for entrepreneurs countries lacking the presence angel investors and the communities they foster. the hyperion fund aims support these entrepreneurs. anticipated that the utilization data-science and machine learning tools the analysis and reporting projects along with business insights, marketing assistance and partner benefits provided invictus capital will strengthen the chances successful investment outcomes. with the large number dubious projects, scams and frauds present within the ico space, legitimate projects require partners whose investments represent more than simply financial support. investments reputed funds well-vetted projects imbue these projects with credibility, distinguishing them from amongst the rest. removing barriers facing independent investors iv. improving odds partner ico success early stage funding provided typically through private presales exchange for tokens often massively discounted price comparison the public ico price. these price discounts represent potentially high return investment (roi) following the ico. these investment opportunities are often still reserved for vcs and remain off-limits the average independent investor. invictus capital successfully launched crypto, which was the largest ico all time its conclusion. invictus capital will leverage its experience and expertise support projects invests through the hyperion fund, increasing their prospects success. further, the team behind invictus capital (the "hyperion fund team") are experienced developers, providing edge over traditional vcs when comes the evaluation projects. fig. illustrates common fundraising structure. many entrepreneurs with vision launch successful ico require several phases pre-ico funding for product development, legal expenses, negotiating and securing partnerships, and marketing expenses. invictus capital will issue thorough reports that include salient due diligence considerations for projects that chooses invest in. these reports will long way towards promoting and legitimizing project, they will distributed via well established marketing channels. professional due diligence hyperion's fund managers aim provide peace mind through professional due diligence and reporting, removing the burden from investors. invictus capital will endeavour further projects partnered with. will provide, amongst other benefits: due diligence investments will supported custombuilt machine learning analysis tools (such the titan ai) quickly narrow down investment opportunities and detect scams. public ico report direct market reach via social channels assistance listing tokens exchanges drawback the ico fundraising protocol the limited degree which investors are able engage with, and scrutinize the people they are investing in. the hyperion fund managers will act with aligned interests those ofund participants and the community engaging with pre-ico projects. introductions powerful network marketers and advisors specific geographies (korea, japan, russia, etc.) smart contract review guidance and strategy value syndication supporting blockchain visionaries the hyperion fund example syndication. through the hyperion ico, participants will effectively pool their investments create venture

attributes blockchain technology provide basis for transforming many sectors our society, such finance, communications, logistics, healthcare, entertainment and education name few. the value the improvements brought these sectors underpins the returns early stage investments blockchain technology projects. entrepreneurs will preferentially seek out funding from vcs with expertise their technological area. invictus capital, through the hyperion fund, capable understanding the potential impact projects and attracting entrepreneurs. entrepreneurs with the vision, and unique ability capitalize these attributes require financial backing and support develop their projects the stage where they can conduct successful public pre-sale and ico. knowledge that their application will

(source: invictus capital and tokendata.io) market insight via similarity and clustering completeness the founding team investor's ability navigate markets, making wise investment decisions along the way can significantly enhanced gaining high-level perspective the structure and behavior market. invictus capital has developed the titan tool that utilizes its large, and continuously growing corpus white papers gain overview the ico landscape including the trends and sub-sectors that exist within it. technical superiority the product expected time for product development buyer concentration perceived risk the market these metrics will help guide model feature construction. this tool, latent dirichlet allocation (lda) applied the text extracted from each white paper within the corpus generate set topics. each these topics has probability having certain keywords associated with it. each document then assigned mixture the topics most strongly associated with them and such can used cluster documents based their topic mix. fig. interactive document comparison similarity screen the titan tool. note that the topics are abstract concepts and the words associated with them are the words those topics are most likely contain. (source: invictus capital) fig. interactive clustering screen the titan tool, showing particular node (document) with its associated keywords (topics) (source: invictus capital) this clustering allows for the making investment decisions faster and more informed way giving the information required diversify our investments across sectors and compare projects their competitors. order accomplish this, data has been recorded regarding both the details and the performance past icos. these details include information about the team extracted from linkedin, information about the project itself from the white paper and any publicly available code repositories (including code can extract from the website directly). performance information about the ico raise size and the token's performance over time then appended the other scraped information. this information will used construct predictive models using techniques such random forest regression attempt predict how successful ico likely be. additionally, word and paragraph embedding unsupervised learning algorithms are used create vector representation each document. these vector representations can then compared each other and quantitative measure similarity established. this used ascertain the three most similar projects one chosen for research subject matter (not textual similarity the plagiarism detector although these can sometimes coincide when project highly plagiarised). these similarity scores are then used along with the topic information gained from lda create informative tree representation. the web will then continuously scraped for new ico projects and the data inputted into the predictive model. the predictions will then stored and the hyperion fund team will alerted any potentially promising icos for further investigation. predictive feature discovery and analysis the number projects available and the rate which new projects are being founded necessitates some form autonomous screening process initially review available early stage icos and flag them potentially promising projects. this flagging process will not necessity for investment and projects may even request funding directly via form. instead, this will allow for more projects surveyed than would otherwise have been possible. augmented due diligence early stage investing particularly challenging investment landscape navigate the amount information available about potential investment prospects limited. ventures are their infancy and their future performance difficult predict. however, due the huge returns investment that early stage investing offers, still attractive landscape provided caution used and extensive due diligence undertaken. additionally, many investors lack high-level market insight and simply not know which startups invest in, are even aware the existence many. both research, has been conducted the predictors success new technology companies. although this research was not conducted the ico space, there should analogous predictive features. several metrics indicating promise research are: the difficulties mentioned above are exacerbated the crypto-space where technologies and business models are new and start-ups abundant. made publicly available). when appropriate, invictus's engineers will perform simple validations the software made available (ensuring that the software does what the owners claim can do). full code reviews for many large projects will far too labour intensive perform. for this reason, are developing and curating tools give indication the code quality large projects autonomously. acutely aware the above challenges, invictus capital has decided leverage their scientists' and engineers' expertise data science and machine learning aid our experienced investors and finance professionals the early stage investing process. machine learning will used both help identify promising investment opportunities well assist with due diligence once start-up has been selected for further consideration. these tools will help our analysts make more accurate decisions and also improve scalability the fund moving forward. invictus developing tool based formal symbolic logic system known separation logic perform comprehensive static analyses bodies code. this tool based recently open-sourced project facebook known infer. while under development already capable automatically identifying many common bugs, and even violations coding conventions, number popular languages. invictus will tailor infer the ico space-- including development support for solidity review smart contracts, and support popular web technologies. plagiarism detection the massive wave interest blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has led huge investment cash inflows and correspondingly, unscrupulous businesses and scammers have entered the space attempting take advantage this inflow. there enough publicly available code for project without having first approach targets, invictus will use the outputs from the code quality tool inputs for our predictive models discussed section vii well. many cases, easy determine that these projects are not worthy investment, largely due their poor quality and hasty construction. however, occasionally these unscrupulous projects can appear high quality, often because they have plagiarized content from reputable projects. the number projects this space means that would difficult for even crypto veteran recognise plagiarism every case. development roadmap development all the features mentioned sections vii and have either begun have been completed. plagiarism detection the plagiarism detection tool has already been developed and available for public use. this concern, along with invictus's drive increase integrity the crypto-community and support the ordinary crypto-investor, that formed the impetus for the development the titan plagiarism tool. this tool analyzes ico white papers and capable identifying plagiarized content even where word substitutions and re-orderings have been used attempt obfuscate the plagiarism. market insight via similarity and clustering the market insight tools have already been developed and are publicly available. similarity trees are displayed after paper uploaded, and the clustering tool also publicly accessible. titan already contains thousands white papers its corpus, which grows automatically the community submits papers for review. the hyperion fund team has also developed tools that autonomously scrape the web for ico whitepapers update the corpus periodically. predictive feature discovery and analysis the predictive feature discovery and analysis tools are currently under development and should completed april these will internal tools not made available the public, but invictus capital will make key results produced these tools available when finalized. when pdf uploaded, pre-processed and the text extracted. the text the document then inputted hash function generate unique for duplicate detection and caching purposes. natural language processing (nlp) techniques are then used break the document into sentences and group sentences into paragraphs. each paragraph then queried against distributed elasticsearch cluster containing the corpus previously indexed white papers and candidate results are returned. the elasticsearch cluster allows for scalability and strong performance over large search-space. word frequency vectors are then constructed sentence sentence basis and cosine similarity performed between the candidate sentences and the sentences from the document being analysed. viii. investment strategy the hyperion fund will function venture capital fund and will exclusively invest early stage blockchain and cryptocurrency based projects and companies. investments will undertaken with view constructing diversified portfolio consisting holdings from wide array sectors (such currencies, platforms, finance, communication, computing, logistics, energy etc.), this strategy aims minimize risk and exposure single sector. minimum investment requirements results below certain similarity threshold are discarded and then grouped their source (origin document). additionally, these final results are cached allow for faster processing time for users querying the same document. navigate this risk early stage investing, the hyperion fund will only invest projects that satisfy list predetermined criteria. the fund will not invest projects based promising ideas alone. this tool has already been developed and will become more comprehensive over time, forming key part invictus's due diligence processes. non-exhaustive list investment requirements has been constructed capture this investment philosophy. requirements: code quality analysis cohesive team with track record achievement once team has applied for investment and due diligence process has begun, applicable invictus will request access the code that the team has produced (usually only limited items such relatively uninteresting smart contracts are resence technical and business development aptitudes within the team fig. illustration depicting the time-scales associated with investing through pre-sales and icos, and realizing the returns these investments after token lists exchanges, and later after value maturation. returns realized can reinvested new projects. (source: invictus capital) minimum viable product (mvp) indication personal commitment develop the project well-defined token vesting strategy hyperion fund managers will evaluate projects terms their originality, value proposition and potential market capitalization, differentiation from competition, and knowledge the industry application. learnings and insights from section vii, inclusive identified optimal raises and sectors, will also leveraged. risk and hedging traditional initial public offerings (ipos) are useful analogue for considering the external factors affecting the realization returns investments icos. ipo prices shares are set through extended processes due diligence and thorough analyses the existing business. these prices, however, can also heavily influenced prevailing market conditions. peer benchmark valuations frequently serve key determinants ipo prices. these prices are typically highest when equities are overpriced, which happens times optimism irrational exuberance. the application form shown appendix will used source and filter potential projects. investment horizon many early stage investments are structured such that the purchased tokens vest over time. these cases, there minimum commitment term based when assets can sold and returns realized. this, together with strategies aiming realize long term growth, define the investment horizon. typical vesting structures range between three months and one year. the analogy relevant, but not entirely appropriate given that ipos are conducted for established businesses and that tokens not represent shares company. the ico landscape characterized offerings tokens related the value proposition significantly younger entities that often simply possess mvp. the hyperion fund will view each exchange listing key opportunity for the realization return. the magnitude realization will naturally depend the investment strategy and whether the listing fact the optimal time liquidate. consequently, token valuations rely far more heavily projections than ipos do. returns investments contingent the token exchange prices are highly subject market behavior the short and medium terms. crucial consider that the tokens' prices offered during icos, and the number tokens minted over project's lifetime, are often predetermined. the market capitalizations that can calculated from these inputs provide initial, and highly speculative valuations projects. these valuations must carefully considered before any investments presales icos are made. the past, early investors with the ability contribute significantly have occasionally used exchange listings too aggressively and liquidated large volumes tokens, thus causing severe negative price actions. changes vesting procedures and other strategies are, however, mitigating these outcomes. the nature the technology and distribution agreements also help ensuring that the interests all parties are catered for. for many projects highly unlikely that these initial valuations will realized. these cases, the token's values will eventually decline below the purchase price ico. syndication creates the opportunity communicate investment goals, ensuring the token distribution and listing processes align with the fund's investment horizon objectives. providing enough vesting tokens recover the initial investment first listing will priority. this however does not preclude the holding assets longer term partnerships with projects depending their fundamentals and the initial strategy the investment. long term involvement would based deeper partnering way support and advisory services, increasing the odds future success. favourable market conditions the time ico will likely have positive effects the project's speculative valuation. however, given the timeframe over which investments mature prudent plan for changes market conditions, given their influence token pricing. the strategies developed should not seek predict the market any way, but rather, establish convex payoff whereby the downside associated with market risk mitigated but upside unlimited. the diagram below provides example potential exit strategies. initial realization return may take place exchange listing, which may full partial. realizing returns investing the management market risk associated with presales and ico investments priority, but more directly and immediately relevant the risk associated with the uninvested funds held liquid cryptocurrencies. method for the management this risk could the utilization contingent claims. contingent claims are contracts whose payoff determined the occurrence future event. call options are common examples finance where the purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, purchase stock

option price the expected value the payoff discounted from the future date the present the risk free rate (usually referencing treasury bills). the pricing options non-trivial and employs advanced

increase its product offering beyond bitcoin futures. the fund therefore will seek, far possible, accept only upside exposure the market and buy protection against possible adverse actions. for example, hedging market downside risk could accomplished selling futures. this however does not limit the losses the market moves upward. the approach could instead move the utilization options which limit loss the option price and deliver exposure the upside. options are appropriate strategy under extreme movements. call and put options cryptocurrencies cryptocurrency indices are likely become

accounts the ihf ico and certain und administration, from user's perspective, will enabled through custom smart contract that adheres the erc standard. this ensures that token ownership and transfer tokens transparent and immutable. all exchange accounts are secured two factor authentication and email verifications for any withdrawals. trades will executed over multiple exchanges varying times mitigate the risk front-running once funds are moved from cold storage. the smart contract enforces ico period specifying end block that restricts the minting tokens occur only within pre-defined period. this guarantees that the fund closed-end. dilutive token allocation (for invictus capital and the hyperion fund team, see section pre-defined code and verifiable all parties. hardware wallets ledger nano hardware wallets will used for the storage all supported cryptocurrencies. for all cryptocurrencies not supported, encrypted storage drives will utilized. these storage devices will held secure safe deposit boxes with back-up paper-wallets, which are engraved brass plates, and also stored secure location. locations are undisclosed due security considerations. reasons for choosing the ethereum blockchain: ecurity and predictability (as opposed to, for example, having run separate blockchain), well-established codebase and development tools, xiv. asset transparency igher liquidity easier listing exchanges with infrastructure already place, and the fund aims have minimum funds invested any given time, with liquid funds and returns retained pool, split between the most supported currency pairs, such btc and eth, and cash usd. this provides increased stability and liquidity and easily facilitates further investment the majority icos accept the most supported coins. heavy bear markets, fund managers will aim open leveraged short positions the most supported currency pairs reduce the drawdown holding btc and eth the liquidity pool. llows for real time tracking token-holders. see section and xiv for more information. addition the custom erc compliant contract, there vesting contract that locks invictus capital and the hyperion fund team's tokens for years with vesting periods every months. this aligns the hyperion fund team and invictus capital with token holders. the contract utilized slightly modified version the crypto vesting contract which can viewed etherscan. transparency hyperion's holdings will enabled through the use view-only wallet addresses. where possible, this enables investors view real-time holdings the hyperion fund. for investments projects pre-ico invictus capital will disclose the name the project and the amount invested. invictus hyperion reserves the right terminate the hyperion fund. the event that the fund scales down closes, this will announced advance and blockchain snapshot token holdings will taken the following quarter. all fund holdings amount specified will then liquidated for eth, the sum total which will dispersed token holders shown the snapshot accordance with their percentage share the fund. due diligence reports and the fund's holdings will published soon the project has appropriate publicfacing presence and the token listed exchange with verifiable market value. xiii. security proof ownership crypto-assets easily fulfilled through the use public blockchain explorer and public key cryptography. the hyperion fund team will sign verifiable message, send token transfer, prove control particular address. this address can then seen blockchain explorer observe the stated holdings. general control environment invictus capital has implemented security industry best practices for defense against sybil attacks and bad actors. strong identity verification and authentication procedures are place ensure secure operations. this real-time viewership ensures transparency without compromising the integrity the fund. the hyperion fund does not actively trade follow deterministic fund strategy this means that the fund not significant risk frontrunning market manipulation, and traditional obfuscation trades and transfers will further mitigate either those risks. invictus capital also implements risk-based approach segregation duties. this includes internal controls which ensure that more than one person required complete critical tasks. this intends prevent fraud and error potentially impacting the fund's performance. invictus capital has previously, and successfully, launched ico (crypto) that has had its holdings and security verified third party auditor (kpmg). the smart contract and cyber-security were also externally audited. security breaches occurred during the ico, date. the hyperion fund team will continue enforce best practices for security. xv. marketing and investor relations the hyperion fund team will invest significant time and effort into post-ico marketing targeted towards potential ihf investors the traditional financial sector via the production information sheets, explainer videos and planning documents that are easily understandable. token holders will able view detailed information their holdings and portfolio composition the invictus capital website. invictus capital will focus marketing efforts solely non-regulated cold storage all currencies will stored cold wallets within secure vault together with the safts. the vault independently managed with secure access pre-registered representatives, and pre-arranged times only. the location the cold storage vault not disclosed for security purposes. withdrawals and markets. promotion and solicitation will limited where participation forbidden likely forbidden the near future, order remain compliant with local legislation. cryptocurrencies and the exposure safts intangible assets opposed financial instruments. initial recognition will recorded cost; subsequent measurement can cost fair value, less amortization (amortization will only calculated when the assets have finite life). tokens traded exchange will reported fair value. safts will reported cost less any recognized impairment value. all fair value gains will taken through other comprehensive income whilst losses will taken through the profit and loss and there will need for amortization described above. xvi. accounting and reporting accounting standards for cryptocurrencies remain unclear. the international accounting standards board (iasb) will either create new standard change existing standards address accounting for investments intangible assets, including digital currencies. they are known set standards based successful businesses leading the way how account for their investments, for example the case commodity broker-traders. the iasb may take years develop and implement new standard. treatment impaired assets the end each reporting period, entity required assess whether there any indication that asset may impaired (i.e. its carrying amount may higher than its recoverable amount). ias has list external and internal indicators impairment. there indication that asset may impaired, then the asset's recoverable amount must calculated. relevant reporting standards ias (intangible assets) due the nature cryptocurrencies and the volatility associated with the these assets, annual assessments will not sufficient. invictus capital will therefore hold regular investment committee meetings assess each asset and identify any possible indicators impairment. investments will only impaired the event that invictus capital has determined, with confidence, that return will not realized the investment such the ico being hacked, funds being lost during ico, and the ico being cancelled. ias intangible assets outlines the accounting requirements for intangible assets, which are non-monetary assets which are without physical substance and identifiable (either being separable arising from contractual other legal rights). intangible assets meeting the relevant recognition criteria are initially measured cost, subsequently measured cost using the revaluation model, and amortized systematic basis over their useful lives (unless the asset has indefinite useful life, which case not amortized). invictus hyperion will report via the following mechanisms: ifrs (financial instruments) fund nav will updated the fund website, comprising live market data for market traded assets and investments cost safts, less any impairment value recognized the investment committee. ifrs specifies how entity should classify and measure financial assets, financial liabilities, and some contracts buy sell non-financial items. requires entity recognize financial asset financial liability its statement financial position when becomes party the contractual provisions the instrument. uarterly reports will include information governmental risk and legislation, risk/return analysis and portfolio performance. initial recognition, entity measures financial asset financial liability its fair value plus minus, the case financial asset financial liability not fair value through profit loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable the acquisition issue the financial asset the financial liability. annual reports will made available the investor portal the invictus capital website comprising: >>>> statement financial position the end the period. >>>> tatement profit loss and other comprehensive income for the period. >>>> ummary significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. ias (impairment assets) ias impairment assets seeks ensure that entity's assets are not carried more than their recoverable amount (i.e. the higher fair value less costs disposal and value use). xvii. fund timeline private ico (whitelisted individuals) april public ico (open all) may with the exception goodwill and certain intangible assets for which annual impairment test required, entities are required conduct impairment tests where there indication impairment asset. the test may conducted for 'cash-generating unit' where asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent those from other assets. end ico (should ico not sell out previous phases) may first investments june end first quarter august xviii. conclusion ifrs (fair value measurement) the hyperion fund tokenized, closed-end fund focused early stage investment projects involving blockchain technology. the fund provides investors with diversified exposure the high returns and risks characteristic these opportunities. ifrs fair value measurement applies ifrss that require permit fair value measurements disclosures and provides single ifrs framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurement. the standard defines fair value the basis 'exit price' notion and uses 'fair value hierarchy', which results market-based, rather than entity-specific, measurement. invictus capital administers the fund, utilizing
