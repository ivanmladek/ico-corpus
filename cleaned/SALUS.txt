alus consortium brief overview salus interoperability approach scalable, standard based interoperability framework for sustainable proactive post market safety studies executive summary pre-approval clinical trials cannot guarantee that drugs will not have serious side effects after they are marketed. post-approval drug safety data studies aim address this problem, however, their effectiveness started discussed especially after recent examples drug withdrawals. this due the fact that, current post market safety studies largely depend the submission spontaneous case reports where underreporting major problem. the need for more proactive approach apparent, where safety data from multiple sources are actively monitored, linked and analyzed. effective integration and utilization electronic health records (ehr) can help improve post-market safety activities proactive basis. salus aims facilitate this through providing functional interoperability profiles and supporting open source toolsets enabling ehr systems and clinical research systems communicate and exchange ehr data; implementing semantic interoperability solutions enabling meaningful interpretation the exchanged ehr data; implementing security and privacy mechanisms and open source toolsets ensuring that clinical information shared ethical and safe way and providing novel exploratory analysis framework for open-ended temporal pattern discovery for safety studies top disparate, distributed, heterogeneous ehr systems. www.salusproject.eu white aper ublished alus consortium brief overview salus interoperability approach introduction salus aims create the necessary semantic interoperability infrastructure enable secondary use ehr data efficient and effective way for enabling pro-active post market safety studies addressing the need for more effective post market surveillance methods the process approving pharmaceutical agents for use humans usually hinges establishing the efficacy the agent. this usually achieved through appropriately designed and rigorously analyzed randomized clinical trials. whilst certain safety aspects are established though the evaluation the development program ranging from animal studies dedicated large trials, for most approved agents however, there are limited data for ensuring the safety the product approval. these include, for example, the risk rare events which are not identified the clinical trials due their limited size, delayed effects the drug due the limited duration the trials. furthermore, clinical trials usually have exclusion criteria, e.g. the elderly pregnant women and therefore there are little data certain groups available prior approval, but who may ultimately use the agent. moreover, the pattern drug use clinical trials may not necessarily reflect the real-world use once the drug reaches the population and therefore may impact safety. for these reasons, while pre-market safety analysis through clinical trials remains vital, there considerable attention towards improving the reporting and collection post-market data. current post-market safety surveillance and reporting activities are largely based reports suspected adverse drug reactions sent the regulatory bodies medical professionals, and some countries patients themselves. while spontaneous reporting remains cornerstone pharmacovigilance the regulator environment and indispensable for signal detection, recent examples drug withdrawals due uncommon adverse events after millions patients were exposed, the need for more effective and proactive surveillance reinforced. one the main problems the current drug surveillance system underreporting: has been estimated that only around adverse drug events (ades) are reported through spontaneous reporting. this partially due fact that overloaded medical personnel not always see reporting priority. another issue that detecting adverse events may not always straightforward, hence can overlooked. also, not possible estimate the number patients taking drug from spontaneous reports, they not readily enable the quantification any risk. therefore the benefit-risk profile the product cannot determined. evident that whilst more proactive post market surveillance methods are needed, they should not create additional burden for the health care provider the patient.

believes that effective integration and utilization electronic health record (ehr) data can help improve post-market safety activities and will result in: strengthening the spontaneous reporting process automated ade detection and reporting tools screening ehrs hospital that ade reporting burden can overcome within clinical institute. this can increase data accuracy eliminates manual screening clinical care data for identifying ades. enabling ade reporting extracting the available information from the ehrs into the individual case safety reports avoid double data entry. this facilitates delivering timely feedback the regulatory bodies via automatic ehr supported adverse event reporting. strengthening the current signal detection processes pharmacovigilance centers for tracing case reports their corresponding patient records allow actual incidence rates computed, and provide additional information extended parts the underlying medical history the patient. enabling real time screening multiple, distributed, heterogeneous ehrs for early detection ade signals. this facilitates proactive safety monitoring complementary approach reactive signal detection based spontaneous reports. enabling sustainable and scalable ehr data re-use facilitating wide scale outcome and health effectiveness research, able observe selected cohorts patients over extended period time screening multiple, distributed, heterogeneous ehr systems another important advantage ehr data that they offer the potential for quantification and contextualization any risk though safety studies and therefore help determine the benefit-risk profile the drug, which ultimately determines the use the drug population. facilitate these wide scale proactive post market safety studies, there need for new capacity enabling access the data locked multiple different heterogonous ehr systems: interoperability architecture. this interoperability architecture should enable execution proactive post market surveillance studies the pharmaceutical companies and regulatory bodies cooperation with the heterogeneous, distributed ehr systems. salus project, r&d project co-financed the european commission's framework programme (fp), aims create the necessary semantic and functional interoperability infrastructure enable secondary use ehr data efficient and effective way for reinforcing the post market safety studies, addressing the challenges that are presented above. salus project, scalable, standard based interoperability framework for sustainable pro-active post market safety studies, http://www.salusproject.eu www.salusproject.eu white aper ublished alus consortium brief overview salus interoperability approach salus interoperability architecture one the first challenges address achieving syntactic and functional interoperability between ehr systems and clinical research systems. salus, our approach provide functional interoperability profiles and open source tools query ehr data for ade identification, ade reporting and signal followup studies and sub-scribe clinical data for selected cohort patients for signal detection and outcome research over distributed ehrs. these interoperability profiles aim enable the ehr systems and clinical research systems used for running post market safety studies communicate and exchange data. order enable the collaborating systems interpret the queries and the resulting clinical data exchanged meaningfully and accurately for producing useful results, there need for semantic interoperability layer built upon these functional interoperability profiles. one the first pre-requisites for such semantic interoperability architecture have common core data set interest data analysis tools used for post marketing safety studies. the role salus semantic interoperability framework semantically mediating the clinical data represented through syntactically different but semantically equivalent ehr content models one another, making use the core set common data elements the common denominator. this facilitated through ontological framework. the following subsections, will further analyze the need for functional and semantic interoperability solutions for enabling post market safety studies top ehrs, and present salus approach realize these. providing functional interoperability profiles between ehr systems and clinical research systems enabling proactive post market safety studies achieving syntactic and functional interoperability between the ehr systems and clinical research the necessary condition for further enabling semantic interoperability. the requirements for syntactic and functional interoperability profiles for enabling proactive post market safety studies can summarized follows: different rule based intelligent data analysis algorithms can plugged top available ehrs detect ades checking the administered drugs, laboratory test results, vital signs, findings and diagnoses and report them the medical practitioners order facilitate detection and reporting ades. standard based protocols are needed specify the data screened machine processable manner, feed these data the intelligent data analysis algorithms, and send the suspected ade list back the medical practitioners seamlessly within ehr session. this way will much easier integrate several different ade detection tools with heterogeneous ehr systems order conduct scalable distributed post market safety studies. upon detection such ades through these enabling mechanisms, confirmed the physician, these should reported regulatory bodies through standard based individual case safety reports. most the data that needs reported within these case reports are mostly available the ehrs. order avoid duplication effort fill these data the case safety reports once again manually, there need for interoperability profiles fill these standard based forms www.salusproject.eu white aper ublished alus consortium brief overview salus interoperability approach extracting the required information from the underlying ehr system, and sending the completed forms the respective regulatory bodies. figure how salus extends current spontaneous reporting system seamlessly exploit the already existing clinical data ehrs spontaneous reports only report the ade events. the information related the percentage other patients who used the drug but not experienced ades, i.e. the denominator data, missing. top that, these reports may fail take into account important information about the patient such underlying medical conditions and co-medication. ideal system for adverse drug reaction surveillance would combine the strength case reports with those ehrs. standard interfaces are needed for tracing case reports their corresponding patient records, query the ehrs enable absolute reporting rates computed, and retrieve additional information extended parts the underlying medical history the patient.

surveillance electronic patient records, pharmacovigilance review, volume number february www.salusproject.eu white aper ublished alus consortium brief overview salus interoperability approach strengthening available spontaneous reporting will already step forward for post marketing safety studies. however, order realize near-real time proactive post market safety studies, there needs mechanism for screening the available heterogeneous and disparate ehrs for specified time period for adverse event signal detection and also for conducting observational studies for validation the suspected signals and for carrying out outcome research see long term effects drugs. there need for machine processable mechanism identify the target patient population for eligibility checking and the details the clinical data collected, together with exchange mechanism feed the pseudonymized patient data common registry. syntactic and functional interoperability can achieved and when two more systems are capable communicating and exchanging data specifying communication protocols and data formats. for addressing the requirements the proactive post market safety studies summarized above, there need for standardized interfaces between ehr systems and clinical research systems: specify the eligibility criteria select the patients for the specific post market safety study specify the clinical data requested intelligent data analysis tool (ade detection/signal detection/outcome research) fed clinical data registry for the selected group patients transfer the specified clinical data the clinical data registries for the selected patients query the underlying ehrs support follow-up studies for signal detection query the underlying ehrs fill the ade reports after ade detected define such standardized interfaces, the salus project will follow "profiling" approach. the profile concept aims eliminate the need for bilateral agreement between any two information exchange partners defining standard set messages/documents, choreographies, business rules and constraints. analyzing the selected use case scenarios the required transactions will determined, and for each them, the best suitable standards for enabling these transactions will chosen. salus functional interoperability profiles will based the available initiatives for achieving syntactic interoperability for re-use

interoperability approach providing semantic interoperability framework enabling proactive post market safety studies beyond the ability two more computer systems exchange information through addressing syntactic and functional interoperability requirements, semantic interoperability needed automatically interpret the information exchanged meaningfully and accurately order produce useful results semantic interoperability prerequisite for enabling secondary use ehr data post market safety studies that clinical data consistently captured from the ehr systems and analyzed intelligent data analysis algorithms. the need for semantic interoperability between clinical research and clinical care systems may stem from the following facts: clinical statements may represented through different reference and domain information models, like rim and cda, cen/iso part (e.g. reference model plus archetypes/templates, patient mandate) cdisc odm/sdtm. cdisc non-profit organization that develops standards covering almost all the steps within regulated clinical research study including study design (sdm), study data collection (odm and cdash), study data analysis (adam) and submission the regulatory bodies (sdtm). although the same information model selected, consider for example cda, the same clinical information can represented through different compositional aggregation clinical statements. address this problem, these information models could restricted more through cda templates cen/iso archetypes cdisc odms based selected cdash data sets. content models based one more these possibilities can created. yet, the content models used clinical research and care domains usually differ. although the same content model (template/archetype) chosen, clinical statements may represented using coded terms from different terminology systems. reasons for semantic mismatch: different reference information models -different templates -different coding systems address these problems, semantic interoperability framework should not only handle the structural mappings two different information models, but also resolve the semantic mismatches due the use different terminology systems and different compositional aggregations represent the same clinical concept differently even when single information model used. werner ceusters barry smith, semantic

www.salusproject.eu white aper ublished alus consortium brief overview salus interoperability approach order able detect such semantic similarities, there needs common harmonized ontology that represents the semantics reference information models, templates, archetypes and the terminology systems used. salus interoperability framework aim provide tools create and maintain such harmonized ontology linked set ontologies, and also provide the semantic mediators that run top this harmonized model map message payloads represented one content profile another cooperation with terminology servers. salus common harmonized ontology aimed act common denominator for exchanging clinical data required for proactive post market patient safety studies between clinical care and research systems. this ontology shall based the already existing standards used clinical care and research domains and the already existing data sets. able create this common harmonized ontology systematic and scalable way serve the needs salus use cases, the following activities are aimed carried out based our methodology: identifying the clinical information requirements the selected salus use cases and the related transactions enabling safety research. for this, aim agree and design content models the message payloads exchanged based the prominent clinical data exchange standards used clinical care and research domains (such cdisc odm models, cda templates, cen/iso archetypes). there important initiative this respect, namely the intended cen/iso semantic interoperability artefact modeling standard (siams) siams approach provides generic, neutral, standard approach for defining models use which not specific cen/iso openehr cda syntax. this generic model use can translated into archetypes, openehr archetypes hlv cda based content templates when necessary. aim develop generic editor for clinical information models (cims) for defining models use, which then can translated different standards like cda, cdisc odm and cen/iso based these information requirements expressed content models, identifying the core common data element (cde) set meaningful fragments/building blocks used create such content models. will provide necessary tools create, select, adapt and manage the cdes this core data set conformance iso/iec standard for metadata registries. building harmonized patient safety study ontology top this core cde set. this evolving ontology will act common semantic dictionary the clinical terms exchanged between ehr systems and clinical research systems. supporting ontology fragments from domain specific ontologies (such drug ontologies, specific disease ontologies) should also added this common ontology providing the necessary semantic interlinkages between these ontology fragments. should also cover the related fragments the terminologies used clinical care and research domains like meddra, loinc, atc, snomed ct, icd-, whodd. salus

consortium brief overview salus interoperability approach top this harmonized ontology, salus semantic mediation framework aims enable the underlying clinical research and clinical care systems communicate through their already existing domain information models. for this, support two complementary approaches: complementary semantic interoperability support for clinical care and research systems that have varying levels semantic awareness enable the clinical research and clinical care systems communicate via the functional interoperability profiles exchanging message payloads conformance the specified content models. this way, they become able communicate through the existing well accepted standards they choose like archetypes, cda templates and cdisc odm models. salus provides tools semantically mediate these semantically similar but syntactically different content models one another exploiting the harmonized salus ontology. enable the development semantic interfaces top their existing proprietary systems that will enable the ehrs and clinical research systems communicate directly through the harmonized salus semantic model. for this, aim develop wrappers translate these semantic interfaces enabled through semantic query languages like sparql the native interfaces supported the available systems, like sql. expected results early salus results are already available from: http://www.salusproject.eu the salus project will foster integration clinical care information from ehrs into clinical research systems enable proactive post-marketing safety studies for early detection potential safety issues. such environment will increase data availability and data accuracy for the clinical research community; reduce time spent data entry for filling individual case safety reports seamlessly retrieving data from ehrs; support wide scale longitudinal observational studies enabling access clinical care data stored multiple distributed ehr systems; decrease the time detect the adverse drug events, access distributed ehr systems will drastically increase the scale the safety studies; and facilitate participation greater number clinicians
