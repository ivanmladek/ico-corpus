development financial and information technology, the current financial system provides many uncomfortable and insufficient services developed countries while having many deficiencies service developing countries. despite the developments over the past several decades, third the global population not still using mainstream finance. the remaining two-thirds those using mainstream financing are also getting services with payment expensive cost. financial institutions are using centralized ledger method that monopolize and manage all financial information centrally. has structural problems which make financial management costs increase such information security, expensive hardware purchase costs, branch and personnel maintenance costs financial institutions are demanding more excessive costs consumers those reasons. some banks, well remittance and exchange fees, are charged for opening and using bank accounts, and they even ask for the inconvenience depositing certain amount. furthermore, the high financial expense that pay used maximize its own benefits the current financial system. the result, causes the widening gap between the rich and the poor financial services along with decline quality life. the ongoing existing financial policy has accelerated the problem, and the public complaining about traditional financial institutions. result financial exclusion, consumers are suffering from high risks and fees relying cash and non-financial markets. the current financial system has made the financial exclusion rely this path well weakened the ability monitor the amount income and expenditure government. the appearance many cryptographic currencies has given hope the underprivileged who have not received financial services. but, there problem that the basis cryptocurrency transactions based real money. generally, when you want purchase cryptocurrency from exchange site, you must send the real currency the bank account the exchange, the escrow account the account the cryptocurrency holder. there high barrier that people excluded from financial services need bank account again trade cryptocurrency. many companies want realize the purpose providing new financial services with existing structures, modules, infrastructure and technology. however, the current developments and the results obtained the financial science's technologies and the comprehensive financial policy are already limited. blockchain the block chain financial ecosystem can not realized traditional finance. the block chain technology can escaped from the problems the centralized financial system and this new distributed finance will meet the principle fairness the financial affairs. also stimulates the real economy and provide encouraging service the virtual economy. new financial ecosystems based block chains can solve long-standing problems such systemic risk, data security, financial exclusion and fragile competition. the decentralized ledger technology and transparent system cryptocurrency allows create new financial tools and processed with decentralization global boundary. they can also provide services and empower individuals and companies around the world. however, despite blockchain and cryptocurrency users are making lot efforts create new ecosystem addition these advantage, they don't still use blockchain cryptocurrency real life easily. there reason that cryptocurrency itself evolving new industry. however, the more fundamental reason that most blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies have unfitted two defects daily life. the first defect the transmission speed. real-time high transmission speed critical order use cryptocurrencies payment means. however, very inconvenient takes least minutes use representative cryptocurrencies such bitcoin and ethereum for paying shops for transmitting between users. the second defect the high transmission fee. transmission fee for bitcoin and for ethereum. may not big problem when transmitting big amount. however, case paying remitting small amount such daily life, the transmission fee big problem make users hesitate use. after all, this brings into scalability. many cryptocurrencies are trying solve these problems. however, due the increasing block size more and more, the solution has not been found yet. intro our goal very simple. the first, creating unrestricted financial system, make everyone the world can received the benefits financial services for free. the second, everyone the world get out the existing financial framework and will able open and use new financial accounts free charge. and fiat currency, cryptocurrency and digital currency are exchanged one another conveniently. achieve this goal, have designed system that allows everyone around the world conduct transaction smart consultations and manage their funds social connections through vast array combined projects. this provide new financial platform for the financially excluded persons the current financial system combining the electronic monetary system based the real economy with the versatility cryptocurrency. also, this create new cryptocurrency's financial system securing the value stability the cryptocurrency and then overcoming the constraints the existing financing the currency the real financial service. introduce aaron platform aaron platform has redefined financial services and transformed its financial paradigm from strictly rated and exclusively centralized system tradition decentralized comprehensive and scalable system. the aaron platform proposes new financial platform that combines stable coin with fluid value coin way overcome the inconvenience caused blockchain speed and the disadvantage high variability cryptocurrency. stable currency and fluid value currency are structured multi-block chains, ensures not only the value stability real financial services currency but also the security and scalability cryptocurrency. our multi-block chain method can offset the variability cryptocurrency through the combination flexible main block chains, fixed value side block chains and echo block chains applicable various digital assets. [diagram ..] the characteristic aaron blockchain this supported using multi blockchain technology, which combination mainchain everycoin, sidechain tabipay, and other ecochains each other. everycoin the aaron platform takes the everycoin standard and adjusts the everycoin deposit amount according the issued volume(the circulation amount) tabipay and other eco-chain. the market, the value changes the equilibrium price demand and supply accordance with everycoin's circulation amount's change. everycoin used the main blockchain aaron platform guarantees tabipay like gold. and used key currency enabling exchange all fiat currency, cryptocurrency and digital currency aaron currency matching engine. tabipay for financially excluded persons, build stable currency blockchain, tabipay blockchain and let them create and use tabipay safety accounts free charge. the tabipay account independent security account tabipay blockchain, not existing financial company account. system that anyone who does not have bank account can freely deposit and withdraw money. instead going bank and opening account there like now, people visit nearby tabipay shop (convenience stores, pawn shops, supermarkets, etc.) our affiliates and will open tabipay safety account which makes deposits and withdrawals convenient real time. addition, you can transfer for days and hours via tabipay app real time. tabipay was developed change the finance the real economy, not the standard currency for exchanging cryptocurrency like usdt, trueusd, and dai which are linked usd. tabipay, used tabipay blockchain, stablecoin, and has value with thai baht. tabipay guaranteed paid because issued much the everycoin reserve aaron platform like the previous gold standard(everycoin standard), customer's deposit will deposited full cash and escrowed and verified through cooperation with partner bank thailand. tabipay currency created apply the cryptocurrency the real economy, and issued stable value's global electronic currency cooperation with the central bank. will stimulate the local economy more and expand the boundary potential influence the aaron platform. with this tabipay system, can complete new currency value system building hub real economy and cryptocurrency. name cryptocurrency tether trueusd dai tabipay operator tether truecoin market participants aaron system standard usd usd usd thb abbreviation usdt tusd dai tabi deposit can not confirmed deposit can confirmed market volume (ten thousand) daily trading volume (ten thousand) characteristic (forecast (forecast everycoin standard, set deposits with deposit can automatic agreements confirmed [diagram ..] comparison stable coin eco-chain ethereum has created cryptocurrency ecosystem creating platform for generating tokens based smart contract technology. the eco-chain system the aaron platform provides ecosystem that can utilize blockchain not only the generation tokens but also digital assets other than cryptocurrency evolving one step further ethereum technology. addition cryptography, there are many digital assets around us. airline mileage for faithful customers' loyalty marketing, online shopping mall points, cafe coupon system, game money and game items game companies can also safe and convenient digital assets using blockchain. the global digital asset market about billion and expanding rapidly every year. the eco-chain system provides services that can manage and issue digital assets easily all companies and individuals issuing digital assets based blockchain. provides services that can issue and manage digital asset management system with low cost. with the eco-chain system, digital assets can easily issued and circulated. you will able realize benefits such secure transactions, value increases and exchange with other currencies. addition, these eco chains will become everycoin's sidechain, they will increase the value and usability everycoin. cryptocurrency exchange the aaron platform includes the aaron cryptocurrency exchange. aaron exchange expected open march based the "digital asset business act" established thailand global exchange market that can deal with various kinds cryptocurrencies. aaron exchange will serve you the market everycoin and tabipay standard. the everycoin and tabipay standard markets are served tabipay and everycoin main-based currency like bitcoin, ethereum, usdt. the aaron platform serves achieve double effects supporting both safe transactions using tabipay's stable value characteristics via tabipay everycoin standard and transactions that can realize revenue the value everycoin rises. also enables find potential coins among the eco-chain's cryptocurrencies created the eco-chain system and trade them the aaron exchange. the cryptocurrencies the echo chain that traded the aaron exchange becomes everycoin's sidechain, that they can get the partnership that everycoin and echo chains can develop together. these traded cryptocurrencies can withdrawn worldwide. the aaron exchange will make possible withdraw money the currency each country the world along with the withdrawal the cryptocurrency the withdrawal transaction. wallet the aaron wallet provided the aaron platform allows you manage real accounts and crptocurrency wallets well integrate digital money. furthermore, provides right access the decentralized cards integrated into this account. addition, will provide more effective services working together with existing global financial services via partnerships with global payment cards. aaron platform will create new financial ecosystem acquiring the permission the securities and exchange commission (sec) thai government and obtaining the authority the real money market though partnership with commercial banks. tabipay global financial account based block chain that monitored and managed accordance with thailand's law. available for all individuals and companies use real time and does not require any address credit history thailand the aaron platform made combination creative ideas and variety technologies. order provide financial account that can used people all over the world and make mutual exchange possible for all fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies with our everycoin and tabipay. aaron platform built under these technologies and ideas free low financial account cost and easy use with security. this white paper describes the problems have found, the aaron platform's solutions and our implementation plan. want deliver legitimate information regarding the broad technical details seek. characteristic blockchain encrypted electronic currency although cryptocurrency accepted the stage investment and speculation, cryptocurrency also has technical value other than monetary value. generally, bitcoin and ethereum have monetary value that you can pay, but you can not define cryptocurrency only virtual currency like bitcoin and ethereum. the electronic money used the real economy made based block chain, will recognized currency because develops security and reliability more than existing electronic money. therefore, electronic money made based cryptocurrency technology, can used more widely than common currencies well bitcoin and ethereum. [diagram the type digital cryptocurrency blockchain method the block chain public block chain such bitcoin and ethereum that anyone can participate in, and private block chain which only limited persons participate. the field industry's attention the private block chain. public block chain technology, which anyone can participate in, not only undifferentiated but also has vague profit model when applied the industrial sector. the most notable private block chain the early years the rcev (global block chain consortium). sharing all internal bank transactions, rcev aims eliminate minimize intermediary roles such clearinghouses represented swift. since the clearinghouse intermediary that keeps and guarantees records transactions between banks, there have been risks from the bank's viewpoints such the brokerage cost and the centralization transaction records. however, blockchain technology can solve this problem storing transaction records decentralized fashion. other words, the transaction records and banks are also distributed and recorded other banks that they can trust transactions between and banks. big global banks such bank america, deutsche bank and hsbc jointly established company called rcev for this business and developed private block chain. rcev has introduced block-chain platform called corda and the test process for its commercialization. the hyperledger, block-chain research consortium led the linux foundation(r), also growing fast. the early hyperledger projects were led companies such ibm, intel and financial companies and finance companies like morgan. however, recently, massive manufacturing companies such airbus and daimler well logistics companies like american express, are actively participating the hyperledger project. private block chains are not easy commercialize. block-chain technology structure that gains confidence data and services managing data decentralization. the greater the number participants, the higher the reliability. however, the private block chain has the disadvantage that difficult obtain participants decentralize the data service and process unless federation like rcev. for example, company building private block chain, needs find number third-party companies that will decentralize and store the data. result, more famous companies are planning cryptocurrencies business based public block chain. from the second half cryptocurrencies that support various businesses have begun emerge. and, january several global corporations are preparing keeping their cryptocurrency business mind. aaron system everycoin mainchain the aaron blockchain consists several sidechains attached one mainchain and differs from the traditional single chain system. "branch ecosystem" that the mainchain acts the backbone the system and connecting multiple sidechains(differentiation into multiple layers). [diagram intro aaron system all sidechains aaron can linked few sub-chains and then they can also linked with role performance mainchain one area the system. like this, aaron blockchain creates branch structures the system that can expanded horizontally and vertically. the aaron mainchain block chain operated the aaron os, which the backbone the entire system. consisted sidechain index system, token system and ddpos agreement protocol. the sidechain index system connects all the chains within the aaron ecosystem. the internal sidechain operated aaron contributes the capital environment the aaron system using aaron tokens. all aaron sidechains are required pay certain amount everycoin create healthy ecosystem and determine the sidechain based the aaron blockchain. the amount payment will adjusted consideration the timing with sufficient time. addition, the amount payment will determined through community vote measure reasonable payments. everycoin token used the mainchain for side chain-based currency and intelligent exchange. all sidechains can support their own default tokens and will considered assets aaron. the sidechain can easily issue contract token. the aaron system, you can switch everycoin digital assets, and vice versa also possible. the sidechain decides issue digital asset, you must pay everycoin accordingly. the same time with creation the digital asset, the user sets the initial percentage digital assets and everycoin. aaron's capital pool and digital asset pool are created automatically and the ratios are quoted according the market price. the value digital asset the sidechain goes up, aaron's capital pool will require more everycoin maintain the value increase. the more quality sidechain projects using everycoin, the higher the value everycoin naturally. tabipay sidechain tabipay chain cryptocurrency used the sidechain the aaron platform and transaction chain method's banking block chains the same time. the nodes the system the tabipay blockchain consist consortium blockchain the nodes our partner owns and operates. tabipay blockchain uses the delegated proof stake (dpos) consensus algorithm. the issuance and deposit volume tabipay will finalized later depending the number nodes and transactions each country. eco-chain system eco-chain system collectivity cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, tokens, organizations, mainnet, testnet, cloud system. the eco-chain system includes blockchain systems non-block systems. the mainchain the eco-chain system will everycoin. hereafter, tabi mainchain based the dag model will connected. then, the eco-chain system will evolve fuse into each sidechain including smart contracts, tokens, organizations. each sidechain can created with block non-block chain system. ach individuals development teams according the dao model will included into the systems the eco-chain system and various outputs will produced. they will develop, validate and distribute tokens, smart contracts, cryptocurrencies and organizations. the results produced the system are not run aaron's mainnet immediately. can entered into the mainnet after open test involving various members the testnet called beta release. when registered eco marketplaces after testnet the system, will automatically entered into the mainnet. registering the marketplace means that many system users can use real time service environment easily without any additional configuration synchronization huge blocks (everytime new cryptocurrency added, synchronized) eco marketplace cloud computing and the space where the results the dao system are stored. also where the proposed calculated results from the dao system are combined with the eco chain system. eco market place, various experiments such various versions, beta, formal opening, upgrading and can done. has functions that can developed and distributed conjunction with testnet and mainnet. new smart contracts, tokens, cryptocurrencies, sidechains, etc. downloaded from eco marketplace will automatically become the part the dynamic smart wallet (dsw). aaron blockchain technology the aaron platform built with cryptocurrency system that digitalized real money, global finance payment system, and multiplex governance system. tries and actualizes new financial services that all people can use keeping all trading books multi blockchain safely. aaron platform's block chain system blockchain and non-block chain system the same time. they have unique structure called main blockchain and side blockchain and each chain connected parallel series. the block chain aaron platform, everycoin becomes the mainchain all chains and each other block non-block chain connected it. each sidechain developed the dao system and the developed items can blockchain non-block chain. each these connected the mainchain sidechain. addition, each chain can have protocol agreement (pow, dpos, pos, pbft, pool) unique way and can also divided into separate networks. everycoin system will build system that accepts block non-block chain called the huge eco-chain system the same ecosystem and communicates with them. these ecosystems make organic alliance possible and establish channels for communication among chains. addition, the everycoin system will provide unique system environment called dsw. the eco marketplace, called the developer system, massive cloud computing system. each developed and uploaded sidechain the eco marketplace will electronic wallet called the aaron wallet, the same time, and will container applications that can actively add, modify and delete chains. aaron blockchain uses hybrid agreement method that combines pow and dpos. and performs checking and complement each other combining the advantages public block chain and private block chain. the aaron blockchain system node works with -way decision consensus method, which are mining node the pow and node the dpos that must authorized the aaron system corporation. consisted business node with the partners managing and maintaining the system well the eiuc called everycoin international user council. aaron blockchain does not waste unnecessary power time generate blocks combining the pow agreement method with the dpos agreement method which the delegated node receives contract authorization and transaction fee contract execution. and does not need wait for the new block mined. instead it, but the state change authenticated and approved any time the agreement the possible designated nodes. individual chains can customized. and sensitive business data can stored and authenticated the aaron guarantee cloud service under strict security instead being stored unspecified location. aaron guarantee cloud responsible for asset and digital signature processing, but separated from the block chain. increases transaction speed and makes synchronization time shorter the aaron platform uses directed acyclic graph (dag) network transport method for example, the bitcoin transmission method like receiving data from the parent, the dag method receiving data from parents and siblings. dag shortens the time for block distributed all networks, makes transmission speed fast and reduces the cost processing large amounts data once. the dag starts from the concept that has limitation throughput and processing speed. also, the processing transaction approval immediate and takes good care the maximum amount information the maximum speed that the network can handle. since the aaron platform starts from dag the basic concept, the calculation the transaction process' speed per second meaningless. this concept can make deal with determinism flexible way. hybrid consensus ddpos(double delegated proof stake) the consensus algorithm the core the block chain-based currency system. the algorithm tries answer the question, 'how can prove that all decentralized databases have the same set information?' the advantage pow ethereum already. since such preventing the simultaneously distributed that has strong security and stability proved bitcoin and mining has been going for many years, has many advantages inflation the currency because the total amount coins not the market from the beginning. however, after certain period time, pow will increase the difficulty calculating the encryption algorithm. the pow system, due competition, weak hash power's group are extinguished while only strong hash power's group survive. result, problems arise due leaning toward the mining group. the aaron platform will use the hybrid protocol the pow ddpos (double delegated proof stake) which originatively designed the aaron team. this protocol will improve security and network performance while maintaining reliable network combination pow and pos. particular, ddpos way lock certain amount tokens before running node the network like pos (proof stake). but, only business node consisting partners who manage and maintain the system and everycoin user council node called the everycoin international user council (eiuc) can participate the settlement. the nodes are executed through mutual complement and agreement. the other hand, the delegated eiuc wants stop the node, they can unlock the token. business node can stake everycoin every units within one node and everycoin international user council (eiuc) can stake everycoin every units within node. they receive transaction fee proportion the total number coins staked the node exchange for liquidity suppression. coins staked node provide economic incentives for operating node well guaranteeing the security and integrity the information stored the node's block chain. according preset rules, when node found have falsified block chain, all stake coins are confiscated into the donation budget account. the number nodes the eiuc (everycoin international user council) adjusted according the number business nodes. the amount token and the selection eiuc will finalized later through community vote. smart contract aaron smart contract executable script data that usually stored tree structure. all information stored the "key and value" format. each key represented unique address. and the value can reference fixed value, binary executable, script executing with logic any other tree, address, etc., so, forms complex nesting structure. the scripts aaron smart contract are turing-complete. put simply, means that script can run other scripts and contain lot complex programming. some cases, can very complicated express appropriate logic perform some transaction management. almost impossible include provisions contracts for these various possible scenarios, but can easily accomplished with executable scripts stored contracts. script signed and unalterable part contract that can perform complex and intelligent logic check for complex conditions, activate specific triggers and perform additional tasks needed. overall, the tree smart contract creates smart contract chain (sc-chain). smart contract chain represents series smart contracts that refer and verify each other. the sc-chain represents the actual set related documents. the characteristics the new sc-chain are defined the new smart contract. however, the block chain does not store the contract itself, but only the state the contract. the body contract stored another object, such the aaron guarantee cloud. this means that you can facilitate smart contracts with unspecified infrastructure via amazon server in-house hardware. the execution the contract authenticated the user signing and nod approving transaction status, all transactions the aaron platform can trusted. blake- hash algorithm hash algorithm one the most important elements blockchain. this -bit constant string that used store encrypted transaction information block using hash function. this hash function should not hacked easily accessible anyone. everycoin used encrypt block data using the blake- hash function. the blake- hash function similar with sha hash function, but more powerful, faster and more secure hash function. especially, capable producing high performance regular x-, mostly personal computers. schnorr signature signature algorithms can easily said key send and withdraw money virtual currency. crypto currency, the portion the digital signature fairly large because the size the key value larger. conventional bit coin has new segwit due network's slowing speed and increasing block size caused digital signature's size. solve those problems, schnorr signature was used the signature algorithm. schnorr signature algorithm exciting innovation that has scalability transactions, protects privacy and improves security. the schnorr signature algorithm saves the space required for signing and reduces the overall cost completing the signature through single signature the trade with multiple parties. the schnorr signature algorithm results huge efficiency increase because reduces space and bandwidth schnorr signature has various features such group signing functions, reduced cost reduced data size, scalability and the ability defend against spammers' attacks. also, the resistance quantum computers higher than existing signature algorithms' one. everycoin will create safer and faster block chain using the schnorr signature algorithm. dao (decentralized autonomous organization) dao the one revolutionary concepts cryptocurrency. this concept originated from the decentralized autonomous coporation (dac). accepting this concept into cryptocurrency gradually, dao's basis was created. looking the features. openness and transparency nowadays, the spirit open source software has become typical example openness. decentralization: centralized individuals organizations cannot control the entire dao. this feature determines self-similarity. the feature the decentralized system ensures the vitality the dao system and protects people from corruption and abuse authority. autonomy: everyone can participate the dao system. all participants are either subsidiary sub-unit dao system, which will promote the development dao from their own point view. the spontaneous behavior the participants guarantees the operation the dao. value: dao system must have value use and can put into practical application. democracy: changes the core protocol the dao system require voting from vast majority units. and the decentralization and autonomy functions have determined that the dao must system capable democratic voting. the work the world does not mean that any organization association can all the works. the introduction new concepts indispensable order keep new sustainable development the future and operate new systems. one them the dao method. after dao has become the core system the "eco chain system" ecosystem, any organization person including the one aaron's key figures cannot make all the decisions peremptorily. will process smoothly inside the system through the method and procedure that have already talked before. the eco chain system will adapt the concept dao for the operational development the ecosystem the crypto chain and will also give certain share the dao system. this will create flexibility, autonomy and new value the marketplace well help build new world eco chain system. dsw(dynamic smart wallet) aaron wallet completely new electronic wallet with dynamic smart wallet (dsw) technology. this not single wallet you've ever thought of. not also the wallet make smart contracts work only after complicated commands are entered. like installing new apps the smartphoe app, just need download the api simply install the chain that connects the new chain our eco chain marketplace. so, call dsw and also call eco chain's new wallet os. this system can work because there are the eco marketplace that cloud system. individuals who own wallet can participate the testnet development such beta version each individual chain registered the marketplace. they can take part feedback individual user. after all, the eco marketplace and dsw systems will become the aron platform's key factors. and they will the most important outputs the aaron platform. aaron platform's dsw will basically set everycoin and tabipay for immediate use. this not the user's choice option. when you download the dsw, will the initial basic api. the basics that dsw works are synonymous with everycoin and tabipay. after then, the market place, you just need download any new sidechain smart contracts, tokens, cryptocurrencies and on. token distribution structure token distribution [diagram.] token distribution structure the aaron ecosystem supported the "evy" token, which virtual asset itself represented aaron smart contract. the total token issuance ,,,evy. total issuance used for pow mining and dpos node compensation after main net opening. the rest used follows; for token sale, for company, for team for global advisors and for bounty. pre-sale the token generation event the token will distributed step step after the date each sales period, shown the schedule below. during the tge (token generation event) period, the ethereum "erc" token distributed, the evy token can exchanged open trading before the aaron blockchain activated.
