peer-to-peer network utilizing cryptocurrency revolutionize the ecosystem schools worldwide. simplifying this ecosystem using cryptocurrency can potentially solve multitude problems currently prevalent within schools today. the campuscoin team recognizes two the largest complications with implementing cryptocurrency global level are educating the masses how correctly use these cryptocurrencies, well the large barrier entry that they currently face. specifically targeting students will allow for the education the ones who will most greatly affected the growing transition from fiat currency digital currency. easy use campuscoin mobile app built for students, schools, and businesses near schools will serve different, unique purposes for each these parties. technological advancements such sub-ledger system for schools and businesses, proprietary payment network termed the cryptocurrency payment network(tm), atms for students, and smart contracts capable securely storing academic achievement will implemented serve unique needs for each. the campus ambassador program well campuscoin sponsored events schools will the primary educational marketing tools allowing campuscoin spread rapidly. the campuscoin project being finalized non-profit foundation used give scholarships, loans and provide educational tools and resources the students who need most. the campuscoin team developing relationships with institutions encourage their students and faculty engage the research and development the new ecosystem, they will direct beneficiaries this blockchain powered ecosystem. the potential improvements from utilizing cryptocurrency within the school ecosystem are abundant. introduction campuscoin aims for economic simplicity within school ecosystems around the globe. intended participants include but are not limited to: students, schools, nearby businesses, well the parents and extended family the students, anyone wishing support the growth the school ecosystem. students today not have cheap, reliable, and fast method transact with their peers. options such venmo, squarecash, and paypal lack the speed cryptocurrency, and incur much higher transactional fees; see section schools and businesses need reliable method conduct data analysis and can the deciding factor for success the case business. settling the student athlete payment debate, offering micro-loans with incentives, and verifiably securing academic achievements are few the many avenues which campuscoin can utilized. taking the intrinsic elements cryptocurrency combined with incorporating new technological advancements added the campuscoin team, will aid simplifying and streamlining this most important ecosystem education. these intrinsic elements include blockchain, peer-to-peer network, cryptography, and consensus algorithm. these elements function together secure and increase the speed the transaction. other features include increased anonymity, lower transaction fees, and irreversible transactions. these properties will enhanced using the campuscoin mobile app combined with unique technologies such the cryptocurrency payment network, the sub-ledger system, proof-of-location, and academically driven smart contracts. complete this task the best way possible, the following steps must taken: students must educated cryptocurrency, the benefits relation fiat, and then campuscoin. schools, local businesses, and parents must educated cryptocurrency, the benefits relation fiat, and then campuscoin. students, schools, and/or businesses must realize purpose for using campuscoin. students transact campuscoin with their peers using the mobile app. campuscoin sponsored events schools further educate all parties. schools/local businesses integrate campuscoin medium exchange. students use campuscoin schools and local businesses. the campuscoin team realizes most crucial that students understand the benefits cryptocurrency and campuscoin relation fiat currency. students must use campuscoin for schools and local businesses consider accepting the token medium exchange. fortunately, students offer strong target market because they are generally open new technologies, new ideas, and are learning continuously through the educational system therefore allowing them the edge needed grasp these concepts, solidify them over time fashion more quickly than the general public, and thus capable and more willing use campuscoin. college aged students are amongst the largest users apps out any age group. based data found for june people aged the united states spent average hours that month using apps their smart phone alone []. this does not include desktop computer tablet usage. notable the fact the number mobile app downloads increased from billion billion increase. this number estimated soar billion []. schools and businesses near schools may not open the idea first but will given tough choice through the economics demand students continue push the envelope utilizing campuscoin for daily transactions. students are using campuscoin, adoption will the most obvious choice for schools/local businesses they continue become educated cryptocurrency and the benefits adoption become readily available. the use the campus ambassador program, hosting events schools, and giving away free tokens students will the campuscoin team's focus for marketing. the campus ambassador program paramount campuscoin. through this flagship, students have opportunity participate and earn rewards campuscoin for spreading the campuscoin vision others that choose participate. spreading the word through social media well the ground marketing strategic events will also utilized best promote campuscoin those who would benefit from its use the most. combining these proven and decisive marketing methods blended also with the technologies mentioned above, the campuscoin team confident that students, schools, and local businesses worldwide will choose adopt campuscoin their preferred medium exchange. cryptocurrency basics campuscoin's mission extends educating the masses cryptocurrency and blockchain, basic description the key properties these technologies necessary for this paper. while this section may appear rudimentary those experienced cryptocurrency, the sections regarding proof-of-work, proof-ofstake, masternodes, and smart contracts will have small descriptions the end each detailing how and when campuscoin will implement these ideas. blockchain blockchain simply growing list data that publicly distributed every user who participates the bookkeeping that data. blockchain most commonly used today store transactional data about cryptocurrency. the transactional records the cryptocurrency are broadcast over network maintain honesty amongst all users. group users' records contain different data than the majority, their data will rejected the rest the network. this prevents malicious attackers from altering transactions that have occurred the past. the blockchain the most essential component cryptocurrency due the transactional information contains. blockchain gets its name from being literal chain blocks. the data from each block blockchain will typically contain hash the previous block, timestamp, and other transactional information. imperative that each block has information about the last, confirm the integrity each block, until the very first block, known the genesis block []. the timestamp and transactional data are used tools for recording how much currency each user owns. the timestamp tracks when all transactions occur, user tries spend the same tokens later, the timestamp the information needed the users the blockchain reject the second attempt spending the coins. blockchain the essential backbone behind cryptocurrency. without blockchain, cryptocurrency couldn't exist there are developmental ideas that currently exist where blockchain not needed for cryptocurrency. these ideas are still unproven and therefore are not recommended currently. see: https://iota.org/iota_whitepaper.pdf for one such developmental ideas, the tangle. peer-to-peer network peer-to-peer (pp) network describes system where two more devices connect and share resources without the use central computer. conceptually, this may thought wiring two gaming systems together play video game local area network (lan) between the two systems. this example peer-to-peer network, whereas cryptocurrencies utilize the same basic concept over wide area network (wan) that happens over the internet. the network operates the following steps: new transactions are sent all nodes upon initiation. every node collects transactions and stores them block. each node dedicates computing power towards finding the next block the chain. when node finds block, broadcasts the new block all nodes. nodes will only accept block with only unspent transactions. spent transaction found, the block rejected. known that block has been accepted when nodes begin working creating the next block the chain, using the hash the accepted block the previous hash. this peer-to-peer network, combined with proof-of-work, used remove the need for third-party handle finances prevent double spending []. double spending can potentially occur from malicious users successfully creating alternate version blockchain. for the alternate chain become useable, the malicious users must have more computing power dedicated toward the network than the honest users. this idea competing blockchains based computing power consequence the proof-of-work consensus algorithm; see section cryptography cryptography the science secret writing that can dated back early b.c []. cryptography used method securely store and protect sensitive data that only the intended authorized user can decode and access that data. cryptocurrency secured using cryptography through use public and private key. public key socially shareable address which the only necessary information needed shared for receiving tokens. the private key corresponding this public key acts digital signature for users' node: program dedicated validating blocks and transactions. any user blockchain may run their own node. double spending: spending the same tokens multiple times with the purpose reversing the first transaction. wallet and functions similar fashion access password that allows outbound transactions take place. when transaction occurs, the sender uses their private key sign the transaction. when signed, the users the blockchain confirm that the transaction valid and begin processing. the event malicious user gained access the private key, tokens associated with the key may stolen will. cryptocurrency and standard with cryptography, imperative the private key remains secure from unauthorized access. this private key always encrypted inside the wallet.dat file and only ever decrypted momentarily allow transaction occur. long the decrypted private key not shared with other users, anyone should feel safe using cryptocurrency send and receive transactions. recommended that this private key backed safe place that isn't digitally accessible, (e.g. written note lockbox). hardware paper wallets may utilized make the private key even safer. cryptography important feature for cryptocurrency that adds security and safety users. proof-of-work proof-of-work (pow) tool used secure network using computing power the cost for participating users. this computing power dedicated solving complex "puzzles" find the next block blockchain. when new block found, the finder this block communicates the other users that the block has been found, and new puzzle begins. this process referred mining, where the "miners" are incentivized use their computer power being rewarded specified amount cryptocurrency for finding each block. the miners also receive rewards processing transactions known transaction fees. when malicious attack, known attack, occurs blockchain, miner group miners has successfully produced more computing power dedicated towards alternate version the blockchain than the current popular chain. this has serious implications transactions can altered this group malicious miners and they can effectively reverse all their past sent transactions the alternative blockchain outperforms the current one. the older transaction becomes, the more computing power required reverse transaction. this because the malicious miners must replicate the computing power done each block after the block which the intended reversed transaction occurs. therefore, transaction was sent blocks ago, the malicious miners must mine these blocks and all subsequent blocks mined the current chain during the time takes mine the blocks. the alternative blockchain must catch the current chain, and that point, the chain with the higher computing power will take control. the transaction that had occurred blocks before the attack will successfully reversed once the alternative chain surpasses the current chain. attack the biggest weakness the proof-of-work consensus algorithm, but more computing power dedicated each block the chain, the costlier becomes for malicious users alter block. therefore, the more miners dedicated mining the honest version blockchain, the less likely the blockchain will successfully altered. campuscoin currently uses the proof-of-work algorithm but there are plans incorporate proof-of-stake make use the advantages both consensus algorithms. different proof-of-work protocol, utilizing more energy efficient methods, also being considered for implementation into campuscoin proof-of-stake proof-of-stake (pos) algorithm that cryptocurrency blockchain can use achieve distributed consensus. consensus the ability for several computers continually record and share sets data upon reaching agreement about what the data should say []. proof-of-stake uses combination random selection, wealth and/or age determine the next creator [][]. this different from the proof-of-work algorithm which relies dedicating computing power find the next block the blockchain. the two most commonly used block selection variants are randomized block selection and coin age-based selection [][]. the most popular cryptocurrency utilizing randomized block selection being nxt, where subsequent blocks are generated based verifiable, unique, and nearly unpredictable information from the previous block. blocks use information from the previous block create chain blocks (and transactions) that can traced all the way back the genesis block []. this seen fair method distribution because the unpredictability the information given the blocks prevents favoritism block via manipulation. the other commonly used method, known coin age-based selection, uses calculation based the number tokens user holds, and the amount time they held them. "if bob received coins from alice and held for days, say that bob has accumulated coin-days coin age []." users can equally obtain larger chances solve the next block based time and tokens held. the energy efficient proof-of-work in-depth: section wealth: referring the number tokens user holds. coin and token will used interchangeably for simplicity. coin and token hold slightly different definitions where coin simply means payment, while token adds functionality. more here: https://blog.chronobank.io/token-vs-coinwhats-the-difference-efd the campuscoin team plans implement the coin age-based selection the belief that this the best choice given the target demographic. this will paired with the proof-of-work consensus algorithm that malicious attacks are less likely, and costlier. one the biggest concerns with the proof-of-stake algorithm how cheap attack the blockchain. this can stopped using proof-of-work add computing power the cost malicious attack. there are plans implement proof-of-stake into campuscoin this implementation moving forward with the idea allowing each student stake the campuscoin their mobile wallet. staking will incentivize students use campuscoin more can used means passive income for the student. masternode masternode simply server decentralized network dedicated completing functions that ordinary nodes cannot []. ordinary node does nothing extra aside from confirming transactions and blocks while masternodes can potentially: increase privacy for transactions. complete instant transactions. participate voting/governing the cryptocurrency. allow the ability have treasury system cryptocurrency []. the benefits running masternode for both the user and the blockchain are very prevalent. those who choose run masternodes also typically are rewarded with larger portion each block reward compared users running normal proof-of-work proof-of-stake nodes. the potential downsides include requiring significant investment token ownership held the intended masternode operate (think this stake the operations that compels honesty the system), and the large amount uptime (%+), needed from the computer server running the masternode. these potential pitfalls however, not outweigh the benefits using masternodes. for this reason, there are plans implement masternodes into campuscoin for the purposes instant transactions and increased privacy. smart contracts smart contract small computer program stored onto blockchain which performs transaction given certain condition. essentially, happens, transfer this similar normal contract; the difference being smart contract automatically executed upon the completion the required condition without the need for any action from the parties included. the applications these smart contracts are endless. storing sensitive information, polling for election, any transfer funding that must occur before the service being paid for provided. any document containing sensitive information may stored and only accessed intended parties, election polls become much more tamper proof, and untrustworthy sellers can held accountable for delivery their product service order receive funds. the applications smart contracts can apply school setting multiple ways. the completion degree can programmed into smart contract such that the degree only received when the necessary classes have been passed. evidence the degree successfully being completed would recorded the blockchain and employers can check the validity potential hire's claims certain degree []. the same may done for other various educational achievements that hold merit. smart contracts could helpful students buying and selling items with their peers. the smart contract would ensure that the buyer receives the product before their funds are sent. securing class president and other various election polls also possible with the implementation these contracts. the campuscoin team will implement smart contracts into the blockchain assist with two the features the mobile app: the campuscoin marketplace and the decentralized teaching platform the campuscoin team will also provide schools the ability use smart contracts for recording degrees they choose. other implementations smart contracts are also being considered and will updated here they are chosen. campuscoin marketplace and teaching platform in-depth: sections .., other basic terms decentralization disperse central power amongst all users such that every user has equal say decision making. the case cryptocurrency, this power deciding which transactions get processed and why they do. difficulty (mining) measures the effort required the network needed solve the next block the chain. more computing power added network, the difficulty increased keep the average block time relatively constant. hard fork the permanent divergence blockchain where chains older version will not able validate blocks the new chain, once the newer chain implemented. the two chains will run separately. this type change not backward compatible. hashrate the amount computing power dedicated blockchain. hashrate correlates the amount hashes the computing power can process per second. proof-of-work algorithm requires scanning through these hashes until block found. the case blockchain, hash alphanumeric string producing output containing the solution the chain. satoshi named after the anonymous bitcoin creator, satoshi nakamoto, satoshi the current smallest unit measurement used when dealing with bitcoin. this number btc, (seven zeros and one). soft fork temporary divergence blockchain where change blockchain implemented way that allows for old users the chain continue validate blocks. enough users must upgrade the newer chain before implementation the change for the soft fork take effect. the upgraded chain does not reach majority time, the soft fork proposed changes are ignored, and the old chain continues. wallet where the private and public keys associated with blockchain user are stored. provides features such encryption and back-up for the keys. average block time constant defined within blockchain that dictates how frequently each block should occur. applications campuscoin within the school ecosystem the campuscoin team has identified multitude applications surrounding schools with the implementation cryptocurrency: faster and cheaper method payment for students and parents. provide more reliable method conduct data analysis for businesses and schools. provide reliable attendance taking methods. settle the student-athlete payment debate. offer micro student loans with low interest rates students. reduce theft business. provide reliable method receiving extra help outside class. secure academic records the blockchain. incentivize students excel school. application faster and cheaper method payment for students and parents while parents can send finances directly their child's bank accounts, the process not simple could be. the parent also has idea what these funds are being used for that point the student withdraws from the account. this problem easily solvable with cryptocurrency utilizing easy use mobile app. the blockchain allows parents know parameters surrounding their student's expenditure the funds. the mobile app will allow parents nearly instantly buy campuscoin and then transfer their child's wallet one step process. the campuscoin tokens will there minutes and the student may then use the campuscoin send other students, use local business, spend their school. the campuscoin mobile app will allow payment between students and their peers easier than ever. the mobile app will guarantee student's never incorrectly send funds using friends list eliminate the need for entering wallet addresses. available options which currently utilize user-friendly interface such venmo, square cash, and paypal all require fees for instant transactions from user user. debit and credit card processing fees are around for each option with another fee associated with trying send funds the receiver's bank account, trying receive that same day []. the goal for campuscoin have miniscule fees less than cent per transaction. this made possible correctly scaling cryptocurrency global level. application better data analysis available for schools/businesses schools and businesses could benefit greatly conducting data analysis their students/consumers. while schools have some information about purchases being made their official stores, they not receive sufficient information regarding purchases associated with their school. with the use the campuscoin sub-ledger system and proof-of-location, schools and businesses will given access aggregate and statistical movement and loosely anonymized activity data for both. schools will able filter the transactions the blockchain only students who attend that school, while businesses can filter for purchases made only their business. with this information, schools will know which local businesses are most popular amongst their students. businesses will also know which items are most popular their store. this data will imperative ensuring success for businesses who struggle profitable without it. while this data will public for the schools and businesses, the identities the students will remain protected, even from the schools. application reliable attendance taking methods professors for many years have sought and tried many methods find cheat-proof technique taking attendance. while this difficult large classroom without being time consuming, utilizing mobile app and proof-of-location makes this reality, and simple possible. students who use the campuscoin mobile app will automatically listed attending lecture within classrooms utilizing sensors measure the absolute and relative location each student. students will earn rewards when they attend class, adding further incentive for attendance. this system can only cheated student giving their phone peer bring class. use biometrics may also leveraged within the classroom eliminate even this small risk. students will much less inclined give their phone for the duration the class, cheat attendance, than the current cheating methods available today. attendance records may also stored blockchain using smart contracts permanent data holders. this information would only available only those given permission. more securing academic data via smart contracts section application settling the student athlete payment debate one the largest issues the collegiate demographic today the debate whether student athletes deserve compensated for their performance. the ncaa and the universities stand make millions college sporting events, while the athletes participating the events receive zero compensation, other than potential athletic scholarship from their school. combined schools the five major conferences totaled billion revenue last year; mostly earned due student athletes []. multiple pros and cons providing compensation student athletes exist: pros: student athletes can support their families. student athletes are incentivized stay school longer. limits corruption from agents, boosters, etc. student athletes are compensated for revenue generated their school. cons: student athletes may financially irresponsible. student athletes may less inclined class. removes competitive nature from the game []. schools fear that the compensation sent student athletes will spent items that are not beneficial the students' educational needs. this can fixed simply limiting where the student athlete can spend funds received the school. different from other students, the student athletes will given unique debit cards which only allow transactions specified merchant terminals near the school the student athlete will incapable sending funds their peers prevent potential detrimental purchases. student athletes will subject daily limit per day per business that buying for other parties not possibility. while offering benefits student athletes may reduce the inclination class, stipulations can set for the student athletes that require them class receive the funds. student athlete stops attending class for week without valid reason, they will subject losing their funding for that week and forth until adequate attendance met. the student athletes conversely may also compensated more their school the campuscoin team for completing certain athletic achievements that will help bring more funding their debit cards and merchants terminals in-depth: section school. this will fact bring more competitive nature the game, student athletes know they may receive more for athletic achievement. application offering micro-loans students with low interest rates unless given full scholarship funding from their parents, students today leave school with student debt. while common borrow loan school, the interest rates these loans continue climb. "undergraduate direct subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans went from percent for the july june time frame percent []." that increase percent just calendar year. with signs this stopping, student debt will continue grow with higher interest rates. the campuscoin team has solution this. initially, students will have access micro-loans from campuscoin with extremely low interest rates. students who achieve academic excellence can reduce these rates even further. for example, student who receives during the year that they receive loan from campuscoin, may have zero percent interest rate that loan. this further incentivizes academic excellence while allowing students acquire loans that are less costly than those currently available. students who are unable afford lunch school every day may also apply for zero interest loans from campuscoin. every student should given the same opportunity succeed, and the inability afford lunch roadblock student should have deal with. campuscoin would like end world hunger and believe this big step towards ensuring that end. this micro-loan system preliminary stages development and more information will provided later date. application reducing theft businesses businesses are constantly faced with the problem theft. commonplace, businesses bury these losses within the term shrinkage, and the costs businesses are directly passed the consumer. the most common theft today being employee theft. employee theft crime that costs u.s. businesses billion per year []. this now easily preventable due the blockchain keeping public list all transactions that occurred. employee charge finances for business tries embezzling campuscoin, this will publicly broadcast all users the blockchain and made visible worldwide. the business can limit the availability the wallet funds owned the business certain employees, that embezzlement ever attempted, the business knows exactly who the employee is. the attempted embezzlement will seen publicly the campuscoin block explorer with exact time, date, destination, and amounts, that the business may pinpoint the untrustworthy employee. businesses that deal with transactions that handle paper money, the potential for robbery always option. the employee the cash register forced give the robber all the money the register and the business suffers. cryptocurrency used place the paper money, robbery cannot occur the funds are sent digitally wallet not reachable the employee working the cash register. application receive extra help class reliably students who miss class have challenging time understanding the material presented, not have reliable method obtaining the necessary information succeed. the campuscoin team aims solve this with decentralized teaching platform for students. this teaching platform will allow students post lecture notes about class that other students can pay campuscoin obtain. students who write accurate, organized notes will given higher ratings and will start earning more rewards for their efforts. students can also post detailed videos core concepts specific class. this could range from romeo and juliet english class laplace transforms differential equations class. this big step towards completing one campuscoin's core missions: enhance students' opportunity succeed school. application secure academic records the blockchain utilizing blockchain driven smart contracts, certificates academic achievement, such diplomas, certifications, and standardized tests may secured. the administration diploma may stored smart contract where the necessary requirements for the given degree must fulfilled for the smart contract execute. once executed, the diploma can permanently stored the blockchain the form smart contract. this makes such that only authorized viewers, such the diploma recipient, the school administering the diploma, and potential employers the recipient, may access the necessary information confirm the completion the degree. there are many academic achievements that may benefit from utilizing smart contracts: decentralized teaching platform in-depth: section diplomas (college and high school) standardized tests attendance dean's list/honor roll transcripts figure smart contract capabilities any sensitive information administered which may need accessed later can benefit from smart contract. the ability securely store sensitive data such permanent manner ensures that the data accurate and can never lost destroyed. storing and tracking this information has never been easier for school. smart contracts will implemented into campuscoin with storage these academic achievements mind. application incentivize students excel school today, the only real incentive receiving good gpa college the potential move onto higher level education. campuscoin will allow for students earn rewards attending class and other academic events, receive lower interest rates loans for academic excellence, well receive scholarships when needed most. motivating students excel academically essential, building well-rounded knowledge will allow for students grasp the ideas behind cryptocurrency more easily. technology help aid our mission, the campuscoin team will implement the following technologies into campuscoin: simple use mobile app for nearly instant transactions between all users. multiple features designed make the process simple possible. the cryptocurrency payment network paired with merchant terminals and campuscoin debit cards. the campuscoin sub-ledger system for schools and businesses. campuscoin atms distributed schools worldwide. proof-of-location reward students for attending class and other academic events. new proof-of-work protocol that more energy efficient than the current protocol. campuscoin mobile app the campuscoin mobile app aims the most simplified cryptocurrency mobile wallet date. this app will have user-friendly interface allowing the transactions simple possible. instead worrying about incorrectly entering long wallet address while sending funds, friends list will used make this process simple possible. along with this user-friendly app, the following features are planned for implementation: marketplace for students easily buy and sell books and other miscellaneous items using campuscoin. decentralized teaching platform aid students with specific classes and core concepts. statistics tab for schools and businesses use for transaction data about their students and consumers. unique campus ambassador tab for ambassadors check their progress and compete with other ambassadors. phased implementation schedule will identify adoptions these technologies each version release the app. ... campuscoin marketplace the campuscoin marketplace will key feature developed within the campuscoin app allowing students trade items with other students their school. this will include textbooks, dorm items, and other educational supplies. when student wants post item for sale, picture the item and price must given. when item bought, the use smart contract implemented. this smart contract will hold the buyers funds safe location until the buyer has confirmed that they have received their item. the buyer never receives the item, the funds will sent back after specified amount time. for this system successful, trust between students imperative. for that reason, sellers and buyers will have ratings and can also reported. buyer receives item and doesn't accept that its happened the app, they are susceptible reporting and can banned from the system for abuse after enough offenses. recommended for the marketplace the transferring the item person, unless the seller highly trusted. also recommended that the smart contract accepted the time the in-person transfer, unless the buyer highly trusted. the campuscoin marketplace will key feature the campuscoin app allowing students trade items with other students their school. ... decentralized teaching platform the campuscoin decentralized teaching platform will aim help students with understanding core concepts their classes. any student can post lesson specific topic within class lecture notes from exact day class. this will aid students who missed important lecture just need some extra help understanding tough subjects within their class. the teaching platform will organized such that students will able filter the potential material the classes their school only. this ensures they are receiving the most relevant information for that specific class. while any student may post lesson onto the platform, rating system will used that the highest quality lessons are shown first. this rating system will separate for lecture notes and actual lessons. lecture notes will rated their completeness, organization, and relevance, while lessons will graded completeness, thoroughness, and understandability. students who purchase the material will prompted review how sufficient the material was. specific material given multiple bad reviews, will removed that students will have access better material instead. the student teachers will receive percentage the campuscoin acquired from buyers their posted material. student teachers who continue post high quality material are more likely shown search results and will earn larger percentage campuscoin sent from buyers. the student teaching system will have three separate tiers teachers: novice teacher any student who posts one more lesson regardless rating, reward: campuscoin from buyers. intermediate teacher student teacher with lessons averaging /-star ratings, reward: campuscoin from buyers. legendary teacher student teacher with lessons averaging ./-star ratings, reward: campuscoin from buyers. each student teacher will have teaching portfolio detailing their progress through the tier system, their best subjects, well their rankings amongst other teachers worldwide. this ranking system will factor the average rating well the amount material posted each student teacher. the rankings will broken subject and school but will also have all-time best leaderboard. globally competitive system will fuel students post the best material possible, leading the education the most students. ... data tracker for schools and businesses special statistics page that gives all the needed information about relevant transactions will exclusively available for schools and businesses. making use the campuscoin sub-ledger system (section .), schools will have access transactions that occurred amongst students that attend that school. with the ability filter down each individual nearby store/business, the schools will able see what items are most popular amongst their student body. each school can make informed decisions based the statistical activities their students. schools will now have access information concerning what items are most popular their dining hall, what books are most popular their bookstore, what local businesses their students use most, and other valuable key data and indicators. businesses will have simpler system than schools determine which blockchain users are using their services. this because transactional data must only known about the wallet addresses corresponding the business. the businesses can view their most popular consumers, their most popular items, and their peak hours. this data imperative for start-up business that needs decide what items should sold well the proper hours operation for the business open. ... campus ambassador page the campus ambassador tab will the hub for all ambassador related information. this section the app will include statistics about recruitment, material field students, schools, and businesses, well leaderboard top ambassadors worldwide. the statistics portion will include total recruits, ambassador level, and progress towards completing their monthly tasks. the material will include the campus ambassador guide and other educational tools that can use. the leaderboard section will purely for friendly competition purposes. ... buying campuscoin with credit/debit cards users the campuscoin mobile app will given the ability purchase campuscoin using their debit credit cards. this will eliminate the need use third party such coinbase purchase bitcoin then purchase campuscoin. this will made possible making use the cryptowolf platform. figure current process buying campuscoin figure simplified process buying campuscoin campus ambassador guide: detailed guide for members the campus ambassador program use educate all parties cryptocurrency and campuscoin. cryptowolf, decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, plans implement credit and debit card purchasing april st, account created with cryptowolf with debit/credit card associated with the account. campuscoin then bought with the buyer entering campuscoin wallet address the intended recipient the tokens. the tokens are then sent directly the wallet. link this service will available the app and optimized made simple possible. now users will have simpler and cheaper method purchasing campuscoin. coin ltd.'s cryptocurrency payment network the cryptocurrency payment network(tm) (cpn), proprietary payment gateway designed coin, ltd., uses new protocol for processing transactions, independent visa. this allows for debit card transactions occur without the need visa support campuscoin. campuscoin pleased announce that march definitive and carefully negotiated two-year exclusive distribution agreement was executed with coin, ltd. ("coin"), venture-financed, new york based company. coin developed the cpn which will allow campuscoin users instant and direct transfers between campuscoin and fiat currency. pursuant the agreement, which being financed part campuscoin, coin introducing for immediate shipment, dedicated cpn merchant terminals and campuscoin debit cards cost campuscoin supporting u.s. users, merchants and schools. signups for merchant terminals and cards, well support for the payment network are now available www.cpnetwork.io. figure campuscoin cpn debit cards public addresses shown are unassigned. the campuscoin team believes that the introduction this service game-changer for cryptocurrency general, and for campuscoin particular. campuscoin now spendable any merchant that supports the free cpn, with the merchant receiving fiat. the network deployed, anticipate portions campuscoin come off trading exchanges and into wallets for merchant transactions, resulting the increased utility the token. the introduction this service just the start, with new, yet undisclosed initiatives planned during our partnership. during the roll-out period, distribution may limited first-come, first-served basis. the campuscoin team and coin will work diligently toward distributing many terminals possible while maintaining stability within the network. both teams will keep users informed and date developments regular basis. campuscoin sub-ledger system the campuscoin team has designed unique method for schools obtain significant data about their students. the sub-ledger system the simplest solution group student transaction data together. requires student registration the mobile app with their school email. when this occurs the wallet addresses that are generated for that student, are grouped together with the rest the students that school. schools can use the grouped addresses see what their students have been spending their tokens on. though official school email needed receive address that will belong the school group, the email information, allowing for identification wallet address, will not provided the school protect the anonymity the students. campuscoin subject u.s. laws and regulations and therefore will protect all instances user supplied personally identifiable information (pii). may experience requests produce data for law enforcement purposes. the blockchain ledger open the same manner bitcoin, data within the sub-ledger tightly controlled. protect the individual identities students but must conform when required. there potential problem that can occur when alumni transfer student with old school email tries sign register for the mobile app current student. this resolved simply requesting for the email list students current school. this will updated semester basis that the transactional data accurate possible. campuscoin atms there are plans incorporate campuscoin atms campuses worldwide allow for the conversion fiat currency campuscoin, and vice versa, with goal easy possible. these atms will run like the current bitcoin atms but will allow for leveraging multiple types fiat within the same machine. this will allow for international students easily convert fiat from their country useable campuscoin one step. this eliminates the fee and time associated with converting one fiat another. the campuscoin atms will installed the more robust, larger campuses first and distributed other locations user demand increases. determining which campuses fit the demand for atm will depend multiple factors. schools who integrate campuscoin into their infrastructure will automatically receive atm upon completion. school has not integrated campuscoin, atms will distributed based the number students and local businesses who are using campuscoin. should adoption local businesses given area accept campuscoin remain slow, the number students needed merit atm will depend the school size. school has less than students, then the student body must registered the mobile app qualify. between and students will require adoption from the student body, and any school over students will require students using the campuscoin mobile app eligible for atm. these campuscoin atms are planned for completion the end proof-of-location using sensors and beacons, campuscoin will able incentivize and validate student movement and activity. campuscoin strongly believes that student activity and input should encouraged and rewarded. there are many benefits that utilizing location-based analytics brings the blockchain. the methods described section utilize the blockchain and the sub-ledger system identify useful data-points within the community for schools and businesses. other analytics such attendance, volume customer traffic, and conversion rates businesses can collected via implementation proof-of-location. student being credited rewarded for attending the library for 'x' amount time. student attending school athletic performance events. student attending guest speaking/seminars. utilizing proof-of-location its early stages and this section will expanded upon further more developed. the energy efficient proof-of-work proof-of-work was originally designed roughly years ago, with the intention combatting the spamming junk mail []. created cynthia dwork and moni nahr, the idea was for user dedicate computing power towards solving moderately difficult puzzle. the time required for the computer solve the puzzle would prevent the abuse from easily sending mass number emails short period time. this idea requiring computing power allow for specific function occur, has since transformed into the proof-of-work consensus algorithm widely used cryptocurrencies today. proof-of-work used primarily applications where users dedicating computing power are given financial incentive for the work done the computer []. this most prevalent within cryptocurrencies where proofof-work offers robust method securing the network for the blockchain. maintaining this security while scaling wide-spread use allows for the possibilities further the cybersecurity field. its current state, proof-of-work requires large amount computing power, and therefore energy maintain database. there direct correlation between cryptocurrencies popularity and the amount mining done blockchain. cryptocurrency scales, the energy output can massive. the current estimated energy output per year bitcoin alone twh according statistics published through the international energy agency, this more demand than the entire country greece and quickly approaching the power consumption switzerland []. all this energy consumption detrimental the environment, and now, much the expenditure unnecessary with the creation the new, energy efficient proof-of-work protocol. designed diksha gupta and maxwell young, new proof-of-work protocol exists which relies measuring the number attackers network, and scaling the work done the blockchain accordingly. the key security feature introduced the protocol ensures the attacking power the network always less than half the total network. when network attacked, power added the network linear rate with respect march th, switzerland power consumption: twh/year. source: https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/key-world-energy-statistics.html the attacker's power. when the network determines the absence any attackers, the computational power used remains small []. the protocol relies the use virtual identifiers determine which users the blockchain are good bad. any user following the algorithm will considered good id, with all bad ids contained malicious users. this protocol assumes that every malicious user perfect collusion which leads the highest amount combined power. the most common attack network, referred sybil attack, when the bad ids attempt create false identities with the idea gaining more influence within the network []. while many case studies have been done mitigating these attacks none had created resource efficient approach because the created systems were incapable being designed linearly increase computing power []. resource efficiency paramount for globally popular, cryptocurrency. the campuscoin team has identified that this energy efficient proof-of-work protocol paired with proof-of-stake will lead efficient network which dynamically becomes more secure needed. real world cases regarding sybil attacks: https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/publications/files//bch_sybil.pdf, https://ediss.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle//----ad-/main.pdf?sequence= marketing the campuscoin team aims use unique strategies market campuscoin students, schools, and local businesses worldwide. these strategies include but are not limited to: the campus ambassador program, campuscoin sponsored events, and distributing tokens students. social media campaigns and in-person marketing will also completed necessary. the campuscoin team currently open all marketing opportunities from the community. campus ambassador program the campus ambassador program aims recruit students across the world earn rewards promoting campuscoin their school. currently, this program open any current college student, ages older, with plans expand high school, well alumni. the ambassadors are given five basic tasks: recruit students sign for free and interact part the community the campuscoin discord server. engage and recruit students download and use the campuscoin mobile app. share information, work with and encourage adoption, and secure use local businesses use campuscoin medium exchange. share information, work with and encourage adoption, and secure use their school use campuscoin medium exchange. educate students, businesses, and schools while completing the above tasks. help coordinate campuscoin events with the campuscoin team their school. these tasks will merit different rewards, and completing enough tasks allows students "level up" and earn more the same tasks. this rewards system can seen figure figure campus ambassador level system while any college student older may accepted ambassador, certain criteria has been put place ensure these ambassadors are serious about this responsibility. the criteria become and remain ambassador follows: there must more than one ambassador per students currently that school. ambassador must join the campuscoin discord server within days acceptance. the ambassador must then recruit students the discord server within days. upon recruiting students, the title novice ambassador has been earned. upon reaching the level novice ambassador, one the following tasks must completed monthly: campuscoin related social media posts. recruits the discord server mobile app. host attend campuscoin event their school. failure complete one these tasks will merit status jeopardy warning for the first missed milestone, suspension from the ambassador program for half the academic year the second missed milestone, and removal from the program the third. this provides opportunity for others assume active role ambassador and provide continuous healthy growth the program. the ambassadors will given the necessary tools from the campuscoin team educate their peers with full confidence and authority over the subject matter. alumnus containing strong connections school would like become ambassador, they may contact the campuscoin team get involved. alumni will have different set criteria than our student ambassadors. this will based the capabilities each individual alumnus. junior ambassador program for high school students may available the future. the program will run similarly the campus ambassador program, but with the focus being education. campuscoin sponsored events the campuscoin team committed hosting events universities and colleges educate students, faculty, and local businesses about the benefits cryptocurrency. students can earn event hosted their school reaching legendary ambassador status the campus ambassador program. other events will hosted the campuscoin team's discretion. events will include seminars and informal educational functions. these events will orchestrated through the campuscoin project non-profit foundation. campuscoin for students students will given multiple opportunities earn tokens from the campuscoin team. the campus ambassador program the best way for students earn tokens, but students who aren't ambassadors will also rewarded just for registering the mobile app with valid school email. this allows for ambassadors recruit their peers more effectively. until the release the app, students will also earn rewards for being recruited our discord server and filling out form. students will given opportunities earn free tokens from attending class school event well. schools concerned with lack attendance sporting event could offer free campuscoin for students attend. students may continue earn free tokens through this other expansive incentive models through the campuscoin team until the depletion the pre-mine strategy. link discord server: https://discord.gg/yefzr the campuscoin project the campuscoin project being finalized non-profit foundation intended the following: educate students, schools, and businesses about cryptocurrency. reward students who excel academically. increase opportunity for students succeed school. offer scholarships underprivileged children. offer low interest student loans. host events schools worldwide. act support model for all parties. non-profit organization will allow for the team accept charitable donations from believers and supporters our mission. the non-profit organization will act the educational cornerstone for campuscoin. educating students will come from utilizing the campus ambassador program, hosting seminars and parties schools, and providing key educational information our website and app. the foundation will also act support model for students, ambassadors, schools, and businesses they progress into the field cryptocurrency and blockchain. support may needed for any the following: answering questions regarding cryptocurrency, blockchain, and/or campuscoin. providing ambassadors with the necessary tools succeed promoting campuscoin. maintaining documents that may stored the blockchain. settling disputes within the marketplace and teaching platforms. creating, providing and disseminating educational material. monitoring and aiding campuscoin projects given students. token specifications covered this section will basic information regarding the blockchain specs campuscoin, where mine, what exchanges campuscoin traded on, and the pre-mine strategy. basic specifications ticker symbol: max supply: consensus algorithm: average block time: block reward: block halving rate: mining algorithm: block maturation period: cmpco ,,, cmpco proof-of-work (pow) seconds cmpco blocks scrypt blocks table basic specifications campuscoin these are the current specifications and this table will updated proof-of-stake, proof-of-location, the new proof-of-work protocol, and smart contracts are integrated into campuscoin. mining campuscoin uses the scrypt mining algorithm. highly recommended that asic miner designed for scrypt used. campuscoin can currently mined the following pools: antminepool mining-dutch the campuscoin team lists these known pools for convenience and not affiliated with any these party pools. users wishing leverage their services understand campuscoin assumes responsibility for the actions these services the event any tokens mined are not paid out the pool operators. campuscoin does intend offer official campuscoin mining pool and will provide more information later this living document. the scrypt and sha algorithms are constantly debated the best algorithm for proof-of-work. both have advantages, with scrypts' being more relevant the mission campuscoin. scrypt the simpler algorithm the two and tends use less energy while processing transactions faster []. wallets windows mac linux figures ,,:

funding for period time. the team has decided that tokens may sold before december st, this agreement was put place the campuscoin team remains diligent its vision while remaining transparent how the pre-mine strategy being utilized. the marketing fund will used for marketing purposes outside the campus ambassador program. this includes digital marketing, in-person advertisements, and sponsored events schools. the development fund will dedicated exchange listing, support for the mobile app, and outsourced development. airdrop and community bounties were used for the initial distribution tokens early enthusiasts campuscoin. they will continue used for bounties given the community such translations, social media posts, random giveaways. the campus ambassador program has million tokens allocated for the purposes rewarding ambassadors who recruit others use campuscoin. this will continue until all tokens are distributed. that point the ambassador program will continue with donations from our non-profit organization. students recruited ambassadors will rewarded upon registration with valid school email. this will begin upon release the app and continue until all million tokens have been distributed students. the scholarship/loan fund will dedicated the non-profit foundation for initial funding these ideas. funding for scholarships and loans after this will dependent revenue

risks, necessary address them that they are known the community. lack adoption from students this the most obvious and greatest potential risk that campuscoin faces. students must educated cryptocurrency, then make informed decision that campuscoin offers benefits over both fiat and other cryptocurrencies. the added benefits students allows the campuscoin team feel confident that they will choose campuscoin their preferred cryptocurrency. however, students are found resistant change offered knowledge that counters innate desire for fiat solving their solutions over cryptocurrency, once educated decide campuscoin not their preferred choice, adoption the intended audience will difficult. lack adoption from schools/businesses integration campuscoin within the student body successful, there still the possibility that schools and local businesses will resist integration with campuscoin well. students using campuscoin will entice schools and business accept they can receive crucial transactional data, but this does not guarantee that integration will occur. this lack adoption could occur from the inability correctly educate these parties, unwillingness change their standards, laws restricting the use cryptocurrencies. this lack adoption, while detrimental the campuscoin vision, does not remove all the benefits given students. lack funding campuscoin was built off initial airdrop and growth from grassroots-movement community, without the use ico. while the campuscoin team prefers this method due the negative aspects that come from the usage ico, funds received are limited comparison. funding for the non-profit will come from using donations received, fundraising, and out the pockets the development team. conclusion the campuscoin team excited for the opportunity simplify the ecosystem for schools worldwide. the change world cryptocurrency imminent and giving students the opportunity the forefront simple given the applications cryptocurrency within schools. utilizing blockchain allow students, schools, local businesses, and parents securely transfer campuscoin nearly instantly just the beginning. applications such data analysis for schools and businesses, solving the student athlete payment debate, and rewarding academic achievement via scholarships and loans are few the many ways campuscoin can aid the school ecosystem. life for students can extremely difficult balancing classes, work, sports, homework, and social life. the easier can made, the more likely the students are succeed. every student should given the same opportunity and campuscoin has potential give students the chance they deserve. appendix appendix meet the team matthew was born and raised south burlington, vermont. the early age while excelling
