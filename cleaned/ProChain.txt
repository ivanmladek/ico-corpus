global trillions internet advertising markets, the marketing budget largely owned centralized media such search engines and social media. due the lack mutual trust between the various stakeholders the industrial chain, there have been many non-value parts such advertisement verification, data monitoring and advertisement interception, and the high trust cost has diverted the interests all parties. according recent data, the registered users mobile app have already acquired the cost high rmb. however, for some specific types users, the cost acquiring users much rmb. so, whether there solution that can solve the trust between the parties, using technical means reduce business delivery costs and enhance the media right speak small and medium media, while allowing users control privacy and even gain? from enterprise perspective, how put marketing funds and optimize channels that they can accurately and quickly communicated the target population has always been the need enterprises. google and baidu have successfully verified the feasibility the ppc business model. however, with the increasing market concentration, search engine marketing has gradually become game for few interest groups. particular, difficult for smes enter the market due restrictions platforms and bidding alliances. the same time, due the fact that the data the flow side not transparent, difficult for the enterprise precisely measure the whereabouts the resources and measure the distortion the funnel model all aspects the roi. addition, click fraud, which accounts for astonishing serving, has left many businesses reluctant use cpc cpm pricing models. so, there solution that can optimize the marketing resources enterprise that the delivery crowd can pinpointed, the results trackable, quantifiable, click fraud free, and benefit regardless the size the organization? prochain presicion blockchain based big data from media perspective, traffic giants such google and facebook have basically monopolized the traffic market, and both are receiving more than their new market share each year. for large number decentralized traffic master, the bargaining power weak, have form network unify the orders and charged commission. the strong side the advertisers often delinquent accounts, due dissatisfaction with the effectiveness the contract contract disputes have occurred. so, there program that can trigger real-time billing users the traffic master platform and set irrevocable settlement rules before launch that the rights and interests small and medium-sized traffic owners are protected? from individual point view, when using internet services, often interrupted sudden advertising. far, user traffic did not bring any benefits the user itself, more and more users choose use adblock block the advertising content the page, advertising getting worse and worse. the other hand, the user's behavior data has been controlled big companies, privacy cannot control their own hands. so, there scheme that lets the value traffic return the user itself, the user has the option authorize the use privacy, and receive ads that are relevant only themselves? prochain presicion blockchain based big data marketing situation according mary meeker's internet trends report, the u.s. internet advertising market reached billion rmb while the internet advertising market china reached billion rmb and the global internet advertising market surpassed trillion rmb. according the company earnings report, google global advertising revenue reached billion rmb, facebook global advertising revenue billion rmb, both total billion rmb. google's online advertising business gross margin not less than which means that the advertising business pay more for the channel costs far more than billion rmb. from the point view the demand enterprises, the roi online advertising the most concerned point advertisers, followed the security budget and resources delivery, that is, anti-fraud, and finally time consider the quality the marketing program itself. prochain presicion blockchain based big data the other hand, the global trend internet users using adblock block online advertising rapidly growing, and traditional internet advertising becoming less effective. the origin the value the internet industry, users and media traffic should return this part the value users themselves instead making profit intermediary platform. prochain presicion blockchain based big data prochain aims prochain's goal build transparent digital advertising data ecosystem: connecting advertisers, media and developers improve the efficiency settlement advertising business, reduce the loss advertising traffic fraud, intermediaries, digital advertising participate side share the maximum benefits. mission prochain insists "data truth" its mission promote the trust all parties involved digital advertising regardless cost. mainly includes: traffic anti-fraudulent: prochain builds full-range data tracking system using cluster analysis, gbm, device similarity recognition and other equipment fingerprint model, with unique post mechanism effectively identify high-risk devices such virtual machines and farm equipment, significant distinguish user behavior, abnormal user behavior, false traffic, eliminate fraud accurately. farewell agent: prochain provides innovative production relations, substantial reduction agency costs; the current digital advertising industry, one the pain points too many agencies and agents, prochain data transparent and traceable, advertisers can easily determine advertisers can skip the traditional buying process and pay directly the target audience who watches the ad, regardless who they view their ads. trusted automated billing: each advertiser's serving task smart contract, because clearly monitors the effect each delivery, and the entire link data transparent, then the smart prochain presicion blockchain based big data contract can settled real time both parties according each effect, significantly shorten the upstream and downstream accounts, avoid contract disputes; domestic advertisers more and more delivery business the form pro tokens pay, easier solve the problem settlement cross-border business; accurate marketing: get connected all kinds information silos, data governance and real time bidding based advertising, algorithms and models that apply variety machine learning and deep learning, targeting users and ads full data set match, achieve personalized high-quality recommendations, ensure advertising effectiveness. why use blockchain? the traditional internet advertising market zero-sum game market. advertiser, publisher and user, due their mutual distrust, introduce number worthless intermediate links such advertisement verification, data monitoring and advertisement interception, etc. reduce the benefits all parties. using blockchain solutions innovate digital advertising productionrelations level will dramatically reduce the cost trust for all parties involved and create market value billions. based ethereum's public chain, raiden's sidechain and ipfs distributed storage technology, prochain will build big data-based precision advertising distribution system. advertisers create fulfillment tasks through smart contracts, which are settled real time with pro tokens for users and media rewards that triggered the ad. expected that the next years, commercial-grade blockchain public chains well the polkadot and raiden technologies will mature. the storage solutions based the ipfs protocol will decentralized web. media, centralized applications provide content-bearing capabilities and blockchain media entering phase rapid growth. advertising one the oldest internet business models, prochain will also provide highquality digital advertising solutions for these emerging web. distributed applications. prochain presicion blockchain based big data solutions prochain pro, which the token prochain system, conforms the ethereum erc- token standard and freely traded via the ethereum public chain. advertiser purchases pros from digital currency exchange and used build delivery tasks. the prochain sdk's publisher and users who complete the task and those who will receive the corresponding pro tokens based the task price. proadx: digital exchange platform, which enables large number dynamic and realtime bidding transactions while interfacing with traffic resources and advertiser resources. prossp: provides blockchain-based supply-side platform for traffic owners and developers who own traffic resources realize professional, efficient, and rewarding cash flow; prodsp: prodsp offers advertisers ethereum-based digital advertising smart contract market where advertisers choose contracts based launch requirements, replenish pro tokens and post them for live auctions; progateway: progateway developed interact the data between chain and off chain helping prochain refine the data mapping; prosdk: provides customizable sdk for traffic owners for serving, billing, and user identification. proadwarehouse: based ethereum's public chain data, provides advertisers, traffic masters, and users with credible data analysis platform for delivering data. provides detailed log-level data verify the real-click source advertisements, measures users' click-throughs, and statistics any period delivery effect. prochain presicion blockchain based big data prochain presicion blockchain based big data technical solutions technology architecture prochain's portal the dsdk and deployed the publisher, well the internal and external adxs that interface with it, sending media requests load balance. includes access policies, access control, chain gateway and real-time datatracking, which are forwarded downstream routing prorouter based the nature the traffic and the processing each module. prochain presicion blockchain based big data when the prochain business end receives the prorouter request, hands over the internal instance. instances map external requests labels the system, quantitatively determine the quality traffic data, match the optimal creatives the advertiser's management platform according the distribution strategy and pricing model, and return the results the front end. the case rtb delivery, prochain's business end determines the quality the traffic data and forwards external exchange, such the traditional internet exchange. further, traffic web distributed applications can forwarded blockchain exchange the pure chain. the datatracking module collects traffic, channel, effect and settlement logs returned the main transaction platform adx and the advertisement demand platform dsp, and relies the log service etl write stream computing the blockchain. since each delivery task smart contract, and the whole process delivery transparent and trustworthy, prochaincore's settlement module, according the contract address, settles the settlement the participants real time. prodashboard shows real-time reports with traffic monitoring and delivery monitoring. the total amount data the chain, the data collected the log, the back-end management system data will used the data source for the report display. prochain presicion blockchain based big data prochain anti-fraud post mechanism: post comprehensive scheme based account pos and time specifically, when account receiving job, post weight used account acquire the threshold the job. the specific calculation is: post pro' x(timestamp timestamp that say, account that wants receive job needs hold pro and needs ensure that there pro currency transaction for certain period time. post mechanism can effectively prevent the robot account batch brush task. when account finishes specific task, the post weight will zeroed and recalculated under the account, while the higher value task will have higher post weight requirement for the task account. prochain presicion blockchain based big data decentralized delivery flow the blockchain transparent database. third parties must know and verify the authenticity and legitimacy the transaction during the transaction process all chainchain. therefore, based the whole chain data, can create decentralized task flow engine and implement through intelligent contracts through data mining and machine learning algorithms calculate personalized task flow that meets user preferences. prochain delivery and tracking process follows: prochain presicion blockchain based big data task matching mechanism order better target audiences, prochain will provide advertisers with precise delivery features, including but not limited to: account balance, post weight, whether take orders, account ratings, tag matching and other dimensions. addition, will introduce user feature recognition system and cooperate with the identification project bind the personal metadata authorized the user the ethernet address that the advertiser can accurately reach the target user through the dapp with prosdk embedded. according pearson's formula, calculate the similarity between user and label ?,; )(r @,; sim(u, ?,; @,; the set items that the user and the label match together denoted puv, ru, rv, respectively represent that the user and label match the score task and represent the average score user and label prochain presicion blockchain based big data the main features are follows: account balance: account above certain limit can claim; post weight: account above certain post weight can claim; whether not delivered: only publisher user who has not claimed the same task link before can receive; account rating: according the big data rating system provided prochain for account classification, only higher than certain rating the account before they can receive; label matching: each task can set more than three labels. users can get the task push priority label matching improve the matching efficiency. machine learning model based full-chain delivery data prochain presicion blockchain based big data according the data blockchain network, and advertisers 'goals, users' behavioral preferences and task completion, training and ranking model calculate the probability task completed properly, and the completion the amount. prochain adopts the gbdt model and evaluates using the auc (area under curve) indicator and supports real-time test validation. prochain presicion blockchain based big data product solutions business process provide advertisers with digital advertising smart contract market
