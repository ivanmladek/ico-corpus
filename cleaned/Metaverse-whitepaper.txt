the new reality version: gravity (v.) supernova drives low entropy higher entropy via gravity. hao chen, eric gu, youming jiang may abstract metaverse blockchain project that provides foundational infrastructure for social and enterprise needs. our goal construct universe where digital assets (metaverse smart token, mst) and digital identities (avatar) build the basis for asset transactions with the help value intermediary (oracle), thus establishing new blockchain ecosystem that will transform human society and allow enter the new reality. unlike other blockchain projects that use technology entry point, metaverse started from enterprise value creation perspective, with the relationships between people, people and assets the core foundations our project. describe this relationship through the use bisc (built-in smart contract), which can reduce the technical risks commercial applications during development and usage. through bisc, metaverse provides functionalities digital assets (mst), digital identities (avatar), oracles, and mst exchanges. through the use mst, users reap the advantages blockchain technology, such the power generate and distribute their own cryptocurrency. the digital identity avatar reflects the relationship between people, people and assets, and this avatar can linked mst. through the use avatars, anyone can become value intermediary oracles, and oracles can help construct immutable decentralized system (reputation). mst can resolve fundamental liquidity issues asset trading, thus solving critical problem any financial system. mst and avatar are utilized under blockchain technology that fundamentally integrated with systems. this process can described baas (blockchain service). baas quick and convenient way build blockchain applications. brief history blockchain the development blockchain technology and its concepts follow the deconstruction and reconstruction the bitcoin system. namecoin and peercoin made landmark contributions the process moving from cryptocurrencies the wider blockchain concept, while bitshares and ethereum furthered our understanding the blockchain. bitcoin blockchain technology derived from the bitcoin system. the bitcoin system very modern innovation created mysterious figure named satoshi nakamoto, who defined bitcoin "peer peer electronic cash system." the bitcoin system seamlessly integrates workflow verification mechanisms, token incentives, cryptography, peer peer networking, and utxo technologies. this system has been operating safely for close decade. bitcoin also introduced new type currency cryptocurrency, and recent years cryptocurrency has become the most prevalent type application the blockchain industry. the same time, the emergence cryptocurrency has driven people explore more forms blockchain applications, such coloredcoin and namecoin. then came technical advancements such smart contracts, with blockchain technology developing through these innovative projects. namecoin namecoin the first application forked from bitcoin. was designed and implemented add the concept "decentralized domain name" bitcoin's original electronic cash system (this can considered the predecessor digital identities). namecoin also introduced merged mining, allowing the simultaneous mining namecoin and bitcoin guarantee the security the node network. peercoin peercoin introduced the proof stake (pos) consensus mechanism. all blockchains needed implement proof-of-work (pow) consensus mechanism, which requires intense resource consumption due the deployment costly mining equipment, blockchain technology would lag years behind its current state development. after the pos consensus mechanism was proposed, the innovation different consensus algorithms has become constant topic discussion the industry. (c)metaverse foundation bitshares bitshares expanded pos implementing the dpos (delegated proof stake) mechanism, which achieves block confirmation mere seconds. dpos not just technical consensus algorithm since also provides community governance mechanism. bitshares also decentralized exchange platform, where new concepts are put forward continually, such digital identity project called keyhotee. defining multiple transaction types, bitshares allows for easy asset and identity registration, which further promotes the distribution digital assets and other features. ethereum ethereum's most important contribution the blockchain field the smart contract, all inclusive tool that describes business logic. the smart contract and its features such the virtual machine (evm) greatly reduces the barriers for people develop blockchain applications. aside from smart contracts, ethereum also has more efficient network protocol, such the kad algorithm, the uncle block which reduces the risk mine pool centralization, the casper consensus mechanism, and the erc token standard. all these features vastly promoted the development the blockchain industry. blockchain development roadmap the development blockchain traceable. for example, the designing artificial intelligence might have seemed unattainable and far from reachable. however, with the popularity internet applications and the development algorithms and chips recent years, artificial intelligence has entered into the view the world. the development blockchain technology can traced the same way. want step into dao (decentralized autonomous organization), there are lot conditions that must met. sum these conditions the following figure: bitcoin operates the "cryptocurrencies" and "digital verifications" stages, bitshares the "decentralized asset exchanges" sector, and ethereum the "smart contracts" stage. for metaverse, the bridge between blockchain and real world applications lies the circled region. metaverse aiming build ecosystem that concentrates around these elements. (c)metaverse foundation metaverse: the new reality the term metaverse first appeared neal stephenson's science fiction novel "snow crash". the world depicted the novel, humans control their own avatars, and these avatars turn communicate with each other and with electronic agents virtual reality world. the name "metaverse" was inspired the world created neal stephenson's novel. the world live today similar the one described "snow crash". our work and life increasingly rely the internet, people spend more time online rather than offline. the way people communicate with each other has also changed, with most communication taking place through the internet. the near future, foresee transition from the internet information the internet value. more and more digital asset transfers will take place the blockchain through avatars (digital identities) and oracles (value intermediaries). this paradigm digital value will shape new economic model. metaverse differs from other blockchain projects that use technology their entry points since metaverse focuses creating value for enterprises. summarize the relationship between people and people well the relationship between people and assets. from this information, can create model from the ground that convenient use. call this bisc (built-in smart contract), and bisc can reduce the technical risks enterprise applications during development and usage. the picture below shows this relationship: the left are other smart contract blockchain projects, and the right metaverse's system. through bisc, metaverse provides digital assets mst, digital identities avatars, oracles, and asset exchange functions. mst allows users enjoy the benefits peer peer asset operations enabled through blockchain technology, and mst gives people the ability distribute their own "bitcoin". avatars embody the relationship between people and assets and can linked mst. through avatars, any person can become oracle, and oracle can help people build immutable decentralized system reputation. asset exchanges can solve fundamental liquidity needs for mst. metaverse's core developers and its community will build bisc together. users not need pay specific attention the technical details conveniently enjoy bisc. bisc not limited decentralized applications creation, can integrated into traditional solutions, described the above picture baas (blockchain service). bisc, through baas, creates value for enterprise applications the blockchain. the new world described above can difficult imagine and will fundamentally change the way live, work, and learn. call this change the new reality. (c)metaverse foundation etp (entropy) etp (entropy) entropy metaverse's token and abbreviated etp. this name draws from the second law thermodynamics, which describes the degree chaos system's microscopic particles. the total number etp's circulation million, and the smallest denomination etp ^-. etp can transferred and traded metaverse and will important factor select who will bookkeepers after metaverse transitions the pos consensus protocol. the security etp guaranteed the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ecdsa). etp not new form cryptocurrency. represents the utility the metaverse blockchain. therefore, etp's price not anchored any fiat currency cryptocurrency like bitcoin. the price etp depends the development metaverse ecosystem and market demand. etp can used measure the value digital assets (mst), can used collateral financial transactions. additional, fees applied metaverse and must paid etp. those fees are not paid the metaverse foundation because metaverse not-for-profit project. these fees are paid the developers charge maintaining the blockchain and miners. examples transactions with fee include: create digital assets, register new avatar, designate oneself oracle, invite trusted institutions verify assets and identities metaverse. etp distribution mechanism etp distributed through the following ways: ico and community metaverse has distributed million etp through its initial coin offering (ico). another million etp will used set the metaverse foundation support blockchain projects that benefit the metaverse community, facilitate investment activities that enhance metaverse's ecosystem, and reward major contributors the community. pow mining rewards million etp will distributed rewards through the pow mechanism those who help maintain metaverse's ecosystem, through process known mining. deposit interest rewards users can initiate etp deposit rewards locking their etp for period time. the system will display the principal and interest reward, and these are given the users normal transactions. the total amount etp reserved for deposit rewards million etp distribution diagram: (c)metaverse foundation pow distribution mechanism theory, mining block the metaverse blockchain should take average seconds. the initial reward for mining each block etp, and block rewards decrease for every blocks mined. the relationship shown the equation below: setting block time and block reward standard parameters, can obtain graph showing amount etp mined against time years, and the decay diagram the total reward obtained every blocks against time years. (figure amount etp mined against time years) (figure total rewards per blocks against time years) etp deposit and deposit reward distribution under etp's economic model, have added built-in etp lock function the blockchain that rewards depositors. this concept new design that will help metaverse migrate the dpos consensus mechanism and will help the development financial applications based the deposit lock function. obtain etp rewards, users must take the initiative use the deposit lock function. this interest reward will sent with the principal amount the user's digital wallet once the transaction confirmed. the deposit lock reward details are specified below: number blocks reward interest rate number blocks assume that the current block height "h", and after initiating the coin deposit transaction, the rewards will given out but frozen. users must wait until the amount blocks reached get their etp principal and reward. the minimum number blocks that must frozen reward interest rate: user locks etp and chooses the reward interest rate, then the user will receive (+%) etp, but will have lock the tokens for blocks. (c)metaverse foundation since locking etp generates interest, this will allow the total circulation etp surpass million. the mip- calculated time surpass this mark roughly years, and the metaverse community has recently come with proposals cap the total circulation million etp. the etp locking mechanism nature bold design, since internal, original interest rate exists that does not depend the central banks' rates. the first implemented version, however, was unsatisfactory because this version did not design the model dynamically like real life adjustable interest rate situations. also this first version was not essentially decentralized, and game theory was applied generate the market interest rate. further, are about promote etp trading activity centralized and decentralized marketplaces. "etp trading pairs" these markets will provide important database for etp interest rates. through voting direct information gathering decentralized market data, community members can influence etp's economic model and adjust the parameters. etp's on-chain transfer activity, number accounts, special transactions (to built), and other parameters can included this economic model. micro-inflation model etp the token representing the utility metaverse. etp not currency, should not subject inflation. however, token loss may occur for number reasons such accidental loss, forgotten passwords, carelessness, death. such, the issue declining etp circulation will steadily worsen. ethereum's white paper, vitalik buterin predicated annual loss rate for crytocurrency tokens. taking into consideration the fractional losses etp during circulation and the possibility that large amount etp may pledged hoarded exchanges, have designed the etp economic model require the introduction micro-inflation fill the demand for etp circulation. between the ico and the metaverse foundation, have distributed million etp. through the mining process will distribute another million etp, and will continue release small amounts etp orderly fashion through locked deposit rewards, with specific reward amounts determined the total amount coins deposited and the chosen locking time period. the same time, the etp inflation rate will used parameter reference the adjustment the etp deposit reward rate mechanism. this system feedback mechanisms enables economic self-adjustment and repair (mainly through the etp deposit reward tool). the system will upgraded with subsequent versions metaverse more robust. our end goal realize intuitive economic models and more effective economic environment the metaverse platform. (c)metaverse foundation consensus mechanism metaverse's consensus mechanism can split into two stages. the first stage employ the conservative and safe pow mechanism guarantee the growth our ecosystem. the second stage, the metaverse ecosystem develops support higher transaction output and the etp distribution for mining nears the limit, will consider switching dpos pos consensus mechanism consensus mechanism similar the combination ethash-casper. first phase: proof work (ethash) the first few years the metaverse system's operations, gpu mining will employed secure the system. will avoid bitcoin's sha and litecoin's scrypt algorithms avoid attacks from bitcoin and litecoin mining pools. considering asic's centralized mining pool, chose the ethash algorithm the mining algorithm for metaverse. the pow mechanism will maintained for some time. when new consensus protocol appears that stable and safe, will switch over this new consensus protocol. have also designed improved version the dpos algorithm alternative the second stage. second phase: hbth-dpos although pow mining can help safeguard metaverse's system security the initial years, has flaws such energy waste and the tendency for mining centralization. the dpos algorithm implemented from graphene can contribute high performing blockchain system. however, there are two flaws the design the dpos consensus mechanism: financial interference: acquiring large number tokens short amount time, attackers can interfere voting for against important proposals manipulate the token price for short-term profit. the current bitshares system, estimated that only usd million tokens are required manipulate voting results. voter apathy: voters (users) are often uninterested the state system. once they have chosen delegate, most voters are unlikely make switch even when the delegate turns out malicious. estimate that the past three months, only voters changed their delegate. metaverse improved the dpos consensus protocol adding the concepts token-height and heartbeat. explained the following model, token-height (th) stems from the concept token destruction: coindays number coins number days since the coins were last spent coindays metaverse constant using weigh votes dpos, metaverse aims avoid financial interference issues. attackers were temporarily acquire large amounts etp influence voting, their value would very small, and thus they would hold little influence over the voting process. achieve their goal, attackers must either acquire more etp from the market hold the etp for sufficient amount time gather th. both methods significantly increase the cost attack. the dpos phase, metaverse will distribute etp etp holders based their prevailing stake, similar other systems using the pos consensus protocol. however, the difference that etp holders will not passively receive etp. rather, they must send "heartbeat" the system indicate that they are still active. this heartbeat equivalent digital signature from the owner's private key. etp holders must choose either replace maintain their delegate when sending the heartbeat. (c)metaverse foundation there are two advantages implementing the heartbeat. firstly, this system motivates users check their delegates, alleviating though not fundamentally resolving the voter apathy problem. secondly, the system will not allocate new etp inactive holders, exerting dilution effect their holdings. the hbth-dpos phase, will consider using model below: the model specifications are below: separate etp's voting and transaction attributes, and define built-in voting tokens locked etp. define coinage the basis for calculation valid votes, which can prevent attacks carried out obtaining large numbers etp from the trading market. the concept coinage defined the accumulation rights and interests over time. this forms unforgeable "evidence," similar pow. consider that holding these rights and interests represents the cost and sacrifice paid holders. the computer's cpu gpu performs the verification the mathematical function similarly how the miner pays for the electricity cost and the computing cost. the formula for calculating coinage below: (coinage equal coindays.) locked(etp) the number etp locked special address prior voting; f(h) the time density function dependent height; the block height the beginning the locking period, the block height after the etp unlocked; the maximum height which etp locking can generate coinage. when this limit exceeded excess height will not generate new coinage; max the number blocks that can produce coinage; conversion parameter and has special significance; assume current height max conversion parameter locked(etp) the etp unlocked this point, then but max local client: voting address (etp for lock) locking completed through the transaction between these addresses, etp locked once the transaction completed when the etp unlocked, calculate unlock (height(unlock-lock)), calculate coinage unlock, unlocking the reverse the locking transaction, but unlocking does not happen instantaneously. the conditional functions for unlocking are: the first blocks unlock the locked etp. this number increases every blocks, i.e. the next hundred blocks unlock the locked etp, until all blocks are unlocked. density and cumulative functions for the amount unlocked etp's are shown below: (etp unlocked for every blocks density function) (etp unlocked for every blocks cumulative function) unlocking speed relatively slow first, but will increase over time. under this theory, takes about blocks complete the unlocking process. block time seconds, takes about hours for unlocking (c)metaverse foundation complete. furthermore, the amount etp unlocked the first hours accounts for only about the total. the total time needs adjusted, the height interval can modified increase the amount unlocked etp's. for example, the height interval increased blocks, the required time unlock doubles. change the unlocking speed while preserving the shape the curve, the rate unlocking blocks (increase ratio) should adjusted. for example, the ratio adjusted from the unlocking speed will decrease. other unlocking models are also available, but the one used here, geometric progression, the simplest. (c)metaverse foundation digital asset mst bitcoin's wiki entry mentioned that nick szabo researched and put forward concept called "smart property". reality, szabo simply defined class assets embedded with smart contracts that execute certain contractual terms. the ethereum project overemphasizes the concept smart contracts such that the existence digital assets dependent smart contracts. this design counterintuitive. the typical standard the erc token. although erc allows users easily transfer and store tokens, some problems exist with the ethereum contract accounts. for example, when the target account code incompatible, when exception triggered during the token transfer process, these situations cause accidental token loss. ethereum community developers therefore proposed the erc token. although this standard upgrades the security the digital assets, this switch corroborates the fact that the use smart contracts implement digital assets counter-intuitive design. the emergence the erc token also standardized the ico market. before erc came out, ico's lacked formal process, and new online token trading platforms needed long time prepare from technical perspective. with erc, the only requirement provide the contract account address ethereum supported platform. therefore the standardization the blockchain token inevitable, and this standardization for both platforms and applications will enhance blockchain potential and bring about considerable economic efficiencies. digital assets metaverse can characterized the metaverse smart token, mst. mst reemphasizes the importance digital assets, that for smart contracts work, they need digital assets and not the other way around. currently, metaverse has made technical extensions bitcoin's utxo model. bitcoin's utxo features will added mst, including security, traceability, and acid features. mst gives everyone the ability issue bitcoin the same price. mst can used for peer-to-peer payments and also supports variety financial instruments such asset additions and asset replacements. note: the original version the metaverse white paper labeled digital assets smart-property. designing mst asset registration (issuance) the first step designing mst referred the "registration" operation and entails finding set data that describes "asset." examples these data sets are equity registration, game property registration, and consumption points registration. the concept "registration" meant describe object with formatted data and has two key design characteristics: firstly, this set data description should reuseable and difficult tamper with. for example, the total amount released assets must conditionally modified. secondly, the design needs provide convenience, accurate queries, additions, and verification interfaces. the generic nature "asset" and its varying attributes relatively simple understand. asset registration can generally described form similar the following table: category common attributes digital asset field explanation identification property that uniquely identifies the asset total amount fundamental attribute verifying asset validity the time transfer after decimal point can customized decimal places places where special rights are stored, such distribution rights place storage for the custom attribute minimum unit special rights(asset certificate) custom attributes custom data fields (c)metaverse foundation important data points come from asset transfers. after mst satisfies the design the basic information structure, need consider how use this information. bitshares tried issue assets based market functions, but this method produced numerous limitations including complex overcollateralization, anchoring mechanism, price feed mechanism, etc. this practice has proved very limited because the underlying financial infrastructure was incomplete, and the market was unable make full use these applications large scale. new generation blockchain systems such bitshares and ethereum have explored the design and feasibility the proof assets (poa) protocol. bitshares, the authenticity digital assets can verified alternative means such posting one's private key signature forums providing asset certificate tied one's account credit. these digital assets can valued the open market those who recognize the assets. the issue with this method that inconvenient provide such verifications bitshares, and furthermore users lack incentive issue their blockchain assets low liquidity market. ethereum, smart contracts seem able solve all problems, including defining the erc token. some tokens can regarded digital assets because they store value and are editable. theoretically, smart contracts can support any business model, which gave rise projects such digix. digix cleverly sought out third parties (gold exchanges, accounting firms, custodians) provide series asset certifications that formed marketapproved evidence chain. this evidence recorded the blockchain, which makes the asset's registration tamper-proof. what mst can asset registration only the beginning, others then need recognize the asset (poa) form its attributes. otherwise there just bunch meaningless data. once the market recognizes mst, the digital assets represented mst will have two attributes: value attributes and operational attributes. value attributes are continuously reflected trading and market price changes. mst will implement operational attributes through technical means (virtual machine-based smart contracts enterprise-based scripting languages, etc.). operational attributes can add real world asset flow constraints digital assets registered the blockchain. metaverse will focus developing poa model for mst, our design will pay special attention using the metaverse digital identity help users provide proof assets. propose: value intermediaries, oracles, can use their off-chain data feed evidence asset value. from this viewpoint, third parties the digix project are all examples oracles. credit scores for digital identities can transmitted through blockchain transactions. when there enough proof the blockchain, the data the chain can prove itself. call this phenomenon "bootstrap proof". once have recognized mst, means that have "assets". the transfer assets the blockchain means that asset liquidity can guaranteed through the blockchain, asset transfer the most basic function mst. mst transfers are "lodged" etp transactions, using etp pay for transaction fees very natural. one can think small etp transfer part the mst transfer. metaverse not compatible with bitcoin technology standards, unlike the bitcoin compatible token coloredcoin. this allows have greater degree freedom expanding the bitcoin technology stack. (c)metaverse foundation payment fees believe justifiable require users pay registration fees since this mechanism for the system protect itself. there are costs (or negligible costs) registering mst, the system will vulnerable ddos attacks. stipulate that any type mst transfer must have etp fee. the next question is, what the appropriate fee charge? presently one can deduce how much token worth metaverse. terms design, this fee may variable, the fee model will use weighted system. for now, all the transaction fees generated the new transaction types metaverse will aggregated address managed viewfin, the company developing metaverse, support the development the metaverse community, and the remaining etp rewarded miners. reminder, metaverse foundation non-profit organization and does not perceive any the fees charged the platform. mst's basic features global uniqueness mst the smart contract token does not have global uniqueness, which might make inappropriate use the financial sector. usually require the token's symbol unique rather than the token's receiving address. the contract's asset symbol can repeated, fraudsters can construct tokens with the same symbol, users will unable quickly and accurately differentiate the token from the legitimate address smart contract. therefore, metaverse must construct globally unique token system. the token's symbol has the following two properties: rarity the unique symbol first come first serve system, with unique token symbols requiring registration taking into account the globally unique symbols, and facilitate easier differentiation for users, upper and lower case letters will insensitive. the above two points will propagate token symbol trading market, much like domain name exchanges. therefore mst must have the following features: symbol ownership can transferred the right use the symbol (name right) may granted others mst splits right use and right ownership. this feature not currently available any smart contract token systems. mst domain name space when designing the token symbol, reserved dot(.) allowable character. this trait can describe affiliation for the asset. for example sony.game sony.picture. this decreases the scarcity sought after symbols. for example, mvs issues btc symbols, and then viewfin.btc issued, which makes the latter more reliable. due the presence dot(.), the naming rights the symbol become tradable the symbol market. for example, you want use the viewfin prefix, you can contact viewfin's developer privately make purchase. mst's multiple operating paradigms mst supports the issuance globally unique tokens, and these tokens can perform the same payment function bitcoin. broader scale, however, operating just payment function insufficient. describe what mean below: (c)metaverse foundation total token circulation amount cannot modified after the intial release, which unsuitable. there need for incremental issuance. economic activities, sometimes there need freeze assets. however, the existence freeze asset function the blockchain represents platform tool help complete transactions, rather than economic model. asset freezing accompanied unlocking. the unlocking conditions represent the true meaning smart contract. metaverse will enforce the arbitration clause when the unlocking conditions are not met. swap the basic requirement asset that mst must fulfill. assets need destroyed specific occasions. exchange advanced requirement between assets that mst must fulfill. based the six points above, metaverse mst proposes the six functions below. mst secondary issue; mst lock; mst conditional unlock; mst swap; mst burn; mst exchange; these functions, along with issue and transfer, form the eight core functions mst, and they will iteratively upgrade through mip. investment threshold mst not only can support targeted asset requirements but can also connected the metaverse digital identity avatar. this means that avatar's reputation can reflected mst. for example, avatar called "eric" wants participate ico called "new-nasdaq", the ico's project initiators can design reputation barrier participate for this avatar. eric's reputation does not meet the threshold, then this transaction cannot accomplished the blockchain. mining token rewards pow produces two types transactions. the first one ordinary coinbase; the second the reward generated the token deposit lock. for the first type transaction, coinbase, can upgrade this with mst. from technical viewpoint, this entails extending utxo new types. the discernible effects this upgrade are: miner can configure mst mining site, i.e. when the target token sony.game, miner mines etp, the miner can obtain sony.game reward. this bonus can configured when sony.game released. considering the block contents, there should not lot mst mining sites. suggestion need miners proactively choose target mst. mst offering curve the setting the mining sweet spots will allow miners obtain etp related tokens through the token release process. this will help build the economic ecosystem mst. discovered, however, that sometimes people not need mine produce the "candy reward". more commonly set token release curve directly rather than see "candy reward" location mine. therefore mst must support the following three token release curves: initial offering additional offering transferring tokens (c)metaverse foundation mst compatibility under mainnet protocol upgrade the smart contract token also faces the problem upgrade incompatibility. for example, when erc was upgraded erc, smart contracts had rearranged, which means users must convert one smart contract another under the new standard (e.g. conversion losses when exchanging from erc erc). thus, designing our upgrade model, consider bitcoin's soft and hard fork upgrades, and how these did not cause trouble users such asking mine pools and users upgrade their wallet programs. for metaverse, using bitcoin's upgrade model more user-friendly. this allows business continue, opposed stopping business activities due technology upgrade. therefore, the mip (metaverse improvement proposal) can make mst's iterations backward compatible. mip does not require users redeploy contracts and redeem new tokens. (c)metaverse foundation digital identity avatar unlike assets such gold, are unable take physical possession digital assets. instead, the ownership digital assets controlled individuals through digital identities and secured through mathematical proofs that ensure these identities cannot forged. symbol user's online identity, avatar can used represent oneself and hold digital assets the blockchain. creating avatar far more than giving your public key alias, just cards and mobile numbers are not alias for your name. various pieces valuable information will attached each avatar's unique index and encrypted ensure data privacy. unless the avatar's owner grants authorization (by providing the private key signature, initiating special transaction, using smart contracts), users will not have access encrypted unencrypted information. hence, zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption play vital role allowing avatars retrieve information such credit scores and validation results without revealing the contents message. although the bitcoin system allows user hold bitcoin anonymously using public and private keypairs, most activities the real world require provide some form personal information: for example, you must provide your age and gender join young female entrepreneur's club. call the digital identity the metaverse blockchain the metaverse avatar. four primary issues the current model digital identity focused service access (eg: oauth. standard), does not provide true identities. fact, the internet does not have adequate identity layer. consequently, companies and public institutions have implemented ad-hoc system workaround internal databases incompatible data silos which they manage the identities people and things their data ecosystem. currently, blockchain also does not provide identity layer. want build blockchain-based identity, need analyze the current issues the existing identity model. issue identity data ownership issues personal information give out when joining club shopping online has more less directly been submitted operators. other words, our identity has always been recorded others, not ourselves. our identity information and data are used different service providers, suffice say the right use the data well the management and protection the ownership this data does not belong anyone. from the perspective property, digital identities are kind special personal asset. fact violation personal property user's digital identity information read without authorization. for example, share photo landscape social media platforms, the photo stored the database social media service providers. then, service providers launch travel ads nearby places users through various cookie tracking technologies, analyzing and categorizing the photo's information. thus, the providers take advantage initial data the photograph and gain indirectly from it. this where the boundaries data ownership and usage rights are blurred. here, can find that today's identity systems, whether based technology other media, have the problem blurred identity data ownership and user rights. (c)metaverse foundation issue maintaining the security identity data (leak and loss) even clearly define the boundaries data ownership and user rights, still face second problem, namely the risk information leak. long users' identity data are hosted centralized service provider, they will inevitably face: moral hazard the internal staff: your identity information cannot protected from prying eyes internal employees, for the evil side human nature can never avoided through the management system, and can only assume that employees not have malicious intentions. this situation even worse mainland china. internal employees can make high profits the black market selling users' personal information, including mobile numbers. data leak caused hacker attacks: every computer software system has bug; long defects exist, the system faces the risk malicious attacks. social media platforms continue gain popularity, the possibility attack increasingly relevant. the data leak facebook accounts and trading accounts cryptocurrency trading platforms provides recent example how this issue persists. issue duplicate and incompatible identity data after opening new website, repeat the process registration and verification which generates large amount identity data. fill the age, birthplace, and education status repeatedly. all these suggest there are effective identity systems with unified specifications and standards. need build identity system that independent from service providers. digital identity projects such cardspace and openid tried build such systems, but the results were not what expected. going forward, expect digital identity project that could help manage users' reputations and personal assets, instead simply managing application data. issue :fraud believe atmosphere ineffective digital identity standards the fundamental reason why e-commerce service platforms such taobao gained much popularity china. since the internet lacks effective identity standards, internet companies cannot uniquely identify bad actors who may receive the commodity but never pay for it. users may purchase fakes never receive the goods they bought. the most common case the sybil attack, where the user can launch attack the counterparty, resulting false identities being able access normal services. the statistic data below are quoted from the sovrin whitepaper: contact center call volume related password and account recovery shoppers abandon their shopping cart due username and password issues businesses struggle with fake users and average web-facing organization's user base will fake the average retailer cost for each stolen record containing sensitive and confidential information people the u.s. fall victim identity theft every minute--leading billion losses from million consumers digital identity standards references blockchain-based digital identity will face these same problems, and agreements become auto-enforceable and entries the database become immutable, these problems may get even worse. thus, need research existing digital identity standards and projects. there are some decentralized identity standards can refer to: (c)metaverse foundation fido uf/uaf, fido alliance web authentication, dids, dkms, verifiable claims, oauth. and oauth., ietf openid connect, openid foundation uma and otto, kantara initiative sovrin, sovrin foundation facebook connect, facebook found that openid connect and sorvin are close the metaverse avatar, focus analyzing these two identity standards. four types identiy classifications are mentioned the sovrin white paper. believe that this classification method line with reality. they are: centralized identity federated identity user-centric identity self-sovereign identity expect identity standards will not centralized and federated. user-centric reflects the situation current internet identity standards.the representatives the user-centric model facebook connect which like the openid standard. however, due commercialization, the user-centric model only recognizes user-centric data, and reality, users cannot control their identity. self-sovereign identity can regarded the ultimate ideal digital identity, which essentially changing from identity island model standard hierarchy model. order have true self-sovereign identity, need identity data usage and operational rights return the user. exploration blockchain-based decentralized identity, selective compatibility with already existing identity standards necessary. after all, the complete construction digital identity standards belonging the blockchain huge undertaking and involves much repetitive design work. order better understand this process, need clarify the concept identity ledger and identity terminal. (c)metaverse foundation identity ledger and identity terminal there are many blockchain related projects, such uport, shocard, netki, and ping identity. people are apt confused about concepts such identity ledger and identity terminal when discussing digital identities. first all, need define identity: identity refers the collective name give all the objective events that occur for any individuals institutions the natural sequence time. the event set has two features that can verified and authorized. then define identity ledger: identity ledger consists pieces records, which reflect the objective events that occurred identity. the identity ledger must satisfy two conditions. first, should record the objective event faithfully possible. second, the recorded event should the segment focus but not all the event. for example, bob was born shanghai and this event was recorded the internal database the shanghai public security bureau. all the records about bob this database constitute bob's identity ledger. finally, define the identity terminal, which the proxy terminal that users access enter into the identity ledger. the terminal supports the functions identity authentication and identity information access authorization. for example, your passport contains search index. when you show your passport, the inspector reads the and then connects the identity ledger find out and verify the validity and legality your information. thus, the passport itself only index and has the function containing credentials. however, does not represent your true identity. instead, the records the system form your identity. the identity terminal the closest part users. terminal technology developed rapidly and has improved from the previous magnetic stripe card the recent chip, and then the current face recognition and fingerprint verification. however, not intend innovate the identity terminal. blockchain essentially ledger and metaverse can provide people-centered and blockchain-based digital identity standard protocols. based this idea, metaverse able cooperate with various identity terminal providers construct set standard identity terminal interface specifications suitable for blockchains enhance the compatibility and practicality the entire digital identity system. next, can take advantage the biometric terminal allow the hardware support the digital identity protocol metaverse. for example, fingerprinting, facial recognition, voiceprint recognition, iris recognition, and other technologies can used access the metaverse identity ledger. reach consensus the concept identity terminals and identity ledgers, will design metaverse avatars based the following principles: the principle identity protection the basic principle protect users' identity information from infringement. first, users are obliged actively claim the ownership digital identities the metaverse blockchain "creating identity", "updating identity", and "certification". therefore the metaverse blockchain obligated provide users with secure and diverse interfaces, and help users exchange services with authorized access. (c)metaverse foundation the standardization the identity terminal interface the data format the identity ledger can customized according users' requirements. however, the format must meet the unified standard and can extended the interface, otherwise there will trouble accessing the identity terminal. identity profile and its claim very difficult build blockchain identity ledger that standardizes all identity data. however, after comprehensive analysis, need ensure that digital identity the metaverse blockchain satisfies the following characteristics and establishes open specification provide incentives that allow users get what they need through the identity ledger. privacy boundary records generated any identity have different sensitivities for disclosure. this sensitivity defined the privacy boundary. the privacy boundary composed two parts: human instinctive security and cultural constraints. for example, even there are moral constraints, most people cannot accept nudity public places. people lose their sense security because there refuge escape. finding sense security the main appeal privacy. secondly, cultural constraints vary depending geographic location. for example, people european countries are highly sensitive about pii(personally identifiable information). east asian countries, people are more tolerant privacy boundaries due the prevalence collectivism. for instance, parents can intervene the marriage and employment their adult children. the diversity privacy boundaries also determines the neutrality digital identities. the design must provide enough freedom that people can control their own privacy boundaries. thus, digital identities metaverse can take the following two methods guarantee the privacy boundary: provide anonymous transactions. pii should not stored the blockchain, even this data encrypted. reputation and profile assuming users now have the identity ledger metaverse, what the most important factor for them operate this ecosystem? reputation. the probability that the general public will accept new infrequently used digital identity low. the higher the frequency use, the more identity records will involved, which makes the identity more credible. other words, identity has more comprehensive record, and has been verified many times, the identity's credibility higher. thus, for metaverse, measuring the confidence the digital identity significant. confidence reflected two aspects: original on-chain records: these refer users' records originally generated the metaverse blockchain, such transfer records based digital identities and assets held under digital identities. records imported off-chain: these refer the data filed off the blockchain, namely the data-feed that users could import onto the metaverse blockchain. (c)metaverse foundation here can infer the basic structure the metaverse digital identity. first define profile the basic unit the identity ledger that describes identity. the profile includes the two records above and allows users calculate their own recognized reputation based these records. couple things note: the profile type guaranteed the transaction history the blockchain. metaverse provides accurate and convenient query interface. the profile type has multiple design patterns. erc, self-sovereign identity system, provides easy-touse design solution called claims-based identity. from large sample business cases, find that kyc certification systems for trading platforms are also claim-based. when the platform grants the user claim, indicates that the user has passed the kyc certification for the platform. the main function the data-feed fill information for claims-based identities. theoretically, one digital identity could have unlimited number claims with the following features: timeliness: any claim must have certain validity period. for example, kyc certification has validity period and not permanently valid. multi-faceted: any person institution multi-faceted. for example, engineer company could also parent child school. privacy control: based profile, any user can extrapolate this profile's information define reputation. for example, could make the rule that only the qualified profiles could participate ico. digital identity designation (did) connects digital assets avatar may represent real person, virtual figure that supported artificial intelligence (ai), machine the internet things (iot), even company. while one type digital asset may owned multiple avatars, each avatar should able own multiple types digital assets. there should multi-point relationship between avatars and digital assets. this relationship seems complicated but reflects the real ownership relationship real life. even have profile, this profile isolated unless linked digital assets. thus, need unique index the entire network, and this index also the certificate the identity, connecting the digital assets and digital identities. here define this kind index digital identity designation (did) whic globally unique the metaverse blockchain well: did can uniquely indexed certain profile and can bound any items the metaverse blockchain, which brings benefits anonymity. users can still use address-based digital assets, they can choose use did disclose their relationships with digital assets. with did, users can issue, transfer, collateralize, and secure digital assets without having rely wallet addresses. for example, did "chenhao". when eric pays etp issues his metaverse smart token (mst), could use "chenhao" substitute the wallet address. did looks like isolated "domain name system", for did not enough express its own relationship with mst and avatar. regard mst and avatar, can refer oop (object oriented programming). least three kinds relationships will shown between mst and avatars and also between avatars, namely has-a, is-a, and like-a. order realize the above three relationships, did, profile, and claim may need integrate with existing internet identities. for example, the claim the end user the oidc can mapped the claim under the profile that under the did. (c)metaverse foundation authentication and authorization profiles and did's solve data problems and not describe how users operate digital identities. there are only two core operations about digital identities: authentication and authorization. thus, have studied existing standard protocols for authentication and authorization: standard, oauth., and oidc (openid connect). applications based the standard are very broad, such the transport layer security (tls)/secure sockets layer (ssl) protocol. the tls/ssl protocol has been applied many internet applications. therefore, basic infrastructure standard. standard essentially (certification authorities) ca-based, which describes the behavior and format certificates. nevertheless, does not meet the concept identity ledger and identity terminal. only provides certificate model and has the following defects: root cannot revoked; the centralization issue using certificate revocation lists (crls) and online certificate status protocol (ocsp) reduces the security threshold; structure complex and not user-friendly; privacy and maintenance issues exist due over-aggregation different types claims; (extended validation), (domain validation), and (organization validation) are susceptible repeated man-in-the-middle attacks therefore, building avatars directly based not good choice. although this standard can immediately support large number applications, lot extra work remains order make this option viable. oauth. oauth. open standard protocol for authorization that enables application access certain user information resources from another web service, without giving the user's credentials for the web service the web application. oauth. has already become the widely used standard protocol for internet application authorization. through analysis, can find that the popularity oauth. based the authorization agreement the usercentric model, which also reveals that oauth. can only complete parts functions for digital identities, rather than all functions. oauth excellent tool, but still oriented towards centralized services. since there concept defining digital identities, the centralization issue will not solved until the establishment the next standard oidc (openid connect). openid connect openid connect simple identity layer top the oauth protocol. openid connect allows clients verify the identity the end-user based the authentication performed authorization server. this also allows clients obtain basic profile information about the end-user interoperable and restlike manner. currently google identity platform and google+ applications play the biggest roles for the promotion this project. (c)metaverse foundation google, super portal the internet era, stores large amount personal identity data. third-party applications are allowed access and use google account-related information through the authorization oidc. although facebook, google, tencent, alibaba, and microsoft all use oidc, the personal data each platform independently stored and cannot mutually authorized and verified. other words, identity data compatible within the platforms (issue but this data not compatible between platforms. since personal data hosted the platform, issue has not been resolved. can argued that oidc has improved the situation issue issue and issue but these issues have not really been resolved, i.e. the recent data leakage incident million users facebook. metaverse avatar mav (metaverse avatar) open identity standard protocol based blockchain and can compatible with oidc. from technical perspective, avatar oidc's protocol extension the blockchain. clear, mav not mapping the existing identity system and unable fully achieve the ideal autonomous identity. the reason follows: due the limitation blockchain storage capacity, people cannot store massive amounts identity information the blockchain. increasing blockchain performance only exacerbates block growth. when the size the blockchain overused application, resulting per day size increase, the blockchain loses its significance public resource. need divide mav into two levels solve this problem: the first level oidc, and the second level mav metadata. recommend using oidc solve the problem mass storage. oidc can implement ipfs storage protocol use cloud storage. both solutions can solved mbaas. metadata provides blockchain-level records, and this where metadata refers the key information the identity. the kyc case the trading platform, metadata refers the verification result kyc. metadata can stored the profile under the did. other words, the mav profile provides metadata with onchain data container. mav needs consider the following two aspects: relationship management:the relationship between mav's manifested metadata well the relationship between mav and mst; permission control avatar: mav's permission control over metadata, mav's permission control over oidc; metadata sign distinguish whether the identity data the chain. for self-aware subjects (usually humans, the future may artificial intelligence), suggest that pii information resides oidc instead metadata. for all kinds physical and virtual assets, such private cars and pets, can generate metadata via identifiable information, then register the metadata the chain. firstly, the verification and authorization mav based oidc. secondly, the authorization process based zero-knowledge proofs the authorization process based homomorphic encryption also provided the chain. oracles ---- value intermediaries some blockchain projects claim they not need trusted intermediaries ("cutting out the middleman"). the moment, believe this bit out reach. (c)metaverse foundation the credibility the off-chain data-feed cannot guaranteed the blockchain since the blockchain cannot judge whether the data-feed reliable. for example, mst contract could only unlocked the rainfall reaches milliliters shanghai three days later. during the process, oracle will inevitably involved since blockchain unable forecast the weather conditions. the mst contract imports the off-chain data-feed from the yahoo weather database. thus, one oracle needed guarantee the unlock, and another oracle needed for arbitration case disagreement. three oracle intermediaries are needed this contract regarding weather forecast shanghai: one for imputing data, the second for group arbitration, and the third act guarantor. instead "destroying the middleman", metaverse will reserve position for one the blockchain, which call oracle. host oracles can store physical assets and then issue smart assets the blockchain. authentication oracles can provide proof personal information and correlation with avatars. supervision oracles (for example, government departments that regulate special transactions) can provide proofs, such transaction authenticity proof compliance. there are many other oracles that can provide such services metaverse. oracle special type avatar and based avatar's authentication and authorization system. these are many built-in functions the metaverse blockchain, and anyone can claim oracle unconditionally. however, how can prove that the service provided oracle faithful? depends whether the oracle's avatar record rich enough and whether the reputation high enough support the credibility the services claimed. this will greatly expand the types transactions metaverse. each transaction type can connected the digital asset mst, can expect that the added value total transaction fees and the transaction volume will increase. used discuss how reduce transaction fees (usage fees) for bitcoin bitcoin-like payment systems. the expansion the volume and the speed block production the one hand meets the needs the business, and the other hand allows the continuous injection value into the system, which allows miners and billing nodes have enough incentives join our system. re-examine the problem, charging transaction fees not just for transactions, but for blockchain services such the purchase value intermediaries the creation smart contracts, allows the value blockchain not solely reliant its block capacity and creation rate. blockchains can create value enhancing service quality and increasing the types services available, ushering new opportunities. the incentive model for miners will also reach new equilibrium since they will derive more benefit from services with high transaction fees. the past, these services were conducted offline and did not utilize the benefits blockchain technology (except record the transaction). similarly, they did not feed back into the blockchain (except for the transfer fee). recording these "transactions" feels somewhat pointless since all services will priced blockchain tokens based their market value, scarcity, importance, and other characteristics. two phases the development avatars will through the following two phases. call them the introduction proof phase and the self-proving phase. introduction proof phase: when the on-chain data insufficient support the credibility digital identity, necessary directly introduce off-chain data prove the credibility. for example, prove that your birth date true, you may use your passport proof. self-proving phase: when the on-chain data enough support the credibility the avatar, there need import the off-chain data. for example, your date birth has been verified other oracles, the authenticator could use this data directly. the introduction proof the initial stage digital identity development. the increase users causes the number proven oracle verifications sufficient. then new applications can directly established the system without the need reintroduce proofs. oracle plays essential role during this process. (c)metaverse foundation blockchain service(baas) from the perspective oracles, the existence value intermediaries inevitable, which makes metaverse different from other blockchain platforms that only provide decentralized applications. the blockchain itself decentralized, but that does not mean the applications must also decentralized. decentralization applications like breaking the civilized structures mankind that have lasted for thousands years. information providers and information consumers will always exist information circulatory systems.this phenomenon determined the structure human society, very difficult eliminate the gap between the two roles. assuming that information asymmetry eliminated (in fact, can only reduced and cannot eliminated), cognitive asymmetry still exists between people. since human energy limited, individuals cannot absolutely learn all the knowledge that humans have obtained. for example, when taking doctor's advice, the premise patient trusts the doctor. there new model that can build applications without relying trust, this implies that human social structure will change dramatically. for example, not need trust any doctors and could get valuable advice from any hospitals, will this system break down when doctors disagree their diagnosis? matter what type application, the provider the application must act both the server and the party that takes advantage the information. the users play the role consumers. long these two roles exist, the application cannot decentralized. further, centralization could gather high quality services and resources only all the services human society could replaced with artificial intelligence and code, which highly unlikely happen. for example, what intelligent decentralized trading platform that uses tls/ ssl encrypt network communications leads the similar heartbleed loophole who will responsible for the loss thousands users' assets? based the above discussion, metaverse believes that the best link between the blockchain and reality for the metaverse blockchain become one the underlying infrastructures the internet. metaverse does not destabilize centralized internet applications. instead, complement the internet introducing cryptocurrencies and digital assets, thus quickly penetrating the internet. this allows all our applications enjoy the convenience digital finance virtually cost. this process, oracle can centralized human-controlled application, can the code certain dapp. oracles provide services for people and are also supervised the people. all these actions occur metaverse, instead different systems. smart contracts and bisc (built-in smart contract) the development blockchain technology can compared the development computer technology. for example, bitcoin assembly language and achieves basic payment functionality. then consider dozens smart contract platforms such ethereum that can provide advanced programming languages. most technical personnel may not agree that the development direction computer technology the same the development programming languages. technology all-encompassing, and programming language just one tool set underneath technology. besides, the popularity programming language determined the ecological diversity applications that support the language's framework. could say that some common libraries and frameworks these programming languages are development directions, such vue.js for javascript, boost library for c++, tensorflow for deep learning framework, and apache hadoop for big data processing. (c)metaverse foundation what vue.js the field blockchain? the answer series generic smart contract standards (templates) that can help real-world modeling, like erc and erc. the reason why erc gained popularity rapidly because its ability tokenize. due the prevalence erc, not many people understand what the erc standard is. then what tensorflow the field blockchain? the basic framework incorporated the digital assets and digital identities that are built the system, rather than single functional infrastructure consisting individual templates. further analyze, can find that bitcoin trying avoid using turing complete language for smart contracts. for bitcoin, the first priority complete stable, efficient, and secure payment. bitcoin scripting actually light smart contract template, for example psh scripts can support multi-signature payments, which then could meet bitcoin's payment demand. radical programmable smart contracts often bring potential security issues, and not think bitcoin's core developers want these issues. adding turing complete and programmable languages are not required for the security bitcoin's payment system. following the idea bitcoin, metaverse should provide users with stable and secure smart contract templates for digital assets (metaverse smart token) and provide smart contract templates for digital identities (metaverse avatar) the metaverse blockchain. uniformly name these standard templates built-in smart contract (bisc). bisc can implemented through bitcoin script, ethereum virtual machine (evm), webassembly (wasm). programming, have two common patterns. the first oop (object-oriented programming) and ood (object-oriented design), and the second (functional programming). considering the account-state model now, smart contracts based account models are more suitable for oop, while utxo models are more suitable for fp. due the security the constructed bisc, etp and digital assets themselves may more suitable for the utxo+fp model. building this utxo+fp model construct more complex codes conduct requires the experience ood. based the above ideas, bisc first needs generalization standard templates for digital assets (mst) and digital identities (avatar). these may based utxo+ft rather than redefining their own applications with ood (realization, dependency, association, aggregation, composition and inheritance). are considering provide bisc block-areas the metaverse blockchain. developers can use bisc directly run instance bisc. the effect may look like this: the code shows the procedure buying eric.btc using etps. the mst and avatar here are the biscs the metaverse blockchain. this code also determines whether the avatar named chenhao has achieved the reputation threshold. depending the scenario, this code can deployed the blockchain, can ordinary python script. recommend people use biscs with sidechains traditional applications. this the concept baas that will discuss next. blockchain service want define baas, first need find the connection between baas and paas. (c)metaverse foundation paas provides useful basic business components, such amazon translation service and aliyun sms service. these services are not simply technical frameworks, but services that can achieve specific functions. consider that bitcoin provides global payment processing, will this function integrated into cloud computing platforms? definitely yes. for many applications with payment needs, the process building bitcoin nodes and data structure the blockchain database extremely time-consuming and painful. after all, the api provided bitcoin's full nodes limited, and users' query requirements may meticulously accurate the transaction output and script signatures. based the analysis above, can find that many cryptocurrencies can made available users based paas services. thus, can give definition blockchain service (baas). blockchain-as-a-service represents public blockchain services that can integrated into traditional architectures internet architectures providing multiple ways querying, transaction broadcasting, and transaction verification. these services were previously fragmented, including tokenization, avatar services, and oracle services. now baas gives these services standards and specifications. currently, most block explorers and cryptocurrency trading platforms are built public cloud services. then, these platforms must build their own digital asset management and verification services the cloud. cloud service vendors can provide common basic framework, just like amazon translate services. can provide derivative version paas based blockchain technology: baas. next consider software service (saas). the best example saas google docs. service fees for using vendor's applications are charged based length use and users' actual needs. this the distinguishing feature saas. bitcoin also kind saas, but bitcoin does not have specific cloud service provider. regard the bitcoin network open cloud that can provide notary announcement services and transaction fees charged block size, then could say bitcoin saas, like the example blockchain.info. the diagram below can explain these concepts: baas (blockchain service) the variant paas btaas(blockchain technology service) the variant paas bsaas(blockchain software service) the variant saas bsaas allows users quickly build services directly with blockchain technology and visualize the construction process. present, bsaas not mature. there are mature applications available currently. cryptokitties, however, provides one example bsaas. ibm and microsoft have proposed the concept baas that benchmarks paas. here, split the baas concept into btaas and baas. the difference here whether use the blockchain technology framework build its own permissioned chain use the services the public blockchain. ibm and microsoft have proposed the former concept baas. here change this concept into btaas, which can solved through traditional solutions, such using (c)metaverse foundation service-oriented architecture (soa) based software replace blockchains build complex in-house enterprise applications. the permissioned chain represents the activity between few nodes and often degenerates into game microeconomics. therefore, using permissioned chain build collaborative system between small number nodes does not pose technical challenge and evolves into how construct stable microeconomic model that enables collaborators achieve pareto improvement. this case, the technology secondary. the services provided the public blockchain are often richer than the services provided the permissioned blockchain. the public chain has anonymity and rights management mechanisms, the public chain can completely replace the permissioned chain. baas, not bsaas and btaas, concerns metaverse the most. baas means that the service provided public blockchains will conveniently integrated into existing internet applications and services, such the payment function provided bitcoin. metaverse will provide avatar and mst services. for example, e-commerce providers can provide mst registration services for stores. then the stores can issue their own bonus-point system based the metaverse blockchain. these bonus points share the advantages blockchain that enable immutable transactions circulate freely the chain. the process described below: finally, oracles and project developers can utilize bisc, and bisc can processed through the baas model. furthermore, project stakeholders can use bisc develop variety centralized applications, and oracles can use bisc endorse their digital identities. users can supervise the project stakeholders via bisc. these three parties can form on-chain closed loop. metaverse blockchain service (mbaas) the basic function cryptocurrency payment, the integration cryptocurrency payment services quite simple. bitcoin considered defined payment gateway, its position the architecture will clear and can incorporated into the fund management module. regarding mst and avatar services provided metaverse, metaverse blockchain able play the following roles common systems: (c)metaverse foundation assume that all systems have their own account module, login module, core-business module, and back office. digital identities can used support the account module existing internet applications and services; digital assets mst allows you create your own digital assets without having build your own blockchain infrastructure. oracles can increase risk resistance capacity for business. the above services are collectively referred mbaas. mbaas can provide infrastructure services for any existing internet applications, services, and even internet things (iot) devices. these services use digital identities the main entry point provide people with convenient and simple asset digitization capabilities. considering the complexity blockchain application development, metaverse endeavors reduce the difficulty technology integration and focus more innovation rather than the underlying technology the blockchain. the baas model essentially provides integration idea. below are two baas problems that need solved urgently. integration issues: there exists need establish stable technical framework for the integration baas solutions and existing internet applications and services digital asset management issues: digital asset management tools for companies that provide secure access private key management mechanisms mbaas also faces the above issues, and our solutions for these issues are below: the full-node wallet and the light wallet are crude partitions, and they cannot meet the diverse demands the architecture. result, the decoupling the wallet function needed provide independent module programs that run separately. solved (hierarchical deterministic) private key management mechanism that provides multi-signature. and multi-signatures are relatively mature technologies. thus, aggregation will prime concern for mbaas. mbaas architecture patterns there are many architecture patterns. will only discuss monolith applications, layered architecture pattern, event-driven architecture pattern, and micro-service architecture pattern. then will discuss where mbaas should fit these architecture patterns. mbaas and wallets firstly, mbaas collection services that manifested the system daemon processes. running wallet program usually provides mbaas. hence, there are two modes for wallet programs: (c)metaverse foundation decoupling mode: separation functions from the wallet program, each function runs detached multi-process that provides mbaas service. combined mode: the wallet program provides mbaas, but the wallet can form dominant relationship and create internal distribution network instead connecting the public network. the combined mode puts higher requirements the optimization and stability wallets. decoupling mode metaverse provides the following basic module separation: network service; transaction verification and parsing; private key management; structured persistent storage blocks, mysql/mongodb. light-wallet the first decoupling mode program derived from the full-node wallet. combined mode the wallet program provides high speed synchronization mode internal network. those nodes can architectured wallet cluster, which has strong stability, even when the chain has forked. regarding block storage, wallets should support rds(mysql/mongodb) connections. decoupling mode combined mode are not used alone; they may combined into hybrid real use cases. next, will discuss mbaas the popular architecture patterns with these two modes. monolith applications monolith applications can classified into client-side monolith applications and server-side monolith applications. example monolith application wordpress. want wordpress support mst, the fastest way deploy metaverse wallet the wordpress backend server, then call mst apis send through the blockchain transaction. the front-end displays the mst token. this situation suitable for combined mode and easy deployment. monolith applications are more commonly used the micro-kernel architecture pattern. for example, the metaverse avatar can embedded the eclipse ide, which requires the metaverse light wallet plugged into eclipse plugin. this situation suitable for decoupling mode, such the light wallet. layered architecture layered architecture suitable for both decoupling mode and combined mode, depending the scale architecture. the decoupling mode suitable for large scale layered architectures. for example, the combined mode not satisfactory soa. considering the decoupling mode, mbaas suitable for the business layer the layered architecture. become common component, mbaas only requires the wallet's api compatible possible with other modules the business layer. there persistence layer, structured block storage may required, otherwise the wallet itself may used instead the block storage. considering the combined mode, mbaas suitable for small scale applications. the mbaas can built with reference the server-side monolith applications. event-driven architecture (c)metaverse foundation event-driven architecture suitable for the decoupling mode since focuses the forward processing events. the process blockchain based transactions, and the transactions themselves are events, the event-driven architecture, the decoupling mode the most appropriate. the mediator model, transactions need parsed and forwarded. the account-base model, the system also needs the ability read the account-state directly. the broker model, each processor has the ability parse and validate transactions, and the broker will stay the same state. the above analysis considers incoming transactions event. regarding outgoing transactions, can think wallet processor, the wallet only processes target events from the blockchain. here may have problem, the wallet evolves into central processor. since the ultimate purpose any core business payment, the wallet will face performance bottleneck. therefore, may need wallet clusters solve this issue. horizontal scalability important for the decoupling mode event-driven architecture pattern. micro-services architecture micro-services architecture suitable for combined mode and can also applied decoupling mode. the combined mode, for the wallet microservice component only requires the wallet function cohesive enough. for example, the wallet can play the role payment component and play the role transaction verification component this requires that the wallet's behavior fits closely possible the micro-services the micro-services architecture, and provides ample query and verification apis. the decoupling mode seems fit well with micro-services architecture. therefore, providing standardized metaverse micro-service components not too difficult and can the primary solution consider. (c)metaverse foundation mst exchange able trade the blockchain advanced requirement mst, mainly for scalability under these options: option graphene graphene the more mature technology presently. support transactions the blockchain, metaverse considers integrating graphene, which faces the following technical challenges: mst backward compatibility avatar and dpos algorithm compatibility compatibility utxo model and graphene account model transaction compatibility encryption module compatibility coupling module controllability option on-chain settlement, off-chain matching protocol-like) bitcoin's segwit and the lightning network provide good scalability. after upgrading segwit, metaverse can set on-chain settlement agreement similar the project, using incentives exchange order and market data for many trading platforms. (c)metaverse foundation potential risks and concerns blockchain technology still stage rapid development, and continuous research will explore how best mature this technology. metaverse comes from the bitcoin system, will inherit the advantages the bitcoin system, well some flaws. the ever increasing blockchain size the bitcoin blockchain grows approximately every minutes, that weekly, which makes the cost running full bitcoin node increasingly expensive. the number full nodes has been decline since the peak more than nodes globally roughly july the ethereum blockchain grows roughly monthly ever increasing rate. metaverse blockchain will suffer the same problem. disregard the decentralization principle, the utxo model can support block cut off. the cut off position can start from the block where the oldest utxo located. starting from this position defined the "milestone" block, since its meaning close the genesis block. mining centralization mining double-edged sword. the one hand, mining can arithmetically protect the system from attacks. the other hand, mining has created new problems, such the problem mining centralization and the threat attacks. mining centralization much detested the bitcoin industry, and ethereum also gradually losing its initiative the face mining centralization. metaverse will optimize its mining algorithm, and although this probably will not sufficient enough eliminate this problem, can slow the centralization process until the consensus algorithm switches from pow hbth-dpos. failure success should metaverse become very successful the future, new risk will arise. when the total value digital assets metaverse rises certain level, will become profitable sabotage metaverse while shorting the assets the exchanges means attack. thus, the total value digital assets metaverse function the cost defending/attacking the system (mining cost the pow stage). ideally, the total value digital assets should not exceed five times the cost mining. conclusion like bitshares and ethereum, metaverse was derived from bitcoin, utilizing blockchain technology solve problems other than simply being digital cash system. from bitshares came decentralized exchanges, and from ethereum came smart contracts and decentralized application platforms. clearly defining digital assets and digital id, and emphasizing the importance the on-chain oracles, metaverse assures the rightful ownership assets digitally, building the foundation for future digital finance. metaverse, avatars are able securely transact digital assets with the help value intermediaries oracles. thanks blockchain technology, metaverse inherently has its own immutable ledger and solves the problem double spending, penetrating beyond the realm digital cash all potential digital assets.
