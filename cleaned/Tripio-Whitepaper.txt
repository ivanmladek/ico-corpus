blockchain. leverages the decentralized network provided blockchain technologies directly connect global customers and service providers. moreover, builds service ecosystem based transparent, tamper-resistant trust and incentives. the blockchain technologies tripio leverages help reduce transactional and operational costs travel industries, well improve customer experience their respective products and services. the tripio platform, service provider can publish her unique service terms and conditions using smart contracts. from the moment purchase initiates the end the travel, every step along the way can enforced and monitored smart contracts. should disputes arise, tripio provides dispute resolution means community self- government mechanisms. tripio comprises its dapps and set tripio protocols that forms the basis the new ecosystem. the tripio dapp and the tripio protocals are powered the erc- utility token called the trio token. customers may use tripio dapps directly. the same, any third-party may build its own dapp leveraging the open ethereum protocols. the tripio platform consisted the following four systems. service and identity registration system service providers use this system register services and create listings. they need pass kyc (know your customer) authentication. user data are strictly encrypted, only authorized service providers may access user data based smart contracts and legitimate reasons. payment and transaction system customer may use any legal fiat currency digital currency (e.g. usd, eur, eth, ltc, xrp and trio) purchase service the marketplace. tripio's transaction system will perform transactional processing based the needs both customers and service providers. for example, specific smart contract may hold the payment until service rendered and confirmed both parties, and subsequently make payment particular currency. reputation system upon completion transaction, participating parties may rate each other, optionally with supporting reviews. rating and review information stored the blockchain. these ratings and reviews form the basis reputation for all participants the tripio ecosystem. dispute resolution system when disputes arise during service, such damaged furniture broken wifi service, automated process kicks form arbitration committee order settle the dispute. arbiters' voting power determined her reputation and number trios held (reflecting her shared interest the healthiness the tripio ecosystem). this whitepaper will describe more details the application scenarios the tripio platform, well the working mechanisms its subsystems. addition, will lay out how the trio token plays vital role the ecosystems. one fundamental benefit the blockchain that can help construct more dependable and robust economic system. tripio aims fundamentally solve the problems fraud and unjust gain that still exist extensively the industries. with increasing participation tripio, network effect will help bring more transparency and efficiency into the travel market. our targets ... restructuring incentive mechanism values brought current sharing economy community participants did not increase along with the increase market, thereby, tripio will restructure incentive mechanism unceasingly stimulate participants community adjusting the value distribution optimization market with the help trio token. ... restructuring credit mechanism with the help the public distribution account book ethereum, tripio established credit system provide ecological participants with user experience based trust and security. ... reducing economic cost using trio token make hotel booking the basis the intelligent protocols trio token, service providers have need pay any commission and operating cost will reduced for the most part, meanwhile, users will get better services with lower prices. our advantages baihuichang.com first came online the beginning and are called media the real pioneer the field sharing space. moreover, are the real practitioner sharing economy with team more than one hundred members. until january there are millions users and thousand sharing spaces baihuichang.com, already operating platform for booking sharing space with million rmb raised. what's different from many other block chain start-ups that we've already had verified business model, clear vision and well-planned roadmap implement rapid global expansion. date establishment shared space completed financing opening city team user growth locations investment institutes blueridge capital caixin capital frees capital rongdao capital cvte analysis tourism market the scale tourism market travel tourism generated trillion usd (.% global gdp) last year. this sector accounted for total global exports and almost total global service exports. the income was generated through online travel agencies. the world travel tourism council concluded, according data from countries and regions, this market grew pace during "for the sixth successive year, growth travel tourism outpaced that the global economy (.%)... nations seem looking increasingly inward, putting place barriers trade and movement people, the role travel tourism becomes even more significant, engine economic development and vehicle for sharing cultures, creating peace, and building mutual understanding." david skosl, the president and ceo wttc forecast global tourism market this industry created million jobs equivalent jobs the global economy. accounted for total global exports and almost total global service exports. forecasted grow average until the scale accommodation reservation accommodation market will still the highest proportion the future process industry growth. the proportion accommodation market the overall tourism market was percent the year the proportion hotel market was percent while the proportion non-standard accommodation such home-stay and short-term accommodation was percent. the past, the basic product forms tourism are "scenery and wine" --- scenery provided allopatric links and wine provided local-life links. nevertheless, the rise home-stay, inns, short-rented apartment and longrented apartment recent years breaks the single- pattern that traditional hotels occupy "wine" filed. under the circumstance that the number tourists persistently increasing, difficult for traditional hotels satisfy the personalized demands customers, however, the development "nonstandard accommodation" fills the gap market. word, accommodation market has shaped pattern considering hotels the major part and non-standard accommodation such home-stay and short-rented apartment important supplements. nowadays, larger number tourists choose the short-rented accommodation sharing economy style, the longer they live, the more likely for them choose short-rented accommodation. the reasons this situation are that short-rented industry better combines internet technologies with lower cost and digs deeper than traditional hotels the aspects customers' localization experience and supervision services. competition analysis tourism platforms percent customers will use online tourism platforms when they are making choice about purchasing tourism services. global online tourism application has formed stable pattern after the development for many years. and global online tourism application main monopoly four groups priceline, expedia, ctrip and tripadvisor .under the market environment whose competition pattern was basically fixed, the channel pricing right mastered otas. nevertheless, ota's commission that percent caused that the profits hotels are greatly compressed, hotels have become the offline "service party" ota and failed share the dividend brought the flourishing development ota. one the iconic events can concluded follow: july one the biggest domestic online tourism application declared that "reducing the traffic marriott international hotels from now and ranking them the bottom". this event triggered extensive discussion this industry and was deemed the inevitable result the long-time bitterness between hotels, and the focus the public opinion vortex ota was the high commission fee ota. travel tech media the pain point tourism accommodation market ... bilateral credit problems along with people's ceaselessly increasing tourism demand, the trust between hotels and customers, landlord and tenant has been totally entrusted third party intermediaries based centralized operation such applications like ota, airbnb. nevertheless, centralized intermediary applications cannot completely sure about the credit verification suppliers, landlord and tenants the process pursuing high commission and the credit data will not shared lower credit risk, thereby, large number situation deviating from credit rules constantly happened. scenario one: user reserved standard room hotel tourism website when this website presented there still were many rooms and withheld. however, this user was told that there was standard room when arriving hotel. the competition and distrust with intermediary applications caused that hotels are unwilling provide real storage and then lead the interruption the whole reservation credit chain. scenario two: user reserved three rooms hotel and has prepaid the room charge reservation website. however, this user was told the rise price and that he/she could check only after paying extra fee. scenario three: landlord issues house resources sharing short-rented applications and installs cameras several places the room carry uninterrupted privacy monitoring tenants. scenario four: tenant reserved room sharing short-rented application, but he/she took away the precious calligraphy and painting hanging the room the landlord when check out room and then brought great loss the landlord. ... counterfeiting comments when customers are purchasing services through online tourism applications, score and comment are the most important factors influencing decision except price. the meaning comment relies reflecting the situation merchants' products and services more real way through users' sharing personal experience. comments with high quality are helpful for customers make optimal purchase choice. along with the increase the competition intensity between merchants, manipulating comment has become one kind tool and method attacking opponents and increasing sales. extreme role appeared under this background full-time negative comment maker. account the much importance attached public praise and score, some hotels stipulated that relative employee kpi would influenced any negative comment appeared. what more important that negative comments will also influence the ranking hotel e-commerce applications (centralized applications). for the sake dealing with negative comments, many hotels try improve their rankings applications through methods counterfeiting comments and counterfeiting order forms. vicious circle negative comments and counterfeiting order forms has been formed online reservation applications. the competition and market authority has investigated some the fake comments existing some english websites which including amazon and trip advisor. according reports, some really excellent hotels and restaurants may not get corresponding amount access and feedback whereas some merchants using unfair competition methods are the top four the positive comment list. ... commission staying all-time high level the centralized tourism accommodation reservation market, the charge proportion commission staying all-time high level. commission ota application:% commission sharing short-rented application:% the competition and markets authority (cma) has launched investigation into third-party hotel booking sites amid concerns over the clarity, accuracy and presentation their company information including how they make money. https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk ... high transaction fee the process current centralized service transaction, the cost transaction fee mounts percent. for instance: fee financial institutes the fixed fees managing transaction charged visa, mastercard and some other financial institutes. fee foreign exchange transactions (%)- handling charge for foreign exchange transaction should paid for each transaction the cases cross-border transactions. ... high operating cost centralized transaction market, the operating cost intermediary application occupies large proportion the total capital expenditure. considering ota industry example, one the domestic otas established operating center with more than ten thousand employees ensure operating ability. ctrip.com: https://pages.ctrip.com/public/aboutctrip/ac_corstre.html product plan tripio developed based ethereum smart contracts. ethereum consensus-based, expandable, standardized, developer-friendly and collaboration-friendly blockchain. leveraging the full-fledged and turing- complete programming language built into the ethereum blockchain, tripio redefines transaction models and state transition function rules, and hence construct various smart contracts power travel services new and innovative ways. redundant distributed system, ethereum, well other blockchains including bitcoin, has intrinsic constraints such high computational workload and high storage cost. tripio will use both on-chain and off-chain solutions build complete and usable system. for example, will store pictures and comments off-chain using inter planetary file system (ipfs) and generate hash values top them used conjunction pointers the chain. ethereum oracle the bridge between smart contracts and external environment (url access, information other blockchains such bitcoin). tripio abstracts the various smart contracts and off-chain services into tripio protocols through oracle, and provides standardized support internet applications, well dapps. meanwhile, tripio's own applications are also developed top the tripio protocols. service and identity registration system ... service registration service provider uses tripio's smart contract template publish service. for example, hotel manager can create new room type, with supporting information such pictures, service descriptions, room dimensions, wi-fi availability, breakfast options, and terms and conditions, for set listing fee, payable trio tokens. tripio automatically stores these data into ipfs files and generate corresponding hash values service identification codes used smart contracts. the charge trio token's main purpose prevent service abuses. these tokens will redistributed into incentive pool upon the first completion purchase and related smart contract executions. tripio uses machine learning technologies perform safety and other necessary filtering uploaded pictures and texts, order prevent harmful information from entering the tripio ecosystem. should the aforementioned filtering mechanism fail, safety committee forms the delegated proof stake (dpos) mechanism, and the committed may vote whether purge harmful content. factors considered forming the safety committee include number trio tokens held, timespan token ownership, reputation rating, and diligence duties performed. ... identity registration both service providers and customers need through know your customer (kyc) process. kyc standard business practices for many companies. however, for any companies with global operations, the kyc complicated task. even today, many service providers still handwrite customer and transaction information, which means sensitive information risk being leaked stolen daily basis. tripio uses asymmetrical cryptography encrypt identity information and store them ipfs. only under specified business scenarios, authorized party may access identity information through smart contracts. for instance, upon signage service contract between service provider and customer, one party may access the other's identity information. service provider may grant access part all its company information all visitors. payment and transaction system due the many layers middlemen the travel industry, approximately the transactional value consumed these layers, the forms listings fees, settlement fees, currency conversion feeds, etc. when customer pays for service, the actual service provider only receives around this inefficiency hurts both the customer and the service provider. the tripio platform, there middleman cost when the transaction done through trio tokens. even the event other payments methods, tripio only charges currency conversation fee. eliminating the middleman layers, transactional overhead greatly reduced. trading and settlement methods: the left picture shows the transaction using trio, the right picture shows the transaction using different currencies. ... payment initiation customer finds services leveraging search, browse, filter, and related utilities provided tripio. she learns the service terms and conditions and confirms her purchasing intent. tripio generates smart contract for this transaction, based service registration information. the customer then makes payment, fiat digital currency, the smart contract. for some services, such room sharing, service provider may request additional trios security deposit. the same time, service provider may required provide set number trios good faith collateral. these rules are spelled out the initial service registration process. upon confirmation both sides, tripio generate proof purchase, stores ipfs and provides the parties involved. ... transaction confirmation while service process, funds from both parties are locked the smart contract. only after the service rendered and confirmed through the bidirectional smart contract two sides, funds and related deposits are disbursed the appropriate accounts, e.g. digital wallets bank accounts. after transaction completed, parties may review each other. should disputes arise, the smart contract locks the funds questions and imitates dispute resolution system. only releases the funds until final arbitration status reached. ... about fiat currency firmly believe that digital currency will extensively accepted the future, however, most transactions all need fiat currency method payment for the current business environment, especially for most the service providing enterprises, fiat currency the only currency that can used assets. for the sake making the various advantages block chain technology apply fast possible tourism industry, tripio will help both parties transactions automatically finish the exchange between digital currency and fiat currency. other words, customers can pay digital currency and service providers will get fiat currencies equal value. furthermore, tripio will finish the automatic exchange fiat currency with the help the services from third party institutes. for service providers: making maximized compatibility with existing business processes and systems. reducing the profit uncertainty brought the fluctuation digital currency. extending the customer group digital currency users. for customers: more flexible options payment. enjoying better services brought reducing transaction cost greater speaking right towards service quality under the circumstance that intelligent contracts provide transaction guarantee. credit system ... problems centralized evaluation system when customer chooses travel service provides, ratings and reviews often play major role. such, merchants and platforms have strong incentive manipulate these ratings and reviews for monetary gain. large commercial industry has grown out this incentive, and customers' trust the integrity ratings and reviews, well their financial interests are being jeopardized because this. the unfair practices are erecting barriers the development the global travel market. with the expanding sharing economy, more individuals are becoming service providers. compared with traditional hotels chains, these individual providers lack professional risk management capabilities. for example, when people evaluate whether list their homes airbnb for unfamiliar travelers, their topmost concern usually safety. creditable and accurate reputation system will play vital role risk assessment, and also the long-term health any sharing economy ecosystem. ... decentralized solutions tripio leverages the ethereum distributed ledger construct the credit system. lets all participants the system accrue credit based good behavior. everyone can view person's public records and determine whether she credible. tripio's credit system global, transparent, automatic and decentralized. works tandem with tripio's other decentralized systems. the tripio ecosystem, participant takes one more the following three roles: customer (c), service provider (sp), and arbiter (a). these three roles perform scores are calculated independently, and their input together generate comprehensive reputation score. the arbiter's role will described more detail later. e.g. george's comprehensive reputation score being the maximum score) his reputation score his provide reputation score his reputation score this set scores demonstrates that customer and arbiter, george has high credit rating. however, may not good service provider. all these scores are calculated based the participant's behavior different roles based smart contracts. her credit ratings are assigned specified wallet address. every time transaction, compensation request, dispute audit happens, smart contracts updates the credit ratings for all participants involved. these updates based participants' behaviors. the reputation score also updated based the sp's service levels and results. for example: does the react quickly c's requests? does the provide services according her promise its timeliness and quality the same advertised? does the have good reviews? the reputation score updated smart contracts based her behavior well. different actions are weighted differently credit score rating. for example: what the c's reimbursement record? what the total reimbursement amount? are these reimbursements resolved? does the reach agreement with sps regarding her reimbursements? her purchase history characteristics, such frequency, prices, etc. the reputation score updated based her actions arbitration cases. for example: does she participate when selected the system arbiter? does she perform arbitration duties within the designated timeline? does she provide quality arbitration? service provider and customer may review each other. transactions with written feedback impact reputation scores more than silent ones (transactions that happen without feedback entered). service provider's renews are displayed customers when they browse search for products. service provider may also view all comments written customer. whether positive negative, these reviews help all participants operate transparent ecosystem. tripio provides incentives encourage both parties participate reviews. after transaction completed, the ratings and reviews are not made public immediately. only after both parties finishes reviews, after one party fails provide review within timeframe, the reviews become public records. this mechanism encourages the reviews independent and trustworthy. ... global and transparent credit system the credit system different centralized transaction market cannot mutually opened each other. for example, merchants ctrip need accumulate credit agoda and customers' credit obtained airbnb cannot recognized xiaozhu rental. through the global transparent credit established blockchain, tripio's credit open the public stimulate all parties and increase its own credit ranking jointly create better decision and safer travel service ecosystem. addition, people with high credit score and credit history will provided with accounts reducing cash deposit and cutting service prices. the occurrence fraud behaviors can sharply reduced this kind transparent least becomes more difficult. for users with low credit score, can increase cash deposit even refuse serve them. ... anti-cheating facility based artificial intelligence the behavior counterfeiting comments (including false reviews and making false reviews) will not only mislead customers harm the interest customers, malignant ecosystem that bad coin expels good coin will formed long term. along with the development artificial intelligence based machine learning, has been verified that context classification model represented bag words (bow) can effectively recognize false comments. but the major reason that artificial intelligence anti-cheating cannot achieve the maximum effect centralized system that impossible for each centralized system share data due business profits, that why trusted model training data cannot formed through complete users' behavior chain. the ecosystem trio, tripio will analyze and establish artificial intelligence anti-cheating model through intact footprint records and the founded cheating will punished with reducing credit integral. comments and ratings from users with lower credit scores will also downgraded systems that reflecting service providers' credits. dispute resolution system dispute may will occur between service providers and customers the process transaction. for example, consumers feel that the sanitation conditions the hotel are not the standard level, that the renter thinks the renter has damaged the sofa. once these cases happened, platform always works the coordinator and arbitrator centralized platforms. the one side, platforms need pay high operating cost and the other side, both parties transaction may will believe that unfair arbitration has been made platform. ... delegated proof stake the above problems had been perfectly resolved the dispute resolution system designed tripio the basis delegated proof stake (dpos) with the help blockchain. firstly, the service provider can clearly indicate the amount the guarantee that they are willing pay and the amount the guarantee that the consumer required pay the service registration period. after starting transactions, both transaction capital and guarantee will locked the specified blockchain. any party can make arbitration request dispute occurs the process service. ... procedures dispute resolution the working procedures dispute resolution system can concluded follows: the party making disputes can start the dispute resolution system through intelligent contracts, and people making the dispute needs pay settlement fee (such trio). ii. both party the dispute should upload evidence the ipfs file system and the hash value evidence will recorded the blockchain. iii. system will automatically organize the arbitration committee with certain number members (the least number five) according the money involved this dispute. iv. the choice arbitration committee will made according arbitrator's activity and credit score. appeal can applied any party the dispute not satisfied with arbitration result. nevertheless, the dispute service fee each appeal will double and the number the members arbitration committee will also double, and the appeal cannot made until the dispute service fee exceeds the compensation amount the appeal. tripio designs dispute resolution system according the idea dpos equity distrust certification mechanism because dpos the fastest, most efficient, most distributed and flexible consensus model present. all the network parameters, including rate plan, block interval and transaction size, can adjusted voted representatives. what the most important that the purpose consensus protocol prevent all the participants from the interference unnecessary supervision. community autonomy the major component tripio system providing the intelligent contracts various services. nevertheless, intelligent contracts cannot updated once they are deployed account the irreversible modification the blockchain. new intelligent contract must deployed tripio need system upgrade, every single participant ecosystem must will influenced this kind system upgrade. for example, the algorithm credit scoring system may will changed the upgrade tripio, different participants ecosystem will hold different positions towards this kind influence. tripio ecosystem one kind decentralized and digital autonomous management organization controlled trio token. autonomy committee ethereum network tripio protocol user protocol proxy third party dapp tripio protocol upgrading tripio application the way community autonomy the case that two versions running parallel produced tripio protocol, although can make all the dapps automatically use the newest version protocol through design specification, this kind specification may will bring systematic risk the platform (in the worst case, attackers can gain access user funds.) the community can decide which version use together. this not only achieves the continuous updating the platform, but also maximizes the benefits the relevant members. tripio will deployed into ethereum blockchain and will provide the rights access and usage for future dapps and users. the uses trio token can concluded the following two aspects: providing for market participants use payment transactions and related fees well implementing decentralized community autonomous organization (dao) the protocols. distributed community autonomy will gradually and safely integrated into tripio protocols according development speed. first, will manage platform development through multiple-signed contract and will simultaneously develop the management system based dao. for example, when the development team tripio hopes upgrade the system releasing new version the intelligent contract, positive negative impacts will produced the new calculation method credit score towards part service providers. this point, all community members can participate deciding whether the new version will online. values trio token economic patterns trio token ... definitions have

circulation value and ecological value. the ecological design tripio, service providers use trio token cash deposit and then purchase advertising space. the main scenes customers using trio token including using payment method which the exchange rate conversion fee waived, using the cash deposit for the purchase the sharing service and using the arbitration fee. incentive mechanism ... behavior incentive mechanism detailed reward rules service party: service party can get reward trio token through the "total equity hotel room positive comment" the unit cycle. the number comments can motivate service party provide customers with better services. detailed reward rules customers: getting rewards trio token writing comments. getting rewards trio token sharing and forwarding. detailed reward rules third party: earning rewards trio token providing more personalized services. earning rewards trio token conducting traffic for the servers through its own traffic. integral mechanism people who travel frequently all will accumulate travel points, including flights, accommodation and car rentals. most cases, receive their points when are using some credit cards providing travel shopping points. nevertheless, the question whether the points provided these various plans are useful? comparing with the discount plans other industries, travel points program have the property more complex, less transparency, more troublesome used. thereby, for most common tourists, points are not important because they have hard time accumulating points that can used, many points are not used. fact, clients believe that the purpose the opacity rules prevent their using these points, however, complexity always brought negative effects these points. meanwhile, company has also increased operating cost because this reason, they were required take part the responsibility points accounting regulations and only after the points are redeemed can the company clarify the relevant situation profit and loss. trio token will play the integral role tripio ecosystem and then everyone can clearly understand the rules integral program its intelligent contracts, simultaneously, they can also clearly find whether these points are truly used the public accountant books. metcalfe network effect tripio travel service marketplace, well set open protocols. all travel agencies, include booking, ctrip, agoda and airbnb may leverage tripio open protocols order reduce cost and increase service quality. for instance, airbnb may use tripio's credit system boost the accuracies its own review system. roadmap q-q integrating digital currency payment gateway developing the prototype registration system developing payment systems for automatic currency conversion finishing the test
