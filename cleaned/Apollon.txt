apollon platform the apollon blockchain vision statement apollon's business vision provide commercial-level integrated blockchain infrastructure services. the group's core competency this business model rests the following areas: community marketplace concept based host panentertainment offerings with diversity capable and robust technology deployment the blockchain, sidechain and blockchain security areas strong and secured offering the payment tools and payment gateway structuring -tier currency structure alleviate platform operator's pain points and the group will offer the following comprehensive set technology functions: the apollon blockchain project aims develop and support all the related business applications with the underlying blockchain infrastructure technology. the group believes that apo platform one world's first and most comprehensive multi-chain platforms, coving and re-sharping pan-entertainment and ecommerce ecosystem landscape. the resharping products and service offering could mean that beyond customer's comprehension (never know such product service could exist) this point time. apo's vision have "free flow value", enabling users members the platform enjoy the benefits the rich offering blockchain technology. apo's underlying technology infrastructure uses bft-dpos consensus mechanism ("byzantine fault-tolerant (bft) consensus and delegated proof-of-stake (pos)"), supplemented blockchain cuttingedge technologies such modular smart contracts, zero-knowledge proofs, and state-channel technologies, create high-throughput, highsecurity, resource-saving technologies with low-cost processing. longtooth one the world most innovated decentralized communication protocols provide services services direct communication without having use any centralized servers. this also relatively better technology deployment method prevent reduce any hacking-risk, arising single point failure tuyyo one the world most secure tools provide state-of-art point-to-point, public and private (hot and cold) personal key protect any message and document transferring and from through the platform. technology combining ntrusign signature and keccak- hash algorithm reduces risk and threats rapid development quantum computing and popularization quantum computers. apollon enables cross-chain interaction technology allow many different blockchains connect and communicate with each other. variety systems can run through and integrate with each other provide efficient, convenient, secured, and stable data processing. the apollon blockchain system enables large number blockchain data parallel processing. the group closely watching the development the pratt whitney case blockchain deployment which apparently may trigger the change the future evolution fintech deployment apo ecology linking entertainment related parties into the platform apollon's strategic plan based blockchain based pan-entertainment service offering. and the group may closely following the footsteps tencent holdings limited ("qq"), hong kong stock exchange listed company the gaming industry with different set(s) technology deployment. the group respects group and its management, and would very hard compete with qq, based their current offerings and its market position. however, the group wonders that there must new and disruptive way (according harvard business school disruptive business model) lying ahead qq's current game offerings. that way, may the group can compete with their huge customer base. has active user over million and their value-added service ("vas") which mainly their gaming business. for the year ended december reported vas revenue rmb billion (us$. billion) which has year-on-year growth any measurement standards, their vas clearly leadership position this field. the group's plan have the following business the platform and effectively, this platform can considered type ecommerce platform. the difference between apo platform and ecommerce that apo platform can very international, offering simple and effective payment tools. also offers electronic wallets and smart payment tool (smart contract), offering clearing and transactional convenience. last but not the least, secured and interactive platform, offering high degree privacy with international acceptable payment token, apo coin: ecommerce for new technology and latest fashionable products (including internet things, artificial intelligence products etc); equivalent gaming entertainment service offering; chat room for innovative service offering; travel and related services secured and efficient payment method example, let's consider there operator apo platform, wanting promote nha trang vietnam holiday package. booking can done via blockchain then onto the side chain complete with payment apo coin. travel and living spending bonus points can used the apo shops for discount price reduction incentives. another example, let's consider there operator wanting offer the same idea gaming. opens electronic shop apo platform. international players can use apo coin play and the loyalty bonus points can used the game other platform shops. specifically, apo platform will offer the following: when interested apo commercial retailer, service provider operator working legitimate and defined industry, once buys defined quantity apo coin, this entity can have the right build and operate electronic shop ("e-shop") the platform subject apo internal compliance review; apollon will provide blockchain bft-dpos secured mechanism e-shop operator, enhancing their ongoing and secured operations while offering corresponding incentives the e-shop operators and possibly their endcustomers; apollon blockchain offers high degree seamless data processing productivity ensure tps throughput and guarantee continuous dapp usage. e-shop operator can develop its own application running side-chain basis within the system, such games, chat other applications enhancing user's experience; apollon blockchain offers two-tier structure, meaning between the underlying blockchain technology and commercial e-shop specific application. operator can run its own customer's payment and clearing infrastructure (say call it, pos) and apollon will not involve its pos flow; apo underlying technology infrastructure uses bft-dpos consensus mechanism, supplemented technologies such modular smart contracts and state channel technologies, build high throughput and security with low operating and running cost; eventually, apollon blockchain will also support other popular cryptocurrency, say bitcoin other erc standard coins once net transactional set data are sent the blockchain level for clearing application blockchain smart contracts; e-shop operator runs its own business application side-chain basis and there are several available technologies available such state channel, smart contract flashing. there will sufficient security mode being built into the whole network; innovation blockchain-based pan-entertainment alliance optimization trading and payment system global trading volume and payments are the rise boston consulting group ("bcg") published their report "global payments ways from through bcg indicated that global payment the exponential growth path. and the growth engines derive from the following categories payments: diverging growth across regions different growth rate for mature and emerging markets retail payments consumer-led payment business (typically business consumer, "bc") wholesale payments business business payment ("bb") cross-border payments international trade cross-border payments bcg indicated that during global payments reached us$, billion. payment venue can classified below: bank-led telco-led prepaid electronic wallets ecommerce-led payments special purpose payment banks apart from all the international bank payments, other payment "tools" are shown below: paypal credit card visa, master american express apple pay android pay samsung pay ripple for international payments merchant wallet such neiman marcus department store etc bcg also indicated that non-cash driven global payment was about times global countries gdp with close year-on-year growth. the same time, the revenue generated core payments has reached billion u.s. dollars, accounting for %-% the global banking industry revenue. the group believes that once the apollon payment platform becomes operational, the demand for its service and the near future and payments could substantial. (). the fee greatly reduced the existence blockchain fact industrial break though the virtue its distributed, secured, auditable and decentralized processing mode. with high diversity parties the blockchain network, there almost little needs for any trading finance intermediate entities. present, the overall transactional fees charged different payment modes various countries varies from %-%. (a) china's specific payment entities charge lower fee: alipay and wechat. their domestic fee-charge between .%-.% and for international payment, special circumstances may reach (b) paypal for example, its current charge rate between .%. for digital product rate, could high and with commercial bank equivalent cross-currency exchange rate. there may times, the cross- currency rates are less competitive. case less competitive cross-rate charged, the fee charged could additional .%. paypal has more than million global active accounts, covering more than countries and regions, and can accept more than currencies, payment and access support currencies, kinds currency accounts. paypal one the strongest and leading international payment companies the world. for any and global payments, the transactional cost could high. (). cross-border payment during china's import and export cross-border e-commerce (including bb/bc) reached rmb trillion (us$. trillion), which accounted for china's total import and export volume with rapid growth. present, china has established cross-border e-commerce comprehensive experimental zones. haitao, chinese ecommerce website helping chinese buyers buy foreign goods had reached rmb. billion (us$ million), increase over this trend will increase further with the rapid development cross-border e-commerce. chinese cross-border ecommerce sales, not counting elements the tmall.com and jd.com was usd billion which was three times the value shown quoted emarketer, research consultancy firm. total number china global outbound tourists exceeded billion for the first time which was much higher than years ago. the same time, the total tourism revenue the year reached trillion, equivalent global gdp. asian students studying abroad also big market. the market size china's student studying abroad over rmb billion (us$. billion). estimated that there will additional were also account for students' local consumption overseas countries. ().real-time trading mentioned before, blockchain distributed, auditable, secured and difficult-to-hack platform. decentralized platform adopting unique consensus mechanism achieve decentralization. that say, there may very little need for any financial intermediate organizations involved the process. recent years, concern raised different countries and governments anti-money laundry ("aml"), know your customer ("kyc") and anti-terrorist money ("atm") are the rise. for any larger amount money transfer, the lead-time not within -hour. there were cases that bank transfer could suspended for months, pending for the bank's detail compliance scrutiny. optimization the ecological alliance (). establishing universal eco-standard payment for recreation the majority cross border payments cover model but payments are the rise. the group's intention create and offer seamless cross-border payment system using apo coin. without using financial intermediate, over times may speed the transfer process. this payment mechanism could extended cover ecommerce (bb bc) transactions. present, the industry standards for payment and settlement procedure vary among countries. local country government policy, central bank guidance and its local currency adding another layer complications. blockchain one international network with "free flow" cryptocurrency. blockchains are decentralized and distributed (distributed ledger technology) across networks that are continually updated and synchronized. blockchain doesn't have centralized location and there single point failure. delegated proof stake ("dpos") consensus algorithm maintaining consistent agreement the truth across the network, validating transactions and acting form digital democracy. efficient system. (). data protection and system optimization blockchain offers compelling reasons where you can transact without having hand over every part your transaction details, remember activate the account owner's pin using special method. the blockchain's potential for zero knowledge proofs also offers cryptographic way things like prove your age without showing your age, demonstrate and proof your status with record successful transactions without revealing detail transaction content. data privacy and information security centralized customer's data base could have chance hacked stolen. the recent facebook's database leakage good example. for centralizing data base storage, there always security risk matter how small the probability from happening. however, the virtue decentralized computing, blockchain has security advantage. optimization blockchain technology double-layer mechanism the double-layer mechanism the unique digital system for apo's ecology. addition, will drastically increase the efficiency and reduce the payment and clearing transactional cost. combination market rate driven apo token and the constant dollar secondary currency. the characteristic apo offers shelter, shielding digital asset market rate fluctuation risk, ensuring constant dollar nature the settlement monetary tool, the secondary token. high throughput the apo blockchain underlying technology infrastructure for commercial applications has the advantages high security and throughput, resource conservation, and low operating costs. the bft-dpos consensus mechanism adopted, and apo incentive mechanisms are incorporated achieve parallel processing. the super node governance mechanism being put forward for dpos super nodes construct ecological production framework. wide application scenario apo eco-platform comprises convenient commercial and other offerings such online games, cross-border ecommerce, animation ip, travel and tourism service offering and other complementary service offering. within the apo eco-platform, trading could done directly, avoiding eliminating unnecessary third parties "less-value-added" service, resulting lower transactional costs. and the interaction with the respective trading party direct, without the need the middle man intermediate. apo solutions linking entertainment apollon double pass structure the group aims conduct international business. avoid alleviate unnecessary transactional complication based apo coin market value fluctuation, apollon designs dual-layer digital currency structure based on: apo and lcash (liquidity cash which has par value us$.) the apollon blockchain double-layer structure, apo coin the primary cryptocurrency. has intrinsic market value which may vary over time. within the apollon eco-platform, there another "operational currency" called lcash. each lcash equal us$. used intermediate tool bridging the legal and apo token currency. acts currency applicator for intermediaries and legal currency clearing and settlement with stable value. the currency tools (or token) will facilitate consumer payment and simplify merchant's clearing and settlement process. apollon will develop level exchange gateway platform for double-layered digital currency structures, providing basic coding and templates. however, the issuance and the actual transactional trading lcash the sole responsibility the merchant(s) operator(s). the group expected will provide all the necessary api and platform inter-connect technology the operator(s). needed, different merchants can have their own coins side-chain level. could lcash, lcash, lcash etc. unlike apo coin, lcash being issued merchants via apo coin deposit the platform collaterals. the exchange gateway allows global apo merchants quickly convert secondary token into their required currency. using the redemption platform gateway, merchants can freely convert any legal currency, digital currency, and online platform tokens (such online game tokens) the ecosystem. the same way, consumers can also use level token purchase products services from any merchant the apollon platform. they can also exchange secondary tokens with local merchants. advantages double-layered permit structure the apo platform, lcash can used within the close circuit and with high degree security and privacy protection. moreover, lcash has constant value. the relationship between two-tier structure and operation logic the apo blockchain meant for global merchants. degree service, merchants are requested: order offer higher purchase apo coin first thereafter, this merchant has the right operate and issue lcash order sustain the lcash value security, say for example $,, worth apo coin will placed apo platform security order for merchants issue worth lcash for remaining apo treated collateral against the intrinsic value apo fluctuation this value considered buffer reserve against the backdrop the apo coin market value fluctuation. such, apo acting like internal banker the merchants the apo platform. this way, the issuance the lcash systematic and well under control. when there large consortium wanting open small number e-shops the apo platform, the consortium could opt for just using their consortium-led lcash (one type only) issuance different lcash: lcash, lcash lcash etc. the group could allow external party operate like internal banker within the platform later stage. then, the group will better position consider the terms and condition the external party service offering. long there are merchants opening new e-shops and there are consumers exchanging the lcash via buying apo coin, the free market supply and demand dynamic may possibly push apo coin market value. technology implementation build the underlying foundation framework bft-dpos consensus mechanism apo determines the block out time and this case, every seconds. given time, the production each block will only granted block producer. block fails produced within the specified time, the block that specific time will skipped. when one more blocks are skipped, there may more than seconds blocking time. the apo system, blocks will generated per round (each block producer produces blocks, multiplied block producers). independent block producers will voted apo holders. selected block producers will perform block production the order agreed most block producers (more than block producers agree). these super-nodes will responsible for collecting the transactions the network, verifying the transactions and packing them into the blocks, and broadcasting them other nodes. after the verification, the blocks will added their local blockchain. block producer misses block production does not produce any block within hours, they will removed from the block producers until they announce their intention re-produce blocks the entire network again. eliminating obsolete blocks, producers can minimize the number missing blocks while ensuring the smooth operation the entire network. under the dpos consensus mechanism, block producers have cooperative and reciprocal relationship. each node cooperates complete block production and accounting. this unlike the other consensus mechanisms that compete with each other for benefits reasons. the workload verification consensus mechanism (pow and the next node competes for bookkeeping rights through computational power, resulting the whole network computing power concentrated the hands few mines, the nodes the pos obtain more bookkeeping awards competing for the amount the holding money. when bifurcation occurs the network, the consensus algorithm will automatically jump the longest chain avoid the occurrence hard bifurcations. block producers are required not produce blocks two forks the same time. block producers who violate the rules will removed. the system automatically recognizes and removes violators who have this dual production cryptographic evidence. the basis dpos, apo will join the byzantine fault tolerance consensus (bft) provide fault tolerance f=(n-)/. this fault tolerance includes both security and availability, can withstand general failures and byzantine failure. the apo network, block identified irreversible after being confirmed block producers. with this consensus, any block producer could generate cryptographic evidence. this would result the same time stamp block height betrayal both blocks, generating cryptographic evidence. the irreversible consensus this mode expected reached within second. high throughput under the dpos consensus mechanism, nodes with high computing power are selected the entire network representatives maintain the network and produce blocks, ensuring stable high throughput (tps) for the entire network. apo can reach tens thousands transactions per second, far beyond the speed attached bitcoin and ethereum. high throughput enables faster transfer rates, lower network latency, and smoother operation. also allows users experience the same transaction speeds existing mainstream payment methods such alipay, wechat and visa. high security the high degree decentralization apo makes the entire network structure and user access more stable. developers gain proportional network bandwidth, storage space, and computing power proportion apo holdings the apo network. this may make local networks less vulnerable attacks and the main network will not affected, thereby increasing the security and reliability the network. save resources compared bitcoin and ethereum's pow consensus mechanism, the dpos consensus mechanism adopted apo does not need increase the power compete for the right book, and not waste extra computing power and greatly save resources. low operating costs the apo ownership model allows developers obtain the proportion the resources the number apo token holding. there need spend the development and deployment applications, and there need continuously burn gas costs during the development and deployment applications like ethereum. gas fees continue increase with the increase applications the internet. besides the buying apo tokens collateral apo platform, there fee payable while trading the apo network. apo decentralized service service direct communication mechanism every elements apo system meant for addressing some kind services. apo adoptes longtooth, open and patented technology that can easily enable interconnectivity and interoperability between all services across different ecosystems thus potentially creating massive combined ecosystem unmatched others size. assigns unique identification each participating service and its applications. such identification will used for authentication and authorization during interacting with other participating services. latency issues are hugely alleviated things things communications can used much possible instead going through middlemen cloud. apo bit and byte data transfer secure protection mechanism every data flow the internet will have risk getting sneaked data theft. apo believes that protection each bit and byte the system one the most critical needs for apo system. apo adopted tuyyo, one the world most secure app technologies, the state-of-art public and private (hot and cold) personal key protect any single message and document transferred through the platform. every encrypted data need have the "present hot key" decrypt the data, that means the "present hot key" keep modified every second the network protect using old key decrypt old data. addition the data flow from the internet, apo wallet, apo will make use tuyyo technology protect users' data the highest security level. apo anti-quantum algorithms new anti-quantum algorithms are devised, which replaces existing sha series algorithm with the keccak- hash algorithm and replaces ecdsa signature algorithm with integer lattice-based ntrusign signature algorithm. these algorithms reduce the threat coming from development quantum computing and gradual popularization quantum computer. new anti-quantum algorithms are devised, which replaces existing sha series algorithm with the keccak- hash algorithm and replaces ecdsa signature algorithm with integer lattice-based ntrusign signature algorithm. these algorithms reduce the threat coming from development quantum computing and gradual popularization quantum computer. apo incentive mechanism order encourage more nodes participate maintaining the main network and block production, provide computing power and network resources for the system, apo network needs generate apo coin incentive those cryptocurrency miners. apo will use the total amount tokens prize pool. after each consensus reached, those who book and provide resources will receive certain amount apo awards. apo's incentives could adjusted future, depending the actual situation. parallel processing apo allocates various parts the block different processing processes and parallelizes the blocks. specifically, apo divides the block into cycles, each cycle divided into threads, each thread contains list transactions, and each transaction contains set information sent. this tree structure, the interaction layers are parallel each other and each processed sequentially. the parallel processing speed will several times faster than single processing speed. such, the apo network throughput will further improved reach higher level. and commercial applications the network will also supported. super node governance mechanism the apo system grants blockchain producers (super-nodes) the ability freeze accounts, upgrade application systems, and propose hard-fork improvement suggestions for underlying protocols. when smart contract has vulnerability abnormal state, super-node has the right decide which transactions are added the block and which one frozen. the same time, apo creates point-to-point protocol legal constraint the entire network. users the network need sign it. this protocol defines the obligations that users need perform resolve disputes between users. also defines the source code for readable intent. protocols, used identify differences between bugs and features, direct the community fix when errors occur. every transaction the apo network must use the hash the protocol part the signature. high reliability and consistency the governance mechanism apo can perfectly resolve the differences the network and quickly reach consensus, avoiding situations which the interests investors are substantially impaired when the system being attacked problems are not quickly being resolved. will then improve the reliability the apo network. smart contract apo uses highly efficient modular smart contracts that can support different development languages. the same time, developers can develop their own unique smart contracts the side-chain meet developer's needs for smart contract customization. say the least, smart contract key part the payment and receipt system and apo platform needs smart contracts for apo coin and lcash utilization. zero knowledge proof apo payments are posted the main chain, but the sender, receiver, and transaction amount the transaction would confidential. apo encrypts the contents the private transactions and uses the latest cryptographic technology solutions verify their validity. also supports privacy and transparent addresses, providing privacy and selective transaction transparency. apo uses zk-snark's zero-knowledge proof structure, which allows the network maintain secure balance ledger without publicly showing trading participants transaction amounts. transaction metadata encrypted and does not publicly display spending rights and transaction amounts. zk-snark used ensure that one cheating stealing the transactional details and its related economic asset value. strong confidentiality apo enables users enjoy the advantages high speed and convenience the underlying blockchain, ensuring user's private and sensitive information. state channel technology apo uses state channel technology enable chain-to-link transfer and reduce the burden the main chain. simple terms, apo establishes transaction settlement layer outside the main chain. apo holders can establish nodes the channel, and nodes are connected each other establish channel. both parties can directly indirectly clear through the transaction channel. the multi-signature final transaction confirmation will return the main chain. state channel technology greatly increases transaction speed, while further enhancing privacy reduce transaction costs. the only publicly visible transaction the transaction when the channel entered and closed. all other transactions are invisible the outside world. specifically, opening state channel apo network requires that two more participants agree the initial state and put some apo token (deposit) into the channel for hosting. when the state channel predictor receives valid status update, will enter the challenge period, and other participants may submit status update the higher serial number. after the challenge period, the valid status update with the highest serial number accepted the final status. when any participant wants close the channel, after updating the latest state, the channel closed after the data uplinked for settlement. this process, the status update must signed least two channel participants. the serial number each successive status update must higher than the former. the status channel working party can only submit the latest status update before closing after the channel closed. this ensures the accuracy determining whether the status valid not. side chain the side-chain based the main chain consensus and completely inherits various performances such main-chain throughput, while deploying the main-chain technologies anchor currency for merchant(s) operator(s) who adopt apo's side-chain build commercial-level payment and clearing system, they need buy and deposit apo tokens have the rights, issuing fixed par value currency called liquidcash (lcash). lcash important money engine for the entire ecological system. proper management and promotion lcash usage ensure the apo platform business the rise. lcash has the exchange stability while having the freedom and convenience digital currency. adopts the pof (proof funds) consensus mechanism one-vs-one (:) backing its currency. that means for every lcash token (us$ par value) there monetary reserve backing for this lcash token. apo uses automatic matching engine, currency conversion engine and intelligent order routing enable users freely complete exchange legal currency and digital currency the gateway platform. cross-chain interaction the apollon cross-chain communication protocol consists three functional modules: register module: this module provides two functions. the first register the original chain involved cross-chain transactions. the module generates unique through the specific algorithm rules the original chain and maintains the registry the original chain avoid fraud caused the dummy chain. the second function register the assets transferred. this generates unique through the asset's specific algorithm rules ensure the uniqueness the asset. cross-chain transaction data transfer module: this module provides three functions. the first function that the user the original chain sends crosschain transaction request apo. this the starting point for transferring assets into transactions. the second function confirm the success failure receiving the verification code node. the third function that apollon's verifier node sends legitimate transaction the original chain and completes the return process. transaction status query module: this module mainly provides the function querying the authorized status asset transfer transactions from the original chain the apo chain locked account and the function locking the account back the original transaction chain the apo chain. these are the control signs cross-chain transaction progress. are using hypocritical user alice example illustrate the transfer assets into the data transmission process. the user wants transfer the value the original (ori) chain the bay chain. step alice initiates transaction oritx with oriaccount the original chain, sends the asset oriassetid apollon's locked account lockedaccount, and broadcasts the cross-chain transaction request intertxreq the apo chain through the cross-chain transaction data transmission module. this function takes the transaction data parameter follows: oritxinfo (oriblocknum, oritx)intertxreq (oriaccount, orichainid, oriassetid, value, oritxinfo, sig) step: the cross-chain transaction the apo chain proves that the node (voucher) receives the cross-chain transaction request and checks the transaction status query module whether the transaction has been identified the original chain. the function token locking flag (tlf) takes oritxinfo, orichainid and oriassetid parameters follows: tlf
