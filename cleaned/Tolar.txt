introduced many advantages the world making its potential huge. allowed many computers take part network, distributing the computing power, which helped reduce the risk any tampering, fraud cyber-crime. furthermore, allowed different parties believe that transactions between them are indeed real and valuable. with immutable records transactions this also ensured possibility for massive range digital transactions happen without any central authority. with significant reduction monopolies middle men, this also removed lot costs from the equation. blockchain also ensured immutability, any transaction can confirmed and shared across the distributed network, while almost impossible undo. the problem all these are great advantages offered blockchain and today can see many projects trying leverage them the best way they can. however, recent years blockchain technology proved have significant problems. among them huge environmental cost the way blockchain being used today. one the most famous examples this bitcoin that uses computing power that consumes much energy used the world's nations. another major shortcoming that blockchain slow and takes much longer time process any transaction when compared let's say "traditional" payment systems such cash debit cards. for example, bitcoin transactions can take few hours finalize which truly unsatisfactory and significantly limits the potential for bitcoin payment mechanism. another shortcoming the dapps which, while having huge potential, failed revolutionise the market this point. these shortcomings inspired the founders tolar hashnet provide solution that solves these major shortcomings blockchain technology, while maintaining all its advantages. the context blockchain the fastest-growing digital technology since the evolution internet. for the last few years, starting change the face business across the world. for that reason, asked ourselves one simple question years ago what can make the most blockchain technology with the resources have our disposal? the answer was facilitated cotrugli business school. cotrugli recognized the potential blockchain technologies among the first the region europe, provided crucial support from the start and turned out best resource could use make the most blockchain technologies. for this reason, chose cotrugli the strategic partner the project. cotrugli the leading business school europe with amazing impact and influence the business community. they have strategic collaborations with more than mba alumni (middle and top managers from the region), and over satisfied clients (leading companies across different industries). all them stand benefit greatly from the blockchain technology. with campuses croatia and serbia, and branch offices bulgaria, montenegro, romania, slovenia and the uae, cotrugli significantly impacting business networks most countries europe, while the same time reaching cultures and business environments worldwide. highlight this statement, cotrugli fund alone has invested over million eur into mba scholarships for the best and the brightest candidates from the leading companies the region. the solution thanks the full support cotrugli, were able jumpstart several initiatives that ultimately gave birth tolar hashnet. one the first initiatives was the creation blockchain adria, which became central place for blockchain ecosystem europe. here, addition regional conferences, meetups and hackathons, also developed blockchain academy and the worlds blockchain emba program and program for certified blockchain developers, helping our clients make the most this fascinating technology. the ongoing success blockchain adria gave the confidence and inspired the passion move further. the time, many projects the blockchain arena were failing deliver their promises, sense becoming major solutions for businesses and governments around the globe. this inspired and empowered start our very own project, one that could leverage the main advantages blockchain technology, resolve some its main weaknesses and dramatically impact the global business. with the ongoing support from cotrugli, started process incubating several ideas found credible. all them were guided professionally the cotrugli incubator, piloted and examined back and forth prominent business experts, consultants and mba graduates one side, and blockchain professionals and enthusiasts the other. the one idea that prevailed was the one that received amazing support from the start, was deemed revolutionary, credible and attainable. the idea soon became extremely serious and professional movement that skyrocketed from the start and received amazing support from both business and the blockchain community... ...we are proud announce tolar. based hashnet revolutionary technology beyond blockchain, are confident tolar will indeed revolutionise the global business. the vision want position tolar hashnet the global leader all dlts, and become favourable solution for enterprises and governments providing open, fast and extremely fair public ledger built top the revolutionary hashnet technology. the product and business overview introducing hashnet hashnet scalable, efficient and high-impact decentralised solution social innovation challenges leveraging distributed ledger technology (dlts). this revolutionary algorithm features faster transaction time, masternodes and will have community governed crypto-currency tolar. dlt its public, open and permissionless form widely considered ground-breaking digital technology supporting decentralized methods for consensus reaching, well sharing, storing and securing transactions and other data with fewer central intermediaries. hashnet consensus uses "redundancy reduced gossip" and "virtual voting" protocols based distributed computation and algorithms from theoretical computer science, which provides fair and fast, byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm. new consensus substitute platform and designed run non-permissioned (public) network thereby, reaching larger community. hashnet designed solve the blockchain scalability problem using the revolutionary algorithm discussed above. new consensus substitute blockchain, keeping all the good characteristics from blockchain (decentralized, transparent, pseudo anonymous) and increasing speed more than tps. hashnet cost-efficient and environmentally friendly given that mining required, uses minimal computing resources. designed solve the problem with bitcoin, ethereum and similar pow systems, which now use more electricity than countries including ireland and most countries africa. hashnet scalable scalability the biggest problem the blockchain technology space. projects like bitcoin and ethereum are simply not capable transferring large number blockchain transactions short timeframe. hashnet, the other hand, was built support over transactions per second, compared bitcoin, which can only manage transactions per second. also, even with large increase number nodes, hashnet network will able process all transactions matter seconds. hashnet fair why? because individual can manipulate the order transactions. with hashnet, there way for the individual affect the consensus order. hashnet fast doesn't require miners create chain blocks order record transactions. this process creating chain blocks very slow and consumes large amount electricity. hashnet uses proof-of-stake algorithm combined with masternodes reach distributed consensus. the process receiving and recording occurs soon transaction takes place, which allows the final confirmation ready instantly. hashnet secure hashnet can't hacked due the power distributed algorithm, which responsible for reaching consensus within the nodes. also, combining proof-of-stake and masternode creates transparency, since the participants are compensated for correct voting. hashnet characteristics transparency funds allocation community funds and voting process transparent. speed network's throughput can process transactions per second. mobile compatible hashnet can run full node even smartphone. ability grow easily scales with number users. completely decentralized every participant can contribute voting. features predicted the governance system tolar has governance system called magnus consilium which stakeholders and investors will have the power voting proposals order participate improvements hashnet network. magnus consilium will part community two ways: tenders tenders are budgeting plans which will submitted the magnus consilium where every proposal will need have majority votes order pass. proof stake (pos) user decides lock-in his coins, he/she will receive interest based the number coins staked, and the duration time the coins were stored. tender eligibility tenders and budget plans are available all tolar holders. magnus consilium will select projects for voting, based solution that best meets the following criteria: social impact: potential impact achieved the implementation the solution. decentralisation and governance: allows voters vote future network developments. outreach: adding value spreading word out the community. contribution: awarding improvements tolar network. extensiveness: allowing voters make decisions further development paths. the technology information transfer solution hashnet provides novel solution computational and communicational difficulties maintaining large-size public distributed ledgers. the key innovation our efficient asynchronous distributed consensus protocol appropriately designed directed acyclic network structure. our consensus protocol belongs class gossip-based protocols, which provide advantages over structure-based group communication algorithms they can handle large group sizes, sporadic sources, high user churns, and random network failures (for the details the theoretical support, see e.g. ]). ensure history immutability through time, which important property for public distributed ledgers, network nodes are connected using hash pointers ([] provides introductory technical description). well established (e.g., [,]) that long the selected hash function secure, already agreed upon history cannot changed retroactively. one the primary goals designing hashnet was significant reduction computational and communication resources needed operate and maintain the system. with this goal mind, designed variant redundancy reduced gossip (rrg) protocol for information transfer appropriately designed network. such rrg protocols achieve considerably lower traffic load than conventional push-based gossip protocols and conventional push-pull gossip protocols, while maintaining the same probability successful delivery []. figure information frame from peer are diffused via gossip that are -phase message exchanges one cycle: (a) phase greeting, (b) phase response, (c) phase closure, and (d) after all phases; fanout=; peer(s) shaded black infected the beginning the phase; peer(s) shaded grey infected the end the phase; peers shaded white remain uninfected the end the phase; solid line refers message containing frame; dotted line refers empty message. traffic load figure measured terms average number copies information frame received each peer. but each message contains protocol headers, and the resulting overheads for the two compared protocols are different. when and the average number active peers less than with c=, the overhead rrg around total traffic. most the overhead contributed the apl, where membership information carried and requires bytes per peer. the same settings, the overhead the conventional push gossip and the conventional push-pull gossip are around total traffic. most the overhead contributed the buffer-map, which least bytes per gossip message. important note that our protocol generates smaller number messages than the fully connected peer-to-peer overlay approach n-to-n communication. the number messages our protocol only around that the fully connected overlay approach. figure performance comparison redundancy reduced gossip (rrg), the conventional push gossip and the conventional push-pull gossip. computational and communicational efficiency while rrg and other asynchronous distributed consensus protocols provide communicational and computational efficiencies, additional implementation improvements are necessary handle large fast-growing systems. direct implementation such protocols could require exchanging much o(n^) messages for reaching consensus single binary outcome [], which would make them not practical and unsustainable for systems where the number nodes, large. thus, imperative implement the consensus protocol way that minimizes communicational load due information transfer among nodes. however, leverage the fact that every node has sufficient information the entire hashnet structure, including information about events and their propagation through the network. use this information compute content the vast majority messages required our rrg protocol, thereby eliminating the need for sending them and, consequently, significantly reducing communication requirements. somewhat similar approach towards reducing communication requirements implementation different consensus protocol has been proposed []. unlike our system, critical requirement that the number nodes constant and must remain fixed constant throughout.) important prerequisite for efficient computation consensus that the total number nodes ("voters") needs known. this provides inherent difficulty for implementation involving public ledger, the number nodes can vary greatly. overcame this difficulty assigning every node the vote weight that equal their stake given point time. since, any given point time, the current supply coins the network known and fixed, this approach ensures proper consensus computations. thus, assigning node weight its stake network, achieve the ability calculate votes instead waiting for and/or sending actual votes over the network. the protocol provides proof-of-stake blockchain discipline, offers qualitative efficiency advantages over blockchains based proof physical resources (e.g., proof work). figure illustration hashnet voting weight and stake changes through the voting rounds result transaction events. note that each round some transactions happen that transfer tolars from one participant another, however total vote weight through the network stays the same each round, enabling have virtual voting without knowing the number nodes advance. furthermore, with such weight assignment nodes, incentives are perfectly aligned with the stakes, suggesting reduced strategy space for obstructive and malicious behaviour. indeed, can shown that the reward mechanism for incentivizing proof-of-stake can constructed such way that truthful behaviour approximate nash equilibrium, thus neutralizing selfishmining attacks reputation based system addition the proof-of-stake based discipline, reputation-based system introduced additional control and verification mechanism. this allows measure 'severity' network protocol violations: some violations could simply consequence sporadic unfortunate network conditions (small negative impact reputation), while others could attributed specific malicious intent (large negative impact reputation). similarly, for nodes which are consistently "fault-free", i.e. consistently communicate correct information and locally compute consensus correctly, positive reputation slowly built-up over time. all nodes whose reputation falls behind certain negative reputation threshold are banned from the network for the amount time decided exponential back off algorithm. (such reputation-based systems have already been proven useful for self-regulating many applications [].) information about node reputation realized part events distribution algorithms. the reputation score computed iteratively and cumulatively and involves both pattern analysis for behaviour over time single node, well randomized verification checks. achieving consensus potentially faulty malicious nodes provide additional challenge implementing consensus protocol asynchronous environment. fact, well-known that theoretically impossible for any deterministic protocol reach agreement such environments []. thus, our implementation resorts class so-called iterative randomized approximate consensus algorithms. the goal allow fault-free nodes agree values, overcoming the obstacle posed (possibly incorrect unreliable) information disseminated faulty nodes. theoretically, the most challenging case are leader-based consensus algorithms, which rely small number nodes that cannot faulty (e.g., such []). such protocols are prone failure and usually exhibit several unresolved issues the case malicious node becoming leader []. contrast, fully distributed protocols (in which every node the network could decisive and which node always decisive) allow for design algorithms that overcome faulty nodes long fault-free nodes form supermajority any point time. more precisely, the approximate consensus algorithm can constructed even fully connected graphs provided that the total number nodes where the number faulty nodes []. our implementation leverages this result: consensus not reached after number rounds our rrg protocol, initiate sequence "random rounds". random round, any non-faulty nodes will choose their votes random and will have non-zero probability all choosing the same vote. the randomization such that guarantees the correct agreement among non-faulty nodes with high probability. thus, implementing small number random rounds results ensures convergence consensus (i.e., the probability failure converging zero exponential rate). finally, note that randomization does not need pose significant computational burden and can manipulation-free, bits provided event hash (that need computed anyway) can used source pseudorandom data. hashnet utxo storage requirements addition aforementioned speed performance guarantees made possible hashnet design, are also able guarantee improvements the global data storage size. specifically, hashnet data storage designed generalizing the approach laid out mimblewimble whitepaper []. the main benefit this approach that manages simultaneously handle security and versatility. utilize concepts such confidential transactions and "one-way aggregate signatures" (owas), which are shown provide private exchanges and better adaptability. the main idea behind owas that when the outputs are created and destroyed, the same they never existed. consequently, approve the entire chain, client only needs know when coins were inputted into the framework and what are last unspent yields. then utilize confidential transactions conceal the sums and owas, thereby obscuring the exchange diagram. this approach utilizes less space than, e.g., bitcoin enable clients verify the blockchain. for instance, the bitcoin blockchain currently about size, while hashnet would require small fraction that amount for the same amount transactions, thus allowing even today's standard smartphones act nodes. our approach (similar mimblewimble), the beneficiary transaction creates the blinding element which utilized demonstrate responsibility for coins. this done through the "excess value", which the contrast between the information sources and yields. this overabundance esteem arrangement arbitrary numbers that guarantee that only the individual who created the blinding factor (the collector/receiver) can spend the coins. thus, the blinding variables don't indicate zero any longer, but instead another number, resembling private key. the important feature our approach that not interactive, which turn creates efficiencies eliminating the need for storing any redundant information history individual transactions. rather than containing complete history all transactions, the blocks (analogous mimblewimble) only have list new inputs, list new outputs, and list signatures which are created from the aforementioned excess value (note that the latter list provides sufficient record all historical transactions). summary, generalizing, adapting and implementing mimblewimble approach for use hashnet provides chain format that has excellent scalability, privacy and fungibility properties. democratic user-governed system one the central features hashnet design democratic governance system which allows for involvement the entire community and open everyone.specifically, any node hashnet network can propose tenders, and then magnus consilium decides and votes each such proposal. magnus consilium comprised all the masternodes with positive reputation hashnet. voting decided simple majority. masternode and node incentives overview masternode owners are helping secure hashnet network enforcing the following: validating that all transactions have correct signatures for outputs being spent transactions must correct data format prevent double spending outputs being spent are valid any event gossiped through hashnet contains transaction that violates some the rules, then will rejected. addition securing the network, masternodes also provide some special functions: participating governance and voting enable budgeting and treasury system tolar masternode comprised of: masternode operator (owner) collateral held tolars that serves guarantee ensure masternode doesn't act maliciously server used part decentralized infrastructure hashnet collateral since masternodes are critical for processing transactions and helping secure the network, there need ensure that masternodes won't act maliciously. that's why operators need put collateral tol which then locked while masternode active. case constant malicious behaviour masternode (trying vote-in invalid transactions, dos attacks rest the network, constant invalid data), collateral will frozen, and masternode kicked off the network. required collateral for tolar masternode tol. masternode server server this case computer computing-cluster connected network which provides masternode services mentioned above. minimum requirements for server are: quad core bit processor ram available disk space mbps symmetrical internet connection fixed and unique (only one masternode can run one address) while these are minimum requirements, it's recommended have masternode better configuration, especially higher network load scenarios. case that your masternode starts lagging because insufficient processing power bandwidth, will not receive masternode rewards for those rounds. masternode rewards since masternode operators are spending their resources help secure the network, they will incentivized keep the masternodes running getting masternode rewards. rewards will comprised of: transaction fees all transactions that masternode helped validate correctly and time masternode incentives from tolar monetary reserve fund since rewards depend the transaction fees, clear that rewards will fluctuate depending the network usage. the more people use the network and make more transactions, the more rewards will masternode owners receive. insure best possible start the network, for the first years, masternode rewards from transactions fee fall below then part rewards will taken from tolar reserve fund ensure minimum roi. example scenarios scenario network constantly running capacity average around half tol supply masternodes (around masternodes) generates: transactions/sec tol (fee) sec year)) masternodes tol masternode tol tol this case, masternode owners makes roi yearly scenario network just starting, running below capacity average only small part tol supply masternodes (around masternodes) generates: transactions/sec tol (fee) sec year)) masternodes tol masternode this case,

masternode owners get additional benefit participating tolar network governance. any node can submit tender from one the following categories: social impact decentralization and governance outreach contribution network extensiveness after tenders are submitted, masternode owners then vote each proposal, and accept refuse it. this makes the masternode owner help the network decision making process, well the technical validation. using tolar platform vertical markets introduction using tolar platform based hashnet protocol can provide new features like scalability, high processing speed

nodes tolar development fund total tokens tokens faq technology what hashnet? hashnet scalable, efficient and high-impact decentralised solution social innovation challenges leveraging distributed ledger technology (dlt). this revolutionary algorithm features faster transaction time, masternodes and will have community governed cryptocurrency tolar. can tolar become major payment network? yes, tolar designed become worldwide payment network from the start. can you tell some future plans? want compete with ethereum and hyperledger. our goal offer faster, more scalable solution featuring masternodes and proof stake. what are the hashnet consensus mechanics? each member the network has copy the hashnet information structure that keeps record who propagated which event whom, and what sequence. those events are spread between hashnet members using gossip protocol and the validity events decided voting. however, order increase speed and reduce bandwidth needed, every member that has copy hashnet can calculate what would the vote that other member sent him and they had been running traditional byzantine agreement protocol that involved sending actual votes. tolar smart contract platform just like eth? yes. the top hashnet will deploy ethereum virtual machine. you have github? yes, but not yet open public. will announce once happens. you have some mvp? had live demonstration our prototype june with more than tps multiple nodes. how interchain support implemented? interchain support will done through contracts running top hashnet. when mainnet schedule? will tolar launch first erc straight mainnet? erc mainnet launch will receive erc token until mainnet? there will erc tokens issued before native token. will you have blockchain mainnet and then change another technology? now have custom blockchain testnet and for ico erc-. what platform will you issue tokens? will issue erc tokens placeholder tokens ico and then exchange for mainnet tokens when mainnet released. when you plan have token tradable? planned for after ico, and ico will start where can see whitepaper? you can see our whitepaper our website tolar.io. tolar the first currency being built hashnet infrastructure? yes, is. this infrastructure project? hashnet infrastructure project that will allow people build dapps. sale and presale what sale phases will you have? private sale, presale and ico phase did you start the airdrop campaign? no. any excluded countries? yes. usa and china. what you need eth for? want globally scale hashnet with different solutions for enterprises and governments. also want position tolar hashnet the top all dlts. the other hand, the competition fierce, and they have much more money than eth. when are the main tokens tradable? after ico when they come first exchange who can speak about public sale? you can find all the information our web our admins telegram and sending email info@tolar.io you have kyc process? yes. presale and whitelist process for ico now open. kyc form can accessed through our official website. when are likely get the kyc email regarding the private sale presale from the application? kyc process currently for presale and ico whitelist. you applied, you will get email soon. will there different kyc process for presale and ico? the same. when tge? ico time. what will happen unsold tokens? will keep them for business development. where can send business proposal? send email info@tolar.io masternodes will masternode owners receive rewards? yes, they will rewarded for helping secure the network. when will masternode live? cannot confirm that the moment, please stay tuned. will inform you. what are the server requirements for owning masternode? server this case computer computing-cluster connected network which provides masternode services mentioned above. minimum requirements for server are: quad core bit processor ram available disk space mbps symmetrical internet connection fixed and unique (only one masternode can run one address) while these are minimum requirements, it's recommended have masternode better configuration, especially higher network load scenarios. case that your masternode starts lagging behind because insufficient processing power bandwidth, will not receive masternode rewards for those rounds. what will the reward for masternode owners? described whitepaper. can earn rewards even not the owner masternode? yes, but there will significant difference rewards. how many coins for the masternode? you will need tol what will the maximum number masternodes? system can tolerate any number nodes that connect it. for regular node, there are special requirements, you just download tolar client and connect the network. for masternodes you are required lock tol. and total supply ,,, tol. whole supply will probably never masternodes. technically not problem have more than masternodes without performance lost. this point are sure about huge power savings compared pow currencies. what's the purpose arbitrary nodes? who and how decides who'll arbiter the network? and how many arbitrary nodes does network need? the arbitrary number masternodes provides much better decentralization the network. clear, there are nodes acting arbiters, the number nodes can arbitrary. where can get info about masternodes? there one group masternodes confirming everybody's transactions and executing all the smart contracts then it's not really dag, it? dag because masternode collects transactions their pool and then sends random node. the network events propagate through the network, they create dag locally every master node, which eventually consistent across the network and based that dag. every masternode can calculate the same states every other network without trusting others. what the role regular nodes propagate transactions through the network? regular nodes will also able staking however, they choose so, their reward percentage less than that masternodes. however, they don't decide stake anything, then yes, they will just propagate events and verify correctness graph. hashnet vs. hashgraph what the difference? the main difference that hashnet proof stake public ledger which doesn't have fixed number masternodes and which actually decentralized. moreover, are adding governance system top, where masternodes can vote the future the ledger. the way nodes are coming consensus different because arbitrary number masternodes. anyone who has enough stake for the master and the tech requirements can masternode. hedera hashgraph has council composed preselected big companies that decide funds and network future. tolar network, any member community running masternode can propose tenders and vote for them. also, our voting mechanism different since includes weighted votes proportional stake and reputation mechanism. for hashgraph function, needs know the number nodes the network advance, that's why was initially intended for permissioned networks only. our algorithm doesn't need know number nodes the network advance, the contrary, you can join leave any time you want. that's why started the project public ledger. our project will open-source where you can see exactly what's happening, while hashgraph closed source. has license been obtained from hashgraph (swirlds ink)? there are enough differences our algorithm not warrant any special licensing. are you using the same technology hashgraph but open source? similar tech but better algorithms, hashnet public proof stake ledger with arbitrary number masternodes with governance and reputation system. technical how come you don't just use rust and minimize your security issues? are more comfortable using c++ because all our developers are experienced c++ and use best practices make sure that doesn't happen. but use well for the more highlevel stuff and networking. how many tps were you able achieve your testnet and how many tps are expected achieved hashnet mainnet? the theoretical number calculated that possible achieve but right now can confirm that showcase more than tps multiple nodes. will continue improve and optimise our algorithm until can achieve our maximum. are you more decentralized than ripple and less decentralized than btc? ripple probably the one which the most centralized. so, the answer yes, hard say how much btc really decentralized. want provide really decentralized ledger which has masternode governance system and where the majority stakers can vote the changes. what programming language you use? are using both c++ and go. used for the high- level networking layer, all other stuff, which computationally heavy and can optimized, c++. what are the implications using c++ java? what are pros and cons? c++ much more efficient, and can dig into the low-level stuff optimize everything from memory management, execution speed, etc. also, are solving algorithmic problems high number nodes, c++ provides with the ability optimize many things the data structures are using, and, that way, can achieve better throughput than many others. what ways this coin different from all other pos with masternodes, they are all cheap, fast and scalable? are also fair sense that there are blocks, miners and masternodes cannot decide the order transactions. time finality few seconds. addition all that, there virtual machine top, making possible run smart contracts and dapps without hitting performance limits any time soon. how you plan showcase the progress tps for the network progress being made? first, tests will run developer's network, where can deploy several dozens masternodes and nodes that will sending large pools random transactions. results our developers testing will periodically published our medium and other channels (telegram, fb, twitter, ln). since plan switch repository public mode, anyone with some technical developer experience should able replicate our test setup and verify the numbers for himself, wishes. also, the program interface gets more user-friendly, will start hashnet testnet, were even non-technical users will able try out everything they want. when could start study and develop dapps testnet? dapps, per roadmap, will come later point (after hashnet protocol fully implemented). will the formal verification out arxi just the whitepaper? are still deciding it, but turns out significant scientific article, will publish and make available arxiv well. business you have official announcement channel telegram? yes, our official announcement telegram channel can accessed here: https://t.me/tolario which country the company based? legal entities that run tolar hashnet project are based slovenia and croatia. will you translate whitepaper other languages? yes. references jelasity m., montresor and babaoglu gossip-based aggregation large dynamic networks. acm trans. comput. syst.
