chatbot for securely sending money the facebook messenger instant messaging platform, and has performed series early tests. these have helped identify the chatbot's scalability and garnered important customer feedback. tigereum ready commence full live pilot and integrate crypto into the chatbot. you can try our prototype bot the tigereum website www.tigereum.io igereum industry background cryptocurrencies readers this whitepaper are familiar with the background cryptocurrencies. summary provided here: cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital currencies which operate outside normal central banking. bitcoin was the first major cryptocurrency, commencing after paper was released under the name satoshi nakamoto. there are close million bitcoins mined, trading around us$ each with capitalization us$ billion. bitcoin value has doubled over the last months alone. other major cryptocurrencies are ethereum, ripple, litecoin and dash which make part over cryptocurrencies worldwide with total value roughly us$ billion. trade between cryptocurrencies, and in/out fiat, crypto exchanges have become important service providers the crypto community. there are about crypto exchanges. approximately us$,, traded crypto exchanges each day. crypto holders keep their cryptocurrency assets digital wallets. digital wallets are like online bank portals. you can see which cryptocurrencies you own, and their current value. you can buy more crypto into your wallet, sell (through exchange). igereum digital wallets enable customers send and receive crypto directly and from other crypto holders. your digital wallet, you have anonymous, encrypted, randomly-generated address for your cryptocurrency. this like bank account number (but it's long you have hope remembering it). you can send crypto friend their address from within your digital wallet. you can only send and receive crypto and from your digital wallet you and your friend have crypto. you want send funds friend who does not have crypto, you have first convert your crypto fiat, then transfer your bank account, and finally send fiat your friend from your bank account through international remitter, indeed instant message. generally, there charge send and receive crypto between digital wallets. online landscape facebook, google, alibaba, tencent, apple and microsoft know that many customers would prefer use instant messaging message money friends and family, especially for smaller social-type payments, this what customers will get. facebook introduced messaging small amounts money for customers messenger. this brilliant customer interface, very easy use. however, facebook has struggled overcome the international regulatory obstacles roll this out globally. has also apparently been working patent protect its unique solution for messaging money. the meantime, facebook's dual strategy work with remittance partners outside the and support payment chatbots its messenger platform. igereum wechat introduced instant messaging money customers china the owners wechat recently bought moneygram, expect see this feature expand rapidly for its chinese customers. snapchat introduced instant messaging money its platform partnering with square. whatsapp announced that plans enable instant messaging international currencies. whatsapp preferred international users, therefore the opportunities for whatsapp are big the regulatory obstacles and currency exchange challenges. could unwittingly running international remittance operation within instant messaging platform, and earning significant revenue from currency exchange. seems this strategy still under consideration. hike (in india) announced august that would introduce payments its instant messaging platform. paypal has been successfully messaging money emails and mobile phone numbers for over ten years. venmo paypal brand) messages money the and singapore through instant messaging app. sending money using instant messaging changing the way use the internet, and how communicate. online experiences which require download desktop software, browser, send sms, install mobile app, even make phone call, are decline. instant messaging money the next big thing. igereum instant messaging even outstripping the new social media tools which put facebook, google and amazon the map ten years ago. instant messaging becoming more popular than the generation social media apps all first came use, and this change occurring right now. the social media companies are having re-invent themselves already. because these trends, and the possibility skimming large number small fees across global banking transactions market worth over us$ trillion per year international remittances alone) easy see why social media companies are working how make payments work their instant messaging platforms. international remitters international remitters (of fiat currencies) are very relevant this market analysis, and tigereum. the key international remitters are western union, moneygram, and transferwise. paypal not regarded traditional international remitter, but rates mention here too. primary customer-facing tools for international remitters are local branches and agents dispensing cash. western union has over branches and agents around the world. where they employ technology they are, the main, still using only web browsers, sms and mobile apps, which are clunky use. international remitters are expensive, and part the centralized financial ecosystem which represents fiat currencies, central banking and burdensome regulations. igereum western union not particularly inventive challenging, and all know well. the dinosaur the park. moneygram was recently acquired chinese financial conglomerate tencent (which also owns wechat). expect changes. transferwise being successful disrupter. only ten years, transferwise has grown remitting billion per month. recently released remittance chatbot. paypal doing great work. has strong customer interface and breaking all the rules (in good way) better serve customers' financial requirements smoothly and efficiently. start-up fintechs like revolut the are also doing interesting work this market. ripple cryptocurrency which developing some great tools for international remittances. its focus seems the top the end the market facilitate efficient movement large amounts international currencies between banks and global corporations. this very important work for the crypto community, however, unlikely that ripple will deliver solutions for sending and receiving crypto friends and family. none these fiat international remitters show any signs using digital currencies revolutionize themselves and create efficiencies. none them seem adopting crypto the way forward decentralized, anonymous, encrypted world which treats currencies jurisdictionallybound anachronisms. they are all very much creatures their highly-regulated environments and legacy customer interfaces. even paypal starting look legacy now. igereum fact, rather than develop their own solutions for messaging international remittances, looks like their preferred strategy partner with the social media companies deliver the systems, compliance and back-end banking for messaging money instant messaging platforms. digital wallet instant messaging the crypto community has built impressive ecosystem over the last ten years, and indeed possible send crypto from digital wallet. however, typical digital wallets are hard work for most people and are expensive use. they are not the preferred way send and receive money between friends and family. difficult use your digital wallet simply send small amounts crypto. it's usually easier send money from online bank portal. the problem that digital wallets have customer interfaces based old forms. crypto has leapt ahead new form digital currency, but digital wallets have not kept with new forms customer communication and they have not linked with the social media tools use everyday. digital wallets may good for holding and trading cryptocurrencies, but not for sending funds friends and family. customers will continue message fiat their default choice their preferred instant messaging platform before they send crypto from digital wallet everyday. igereum competitor analysis tigereum not proposing any these things: crypto wallet crypto exchange remittance bank social media billing platform foreign exchange payment card tigereum will blockchain, anonymous, encrypted and secure instant messaging chatbot send crypto friends and family. who competing with tigereum the crypto community? have not identified any direct competitors. nobody seems doing what tigereum proposing. have identified number indirect competitors tigereum the crypto community whose mission provide good customer interface crypto holders, and help them use their crypto predominantly fiat world. they are not digital wallets (exclusively) but are building website and app solutions which are friendlier and easier use than the average digital wallet, and which generally also enable their customers send crypto friends and family fiat world. igereum wirex (www.wirex.com) bitcoin wallet website and app with plastic and digital prepaid mastercard attached. customers can move funds within the wirex wallet between bitcoin and fiat, and spend their fiat online and instore with the mastercard. also enables send/receive between other wirex account holders, and easier links your fiat bank account(s). cryptopay (www.cryptopay.me) also offers plastic and digital prepaid mastercard that customers can spend their bitcoin fiat currencies online and in-store, and send crypto other cryptopay account holders. izibits (www.izibits.io) interesting tigereum because its whole architecture built chatbot. not website app. website/app chatbot. all interactions with their customers occur within chat. developing new suite services, including: transfers, international remittances, prepaid mastercard, shopping platform, and crypto exchange. bitpay (www.bitpay.com) us-based payment gateway for crypto/fiat. seems pitched mainly merchants who want accept crypto payments. bitpay enables merchants and retails customers send crypto and fiat their shopping ecosystems. byteball (www.byteball.org) one the few new blockchain offerings could find which allows you chat and pay instant message, one the many things does. however, none these crypto companies are doing what tigereum proposing. igereum disruption messaging money instant messaging platforms going game changer. will disrupt many markets: banks (domestic and international transfers) remitters (western union, moneygram, transferwise) payment apps (venmo, paypal, paytm, revolut) crypto should not left behind this change sweeps through our financial institutions the customer experience gap between crypto and fiat will widen further. fact, crypto should leading this disruption. crypto's decentralized blockchain architecture should taking this battle on, not leaving the social media companies. first mover advantage tigereum has significant first mover advantage. are well positioned ride the instant messaging wave for the crypto community can start our development work and go-to-market strategies now. our primary aim provide viable alternative the market for crypto holders message crypto their friends and family, that they not have convert fiat simply message funds easily and efficiently. our secondary aim build all the benefits crypto make messaging crypto better and more secure solution for messaging funds, especially across international borders. igereum tigereum tokens cryptocurrency for instant messages tigereum tokens will the cryptocurrency used send crypto friends and family instant message. senders will buy tigereum tokens message money. recipients will redeem tigereum tokens into their preferred crypto fiat currency receive their money. the mechanisms for this occur securely and efficiently will developed further through the course this project. initial tokens there will fifty million (,,) tigereum tokens created. forty million (,,) these will swapped for eth under the token swap program described further this whitepaper. listing tigereum tokens tigereum tokens will listed public cryptocurrency exchanges, starting with etherdelta. this listing scheduled for monday december (the close date for the token swap). tigereum tokens will listed other exchanges promptly after monday december maximise trading opportunities for tigereum token holders. revenue model tigereum will earn revenue from payments flowing through our platform. this revenue stream will underpin the value tigereum tokens. igereum common for crypto exchanges charge for transfers, and for international remitters charge fees (including exchange margins) for fiat remittances. based these competitor price points, tigereum expects revenues through its chatbot attract gross margins the range value proposition tigereum's high-margin revenues will create environment which upward price pressure can benefit token swap participants, and ensure strong secondary market into the long term. tigereum gains traction the market, more tigereum tokens will required our customers message crypto. this will give rise greater liquidity and upward price pressure the value tigereum tokens. the availability (and pricing) tigereum tokens will controlled the secondary market, token swap participants can assured that there will viable secondary market for tigereum tokens when market. messaging tigereum tokens tigereum will develop the mechanisms securely message crypto seamlessly and cost-effectively without compromising anonymity and the blockchain's integrity. anticipate that these mechanisms may require tigereum hold treasury float manage the exchange between crypto and fiat currencies. this treasury float, required, will not created until tigereum ready market not required during the development phase, and need get the model right first. igereum intellectual property tigereum may apply for patents for methods develop within our chatbots for messaging crypto. patents will further underpin the value tigereum tokens and reduce the risk unfair competition. this will considered after our key development work has finished, but before market. regulation until tigereum has completed its development, not possible have clarity about what regulations may apply tigereum tokens. tigereum will obtain legal advice regulatory compliance before launching any chatbots using tigereum tokens the market. notwithstanding this uncertainty, this stage recognize there are four key areas regulation consider regardless which laws may apply: consumer protection, prevention money laundering, taxation and remittances. all countries, regulators with responsibility for ensuring that financial services are provided way that protects consumers and maintains the integrity the market will interested tigereum tokens. local tax laws are complex, and will apply case case basis, depending where tigereum tokens are issued. the prevention money laundering taken very seriously many countries around the world. tigereum will all times act prevent money laundering. igereum not clear whether messaging tigereum tokens would constitute remittance, and whether tigereum would have comply with the regulatory requirements which various countries impose international remitters. insurance all tigereum tokens will fully insured and kept cold storage. this means that tigereum were suffer breach its online storage, the insurance policy would pay cover any funds lost result. the insurance policy covers any losses resulting from breach tigereum's physical security, cyber security, employee theft. the policy planned provided syndicate insurers through lloyd's london (which also insures, for example, airbnb tokenbase). this will also apply other digital currency that tigereum will hold, such eth which will receive under the token swap. igereum token swap introduction tigereum will make forty million (,,) tigereum tokens available swap for eth. key dates the token swap opens gmt friday december and closes gmt monday december token swap price the token swap price eth for tigereum tokens. first day bonus when the token swap opens friday december there will bonus. your eth can swapped for tigereum tokens (giving you bonus tigereum tokens). this bonus applies only from gmt gmt the first day friday december. public exchanges monday december tigereum tokens will listed etherdelta. will list promptly other public exchanges such coss.io after this initial listing. igereum pre-swaps pre-swaps are available until monday november will offer special bonuses pre-swap participants. contact for your pre-swap special bonus. the objective pre-swaps fund this token swap campaign and further develop the tigereum prototype. pre-swap participants will rewarded with the following additional benefits: personal invitation participate testing vip invitation product launch bonuses for early participation priority access the first buyback benefits token swap have structured the token swap minimise risks and maximise returns for participants: prototype already testing experienced team entrepreneurs low, hard cap the number tokens optional buyback burn program tokens integral part the business model allocation tigereum tokens will allocated follows: token swap participants, including pre-swap and bonuses split between bounty (%), team members and advisors (.%) and founders (.%). the unlikely event that not all the tokens allocated for the token swap are swapped, they will burned. igereum erc- standard ethereum smart contracts enable very transparent and secure way profit sharing among tigereum token holders. tigereum tokens will ethereum-based token value. ethereum-based tokens are digital asset, bearing value themselves based their underlying assets and associated rights. they rely well-established ethereum infrastructure, benefiting from several advantages: security and predictability (as opposed to, for example, having run independent blockchain network). use robust and well-supported clients (ethereumbased tokens can managed with official ethereum clients). high liquidity (interchangeable with other ethereumbased tokens eth); easier listing exchanges with infrastructure already place. our ethereum-based tigereum token smart contract will comply with the erc- standard, and will extremely easy for exchange trading happen. more detailed information about the erc- standard: https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/ igereum use token swap funds overseen the advisory board and financial auditors, eth swapped for tigereum tokens will used fund: the development tigereum's chatbot solution, legal and regulatory costs, go-to-market team around the tigereum solution, marketing grow the tigereum business, and working capital for operations the tigereum business establishes itself, and the treasury float crypto and fiat currencies needed tigereum enable settlements occur (subject the mechanism finally adopted). buyback burn tigereum will allocate corporate profits buying back tigereum tokens. participation the buyback program optional. tigereum token holders who participate will receive their buyback the form eth swap. priority will given preswap participants the first buyback program. tigereum expects burn buyback tokens. our buyback burn program will allow the net asset value tigereum token increase, giving all token holders fair way gain value their tigereum tokens over the long-term. igereum facebook messenger bot tigereum has developed facebook
