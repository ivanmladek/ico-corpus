ever since napster enabled music files freely shared digital content-related technologies easily enabled sharing music, and even video files without damaging compromising the original. also, when apple released the iphone the world camera was essentially put everyone's hands, and photos taken ordinary people became one the most popular contents. however, despite such rapid developments, the image market has yet institutionalized. the typical image market ecosystem known the 'social image market', there are hardly any rightful rewards provided users and their creations. instead, most the profits are directed towards platform providers. addition, there are fewer opportunities for professional creators and aspiring indie groups. the pibble project represents the interests the following groups people: individuals who are leading the quantitative image market through the sharing images and videos social media; entertainers whose portrait rights connects directly their branding value; experts the stock image market, the traditional paid image market that needs change; and indie artists who are aspiring pursue dreams creation and develop them into careers. hile allowing groups above communicate with each other within the pibble ecosystem, pibble aims reorganize the existing market that each group member the ecosystem may properly compensated for the images and works they have created. this, the pibble project planning developing decentralized marketplace based blockchain, while building incentivized ecosystem, which the more users share and participate, the more they get rewarded. the pibble project, decentralized and shared platform that protects the value the creations aims challenge the status quo which most the users don't recognize that the images they upload daily social media such facebook, instagram, etc. can great asset them. developing decentralized image market through cryptocurrency called pibble, aim create blockchain based image ecosystem which can allow images circulated and distributed the pibble market platform. image market pibble project target are living 'image culture' which being newly created through ongoing social media activities. standing ''isual superiority zone', share our perspectives with others through pictures and gifs rather than speech words. the pibble project starts with such popular images. pibble blockchain-based cryptocurrency that brings together image creators and consumers, compensating them for the work they create, use and enjoy. the types images that the pibble project handles are not only picture stock image, but also various kinds images such cartoons, characters, illustrations, graphics, pictures entertainers (including singers, actors, etc.) and video stills. the users the pibble project are comprised mostly ordinary individuals that not have clear concepts portrait rights, but also includes entertainer groups who have difficult time exercising their portrait rights online, expert groups who had been managing business through images, well indie groups who have had little opportunity have their creations valued. creators the pibble project will receive rightful rewards for their work, and this will done through building blockchain based image ecosystem. this will achieved creating community ecosystem where anyone can participate and rewards users they participate, and providing blockchain-based social image market users. furthermore, experts, pibble will serve platform that protects their rights creative works and effectively connects image sellers and consumers. the pibble project's services uses blockchain technology and individual techniques and image tracking system limit the image's unauthorized use and let users send images consensually. through these methods, the pibble project will develop into blockchain based image ecosystem that merges the social media market, image market and all user bases. image market status social image market the user base for social media growing breakneck pace with facebook now having over billion users, profits generated through social media worldwide also increasing rapidly. according statista, global market research organization, social media such facebook, twitter and linkedin aggregated global advertisement revenues approximately usd billion and expected reach usd billion also, the average revenue per user, namely the value total revenue divided number users, was usd and expected greatly increase usd shown this instance, can see that the number users and increase sales generally proportional. million dollars (e) revenue (e) (e) revenue (e) (e) (e) average revenue per user the case instagram, currently has expected revenue usd billion, from which usd billion was mobile advertisement revenue. (e) (e) mobile internet advertising revenue (e) (e) (e) total annual revenue also, facebook's revenue was usd billion, which increase from same quarter the preceding year, which had been attributed advertisement revenue. advertising payments and other fees through various instances, can seen that the number users and the social media platform provider's revenues are directly proportional. however, not structured distribute rewards participating users, but rather most profits are taken platform providers. paid image market according technavio, marketing research facility, the global stock image market estimated reach billion the most significant portion transactions thereto was micro-stock images and flat rate sales, which recorded sales approximately million. video image (footage) related sales, which are very likely grow the future, totaled million, and the relatively highpriced (royalty managed)/ (royalty fee) market was million. total market size billion micro stockimage fiate rate million footage category million rm/rf million experts predict that the stock image market will continue grow. technavio expects the stock image market grow average annual rate reaching billion. ith the development communication-based technologies such the internet, more images will created and the still images market well the video image market will expand. the growing need for visual effects the media field, such marketing, also one the factors that forecasts the growth the market. appropriate use images can enhance the purchasing power the products and public relations effect. the pibble project based global stock image market which worth billion. however, the pibble project will break the frame the existing stock image industry and introduce new industrial structure that enables not only professionals but also ordinary people buy and sell their images the pibble ecosystem problems centralized social media platform excessive growth commercial activities used marketing tool social media platforms have become medium for commercial advertisements, place for communication, exchange opinions and sharing information. consequently, there has been rise consumer's dissatisfaction well damages incurred from the use social media. according the korea consumer agency, out consumers, have answered "experienced dissatisfaction" from the use social media platforms and such dissatisfaction was caused "excess amount commercial posts". further, seen the chart above, case which platform provider returning massive profits generated through marketing back its users extremely rare. monopoly profits platform providers also prevalent problem with the social media market. due increase advertisement exposure frequency, platform provider's profit increases. however, ironically, the user's usage environment becoming increasingly worse. indiscriminate leakage personal information and user activity history ith facebook's user information leakage incident which lead the bring gdpr into effect, social media's personal information leakage done opposed user-user agreement and beyond agreed limits. platform providers monopolize user's personal information and make profits through advertisements and selling user data. that process, transparency inhibited, questioning the platform provider's ethical and legal responsibility. this problem caused when centralized services undertakes excessive business activities and allows individual's private information shared with companies, regardless our actual wishes preferences. problems the paid image market unreasonable payment methods huge intermediary, the stock image agency the stock image market, which largely paid market and multi-billion-dollar market, expected grow continuously. ironically, however, unlike the recent growth market size, revenues the creators are actually declining. this due the rights the creators not being managed properly. structure which the stock image market company has the upper hand over the creators becoming fixated, giving rise various problems. most large stock image companies are introducing subscription system compete against companies providing images for free. this sales method has its perks since numerous people can use quality images low rates. however, significant portion the revenue taken the stock image companies brokerage commissions, and due the lower price sold images, the profits the original creators decrease significantly. addition, one the many problems the current market that takes long time calculate their profits; for example, takes about days even "shutter stock," leading company the stock images market. meaning, users are subject transaction restrictions due such payment methods. for these reasons, creators have two choices, namely look for other agencies which guarantee better treatment, simply accept the situation is. opaque selection and pricing system upload image today, stock image companies permit users upload their images only the images pass their own internal review. companies implement their own review standards, and creators have abide them which can't help being regarded irrational since big portion stock image company's profits rely creators uploading their work. the review procedures take long time and certain companies often delete photos that has already been approved without proper notice. for these reasons, difficult for indie creators and general people assert the value their own creations secure their rights because the market itself starts with opaque selection criterion. pibble will aim solve this problem transparently disclosing the process images that are being uploaded which directly linked the livelihood creators and through voting system within the pibble ecosystem. evaporation rights due the inability identify the distribution process creation intellectual properties can popular stock images with lot effort put into them even popular cartoon characters. both can steadily make profit unless the creators manually delete them. result, the needs those who work full-time stock image creator has increased steadily. hile images are valuable assets many creators, there virtually device system protect their rights due the absence proper tracking system and ways manage unauthorized images. pibble aims fix this using our self-developed image tracking system which was operated for years and plan expand the reach this blockchain solultion. pibble will provide service that offers protection not only professionals, but even regular people from copyright infringement which can result creating profitable models for them. pibble ecosystem summary the pibble ecosystem combines media contents sharing social platform with blockchain technology, thus creating the following ecosystem. reward system for social value blockchain based commerce crowdfunding using cryptocurrency marketing system between social participants reward for contents curation marketplace expansion for experts the pibble platform social sharing platform that manufactures and consumes media contents similar instagram. but while instagram has its data centralized, the pibble platform has user user rewards and empowerment methods means adopting decentralized social platform. rewarding platform using blockchain and cryptocurrency blogs known steemit, already existence. the pibble platform combines rewarding platforms like steemit and popular contents such images, thereby constructing more comprehensive rewarding social platform ecosystem. reward system for social value participants the pibble platform create social value uploading and sharing media contents such photos videos. other words, platform participants share uploaded contents and express their opinion through reactions such 'likes' and comments, and the pibble platform converts these expressions into social value. this, the pibble platform provides cryptocurrency pibble(pib) and pibble brush participants reward system. that is, 'social value' refers sympathizing and providing value contents stimulating users' emotions and reasons. the pibble platform allows users directly reward creator through upvoting. blockchain based commerce instagram, users may add purchase buttons their posts, lot products are being posted contents and followers consume these advertising contents, leading purchases. pibble provides improved commerce mechanisms for posting commercial contents and sales. commerce contents can purchased directly from the platform using pib coins brush, providing secure payment features including cancellation, edit and final approval payment. marketing system between social participants pibble, unlike other centralized platforms, does not use user's data for advertisements. rather, participant wishes appeal his contents for business purposes, such participant may use reward system such followme, giftbrush, brushtag, etc. reward users with brush/coin reward for following his profile. this advertisement rewards structure expected valuable for its innovative marketing platform expands. crowdfunding with cryptocurrency pibble participants can create crowdfunding projects within the pibble platform raise necessary funds. creators may post stories involving, the reason behind crowfunding, the schedule, the target amount, and reward, etc. and participants can send pib coin brush support funding. this story funding includes photo trips, fundraising for charity, etc. particular, the pibble foundation will select one many photo trips and charity crowdfundings, giving them extra funding contribute social enterprise. contents curation reward pibble's social participants can curate collection even though they don't post any pictures their own. participants can use other's contents with appropriate themes (bgm, speed, effects, etc.). these collections can seen other users and upvoted, thus providing brush reward. this reward distributed not only the curator but also original author, therefore helping reward ecosystem please note that pibble not planning provide this crowdfunding feature singapore due certain legal and regulatory considerations. expand. expand expert marketplace the pibble platform offers level based standards for users. among those levels, professional level users may upload contents full and sell their contents while having their copyright protected. the pibble platform uses bitdna protect the copyright professional contents, extracting characteristics contents, hashing its value, and writing the hashed value into blockchain. other words, this hash value unique the content, comparing multiple hash values can confirm whether content duplicate. also, professional contents' use copyright, movements since its creations are managed the blockchain network. therefore, ownership data copyrights are managed together. because impossible edit delete records image's movement process written real-time the blockchain network. pibble platform components construct the pibble ecosystem, pibble presents evolved social sharing platform using blockchain technology. particular, the pibble platform has unique features such photo sharing service, reward and purchase system using cryptocurrency, commerce and crowdfunding and professional marketplace. the pibble platform constructed with the following elements implement above features. evolved reward system participant level system cryptocurrency payment system ethereum network and hybrid system mainnet evolved reward system 'provide coins participants who uploaded photos?' many blockchain services try expand and vitalize their ecosystem rewarding participants with coins. but exposes ecosystem insoluble natural limitations and abuse. for instance, some participants might over issue meaningless data get more rewards. photo service like instagram added rewards their service, significant number users will upload dummy files get rewards. the pibble platform propose two kinds brush solution this reward system conundrum. green brush red brush the green brush reward point given participants for their activities. however, this green brush unlike other mileage point system that cannot used for user's own good. participants must use green brushes that they have been rewarded with contributing platform and sharing contents for other participants. for instance, one contributor rewards someone else's photo video with upvote. thereafter, the green brush will automatically turn into red brush while getting transferred someone else. other words, give green brushes person 'a', equivalent person getting red brushes. the red brush can also used within the platform like pib token. that is, can changed pib token wallet used activities such purchasing products. the pibble brush cannot traded exchanges and can only used within the pibble platform. pibble brush can exercise influence proportional brush balance community activities, especially voting, and can given other account even with this method, abuse still possible. for example, abusing the green brush red brush conversion structure, possible give particular account excessive amount green brushes. prevent such abuse, both green brushes and red brushes have limits based user's level. other words, user with more participation and contribution has higher limits, thus able earn and give larger amount brushes. chart below describes various activities earn pibble brushes. the amount pibble brushes earned calculated number

system currencies used within the pibble platform are brush and pib token. the pibble platform uses cryptocurrencies, making immediate payments with the least commission, and also provides escrow services for secure payments. the escrow service service that makes final payment approval after visual confirmation the product. often used second-hand sale gig consumer's request. network and hybrid system the pibble platform uses the ethereum network for payments systems and copyright protection. however, for users' immediate purchase system, purchases made within the platform managed hybrid systems such central exchanges. mainnet the pibble platform uses the ethereum network, which has firm user base and verification system. however, for the expansion the pibble platform, relocation mainnet being considered for further decentralized cryptocurrency transactions and more efficient transfers. relocation mainnet happens, previous pib tokens will converted pib coins. pibble token ecosystem the pibble token (pib) used within the pibble ecosystem for transactions between participants, payment method, funding. user can buy products commerce participate crowdfunding receive participation rewards. pibble token has cryptocurrency's payment function is, thus being able perform global payment system for demand own use images and photos globally. other words, global image marketplace, the pibble ecosystem uses the blockchain network and the pibble token serves global media payment method without having adjust exchange rates every day. also, can dramatically reduce unnecessary time and money spent through brokerage firms. addition, the pibble token has advertisement features for participants who need promotions. advertisers can advertise themselves through photos and videos, engage marketing which rewards participants with pib tokens red brushes when they follow, tag, like advertiser's contents. pibble roadmap team building idea development, forming
