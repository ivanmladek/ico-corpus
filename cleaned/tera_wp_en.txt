akin operating system. tera consists repository programs and data storage integrated into the internet. the mechanism for publishing programs and data this platform free from censorship. the circulatory system the blockchain. consider the following layers: hardware software database centralized network decentralized network the century, everyone has computing device like computer, laptop, smartphone, smart watch, and on. itself, such device useless for person always running program that performs something useful. the result the program displayed the user interface. often, results are persisted the device's data layer able access them again. even greater usefulness achieved allowing other users access this data over network. thus, each successive increases the usefulness for the user. communicate with each other, devices are combined into network topology which each such device called node. the easiest way combine nodes into network use single coordinating server, but such solution centralized with corresponding unreliability due single point failure. there are other solutions which all devices are equal, have the same rank and priority and which will call decentralized network. important understand that the decentralized network works whole; nodes communicate with one another throughout the network well-coordinated mechanism. achieve this, there are special algorithms for interaction nodes with each other, which will call consensus. can be: time consensus, delivery consensus, data chain consensus. tera the next generation human-software interaction. tera smart money seite introduction problems with modern blockchains low speed. breakthrough (rocket science) technology back the main bottleneck the blockchain was clear was its slow work. the situation has not changed the duration since then. the industry needs technology that enables hundreds millions people around the world work with it, and that uses dynamic scalability. the lack such technology leads the stagnation the industry and the loss capitalization cryptocurrencies exchanges. dapps and centralization the term dapp stands for decentralized application, but present, applied incorrectly. called program that interacts with smart contract the blockchain and actually located centralized server. that part which the centralized server key because without the server not possible use. such dapp can only guarantee the preservation the user's funds, since they are the blockchain. this situation due the fact that the current blockchains not provide hosting services their platform. there such thing user interface existing blockchains (with the exception the tera blockchain). integration with the web blockchain remains too virtual for ordinary users comprehend; they not see before their eyes. difficult believe something you have never seen. adding visualization interfaces the blockchain will allow users see and start working with right now. the real distribution the blockchain will helped the simplicity software development. this, the language the smart contract should simple and familiar possible. you need use simple language and modern, common technologies (javascript and html) maximize the adoption rate through basic familiarity. web programmers are the largest group blockchain users the industry. they will able quickly create popular applications the blockchain and make them convenient possible for all users make use dapps. tera smart money seite implementation theoretical aspects fast routing network traditional blockchains not use the ordering nodes with each other. the overall picture the network looks randomized, like this: this random organization links does not guarantee fast delivery blocks between all nodes. tera, nodes organize themselves into orderly manner communication: the blockchain takes longer than seconds deliver data from the node the last one. achieve this, the nodes are connected each other special connection, based the similarity the addresses nodes with each other. node addresses are random values bytes) and not change during node operation. the number connections with other nodes has logarithmic dependence the number nodes the network, thereby achieving relatively constant time transaction delivery. tera smart money seite thus, were the network consist billion nodes, the delivery time between the nodes would still more than milliseconds (ms), the maximum time will seconds. the delay time for delivery transactions between nodes the upper bound, but practice, less than because nodes with less mutual delay have connection priority. order make successful connections more permanent, each node records statistics successful exchanges with the node with which the contents the blocks are exchanged. this statistic affects the connection priority. network protocol the transaction sent the user neighboring nodes (where from the transaction added the newly formed block (the block the current second). when the exchange stage comes, the transaction begins move from one node another, accumulating the block. block contains more transactions than can hold, then transactions with large pow are left this how ddos protection implemented. the end the block formation stage, the signature stage and the pow block calculation second) are performed, then the three-second stage the leader block search with the maximum pow begins. the block gets added the blockchain. conveyor processing blocks blockchain: forms blocks times per second, but the time confirmation the block (i.e. the on-time block the blockchain) seconds. order create blocks times faster than the confirmation time, the pipeline processing blocks used. this can thought separate blockchains, with formation period seconds. each such blockchain shifted relative each other for one second. thus, create block the blockchain for one second, block the blockchain for the next second, and the blockchain. order connect these blockchains into one, they are glued together. traditional blockchains, the hash the previous block included single chain the header each block. the tera blockchain, for these purposes, the hash the previous block calculated the basis several previous blocks each the blockchains. this stage, get logical binding chains into one. tera smart money seite several blocks are processed parallel, the order processing depends the current time (the current block): timing: new (current) block, loading transactions from mempool, timer activation the beginning synchronization unit (distributed unit of) end synchronization bundle data block with the previous blocks, the calculation pow the search begins the maximum pow network the end the search max. pow check the validity the unit taking into account possible changes the previous blocks due download the new block chain with large total pow from the diagram you can see that the block refers the previous blocks but with delta blocks. once determined valid and stored the database, blocks from the then participate unloading other nodes (similarly, they can loaded from other nodes). this how blocks look the tera blockchain explorer page; tera smart money seite separation data delivery and validation each node the network equal the others. the number nodes unlimited. communication between nodes carried out through the organization single data chain, which information recorded the form commands (transactions). often such chain called blockchain, but this platform, its application expanded. traditionally, the blocks are written the transaction. this case, not allowed write the transaction block, which invalid (for example, having the incorrect digital signature, insufficient funds the account, double spending, etc.). the tera platform, the blockchain used transport, arbitrary information can written blocks (hereafter, will call transactions). the interpretation the correctness the information lies with higher-level applications. the blockchain has consensus mechanism that determines which data chain true, but this consensus does not contain rules for interpreting transactions within the block. the block data black box all operations are performed with set bytes. the pow algorithm used protect against ddos attacks. the greater the length transactions, the greater the value must for pow. the pow value calculated the client before sending the transaction the network. data river the tera platform can abstractly represented water channel, which guarantees continuity and numerological order passage ships with cargo containers. the channel not responsible for the jurisdiction ships and cargo. the utility the ships receive ports, fishing factories, warehouses, etc., they load the ships with useful work. how used? let's say you need deliver the goods port and port has put the goods the container and sent the port. port check all containers for the right contents and pick the cargo when you find it. the channel delivers ships all ports destination just seconds. important aspect here the numerological order. the purpose the blockchain make sure that each device has single order and composition blocks. this provided, the program that reads them will always produce the same result all computers the world the data the same. thus, even these blocks are incorrect transactions, double spending, and on, the program the user side will see and reject its execution. this called the transaction validation process. speed the whole system, separated from the block delivery process. thus, can perform validation another time and another process, without interfering with the blockchain, well much faster due the mass checks can group operations and speed the work due fewer database accesses. tera smart money seite the dependence the size the blockchain database from user settings with large amounts data that will inevitably occur tps, new users should able quickly download the blockchain validate and start working with it. therefore, the download order changed was previously from the beginning the chain, will now downloaded from the end. loading information will depend the user's settings the size the disk memory that has allocated for the blockchain. depending the size, the next download priority will be: the chart accounts block headers the contents blocks transactions how will work: for super thin client: only part the headers and piece the invoice table will loaded. for the average customer: the entire table accounts and titles but only part the content blocks for the full client-all data (as done now) example: the user allocates space for the blockchain the disk, for example this disk space divided into three parts: regular block structure (starting from the end), for example other blocks that are not included regular structure but are required stored the node (determined the dht principle i.e., the degree similarity the addresses the nodes), for example the last commonly used blocks, for example security double spending the tera blockchain uses pow consensus. this allows all transactions arranged sequential order. transactions are also executed sequentially. when withdrawing from the account, the necessary amounts are checked. the time recordation, the counter "operationid" incremented. each subsequent payment transaction must have the next "operationid" number prevent the same transaction from being applied multiple times. tera smart money seite calculating the number block confirmations the bitcoin network, protect the user against double spending, necessary wait for least minutes, sometimes hour. the tera network, blocks are created every second, but you want the same degree reliability the bitcoin network you need wait for the same duration. the duration time you wait correlates the degree reliability. there magic here; any pow algorithm, you exchange time for reliability. tera, have made more flexible choice. you can wait seconds, minute, hour (if, for example, transferring sums worth millions dollars). economic stimulus miners miners perform complex calculations the hash for block create the immutability the blockchain. the reward for the found hash block provides the economic incentive the miner. this reward calculated follows: one billionth (.) the balance the unallocated amount coins remaining multiplied the hundredth part the square the logarithm the miner (net) power. initially, the total unallocated amount was equal billion coins (the total issue the tera), over time the reward will fall, but this will compensated the real exchange rate the exchanges, well the reverse replenishment the unallocated balance coins due paid transactions: tera creating new account for users out the restrictive queue tera creating smart contract/dapp tera creation smart token (i.e. own currency) payment goes the account (i.e. back the unallocated balance for mining). the price the transaction will continue change through the dao mechanism voting. protection from ddos attacks each block has limit kb; the average transaction size bytes, average transactions per block placed. each transaction must have pow field, which records the work done calculate the hash. this field used determine whether not this transaction included the block. must least certain value and must sufficient compete with other transactions. only the first (approximately) transactions with the highest pow values are included the block. calculations: the large capacity the blockchain and the requirement for mandatory pow execution each transaction sent allows you effectively organize ddos protection with the following limits: the attacker has processing power times the average user. the average network load i.e. transactions per second. this case, the attacker can send transactions per second. when you first send the network will have transaction and attacking regular users, only transactions. the blockchain will accept only transactions, will discarded (regular users and attackers will each lose one-third their transactions). but the same time, the average power pow transactions will increased and, therefore, the next block ordinary users will spend more computing time send transaction (i.e. twice long). the same time, the attacker will not able increase the power pow transaction calculation, because initially works the limit (%) capacity. result, the average power the tera smart money seite pow transaction ordinary user will double and the ratio the block between ordinary transactions and the attacker's transactions will already that is, all user transactions will accepted. from these arguments can seen that the smaller the workload the blockchain, the more difficult apply ddos. soon the average load the blockchain exceeds will increase the upper threshold transactions. the moment, each miner's node actually supports transaction processing using only one thread. given that the moment, multi-core processors the norm, will not difficult multiply the transaction processing performance each node. practical aspects specification consensus: pow algorithm: terahash

smart money seite composition processor threads important point the blockchain tera the continuous operation the network. the network formed creating multi-dimensional lattice topology with dynamic structure support. the exchange performed every second. the node must continuously exchange information new blocks with its neighbors (this task will referred transfer). such exchange should performed even the node the blockchain loading mode (i.e. not synchronized). when you start full node, the following processes are created (node): main the main thread the program transfer. writing new blocks the database. loading history when out sync. static-giving static information other nodes (headers, blocks, states) tx-executing transactions (changing the state table). web-data retrieval via http
