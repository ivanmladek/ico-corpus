scalability and interoperability etc. address these challenges, propose palletone, protocol for abstract-level ledger ecosystem. palletone adopts jury consensus mechanism which combines the whole network consensus and part consensus ensure the efficiency and safety cross-chain smart contract execution. besides, contract template and token abstract layer are introduced decrease the difficulty and complexity contract development. palletone makes inter-chain transactions possible decoupling the state contracts from the blockchains. developers can choose the language they are familiar with and the platform they need. palletone interacts with mainstream underlying blockchains and accomplishes interchain interaction. palletone, only need group verifiers execute one contract. this group verifiers called jury, which consists individual verifiers called jurors. similar the protocol that separates the physical layer, data link layer from transport layer and application layer, the palletone fully decouples the dapp, contract status, and underlying blockchain three-tier architecture. palletone contract supports multiple blockchains. through jury consensus and adaptor layer, possible build contract that can interact with different blockchains simultaneously, users can trade tokens from different blockchains one palletone contract invocation make the inter-chain token exchange distributed, atomic, and immutable. the palletone contracts inter-chain token exchange can executed multi-tasking way different groups selected jury, which can effectively reduce the congestion the whole network compared with consensus throughout the whole network. plan use palletone the core technology build the contract executable and execute the contracts, which makes the contract execution more secure and developers can choose the language they are familiar with and the platform they need. token abstract layer and contract template ensure the convenience and security dapp development further. introduction blockchain technology considered the core technology that has the most potential trigger the fifth round disruptive revolution after steam engine, electricity, information and internet technology. although blockchain technology likely subvert many industries the next years, there are still some technical challenges that restrict its large-scale deployment and application. challenges scalability order build distributed trustless network which the tokens (values) flow, the consensus that bitcoin and ethereum adopt reached every node throughout the network guarantee the correctness, that all the nodes execute the same procedure order reach the consensus the state. based this kind consensus entire network, tps(transactions per second)of bitcoin reaches only december crypto kitties severely slowed down the ethereum transactions. these phenomena reveal the problem resorting the consensus the entire network. interoperability blockchains today such bitcoin ethereum are using full nodes brute-forces trust-machines. these full nodes verify transactions their respective chain without knowing anything outside their chains. result, such blockchain becomes silo itself, making the blockchain look more like intranet today. not user friendly the current popular blockchains, there not yet blockchain platform, which can meet different needs developers and users terms ease use, security and high performance. platform lock-in similar the early stage any computing technology, blockchains have critical "platform lock-in"problems. developers have choose which blockchain support and implement platform-specific code, which makes difficult switch application another blockchain later on. developers don't want locked into working with certain underlying blockchain they need free evaluate, use, and switch between options. some applications may even need run multiple platforms order provide the best user experience. the birth palletone considering the challenges above, interchain interaction has become important issue the development blockchain technology. have put forward distributed interchain protocol palletone (protocol for abstract-level ledger ecosystem). introduction palletone palletone propose effective way address these challenges that include scalability, interoperability, lacking the user friendliness well platform lockin. palletone adopts jury consensus, which only need group verifiers execute one contract. this group verifiers called jury, which consists individual verifiers called jurors. palletone decouples smart contracts from the blockchains accomplish interchain interaction. mediator ensures palletone security and the core component palletone. the core technology build the contract executable and execute the contracts. palletone make developers can choose the language they are familiar with and the platform they need. token abstract layer defines the definition set and operation set token, which improves security token definition smart contract. the architecture and components palletone illustrated figure figure palletone architecture sdk palletone provides sdk (software development kit) for each supported programming language. smart contract developers can quickly complete the development cross chain smart contracts based sdk. palletone the core technology build the contract executable and execute the contracts, palletone compile the contracts written several programming languages into bytecode that allows efficient execution multiple platforms,which makes palletone contract not only decoupled from the underlying blockchains, but also decoupled from contract languages and execution platforms. when the smart contract deployed palletone, will run the palletone vm. palletone provides sandbox environment for host safety and eliminates the possibility host network attacks from malicious contracts. token abstract layer the token abstract layer defines the definition set and operation set token which may issued users the platform (although palletone will not responsible for issuing any such tokens), which decreases the difficulty and complexity smart contract development and increases the security such smart contracts, while expanding the range possible digital assets tokens which can devleoped issued users the platform. palletone will initially include the following pass-through abstract models, which, for the avoidance doubt, will not the palletone tokens (ptn) that are the native tokens the palletone platform: full pre-excavation token similar the token issued ethereum erc, users only need specify the total amount, accuracy, token name, and abbreviation the time issuing the token. palletone generates and distributes the token one time. mining token similar bitcoin's economic model, the user does not pre-excavate not full preexcavate the token the issue time, and the token will generate time unit height. fixed deeds token similar the cash, the user can define and other denominations the deeds, and once released, inseparable when the token used. non-homogeneity token the above-mentioned tokens are homogenous, which means that there difference between the token you have and the token have. the real world, there are also large number non-homogenized tokens. for example, after tokenization works art (such paintings and calligraphy), each token represents unique piece art. this non-homogeneous certification was defined ethereum erc. palletone natively supports non-homogeneous token. mediator mediator responsible for the security palletone. the character mediator looks like traditional blockchain, which trustworthy machine. mediator should guarantee make all decisions correctly. mediator uses delegated proof stake(dpos) mechanism reach consensus. prevent mediator from being the bottleneck palletone, most the work only done the jury without invoking mediator. mediator takes the responsibility the safety palletone network. the following what mediator does: maintaining palletone tokens, the native token palletone, which used for transaction fee and maintenance fee. maintaining the deposit jurors. randomly selecting the jurors jury. arbitrating when jurors cannot reach consensus. jury jury the fundamental unit maintain the security and integrity palletone. more specifically, will assigned run contracts and manage multi-signature accounts. achieve secure and decentralized design, jury designed compose many participants, called jurors. every juror pays deposit guarantee the security. jurors use bft (byzantine fault tolerance) algorithm reach consensus. distributed storage distributed storage infrastructure will used store contract id, contract code and selected jurors list involved the execution mediator, well the contracts states during contract execution jury. palletone, use directed acyclic graph (dag) our distributed database. dag has many advantages over traditional chained storage. first all, there concept block dag. all transactions are individually encapsulated single structure called unit, and the connections between the units are established reference. secondly, using dag distributed storage, transactions can written parallel. traditional blockchains, block generated miners, and miners need select transactions the transaction pool based priority and block size, and then transactions are associated the merkle tree. therefore, under the chained storage structure, transactions that are not packaged into the block are all blocked, and transactions packaged into the block are all unconfirmed state before the block broadcasted the entire network. compared with the chain storage structure, dag transactions can written real time parallel the entire ledger, thus ensuring the speed transaction confirmation. thirdly,in the dag, choosing the main chain, each transaction orderly state, which effectively solves the double spend problem. finally, with the traditional chained storage architecture, when the volume transactions continues increase, there will network congestion and long-term transactions that cannot confirmed. but the dag, the more nodes that participate, the greater the volume transactions, and the faster the confirmation the transaction, because the transactions are confirmed the relationships that they refer each other. palletone distributed storage, the specific information that needs stored mainly includes transaction information, contract id, contract bytecode, contract state, list jurors corresponding the contract, and status information processed the jury during execution the contract. adaptor layer palletone provides api and library the adapter layer that not only allows for the interaction with popular underlying blockchains, but also facilitate emerging blockchains interact with palletone. palletone protocol template deployment palletone, all types services are created smart contracts. the creation contracts based contract templates. palletone provides some contract templates for common scenarios for users. users can also create new contract template themselves and deploy palletone. the deployment the contract template needs designated mediator. mediator responsible for checking the syntax, specification, etc. the contract template and only the contract template that meets the requirements can successfully deployed. successful deployment contract template will saved the distributed storage palletone for contract deployment the future. contract deployment palletone, all contract instances are based templates. you cannot find correct contract template that you needed palletone, you need deploy template first. once contract issuer attempts deploy the contract, palletone will below steps: step contract issuer send template hash and contract initial parameters mediator. step mediator will create jury and random select jurors from "juror pool" based contract parameters. step juror list this jury will communicate each other and receive initial parameters from mediator. jury will retrieve template code from distributed storage. step jury will create contract instance based initial parameters and template code, validate and execution. after validation and execution, jury will write the state data, contract and juror list into distributed storage. contract execution has two kinds jury mode bind: lock juror mode and unlock juror mode. user can select different kind jury when create contract template. contract invocation after the contract has been deployed, other participants are able invoke it. step invoke the contract, the contract invoker queries the distributed storage the contract first. then, the storage will return the contract program and the list jurors who are responsible for the execution the contract lock juror mode. unlock juror mode, mediator will select new jury. after gathering necessary data, the contract will packed with parameters into request object and sent jury. step when the jurors receive the request, they execute the contract independently along with the latest contract state and invocation parameters. everything runs expected, the results those jurors will the same, and the contract state will shifted the next one. step interchain transaction triggered, they will sign multi-signature transaction that blockchain well. contract query after the contract deployed, the user can use the query interface the contract query the contract state data. the query the contract will not change the distributed storage, does not need the participation the jury. contract termination after the accomplishment the contract execution the contract meets the terminate conditions, the contract issuer may apply for the contract termination. step the contract issuer send message mediator apply for the contract termination. step lock juror mode, mediator select the associated jurors from distributed storage contract id. unlock juror mode, mediator select new jury. step mediator send terminate message jury. step jury retrieve contract program and state data from distributed storage contract id. step jury check the terminate conditions, matched, execute the terminate function. step jury write the state data terminated contract into distributed storage and send terminated message mediator. step mediator validates the terminated status, and then dissolves the corresponding jury. token economy tokens' use payment deposit ensure the safety palletone system, jurors must pay deposit prevent them from conducting fraud. become juror earn transaction fee, participants need follow this process: first, pay deposit the form the palletone tokens ("ptn") become candidate juror. the juror can earn transaction fee when executing contracts. the deposit can withdrawn when the smart contract ends. the juror can also withdraw its deposit after invoking the mediator select new juror for replacement. the proper amount deposit can evaluated through model that contains different properties, including the value the contract, the size jury, the credibility juror and the design contract. the juror must ensure good host environment and network environment, because poor host environment may cause smart contracts not complete within the specified time and the poor network environment may cause the communication between the jurors the jury timeout even offline. result, smart contracts could not reach consensus among the jurors. after multiple consensus failures, deposit will forfeited and the juror will removed from the list candidate jurors. tokens' use payment transaction fee provide incentive for jury's execution, jurors gain fees from contract participants executing contracts. contract participants need pay some palletone tokens the transaction fees those jurors. the transaction fee would much lower than the transaction fee other blockchains because only the jurors the corresponding jury will run it. the jury will only execute the contract after they verify that the palletone tokens have been successfully transferred. palletone, provide incentive for jury executing contracts, jurors gain fees from contract participants executing contracts. contract participants need pay some palletone tokens the transaction fees those jurors. the transaction fee would much lower than the transaction fee other blockchains because only the jurors the corresponding jury will run it. the jury will only execute the contract after they verify that the palletone tokens have been successfully transferred into mediator. token juror incentive for the efficient operation the palletone whole network and encourage many possible nodes participate the consensus, addition transaction fees, the mediator will use the palletone tokens incentives for the jury's participation consensus based smart contracts. every juror who participates the validation and execution the contract will receive transaction fees and incentives the form palletone tokens remuneration for their services. because the jury was randomly selected, everyone has the opportunity become member the jury and participate the token economy. tokens' use payment contract deposit some contracts (such currency exchange contracts) require both participants pay certain contract deposit the form palletone tokens the contract avoid the occurrence breach contract single party. the contract completed normally, the contract deposit will refunded both sides the contract, and one party breaches the contract, the other party can apply for penalty the defaulting party's contract deposit compensate for loss. recap based the aforementioned palletone architecture, the jury can execute the contracts and interact with the underlying blockchains. jurors jury reach the consensus perform the reliable contract execution. such design makes the execution efficient and scalable, since the consensus generated the jury this individual contract instead all jurors the network. reduce the cost transaction fees and settlement latency, only contract states are stored the underlying blockchains the request contract participants. palletone attributes multi-chain palletone smart contracts support multi-chain. through the jury consensus and adaptation layer, palletone smart contracts can run different blockchains the same time. palletone smart contract can interact with different blockchains the same time, users can trade tokens from different blockchains one palletone contract invocation make the interchain token exchange distributed, atomic, and immutable. the same time, smart contracts (such bitcoin) developed for blockchain can reused other blockchains (such litecoin), significantly reducing the development costs smart contracts. multi-task the verification, execution, etc. the palletone smart contract can done the jury specifically created for it. the jury composed group jurors that randomly selected from the candidate jurors randomly. smart contracts palletone can implemented selecting different juries multi-tasking manner. compared with the whole-network consensus, palletone network congestion will effectively reduced. multi-language dapp developers palletone can develop smart contracts using mainstream development languages (such java, c++, js, etc.) without having learn new contract development language, such solidity for ethereum. the attibute palletone supporting multiple languages will contribute prosperous palletone ecosystem. multi-platform the key tool smart contract compiling and execution, palletone completely decoupled from the underlying operation system, which allow palletone smart contract adapt windows, linux, mac well other types platform. security palletone's security reflected two aspects, one the security development, and the other the security contract execution. development security reflected two aspects: palletone, will provide sorts standard contracts for common specific scenarios. when user develops corresponding scene contract, he/she only needs call standard contract and complete dapp development few steps. this design reduces the difficulty user development while also reducing the risk due incomplete development considerations. palletone provides comprehensive set token definitions and operations, making the user's token release process simple and easy operate. meanwhile, because palletone has comprehensive set license definitions and operations, each license traceable and safe. regarding smart contract execution, palletone provides sandbox environment for host safety and eliminates the possibility host network attacks from malicious contracts, which allows palletone smart contracts execution more secure. palletone advantages high capacity computer architecture, "data algorithm (calculation)"is the program. while specific the blockchain world, data stored blocks, and calculations are performed the mining nodes. the block generation speed and block size determine the processing speed the chain. bitcoin and ethereum's transaction processing using the "serial storage serial computing" mode, bitcoin about tps and ethereum about tps. dag different from the traditional "block chain" structure, changing the serial nature single-chain, through the parallel write solve the data storage bottlenecks. blockchain platform for smart contracts, the serialization computing nodes has become new bottleneck the blockchain. the independent innovation jury consensus mechanism palletone broke the seriality the traditional consensus mechanism. multiple juries conducted consensus calculations multi-task parallel manner, thereby improving computational performance. combining the dag distributed storage with the jury consensus algorithm, both the storage and the computation break through the technical limitations the traditional blockchain, and palletone thus forms high-performance distributed ledger. high universality palletone aims establish "ip protocol" for the blockchain industry, allowing value flow freely between different blockchains. the internet technology, the physical layer may cable optical fiber; the data link layer includes both atm, sdh, and ethernet; but due the existence the protocol, the upper layer internet application can not only ignore the physical layer and data link layer technologies. the evolution physical facilities has changed, and historical accumulation data has been retained, and the existence and development sustainability have been maintained. palletone also plays this role. dapp (decentralized application) can deployed various chains the same time and not limited the underlying chain. palletone provides interfaces and library functions for each chain the adapter layer through abstract digital currency chain (bitcoin example) and smart contract chain (using ethereum example). the smart contract directly addresses the abstract interface without for the specific chain, the smart contract decoupled from the bottom the blockchain; the underlying chain can obtain the same information value other blockchains through palletone's adaptation layer without any requirement, restriction restricted exchange. safe and smart token model palletone has built-in general-purpose pass-through abstraction model for market and economics. users can create their own token simply, safely and quickly based the existing token templates. palletone provides support for the token model the underlying data structure, which isolates the pass-through data from the contract data. palletone uses the utxo model and provides similar payment methods such bitcoin pph, psh, etc., making users experience simple bitcoin the payment experience. palletone token abstract model, integral token methods are provided. therefore, the users not need write any code when issuing token, but only need configure the relevant parameters, thus avoiding the smart contract flaw the issuance the token. healthy ecosystem palletone aims establish complete smart contract ecosystem that allows developers, users, and "miners" each and every one palletone's platforms create healthy ecosystem. for developers, the one hand, support for smart contracts provides support for popular development languages. developers not need learn new contract development language, but only need use their used development language develop smart contracts. reduced the difficulty contract development. the other hand, the contract store provides developers with platform for smart contract sales. similar apple's appstore, developers can freely price smart contracts, and users benefit from using paid contracts further improve developers' enthusiasm and smart contract quality. for end users, user can choose smart contracts that meet their needs through the smart contract store provided palletone. they only need pay developers contract fee realize their own needs, instead development and debugging themselves. addition, palletone will also provide powerful set contract templates for users use for free. for "miners", they can apply for juror, provide good hardware environment for the execution smart contracts, and collect execution fee. due use the dpos consensus and the jury consensus, the "miners" not need use large number mining machines compete for mining, avoiding extreme waste energy and increasing the use hardware. application scenarios palletone promising cross-chain project that will focus achieving interaction between different blockchains. palletone's ultimate vision connect all the blockchains that the originally closed and isolated information, values, and applications can used freely across chains build globally interconnected network with boundaries. for the avoidance doubt, palletone not responsible for the offer the following application scenarios including cross-chain payment, financial instruments, and payment types dapps these may offered developers dapps other participants the platform. because these applications may subject licensing requirements other regulations various jurisdictions, they may not available every jurisdiction. cross-chain payment can imagine the following scenario: users the bitcoin network want enjoy the fun playing crypto kitties ethereum. the most feasible solution convert certain btc eth through complex operations cryptocurrency exchange with high fees. palletone make the payment more convenient, that the user can use palletone pay for the cost directly using btc, thus avoiding complex currency exchange operations. financial instrument mutual funds mutual fund professionally managed investment fund that pools assets from many investors purchase securities. palletone the best platform share their investment strategies. other words, they can create their mutual funds, and define the reward contracts. everyone will have the right use the palletone they wish, everyone has the opportunity create their own mutual fund. they can distribute the funds into different cryptocurrencies they want. with palletone, human creation has boundaries. exchange trade fund financial instruments are monetary contracts between parties. they can created, traded, modified and settled. present, there are very few cryptocurrency etf over the world, and they are all controlled large financial institutions. users can use palletone create their own etfs and hold assets such cryptocurrencies, commodities, bonds. create more opportunities for investors all over the world. financial derivatives instrument for financial applications, palletone also provides convenient services. the token palletone highly flexible. any user can use the forensic tool design bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin even stocks and bonds. the case combination various assets, the value this certificate will determined the real-time market for all the assets that make the permit, avoid the risk large increase decrease individual currencies securities. addition, based the token abstraction layer, the user can also issue different functions for the assets holds. for example, house can issue the ownership token and the use right pass, and the user who purchased the ownership pass will have this. home, and the user who purchased the pass will able use the house during the life cycle the permit. palletone provides comprehensive set at-risk definitions and warrants that can accomplish this and ensure security. support for multiple payment types dapps based palletone, developers can deploy various types dapps, unlike the case where dapp ethereum only supports eth payments. when users use dapps built palletone, the payment method more flexible and free: both through palletone token and you can choose btc, eth, even random combination several ways. the flexibility payment methods will stimulate the diversity users certain extent, which will further promote the development the palletone ecosystem. core team peijiang zhu palletone global community leading official secretary general z-park blockchain

group entities could materially and adversely affected. person owes you any returns respect the ptn can guarantee that the platform, any ptn and any and all the activities and businesses contemplated and discussed this white paper will definitely established, materialise and carried out, result any returns now the future. such cases, you may lose all part the value the ptn which you and you alone will have solely bear. for the avoidance doubt, the risks involved with purchasing ptn include (but are not limited to) the following: risk uninsured losses unlike bank accounts accounts some other financial institutions, ptn uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance insure them. thus, the event loss loss utility value, there public insurer private insurance arranged any person provide recourse (and any event, person obliged compensate insure you for any event loss loss utility value). risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions the regulatory status ptn and distributed ledger technology unclear unsettled many jurisdictions, but numerous regulatory authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering the implementation regulatory regimes which govern cryptocurrency cryptocurrency markets. difficult predict how whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect such technology and its applications, including the platform and ptn. likewise difficult predict how whether legislatures regulatory agencies may implement changes law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the platform and ptn. regulatory actions could negatively impact the platform and ptn various ways, including, for purposes illustration only, through determination that ptn regulated financial instrument that require registration licensing, which may force the platform made unavailable certain areas. any group entity may cease operations jurisdiction the event that regulatory actions, changes law regulation, make illegal difficult operate such jurisdiction, commercially undesirable obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) operate such jurisdiction. risks arising from taxation the tax characterisation ptn uncertain. you must seek your own tax advice connection with purchasing, holding and utilising ptn, which may result adverse tax consequences you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties other charges and tax reporting requirements. risk alternative competing platforms possible that alternative platforms could established attempt facilitate services similar those provided the platform. the platform may compete with these alternative platforms, which could negatively impact the platform and ptn. risk insufficient interest the platform distributed applications possible that the platform will not used large number individuals, companies and other entities that there will limited public interest the creation and development distributed platforms (such the platform) more generally. such lack use interest could negatively impact the development the platform and therefore the potential utility ptn. risks associated with the development and maintenance the platform the platform still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. although intended for ptn and the platform have the features described this white paper, and the relevant group entity will endeavour work towards those ends (subject internal business considerations), changes may required made the specifications ptn the platform for any number reasons. this could create the risk that ptn the platform, further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations requirements the time purchase. furthermore, despite the relevant group entity's good faith efforts develop and maintain the platform, still possible that the platform will experience malfunctions otherwise fail adequately developed maintained, which may negatively impact the platform and ptn. inadequate disclosure information. the date hereof, the platform still under development and its design concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and parameters may constantly and frequently updated and changed. any statement the white paper subject change and may adjusted and updated from time time. risk unfavourable fluctuation currency value the proceeds from selling ptn are intended fund the development and maintenance the platform. the value digital assets which the ptn sale proceeds are denominated fluctuates unfavourably during after the sale ptn, the relevant group entity which will undertake development the platform may not able fund development, may not able develop and/or maintain the platform the manner that intended. risk dissolution any group entity platform start-up companies such any the group entities involve high degree risk. financial and operating risks confronting start-up companies are significant, and the group entities are not immune these. start-up companies often experience unexpected problems the areas product development, marketing, financing, and general management, among others, which frequently cannot solved. possible that, due any number reasons, including, but not limited to, unfavourable fluctuation the value cryptographic and fiat currencies, decrease the utility ptn due negative adoption the platform, the failure commercial relationships, intellectual property ownership challenges, the platform may longer viable developed even developed, maintained and operated, and the group entities may dissolved. risks arising from lack governance rights because ptn confers governance rights any kind with respect the platform any group entity, all decisions involving the platform any group entity will made the relevant group entity its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions discontinue the platform, sell liquidate any group entity. these decisions could adversely affect the platform and ptn you hold. risks associated with markets for ptn there prior market for ptn and the ptn token sale may not result active liquid market for ptn. ptn designed used solely within the platform, hence there may illiquidity risk with respect the ptn you hold. ptn not currency issued any central bank national, supra-national quasi-national organisation, nor backed any hard assets other credit nor "commodity" the usual and traditional sense that word. group entity responsible for, obliged pursue, the circulation and trading ptn any market. trading ptn will merely depend the consensus its value between the relevant market participants. one obliged purchase any ptn from any holder ptn, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity market price ptn any extent any time. furthermore, ptn may not resold purchaser who faces restrictions the purchase cryptographic tokens with respect whom the purchase ptn may violation applicable laws. accordingly, group entity any person makes any representation, warranty guarantee that there will any demand market for ptn, that the price you pay for ptn indicative any market valuation market price for ptn. even secondary trading ptn facilitated third party exchanges, such exchanges may relatively new and subject little regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible fraud manipulation. furthermore, the extent that third parties ascribe external exchange value ptn (e.g., denominated digital fiat currency), such value may extremely volatile, decline below the price which you have paid for ptn, and/or diminish zero. loss talent the development the platform depends the continued co-operation the existing technical and commercial team and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced their respective sectors. the loss any member may adversely affect the platform its future development. further, stability and cohesion within the team critical the overall development the platform. there the possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure core personnel may occur, resulting negative influence the project the future. failure develop the platform still the developmental stage, hence there may large changes the final design before the official version released. there the risk that the development the platform will not executed implemented planned, may not meet any expectation purchasers ptn, for variety reasons, including without limitation the event decline the prices any digital asset, virtual currency ptn, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage development funds for activities. risks associated with the related blockchain because ptn and the platform are based blockchain technology, any malfunction, breakdown abandonment the relevant blockchain may have material adverse effect the platform ptn. moreover, advances cryptography, technical advances such the development quantum computing, could present risks ptn and the platform rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the relevant blockchain. the future cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable. risk losing access ptn due loss private key(s) private key, combination private keys, necessary control and dispose ptn stored your digital wallet, vault other storage mechanism. accordingly, loss requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet, vault other storage mechanism storing ptn may result loss such ptn. moreover, any third party that gains access such private key(s), including gaining access login credentials hosted wallet service you use, may able misappropriate your ptn. group entity can will responsible for any such losses. risk mining attacks with other decentralised cryptographic tokens based blockchain technology, ptn susceptible attacks miners the course validating ptn transactions the relevant blockchain, including, but not limited, double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. any successful attacks present risk the platform and ptn, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording transactions involving ptn. risk hacking and security weaknesses hackers other malicious groups organisations may attempt interfere with the platform ptn variety ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial service attacks, consensus-based attacks, sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. furthermore, because the platform based open-source software, there risk that third party member any group entity may intentionally unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure the platform, which could negatively affect the platform and ptn. forking the platform community project and certain elements are open-sourced. the group entities not and cannot monopolise the development, marketing, operation otherwise the platform's blockchain. any entity may independently develop patch upgrade the source code the platform's blockchain without prior authorisation any other party. the acceptance these patches upgrades sufficient (not necessarily overwhelming) percentage ptn holders could result "fork" the blockchain, and consequently two diverging networks may emerge and remain. each branch the blockchain arising from the fork will have its own native cryptographic tokens accordingly there will two different versions ptn respectively residing the two divergent branches with almost identical technical features and functions. the community the platform may split into two groups support the two branches respectively. further, theoretically possible for each branch the forked blockchain further forked unlimited number times. the temporary permanent existence forked blockchains could adversely affect the operation blockchain and the ptn which you hold, and may ruin the sustainability the platform. unanticipated risks the ptn, being cryptographic tokens, are new and untested technology. addition the aforementioned risks, there may other risks associated with your purchase, holding and use ptn, including those may not anticipated the group entities. such risks may further materialise unanticipated variations combinations the risks discussed above otherwise howsoever arise. cautionary note forward-looking statements all statements contained this white paper, statements made press releases any place accessible the public
