revolutionary new digital currency. but was based its predecessor hashcash and the proof-of-work concept was originally proposed dwork and naor means combatting junk email. the success bitcoin why did bitcoin achieve such explosive economic value while its predecessors were mostly academic interest only? real implementation more than just white paper, "satoshi" released the open source reference implementation because bitcoin itself was more than just white paper, but actual working system, was able capture the imagination developers and leverage the paradigm open source software development quickly iterate and improve into global-class financial infrastructure. open governance more importantly, bitcoin open system that allows for evolution through forking and such provides assurance its long term trustworthiness. stakeholders ever get upset with the direction bitcoin, they can and already have produced forks that users and miners can migrate they see fit. the problems bitcoin the biggest problem with bitcoin the moment that has not broken out into mainstream adoption. one study pegs the number active cryptocurrency users between and million. this paper proposes solution for adding billion users the cryptocurrency movement adding two key elements missing order provide significant adoption mainstream users. the next billion users have not yet entered cryptocurrency for two main reasons: too complicated cryptocurrency suffers from complexity for the average user. managing private keys, public keys, blockchain concepts--it's all vastly out the reach the http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/papers/pvp_abs.html https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/globalcryptocurrency/#.wezkkrnszbi pundi ico average user. some cases the next billion users may even barely able operate smartphone. not relevant today, the only thing you can buy with cryptocurrency are other cryptocurrencies. the vast majority people have involvement with this process and interest. until the average user can use cryptocurrency buy bag rice loaf bread, the relevancy cryptocurrency will restricted small audience. the solution this paper presents pundi platform for consumerizing cryptocurrencies enabling their use retail point sale (pos) through mobile app and contactless payment card. following the footsteps bitcoin, pundi has the same properties real implementation, open governance and incentivization that allows for the rapid global expansion the solution. real implementation pundi complete end-to-end solution for contactless and mobile retail point-ofsale (pos) including full-stack reference implementation all the components. includes mobile application, contactless smart card and point-of-sale (pos) terminals that are already deployment. all these components will made widely available through open source and open specifications. open governance releasing the full-stack reference implementations open source and open specifications, can enable ubiquitous distribution worldwide the pundi protocols and ensure the rapid expansion the value the pundi network. incentivization the pundi network incentivizes participation through providing free hardware retail stores the initial target geography indonesia. users are incentivized participate the pundi network through accessibility and ease use and the convenience mobile payment. with solution that decreases complexity and adds relevance cryptocurrencies end users, will see rapid mainstream adoption cryptocurrencies and the merging the crypto-economy (current estimated value october with the much larger mainstream economy (estimated value t). note: please refer english whitepaper the main source pundi ico vision the next billion crypto users pundi will help generate demand for new and old, well big and small cryptocurrencies. other online cryptocurrency exchange can bring new cryptocurrency users from this segment and the same number, thanks our powerful focus attracting the consumer market. from million million with future growth mind, let's look some relevant statistics october bitcoin price approximately usd bitcoin market capitalization approximately usd billion trading frequency times trade volume usd million. with trading volume accounting for total volume, the reason bitcoin had such respectable numbers because there may many and million average million active wallets. however, the global bitcoin wallet ownership numbers not even reach the population south east asia. source:bitcoin.com blockchain.info just take few seconds absorb this information ... what could introduce another million, even million users ... what kind impact would this have the cryptocurrency landscape? pundi ico million users years pundi concentrating initial traction efforts south east asia. half all south east asians live indonesia. have local team with deep understanding the indonesian market plus have track record, connections and products match the local market's needs. will spend the next two years building extensive coverage convenience stores, shopping malls, retail shops, chain outlets, cafe, restaurants and other outlets. will use pundi apps coverage even greater number smaller sellers. our goal for users able buy and spend cryptocurrency within five minutes walk any location jakarta. with our initial outreach indonesia, intend expand into thailand, malaysia, singapore, japan and other regional markets simultaneously. our plan cover south east asia within three years. the same time will explore other parts asia, the americas and europe using our open source and open specification for adoption our protocol. this way can achieve our objectives sales cryptocurrency; usage cryptocurrency; and growth cryptocurrency. million billion years pundi platform will provided open source and the hardware reference implementation specifications will provided under creative commons. the pundi solution will therefore readily deployable across the world regions outside indonesia. with these international deployments, pundi will able reach the billion user mark. pundi ico mission the next billion cryptocurrencies, while capturing the imagination million people has almost meaning value most the world. pundi seeks bring cryptocurrency the next billion users. benefits achieving this goal, pundi will help increase the value cryptocurrency for all users. problem complexity one the hardest problems crypto how radically reduce the complexity handling cryptocurrency. pundi solves this problem through several end users layers including mobile wallet and contactless smart card. ...the mobile wallet the mobile wallet helpful component because solves the handling private and public keys. instead managing long and complicated blockchain public key, may preferable for end users simply maintain password-based system that much more familiar. increasingly mobile devices can secured fingerprint face recognition, even the password may become too complex for many users and fact point where the complexity can help create security risk. ...the smart card the second layer that reduces even more complexity the use smart card. the card can used with without the mobile app, and one member the family could use the mobile app charge multiple cards that can used other members the family. empowering users with contactless smart card, this enables users avoid even the complexity navigating smartphone app. pundi ico ...the pundi platform the pundi platform the final round-up solving the complexity issue. both software and hardware, the full stack implementation allows the merchants integrate their existing pos device connecting with the pundi platform and accept payment lieu purchase/sale cryptocurrencies and sale daily goods services. the hardware allows the use the smart card and any mobile wallet, whereby addressing the inter-operability complexity. relevance mentioned before, the fact that most cryptocurrencies can only used buy other cryptocurrencies reduces the relevance them almost zero for most people. thus the problem can reduced this: how can cryptocurrency converted fiat currencies for use "normal" everyday retail store buy just about everything? and how can fiat currencies used buy cryptos just about anywhere? ...crypto fiat the standard way crypto banking solve the problem crypto fiat for consumers the "bitcoin debit card". this leverages the visa and mastercard networks and enables users access many million point sale (pos) terminals around the world. one the problems that has cropped this space recently that visa and mastercard have both blocked the access their networks for crypto debit cards. for many geographies, another solution will needed. ...crypto crypto fiat pundi offers support point-of-sale devices through full stack reference implementation contactless nfc mechanism that transacts directly with the cryptocurrency blockchain. the point sale (pos) devices can become active the pundi network through multiple means including: the full pundi reference implementation stack. pundi giving the full hardware reference implementation retail environments their primary pos device indonesia. sdk -another easier approach for existing pos device manufacturers use the open source pundix library support crypto crypto fiat transfers. mobile app--one the easiest ways for point sale include this payment protocol simply download the mobile app onto compatible pundi ico device, some retail environments may even choose use android phone iphone (like the apple store) for customer checkout. another approach would use android ios tablet device with the software. the existence any these solutions allows the point sale sell anything for cryptocurrency without the use the visa mastercard service going directly the cryptocurrency blockchain record transactions. after these transactions are recorded, the pundi device api reports back pundi ensure that the merchants and retailers are paid back fiat. ...fiat crypto how pundi users buy cryptocurrencies? three primary ways: the mobile wallet can allow users directly purchase cryptocurrencies mobile card--users can transfer cryptocurrency from the mobile app cards. example where this might useful member the household has minor technical skills, they can set crypto backed debit cards for the rest the family and they don't even need worry about working phone app. pos card: for the simplest use case and for users who don't even have smartphones, the pundi system enables the pos, whether the full hardware reference implementation, the mobile app tablet powered the mobile app directly charged cryptocurrency. pundi ico solution pundi aims bring the next billion crypto users allows users buy cryptocurrency anywhere and anytime. this will make pundix the world's largest decentralized, offline cryptocurrency sales network. 'decentralized' because the ecosystem and transaction records live the blockchain. 'offline' because our entry point via point-of-sale (pos) devices installed physical outlets. pundi allows for three customer use cases. enables users to: buy sell cryptocurrencies through point-of-sale (pos) device buy anything using cryptocurrency through the pundi pos device (retail point-of-sale) pay peer-to-peer using mobile (like paypal) pundi consists of: pundi mobile app smartphone app used the following things: buy btc, eth, ltc, xem, pxs and cryptocurrency using cash card sell btc, eth, ltc, xem, pxs and cryptocurrency for cash top fiat money digital wallet buy utilities and services, e.g. electricity using cryptocurrency pundix card will the physical multi-currency wallet for fiat and cryptocurrencies available for purchase and sale via the pundix platform. the pundix card also facilitates payments via cryptocurrencies held the card through nfc and contactless technology. pundi platform reference implementation stack including software and hardware that performs the full point sale (pos) device function. our reference implementation hardware already deployment convenience stores and retailers, and will further distribute the platform through open source licensing and distribution the sdks and open apis. effectively, pundix will become: world's largest offline cryptocurrency sales network connecting existing pos devices and pundix devices the pundix platform .your very own crypto debit card pundi card .an offline crypto exchange allowing for more liquidity cryptocurrencies *the pundi business scope outlined above may modified according local laws and regulations, the sole discretion the management team. pundi ico pundi mobile app existing pundi-pundi apps are expected promote the rapid growth pundi since february pundi-pundi has over downloads, achieving monthly active users (maus). today, over retail outlets, restaurants and cafes accept our pay-by-qr apps. users are concentrated indonesia's capital city jakarta with eventual roll out planned across the whole south east asia. pundi-pundi available the ios appstore and google play. have also rolled out the scanbersama, pundi booster and pundi toko, apps. scbersama indonesia's universal payment sdk (software developer kit) which enables any app integrate with scanbersama solutions using single line code. after integration these apps can used make payments participating merchants. scanbersama available sdk for our clients for integration app owners. pundi booster app selling virtual goods services. merchants that have pundi booster can sell mobile talk time and enable utility bill payment via the app. pundi booster available google play. pundi ico pundi toko the merchant management app for pundi-pundi and available for download google play. more information available www.pundi-pundi.com and www.scanbersama.com. you can download our apps google play and ios app store. pundi card the pundi card the physical multi-currency (fiat and cryptocurrencies) wallet crypto debit card which can loaded with cryptocurrencies via the pos devices which are connected the pundix platform. the pundix card also facilitates payments via cryptocurrencies held the card through nfc and contactless technology. with the future being crypto, this physical debit card/wallet has key use case the event theft the mobile phone loss battery service coverage. the pundix card will allow the easy onboarding the next billion crypto users, who can get accustomed using cryptocurrencies. also envisage several channels (crypto banks, crypto exchanges, pos device manufacturers, etc.) through which the pundix card can potentially become regular feature. pundi platform starting with indonesia, the largest country south east asia, our team aims provide retail outlets, restaurants and convenience stores with pundi point-of-sales pundi ico (pos) devices that customers can use the cryptocurrency held their accounts make daily purchases such sugar and rice.* this way, pundi pos devices become the latest participants the global blockchain and consumers benefit because they can use cash, credit card digital wallet buy anything. these purchases using pundi are carried out first selling fraction unit cryptocurrency and buying the local fiat currency (dollar, rupiah etc.) and then local currency used buy products services. for example, pack sugar costs dollar, users will sell approximately btcs (bitcoins) for dollar and then use fiat currency buy the pack sugar. (rates are calculated real time; the fiat currency selected the local currency.) what pundi platform? the pundi pos smart device that built distribute cryptocurrency and connected the blockchain, that each transaction recorded. consumers use pundi pos buy physical goods using cryptocurrency software-only pundi pos designed run android and ios tablets and special purpose version the consumer mobile wallet app. since each pundi pos device connected the web, software and feature updates can performed remotely. for example, update may introduce new blockchain features; schedule the sale new erc tokens; arrange for new cryptocurrency issued through ico. pundi ico these purchases using pundi are carried out first selling fraction unit cryptocurrency and buying the local fiat currency first before using local fiat currency purchase items. targeted growth: devices years the upcoming ico reaches tokens, our target for installed base pundi pos devices over years. since these devices constitute big part our cost, the amount raised during the ico will determine device roll out numbers. for example, double the amount raised, our network will reach pundi pos devices three years, and forth. for more detailed explanation please check chapter our plan address the global market implementing agent-partnership model for markets where cannot roll out our device immediately. although our focus remains roll out our full stack hardware solution, our aim upgrading the current infrastructure (existing pos devices) globally will allow grow faster. looking beyond south east asia, will forming these agent-partnership models with the goal introducing pundi pos devices many other parts the world within the next twelve months. pundi ico pundi ico pundi blockchain every pundi pos device connected the ethereum and nem blockchain via xplugins. result, each physical outlet part the ethereum and nem blockchain and developers from all over the world can connect with the pundi network devices and physical outlets. pundi management platform the pundi platform visual management system consisting pundi pos devices and other existing pos devices. every common man can login the pundi platform buy sell cryptocurrencies using the pundix card and the pundipundi wallet app. all transactions that are executed the pundix devices are recorded the blockchain for easy access and tracking. connecting stores with pundi the target for pundi enable every pos device retail store part the blockchain ecosystem. with the pundi platform, now have cost-effective approach achieving this goal. each device connected the blockchain using pundix platform api xplugins via two layers: the communication layer and the pundi ico blockchain layer. the communication layer delivers 'buy' request and uses the blockchain layer make record the sale. this information then stored permanently the blockchain. result, pos manufacturers all over the world can now collaborate with pundi selling cryptocurrency stores everywhere allow developers well cryptocurrency traders and holders sell their cryptocurrency via our sales network. major cryptocurrency and erc tokens can accepted and sold pundi pos and developers can use xplugins connect digital wallets, creating smart contract requests that can supported pundi devices. the system automatically generates smart contract the ethereum blockchain after receiving orders from xplugins. making payments using digital wallet all erc tokens can used make payments pundi pos device locations. developers can use digital wallets connect the

their preferred cryptocurrency various exchanges, and the market will help determine which platform offers the best combination price and service. pundi ico pundi token (pxs) pxs the token used for pundi token purchaser, crypto traders, crypto developers and trading platform. they can also use pxs "gas" fuel transactions the pundi ecosystem. for example, people who want use the pundi sales network will have buy pxs. the pundi ecosystem grows, will the demand for pxs and the earliest token purchaser will stand benefit most. supporting digital wallets pundi the pundi-pundi digital wallet app supports the pundi wallet api; hence all pundi features will carried across the pundi-pundi app. for example, using the pundi platform you can also buy pundi-pundi. the future the pundi wallet api will connected wide range digital wallet apps. many our business partners' digital wallet apps are the process integrating the apis. all these digital wallet apps will enjoy the benefit access the broad pundi ecosystem, including the ability buy cryptocurrency directly within the app. pundi ico progress date pundi has been launched the pundi team which has already developed highly successful digital wallet apps for south east asian markets that have grown rapidly become some indonesia's largest pay-by-qr applications (think alipay). pundi aiming become cryptocurrency's largest offline sales network (think walmart -eleven) providing the first comprehensive online-to-offline cryptocurrency sales solution that includes: decentralized sales network multi-currency (fiat and crypto) wallet decentralized trading platform decentralized ico platform pundi-pundi already one indonesia's largest payment application (think alipay). pundi ico roadmap pundi platform are currently identifying several channel partners promote the pundi platform and pundix card. this instance, have identified the following verticals: existing pos device manufacturers both hardware and tablet based (ex. verifone, mswipe, kounta, inhouse, etc.) pos software developers crypto exchanges (ex. kraken, bitrex, etc.) crypto cards (ex. tenx) crypto banks pundi banking approximately the population south east asia does not have bank account. addition, tracking user credit ratings presents major challenge without workable credit rating system and bank loan approval presents many difficulties. consequently, pundi will collaborate with local financial institutions create effective credit rating system addressing the biggest challenges privacy and decentralized control using blockchain technologies. ...challenges storing credit data privacy always concern when comes storing data the blockchain. also, the cost and performance storage are both important considerations: all the credit rating data generated users was stored the ethereum blockchain today, the system might not able handle all the necessary data processing. ...pundi solution solve this challenge, pundi has api suite that connects the ethereum blockchain and stores user data the blockchain the form hash calculation. the aim store all data indefinitely including utility bills history. our approach store the hash results the ethereum blockchain instead all the credit data. the hash data can then retrieved and validated order check the full set data stored outside the blockchain. accessing the open database and calculating the results into hash, pundi partners can match their results with the hash that stored the ethereum blockchain: both results match then identity and data-integrity validated. pundi ico avoiding storing all data the ethereum blockchain, have developed cost-effective method that also effectively addresses privacy issues. today, user data stored the ethereum blockchain, only hashes. financial institutions can now retrieve credit rating data effectively and perform further calculations their own servers, while avoiding impinging client privacy. ...pundi advantages due its successful growth, pundi has wealth transactions and other data that mapped wallet blockchain address, while pundi-pundi has great deal user data such names, occupation and credit card information. together, pundi and pundi-pundi hold huge data pool from which anonymized information can extracted responsibly order create huge value. this something that other startups companies are not position achieve. pundi ico ...the workflow pundi pundi ico token release this ico, pundi will issuing erc compliant tokens with the ticker "pxs". pxs -year release program accept ethereum (eth) during the ico
