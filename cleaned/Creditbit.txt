creditbit white paper credit ii. roadmap version (first release, pre-migration) release date: cc-by licence creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org short document summary creditbit relatively young cryptocurrency, developed independent bitcoin-like blockchain december despite sharing most its properties with bitcoin, creditbit offered solutions for faster transactions and hybrid proof work/proof stake consensus mechanism. order develop this currency and build whole monetary ecosystem, currency will ported (migrated) advanced ethereum blockchain. ethereum was chosen because currently the most advanced decentralized blockchain system out there. offers fast transaction confirmations and its own programming language named solidity, which used for writing smart contracts. essentially possible write any custom logic form smart contracts upon ethereum and that what needed cover the credit decentralized solution. the migration starts the march and will open new possibilities like implementing smart contracts, dao, enable innovative currency issuance and distribution mechanisms etc. current owners creditbits will able exchange their current crbit coins for crb tokens through migration website. currency ecosystem around new creditbit have several appealing features: proof trust, locking mechanism that prerequisite for token issuance and voting process, creditgame and creditbond two main distribution mechanisms, creditdao will used community consensus platform, enabling voting for proposals and elections leveraged rights titles trust levels, creditidentity will enable voluntary identification addresses owners, creditbay decentralized commodity market. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org how got here... evolution electronic money started long before anonymous researcher and coauthors issued their paper "bitcoin: peer-to-peer electronic cash system" under joint pseudonym satoshi nakamoto. this paper was breakthrough evolution digital crypto currencies and laid foundation for digital assets and transactions. later on, the first digital cryptocurrency was launched january named bitcoin. although this digital asset carries intrinsic value and not issued controlled any centralized organization bank, enables users use tool for exchanging value conventional basis. after initial hypes and disappointments with uncontrolled value volatility the exchange markets, bitcoin managed consolidate primacy the first cryptocurrency with market capitalization nearly billion dollars. soon several other cryptocurrencies emerged, mimicking and fine-tuning some the bitcoins blockchain attributes and concepts. although some improvement was made, all those new digital assets (altcoins) suffered from same limitations the blockchain. while limitations like block size and speed transactions were broadly discussed, argued and modified, there are also other, more fundamental limitations this state transition system blockchain. most evident lack turing completeness, tell simply: blockchain cannot carry "for" loops any kind programming code. lack state, value blindness and blockchain blindness also disable implementation advanced and complex smart contracts. .., creditbit dev team released first development roadmap, introducing new altcoin bitcoin family coin named creditbit (abbreviation: crbit). most important advantages creditbit network were speed transactions and hybrid consensus mechanism, switching from initial proof work (pow) proof stake (pos) after some months operating. creditbit became popular for its proof stake, promised interests annually for staking. this rather new approach rewards owners coins for confirming the transactions, while their confirmations are proportionate the balance coins they keep their wallet. development team managed deliver wallet, blockchain explorer (creditsight), official mining pool and some neat ios paying apps (creditpay) till .., enabling the creditbit community store coins, explore and create transactions practical way. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org crbit and network have attributes: name coin: crbit family: bitcoin genesis block date: total coin: million coin cap. hashing algorithm: consensus mechanism: pow, then pos block time (target): minute faster than bitcoin network) diff. retarget blocks coin reward halving every block, the end pow after block halvings stake interest: minimum stake age, hours, one year max age credit credit also named "credit", the name the second major creditbit development roadmap and also parent project new creditbit development team. main goal this project develop and maintain crypto currency ecosystem, based token, that built top ethereum blockchain. the project started january th, with introducing new dev team. project based open-source and continuous development principles. consists several subsidiary projects, ex. creditmc, creditgame etc. while this project covers more technical side development, decentralized autonomous organization (dao) will responsible for developing community, social, marketing and decision-making processes. first stage the project will concluded with migration another platform: crbit, bitcoin-class coin will replaced with ethereum based token with new abbreviation crb. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org dictionary term explanation description crb abbreviation for new creditbit token ethereum network. crbit abbreviation for current creditbit bitcoin-family crypto currency coin credit the second development roadmap, parent development project. creditbay distributed application that forms decentralised commodity market. creditbit has several meanings: open source project and community name name bitcoin family coin name new ethereum-based erc compliant token creditbond concept locking tokens their owner get bond yields vote. creditdao decentralized autonomous organization within creditbit ecosystem. creditgame fun and innovative distribution newly issued tokens. creditidentity contracts that enable users link their address and public identity. creditmc migration contract from old creditbit network ethereum token migration process exchanging old creditbit coins for new ethereumbased tokens. proof trust locking mechanism, prerequisite for participating creditdao and creditbond creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org migration reasons for the migration main reason for migration need replace bitcoin-family blockchain for sophisticated ethereum blockchain that enables several features like smart contracts, dao, innovative distribution systems, contracts etc. for extensive reading about ethereum and its blockchain recommend reading ethereum whitepaper. smart contracts are pieces code that can stored blockchain, making possible store whole contracts and agreements form programmable code. smart contracts (sc) can store values, conditions, complex logic even distribution system. each equipped with rules, enabling one several addresses trigger functions processes like transactions, voting, deploying other scs self destructing. creating erc compliant token, based the ethereum blockchain also eliminates the need for creating and maintaining independent network, thus the development team can concentrate developing new apps. each interaction with smart contract costs its initiator small amount ethereum (gas), even make simplest actions like transactions voting. while small fees were also present bitcoin-family networks, they become necessity ethereum network and are proportional complexity interaction with sc. more computationally heavy interactions cost more ethereum gas. creditbit token features creditbit erc compliant token with lot attracting features added top it. fully compliant erc implementation, which means that integration will simple and will work outside the box for all community driven services that are standard compliant (block explorer, web wallets, mobile wallets...) migration strategy will prepared will able plan the future version without having deal with standard headaches migrating user balances. the creation new creditbit token will developed accompanying contract that will allow set the cap issued coins with vote and community consent creditdao. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org mechanism migration migration actually process exchange replacement. common, but not obligatory, that exchange rate decide for that rate, for each coin (crbit), that its owner deposit and lock the migration website, new token(s) will issued(crb) and made available coin depositor. first step preparation migration creating new ethereum token, which established with smart contract, named creditbit. there also second contract called creditmc that will issue store the initial votes and the amount crbs that users will get. migration executed several rounds, amount minted tokens are proportional the number crbits, that will deposited migration accounts. migration will executed through website. each owner crbit will able register one several migration accounts that act intermediary. after user creates new ethereum address account offline and provide website, will generate migration account. all crbits, that will deposited this migration account till the date each migration round, will permanently locked and proportional number new ethereum creditbit tokens will minted central migration account and transferred ethereum account, that the user provided. non-migrated coins all coins, that will not deposited one the migration accounts till the end migration will given creditdao for development and promotional purposes, then the crbit network will put halt. after that date, one will able restore account balance make any kind transaction the crbit legacy network. migration rounds timetable date operation migration website fully operational creditmc deploy start migration end migration end legacy crbit network operating period full report migration process creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org development timeline development divided into two separate development tiers one exclusively responsible for developing smart contracts and second providing supportive systems, infrastructural projects, communication channels, marketing and developing community. first tier full responsibility core development team, while second tier will managed from creditdao(community), while different tasks/projects can entrusted core development team, but not necessity. smart contract tier: march creditbit main smart contract, introducing erc compliant ethereum token and several other features the end april, release creditgame smart contract start june, release creditdao smart contract tba: creditidentity and creditbay supporting tier: march release the new redesigned website, enabling the migration march whitepaper release (this document) march start migration the credit platform parallel with release creditbit token the middle may release the first dapp tba custom block explorer tba mobile wallets creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org development teams core development team (dev team) group developers, designers and persons, working closely together credit projects. team having regular meetings and post announcements about development and strategic topics. members are not disclosed public protect their privacy. new development team started this project first days original development team that started creditbit and made fantastic journey from implementing some innovative consensus mechanisms altering blockchain configurations (block time). this occasion, our development team would like express our gratitude toward their efforts and achievements. development support team (dev spt team) group individuals that offered their voluntary help dev team the fields developing, design, promo material creating and others. after establishing, the creditbit dao will reward these individuals (in crbs) after successful delivery. not our intent fully compensate the costs their work, but show some gratitude. plan put these independent tasks our website, where members dev spt team will able stand for each task. member dev team will moderate this process with accepting developers with best solution proposals. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org token features proof trust for each owner tokens participate distribution process, must candidate with act trust community. locking certain amount tokens will enable him participate different modes distribution. with holding long position tokens (locking), you are not able create transaction with these tokens, although they still belong your public address. already mentioned creditgame project, that will distribute certain amount coins each time period among winners. each game will allocated with fixed amount tokens distribute certain time frame. owners tokens can participate these games after locking certain amount tokens. depending their game score, game can unlock their tokens and award them with new coins keep their tokens locked for variable time period. while this our favourite distribution mechanism, might develop others, based proof trust concept. two modes tokens each wallet (more precisely: each public address) will have two balances. both balances belong only this public address. first balance representing transferable tokens, similar like other currencies. second balance representing "locked" tokens, that are not transferable. balance the sum several batches tokens, each locked for different period time. after the expiry locking period, each batch previously locked tokens moved first, transferable balance. "lock" the batch tokens item itself. can created only trustworthy entities, that practice represent distribution mechanisms creditbit dao organization and with prior consent tokens owner. and when owner tokens voluntary enters distribution voting mechanism with predefined batch tokens, lock them for predefined period time. other words: owner tokens wants new tokens wants vote, he/she has lock certain amount his tokens and thus show his trust the community. locked tokens are not lost, only their transferability restricted for certain time period. trust with locking several good currencies with brilliant ideas were destroyed due market manipulations. our community tends support responsible behaviour, based creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org mutual trust. long position tokens bares some level risk. with locking your tokens for months even for week you show your respect and trust into the community. bounties for developers and promoters will payed out locked tokens. locking period will prevent instant dump the market, helping currency reach stability and proper value. would like spread risk/trust among all participants our community. same principle will effect for voting creditbit dao. order participate dao voting, owners will have lock certain amount tokens. votes will pounded with the amount locked tokens, therefore linearly dependent the trust. transferable lock owner will have ability transfer right unlock (ownership "lock") certain amount locked tokens other entity. lock itself thus transferable entity, but the transfer does not affect the current ownership transferability locked tokens. this only means, that after the expiry the locking period, entity, that became new owner lock, will have the right unlock and transfer this tokens simultaneously address choice. degree trust degree trust the ratio between sum all locking tokens periods and all existing tokens. more locked tokens for longer periods, higher degree trust. constant least slowly changing degree desirable state, that tend achieve. dot sum(nli*lti) dot ... degree trust nli ... amount locked tokens batch lti ... remaining locking period for this batch ... all tokens existence the distribution and other mechanisms will take into consideration amount currently locked tokens. quantitative easing with distributing either free locked tokens will counteract falling currency supply and prevent induced deflation. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org issuing and distributing new coins migration crbit ethereum token will have many impacts. since the token build the top ethereum blockchain, there need have independent mining network confirmation consensus algorithms. share same algorithms and network with ethereum. but have tackle problem minting and distribution newly minted coins our own this one the key attributes each token. issuing new tokens (minting) every real-life currency has its central bank authority, that decide about issuing new amounts currency. decentralized communities like creditbit community, decisions about minting should accepted with some consensus and quorum. would like keep the currency and its management transparent and based democratic principles. our token will have three issuance processes: migration: these tokens will initially minted for purpose exchange for current crbit coins. migration will executed through web site, there would several migration rounds (target date for first initial round march after each round minting process will fired, all tokens will distributed respective depositors crbit coins. proof trust with distribution mechanisms: creditgame and creditbond: issuance plan will proposed from the development team, some key settings minting plan will decided within migration. other words, community will able vote for predefined proposals how many new tokens will minted and distributed next time periods. migration, each depositor will able vote for favourite proposal, his/hers vote will weighted amount migrated coins. later votings will managed creditbit dao organization. while other currencies minting plans are determined their dev teams and hardcoded, would like you, the community, offer your view and opinion. trust the community decide, even change this minting plan later future. dev&promo funds: will ask community allow the minting certain amount tokens and deposit them two dedicated funds, each with different function. decision about how many tokens will minted for each fund and what time periods will well made the migration. core development fund will explicitly dedicated cover some expenses our development team while bringing the whole solution the ethereum network. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org dao fund will locked for years and will used constant stream revenue for the dao and its projects via collecting creditbond yields. the voters will decide how this funds will used with vote the dao. but mainly the funds will split into two subfunds community development fund will dedicated development support team. after the creation this fund, the development team will provide several tasks development and offer them the community and development support team (dev spt team). after successful completion delivery solutions for these tasks, developer will granted award from this fund. specialized decentralized board within creditbit dao will manage the fund and confirm each task's completion. promotional fund will dedicated promo team for promotional purposes (more text below). distributing mechanisms creditbond yields you are familiar with proof stake concept, then would very easy for you understand this distribution mechanism. the main difference is, that collecting creditbond yields not automatic and not linked confirming transactions consensus algorithm the only prerequisite locking tokens (proof trust) for longer period. with this locking you are automatically given the right contribute the creditdao with proposals votes that your locked coins present. for reward participation you will get the opportunity claim your bond interest/yield. yields will calculated variable algorithm based (which will published advance) the length the locking period, other words, the trust you have put into credit project. exact: owners tokens will have opportunity lock certain amount their tokens for longer period for the purpose creditbond this will possible through dapp, mist other similar wallets. after each minimum time period, owner can trigger calculation creditbond yield, that will added his balance. when the lock time will end, owners will able reclaim their tokens from creditbond yield lock them for another round. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org creditgame mmo games each distribution period (month), same amount new coins will created and distributed among all owners coins, that are willing temporary lock (pawn) down their coins. enter distribution group, owner tokens must lock down fixed buy-in amount coins. his position (score) distribution games will decide, for how long his coins will stay locked (to maximum year) and what his share newly minted coins. after this locking period, his tokens are unlocked and free enter new transactions. this algorithm runs long all newly minted coins for this month get distributed. new coins are unlocked and can used instantly after their distribution the end each distribution period. distributing algorithms are games, where players test their skills and/or knowledge. several different games can activated the beginning each period distribution, each with fixed amount new coins for distribution. games will have different dynamics, rewards and lock-down fees. this way plan cover different tastes and talents and also enable small and big coin owners participate. players can enter this games anonymously, only with transaction game account. peer-to-peer games games where players can compete -to- games anonymously for the creditbond yield. both players lock equal amount tokens for certain period and enter the game. winner collects both yields for this locking period, but ownership locked coins not change. this mechanism actually reallocating the creditbond yields for locked tokens. game jenga jenga game physical skill where players take turns removing one block time from tower constructed blocks. each block removed then placed top the tower, creating progressively taller structure. game minesweeper minesweeper game all know well. the player initially presented with grid undifferentiated squares. some randomly selected squares, unknown the player, are designated contain mines. typically, the size the grid and the number mines are set advance the user. the game played revealing squares the grid clicking otherwise indicating each square. square containing mine revealed, the player loses the game. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org mine revealed, digit instead displayed the square, indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines; mines are adjacent, the square becomes blank, and all adjacent squares will recursively revealed. the player uses this information deduce the contents other squares, and may either safely reveal each square mark the square containing mine. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org creditdao creditbit dao decentralized organization, that plan establish after migration (th march), enable community voting and raising funds for development and promotional purposes. creditdao subproject credit that aims provide development and sources establish this organization. atm, are tweaking the details this mechanism and organization structure. but the core idea give community decentralized power decide about all important issues fair and safe manner. voting voting general expression for participating decentralized consensus process. technically, voting mechanism written smart contract, that contains transparent rules and conditions execute action grant some permission privilege. practice these voting smart contracts represent either elections proposals. purpose elections make consensus about which addresses will gain elevated dao trust levels (tls), that includes privileged rights for predefined time period. these trust levels are transparent and same trust level can assigned the same address multiple times. purpose voting for proposals create consensus variable questions regarding development, credit project, creditbit token, community, funds, features etc. the result voting for proposal single pool option that has most support among voters. election smart contracts will issued initially from the creator address and will define the trust levels repetitive election process till cancellation. proposals will issued demand from other addresses with suitable dao trust levels and underlying rights. voting for candidate the election for proposal will executed through digital wallet. voting decision can changed till the voting/election day, when all votes are registered and the result calculated. the creditbit token build top ethereum blockchain and voting mechanism realized with smart contract, each vote costs small amount "gas", that ethereum. for that reason, each voter will have sacrifice this gas exercise his/hers right vote. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org voting quorum and timeframe order for voting valid, minimum quorum addresses, that cumulatively own least all tokens existence, must submit their vote. there need that all tokens their possession must locked quorum calculated independently the state tokens. all votings must last for least days period, enable all token owners submit their vote. right vote, right elected each address have the right vote proportionally the amount donated locked coins (pot) from that address. each address have the right elected, respectively gain trust level and underlying rights. each vote will assigned with weight, proportional the amount locked coins (pot). other words, gain right vote, owner address has lock some his/hers tokens. several votes can executed with same locked amount tokens. right vote can also obtained donating tokens creditbit funds. with donating, each address gains right vote, votes from donating bear twice high weight with ordinary locking. there are some limitation the right elected, that cannot enforced technology. trust levels must distributed among several persons prevent concentration power. elections elections will triggered each half-year. preparation, all candidates can run for election and choose disclose their identity through creditidentity remain anonymous, distincted only public address. candidates can also express their devotion community with locking some their tokens. election list all candidates will collected and locked one month days) before the election day. all addresses owners with right vote will able vote for one several candidates, spreading support equivalently among them. trust levels (tl) dao has trust levels: executive board (eb) the trust level with highest powers and privileges. consists addresses with different owners, who disclose some their creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org identity. has regular meetings, they can establish new votings and execute some smart contracts. elected commons (ec) entity elected addresses, that have power elect eb, prepare proposals for voting and tasks for development support fund. voters are all addresses with right vote. identity disclosure executive board (eb) candidates must disclose their identity ensure that all addresses belong different persons. elected commons (ec) candidates are not obliged disclose their identity, but support the idea that each candidate should show great deal trust and support the community, either with posting forum, giving innovative and feasible suggestions, promoting token crypto conferences etc. mandates and mandate lasts for months. election process automatically triggered and announced month before the expiry (candidacy procedure). trust levels powers have regular meetings, conclusions are public and posted the media. approves decisions with minimum (approving) votes for the proposal. main task create proposals and trigger voting process. also manages development support fund and represent creditbit the public and media. expected for members actively participate process development product owners, giving developers clear view priorities developing. think tank our community. produces new ideas, prepare draft proposals, drive marketing and promoting activities, review and test new applications etc. each days they appoint facilitator, member who moderates and guides activities. members work groups the projects, that are assigned them from eb. they also manage promotional fund. management funds all tokens donated all three funds are permanently locked. only yields from creditbond process can used for the fund purpose. development fund fully managed the development team's representative his/hers own discretion. funds must spent for development only. frequent reports from dev team will reveal the functionalities and apps under development. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org community development fund managed eb, each transaction must approved least members. purpose spending their own discretion, but regular reports must show reasons and the nature spending. promo fund full discretion elected commons, transactions and awards will voted batches and released once month. creditidentity default, all addresses and transactions are anonymous. for participating some processes, respective owners addresses will able disclose their identity and connect their addresses with their personal data public information. this feature will enable track history the creditdao and creditbay, can implement fair rating and reputation system for the community. this smart contract will store links between individual ethereum public addresses and public social network accounts identity verification services accounts. linking voluntary process, each link can deactivated (but not deleted) later each public address has right create new links and deactivate old links, but cannot delete links permanently order ensure audit trail. all links are stored blockchain and visible all, creditbit will implement tools for searching and previewing these links, attached public addresses the official website. each public address will collect rating and reputation with his activity creditdao, development support team and creditbay. the moment, these measures are not assurance, that true person using and manipulating with this address, but they are good measure address owner activity and engagement the community. creditbit will not check identity any person give guarantees, that identities are not stolen falsified. creditbay this project developing decentralised commodity market top ethereum, implemented with series smart contracts. each contract defines relationship between physical commodity and ethereum address. relationships can vary from ownership more complex rights that connects one more addresses, ex. lending leverage trading. thus "smart property" principle can implemented and integrated large market, with some restrictions and terms use and privacy policy. implement kyc and aml regulations, some level identification (with creditidentity) and corresponding trading limits will integrated. creditbit whitepaper creditbit.org basic purpose establish market, where ownerships over commodities are traded using simple smart contracts. further extensions and implementations are also possible and feasible, also combination with the locking mechanism (proof trust). community and promotion promotion team promotional team (promo team) group promoters, who promote usage and look for new possibilities, use cases, valuable integrations etc. would like accept journalists, crypto enthusiasts, investors, analytics and evangelists that show interest towards our projects, coin/token and community. creditbit dao will probably also offer some rewards for most creative, innovative and content rich ideas and individuals. bounty awards for promoters promo team opening its doors! this open invitation all promoters, journalists, blockchain and tech enthusiasts, ethereum addicts join our cause. this opportunity show your trust this project and community. time before the migration and before establishment dev&promo fund, will offer some symbolic bounties/awards for best promoters. seek innovative, qualitative approach, would like promote creditbit broad public. keep mind, that are not trying spam the media even members our community, but reach out crypto community. main goal spread word about migration and its benefits, new minting and distribution process, attributes new token and subprojects creditgame and creditidentity.
