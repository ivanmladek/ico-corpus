abstract decentralized forum application platform using smart contract bitcoin, which the blocks were first generated january brought global currency innovation. this was the first case actually utilize blockchain and move away from the traditionally non-reliable network trust-based innovation using blockchain the bitcoin ledger, and eventually bring about currency innovation. since then, the use bitcoin has been steadily growing along with its technology development. whereas bitcoin focused the most basic functions blockchain, the stable transfer and storage functions currency, ethereum which the first block was generated added private contract top its transferring function. the first smart contract function was used enable private contract blockchain without the intervention third party. ethereum, also called blockchain following bitcoin, blockchain with perfect turingcomplete programming language embedded. this programming language allows users directly build private contracts according given rules. this contract not only includes literal contracts but also the generation contracts the concept 'generating tokens' under conditions that meet the rules erc-. using the condition being ethereum contract, possible issue and transfer other coins the ethereum blockchain network, and already countless numbers tokens are run the ethereum platform. ethereum continuously developing blockchain that demonstrates tremendous advancement. however, there are still many limitations for general users and application developers actually apply its functions. also, very much complicated for various social networks, communities and game websites develop their own coins. ethersocial provides management tools that can generate tokens complying with the erc- smart contract rules with couple clicks well api functions that are applied various services. through ethersocial, website administrators can plan, make, create, transfer, manage and burn their own tokens. table

conclusion..................................................................................................................................................................... this case, the 'state transition function' the banking system explained this white paper applied per se. define the unit the currency and the initial work for distribution, enable other contracts process information requests the balance accounts, additional lines codes could written. but that all need make token system. theoretically, the token system sub-currency system based ethersocial may have important feature the metacurrency (currency linked the bitcoin blockchain) based bitcoin does not have. that payment can directly made with the currency used when trading the transaction costs. such feature can realized through the following process. execute contract, the esn balance should much the costs paid the sender. and the internal currency that received fee when executing the contract, can immediately exchanged and charged ethersocial balance. although users have 'activate' their accounts through the esn, the amount obtained through each contract can exchanged esn every occasion. this implies that once-charged esn can re-used. application process incentivized communities requirements for commercialization coins ethersocial was designed for the pay-type contents forum. also brings contents creators blogs the forum. coins can applied click-type reward, recommendation based reward and direct purchase for the contents without the server approval, and can bind the contents from different servers working different portals together. numerous coins are released with more than one role. through the white paper that can utilize blockchain technology and various types application software, can observe the possibilities that blockchain contributing other fields. however, out the vast number coins, there are only few that are commercialized according the white paper, which arouses serious suspicions regarding the commercialization coins and blockchain. need consider currency issuance model: esn used financially support the ethersocial organization, collect funds necessary for development, give rewards developers and investment fund for various profit-making and non-profit projects related ethersocial. initial ethersocial amount which has been secured before making public was owned the 'development team(geminis)' and the initial supply amount million esn. this amount divided into holding amount and circulating amount, holding amount long-term internal esn for development team, and circulating amount for public circulation towards general users. holding amount holding amount the initial supply, and used for 'development', 'reserve', and 'legal'. esn allocated for 'development' can used directly for esn core and ecosystem development and supports the development team, which about the initial supply. among 'holding amount', the reserve about the initial supply. the reserve will kept for long period, and unexpected situation happens, this amount can used. besides, 'legal' amount, which about the initial supply, will used for such legal advisory expenses. circulating amount circulating amount about the initial supply. this amount will circulated externally. for marketing, the initial supply, can used marketing expenses such active advertisement and promotion. for community and airdrop, about the initial supply will allocated and more users will use esn. 'bounty' means esn rewards for special mission participants contributors development and design. also about the initial supply allocated for esn development and spread. 'private' amount, which the initial supply, can exchanged ethereum. esn supply after initial issuance. after the time mining, esn are newly issued for the first one year and after that every year total esn are newly issued miners. after that, depending the level block and mining difficulty, mining amount can gradually decrease. mining algorithm can changed developers depending the level mining difficulty and the use mining equipment. the following explanation about the legitimacy the 'ethersocial forum's reserve'. for example, ethersocial can constantly distributed every year for ten years and contribute increasing the user base. certain portion will distributed according the contributions the forum's members and another portion can distributed through specific events. also, ethersocial can distributed necessary, basic asset for using ethersocial tokens other forums websites. there such reserve, ethersocial cannot easily acquired and the user base will inevitably become smaller. legitimacy the 'distribution ethersocial's development organization (geminis)' can explained the following. many development human resources, planning and marketing manpower are required develop blockchain and various apis well for repair and maintenance. expenses are accompanied running organization, cover such expenses, ethersocial has distributed the ethersocial development organization. for legitimacy the 'long-term reserve', the following explanation can applied. this long-term reserve not distributed the market for least one year (or more than year). for the first one year, mining reward esn, meaning that the proportion the mined amount the initially issued amount much higher than other cryptocurrencies. however, initial issuance increased too much, then esn may not become widely used cryptocurrency. therefore, initial issuance should kept level lower than the half ethereum but not too low, and distribution for the first one year should prohibited. for comparison initial issuance ethereum eth and mining reward for the first one year eth initial issuance ethersocial esn and mining reward for the first one year esn. afterwards, mining reward per year would esn. permanently issuing new coins from set amount esn could relieve the 'concentration wealth phenomenon' currently bitcoin experiencing. also, provides opportunities for current future participants acquire ethersocial through mining and not through the market. increasing initial mining more than ethereum, esn shall set the mining reward until blocks and esn for the blocks afterwards. mining centralization bitcoin mining done repeatedly hashing the sha block header until value lower than the target value acquired. however, there are two weaknesses this method. first, the barrier participate mining has become much higher. currently mining has been completely encroached asic. the mining asic can have thousand times more efficiency compared the general gpu mining equipment, mining through gpu has become less effective terms competitiveness. mining activities were decentralized the past, now centralization due asic intensifying. second the method mining. not that participants from various regions take part the generation blocks like the past. nowadays they participate mining depending block headers provided the mining pool. there are significant side-effects arising from this situation. now, three mining pools have been transferred with the computing power individuals and are indirectly controlling almost the hashes. course, individuals can move smaller pools before the share those pools exceed those pools cannot arbitrarily abuse resources,. however, this still remains major issue. ethersocial mining works slightly different. each miner brings random information from the state, hashes details randomly selected recent blocks and comes with the result value. there are two advantages this method. first that ethereum contracts can include calculation methods all types computers. naturally, asic would have designed fit for all calculation methods, but then would become high performance cpu rather than asic. reality, asic (application specific integrated circuit) itself will become useless. second, miners would have verify all transfer details downloading the whole blockchain. this case, there would need for large and centralized pool. course large pools have the effect equally distributing rewards participants for generating new blocks, but that effect can also sufficiently realized through the type pool. there need use centralized pool. however, some point, asics designed for ethereum mining can released. therefore this time, decentralized mining should enabled applying new hash algorithm difficult for the asic use. conclusion ethersocial provides token management tools that comply with the generalpurpose erc rules based smart contract, well apis that can easily combined with various services. ethersocial also provides administrator management tools that enable applications with 'esnrow, setup withdrawal limit, financial contracts and other advanced functions' used various services through very general programming language. ethersocial also provides support theoretically create all types transfer methods applications through the turing-complete language. through these features, forum hosts administrators all services that have accounts can use these services more easily and universally. reference .bitcoin whitepaper https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf .ethereum whitepaper
