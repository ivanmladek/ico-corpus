problem commitment open source community legal disclaimers risk factors introduction privatix established and profitable company that was founded group experienced entrepreneurs and talented developers who are passionate about the freedom the internet, online security, and the rights individuals and businesses privacy protection. our team which has more than years' cyber security experience are the developers incredibly easy-to-use, free vpn service privatix.com that can used anyone anywhere, regardless their level technical experience. since more than users have used this service. privatix also the team behind temp-mail.org has more than daily visitors and filters out more than million spam emails day. privatix has developed the advanced internet identity checking website ipleak.com, and many other privacy-related services. now have created concept decentralized, fully autonomous network blockchain. the privatix network designed have its own advanced crypto-economy and allow the users rent out their broadband. believe has the potential end the current era internet censorship and totally change the current vpn market, among others (e.g. cyber security). major problems facing the internet the incredible worldwide growth internet users astounding. had billion users, representing the world's population. predicted that will see billion users online. but, the number users online grows, does the level internet censorship. the future, most new users will likely come from countries with increasingly strict internet censorship laws; because these users often have poor internet mobile connections, they are the most vulnerable these sometimes draconian and arbitrary laws. these users who are seeking effective solutions internet restrictions. today, one the major problems with the internet the denial the network neutrality paradigm, that suggests equal opportunity for everyone access the world wide web. this denial will lead the collapse the internet have known over the last years. users are not just being watched overzealous governments and cybercriminals, their data collected isps and their basic privacy rights are routinely violated. this happening not just countries like china iran, but australia, germany, and even the u.s. the second problem the cybersecurity issue. according cybersecurity ventures report, have more than losses from cybersecurity incidents online and expected grow the complexity technical solutions today means that robust encryption algorithms aren't always accessible ordinary people effectively protect their data and ensure cybersecurity easily and affordably. the third problem speed. while the internet global, network quality not equal all countries. content getting heavier all the time, e.g. full videos, streaming movies, etc. the current centralized solution solutions for the internet censorship problem are currently available the market. however, they come with high price tag and are still vulnerable isps control. it's not secret that the vpn industry growing fast, not least all because the lure the industry's huge profit margins. insider, privatix aware some the major problems the centralized vpn arena, including false statements about log-keeping policies, data selling, overcharging, unclear billing policies, and the incredible margins that are siphoned off into marketing, advertising, etc. fact, the vpn industry doesn't protect users' privacy and data while the users pay high price for vpn services only because there are better options the market. new opportunities with its huge potential one the most powerful forces the internet technologies sphere, blockchain will enable turn current internet privacy and security practices its head, simultaneously speeding the internet (without any physical scaling.) privatix network conceptual new solution that will benefit ordinary internet users, developers, and online businesses. intend reduce costs and margins the vpn consumer market, eliminate the middleman and enable people share (and profit from sharing) their spare broadband connection. will provide new horizon for developers build awesome apps and services the basis this network, e.g. cdn, business intelligence proxy tools, anti-censorship sdks for apps, etc. the wealth potential applications only limited imagination. our mission and goals our mission create decentralized and fully autonomous vpn network blockchain with advanced internet bandwidth marketplace powered its own crypto-economy. our goal show possibility create new kinds products and services based the network capabilities which have the potential transform number markets like vpn, cdn, cyber security and encryption may even change the landscape application monetization market. token prix the privatix network ecosystem will based crypto-economic principles. prix will the only crypto-currency allowed for mutual settlements during the buying selling interactions between network participants. specifications prix erc token the ethereum blockchain, the central part the privatix network. it's main purpose allow network participants exchange value. token name privatix token ticker prix type erc ethereum address xadfcfdcbacfafdffba decimals total supply (after burning) prix (fixed, dilution) mining mining any other means increasing token amounts will apply privatix token token utility internal crypto-currency exchange value (utility) between privatix network participants token issuer privatix token ltd gibraltar limited company) token special conditions token exchanges for purpose buying selling internet broadband (between privatix network participants only) will subject commission fee transaction price prix. fees for any other transactions and exchanges except payments for bandwidth. the crypto-economy the main economic agents inside the crypto-economy the privatix network are: users who want sell their internet bandwidth (agents) users who want buy internet bandwidth from agents (clients) prix will the only crypto-currency allowed for mutual settlements. the same time, the prix token itself expected traded external exchanges. assuming there sufficient market volume, prix shall freely exchangeable for other cryptocurrencies both directions and anytime, subject applicable regulations and/or restrictions the various jurisdictions. prix not intended digital currency, security, commodity, bond, debt instrument any kind financial instrument investment carrying equivalent rights, nor are the prix tokens intended represent any form money legal tender any jurisdiction, nor any representation money (including electronic money). accordingly, any protections offered applicable law relation the purchase, holding and/or sale the instruments and/or investments referred above and generally known "securities", should not apply your holding sale prix tokens. prix tokens are intended digital goods, similar downloadable software, digital music, and etc. basic economic terms, the demand side there are clients and the supply side there are agents. clients want buy broadband from agents, and agents, accordingly, want sell it. so, the market equilibrium point, the price internet broadband will represented prix tokens (for example, prix). the event excessive demand for agents' broadband, the prix token going increase price, thereby likely attract more agents the network (as they will see they can sell their broadband for higher price) and vice versa. demand and supply will self-regulated effectively market forces; attracted the case high traffic costs agents craving profit, and the case low traffic cost clients wishing buy broadband cheaply possible. examples use here are two very simple examples which demonstrate prix tokens payments inside the privatix network ecosystem. example hans, regular internet user from germany, has mbps channel and does not use completely, especially night. has already paid his isp additional costs are required. hans installs the privatix network software and thereby becomes agent. the other side the world chinese internet user, lee. lee does not have access many internet sites because internet censorship china very strict. lee installs vpn program based the privatix network and through buys broadband from hans. now can surf the internet via the encrypted german vpn and get access all internet sites. hans receives payment prix lee uses his free bandwidth. example alex has internet hosting business. rents dedicated servers and sells hosting services for his customers, e.g. site owners. all servers are already paid for but their bandwidth significantly underused. alex installs the privatix network agent software all his servers and starts selling his bandwidth. another user, ivan, the owner video site, has rent expensive servers that people can watch video content from around the world. ivan, order save data transfer, uses product based the privatix network cdn which allows him buy cheap broadband from hundreds agents like alex. result, alex fully loads his servers and receives profit while ivan cuts content delivery costs. token sale the privatix token sale opened october and ended november during those days collected: eth eth total with eth pre-sale). privatix token (prix) final distribution details total supply: token sale and pre-sale: founders (locked for m): future and current team: advisors, bounty, and cost covering: total circulation supply: locked tokens excluded) total contributors: all unsold tokens were burned, and future tokens can issued. the exact total supply ,,. prix token address: xadfcfdcbacfafdffba business model the main assets the privatix network are "exit nodes owners" (agents). these agents host their internet-connected devices special lightweight software which enables them sell their internet bandwidth. most internet-connected users have lot spare bandwidth that already has been paid for isp but mostly remain unused. privatix will enable the sale this unused asset (bandwidth) other network participants and strives create meaningful value for agents with additional costs any initial investment from their side (installing the free software quick and easy). all financial relationships between agents and clients will prix crypto-currency only. every token exchange linked payment for internet broadband will subject fee that will accumulated privatix for maintenance and future development. the fee will the range the transaction amount. all operations except payments for internet bandwidth, like token trades exchanges, will free from any fees. privatix network proof concept (poc) products our mission create decentralized and fully autonomous network blockchain the privatix network but, hand hand with this, one our primary goals show how people can make the best use this network and benefit from many different ways, including financially. for this reason, ourselves will create number revolutionary poc products, based the privatix network, order demonstrate entrepreneurs and developers how they can use this new platform number innovative ways. privatix, platform pioneer, also has the potential derive significant profits from these products transforming several popular vpn and other markets (e.g. cyber security). the first product will focus will decentralized unblockable vpn blockchain that believe will address the challenges facing cybersecurity and internet censorship the digital sphere forever. expect totally change the consumer vpn market, enabling people use vpn for free sharing their own network, pay less than per year times less than current centralized vpn prices). long-term strategy define the long-term strategy plan for the next three years. the current real-world situation internet disruption and blockchain technologies development, challenge create fully detailed plan, but sticking our mission and goals, and relying our extensive experience, are completely confident that will find the right way any situation. facilitation privatix network platform, provision network supply the form agents, well the creation demand the form clients are our main objectives for the immediate future. the challenge face will facilitate balanced marketplace: will address this providing adequate compensation agents and the same time create demand customers. initially, will take the roles customers and poc products' owners. will use our funds promote the network and ensure its growth and maintain the optimum balance between supply and demand. this time predict the network will include tens thousands even millions agents. developing variety products based its foundations, the network will start taking life its own. privatix will benefit only from the network token exchanges fee and will develop the infrastructure the network and products. technical specifications this document describes high level architectural and process overview privatix network. more details can found our technical documentation general privatix.io attempts deliver multiple services that can used through privatix network. privatix network consists nodes running privatix distributed applications. each node can provide consume services. for each service client those who consume and pay for services, agent those who provide services and receive payment. concept the idea that stands behind this project create process that will achieve consensus among privatix network users and develop software products that will allow users provide and consume services this network. those processes should decentralized much possible remove single point failure both technically and politically. also aim protect the privacy privatix network users. decentralized applications decentralized applications provides different services top privatix network. new application deployment greatly simplified with the help privatix core engine, which enables offering publishing and discovery, agreement signing and termination, usage based payments for each unit service, billing driven access management and powerful api that give comprehensive control service lifecycle. all that completely open source and decentralized. each application will usually comprise two independently installed components: privatix core engine service plug-in privatix core engine privatix core engine software that implements consensus algorithms and operations that are common for any service delivered through privatix network. first goal privatix core engine process untrusted data trustless environment, verify that can univocally understood and processed. secondary automate common tasks for service providers and customers distributed application. service plug-in service plug-in software that provides particular service running along with privatix core engine and using its api. makes possible provide consume particular service, while offloading all consensus and routine tasks privatix core engine. basic usage scenario agent creates service offering and places deposit. client discovers offerings, compares and accepts them. client signs agreement and places deposit prove his ability pay for the service. agent provides access service. client starts consume the service units and pays for each unit service terminated and payment finalized due lag payment client's and agent's rating updated based history their payments processing. consensus any decentralized application should define protocols that user should agree. this allows any application get the same result, while running any device, any user. privatix network should agree several procedures: offerings processing payments processing service access procedure offerings are formalized proposal service agent any client the network. same procedure offering placement, discovery, acceptance and disposal makes possible all privatix nodes "speak the same language" and particular: how offerings should published (by agents) how discover offerings (by clients) how validate offerings ensure that they can unambiguously interpreted (by clients) how client signals agent that accepts his offering how agent verifies that client possesses required amount funds for particular offering and that these funds cannot presented another agent (double spent) offering can seen contract that agent publishes and sign. this contract should include all necessary information regards of: which service provided which units measured when and where client should pay which cases agent will stop providing the service offering consensus reached ensuring that all offerings are conform offering template. offering template template (schema) for the offering particular service. when say particular service mean not just for e.g. "vpn service", but concrete implementation vpn service that both clients and agents trusts. each offering for each single implementation will have its own offering template. payments are payment for service usage paid client agent for each agreed portion service and for agreed price. these agreements are part offering and thus known client before accepts it. blockchain blockchain technology helps achieve full decentralization. currently use ethereum, but another blockchain (e.g. cosmos) can used implement the same logic. particular, blockchain used for: micro-payments offering discovery data for rating system smart contracts ethereum smart contracts playing important role privatix dapp architecture. there are two smart contracts that use. first one simple erc smart contract that holds mapping between users ethereum addresses (aka wallets) and prix tokens. call privatix token contact (hereinafter ptc). was deployed during ico. privatix token contact (ptc) used for: token exchange between users delegation tokens psc (described later) get balance user point migration between privatix service contracts (if new version released) any user that want start using services based privatix network will first get prix tokens privatix token contact (ptc). users also need have eth pay for transactions ethereum network. ptc balances will used buy and sell prix only, rather than pay for services. provide additional logic and features, well support future upgrades, privatix deployed additional smart contract named privatix service contract (hereinafter psc). psc implements state channels features, service offering discovery, incentivize fair usage and controls supply visibility. use privatix services user will delegate control chosen amount his prix tokens psc. psc will then hold internal mapping between user's ethereum address and prix balance and will make transfer operations according payments for services. user may transfer his tokens from psc back ptc. each smart contract method invocation subject user's signature verification same regular ethereum transaction thus ensuring each request authenticated. privatix service contract (psc) used for: user balance storage agent offering registration and deposit placement agent offering deactivation and deposit return retrieve available supply for each offering pop offering signal still actual creating state channel cooperative close channel (normal close) uncooperative close channel (dispute close) top deposit state channel get internal balance user transfer user tokens his ptc wallet offering registration psc has method that allows agent register offering. placing full offering, including all the details can costly operation blockchain will require significant amount blockchain storage. instead full offering only offering hash published. used unique identifier the offering. during method invocation agent will specify the following parameters: hash the offering minimum required deposit for client maximum supply (explained later) address where full offering can retrieved together with offering registration agent required place agent's deposit, which equal maximum supply multiplied minimum deposit. this step intended make sybil attack ineffective, forcing agent lock exactly the same amount tokens would clients do, they will accept his offering maximum supply. each offering registration will create ethereum event (aka ethereum log). clients will listen such events and thus will notified, when new offering registered. address field will contain url, where clients would send request get full offering details. currently use tor hidden service url address. this allows clients get full offerings from agents without revealing their addresses and makes agent's addresses harvesting complicated. offering removal offering can removed agent only after some predefined time passes after offering registration offering pop-up. this period called offering removal period. such measure intended limit effectiveness sybil attack irresponsible behavior. offering pop-up real world offerings likely become irrelevant time passes. privatix clients will accept "fresh" offering and ignore old once. case agent want signal that his offering still actual, can pop-up offering. this operation cheaper than removal old offering and registering same offering once more. service supply maximum service supply the maximum number concurrent clients that agent can serve within single offering. when agent registers his offering psc, must specify maximum service supply. each accepted offering will deducted from the available supply. and vice versa, each closed state channel will increase the supply. observing current service supply will allow clients find out, agent still has available supply serve the client. psc will ensure demand for the offering cannot exceed the supply. state channels psc has method that creates state channel, when client accepts agent's offering. state channel can seen temporary bank account where client places deposit and agent can withdraw any portion this deposit. agent can withdraw only amount specified client and cannot exceed state channel deposit. during withdrawal agent will send psc transaction, which includes state channel unique identifier and amount for withdrawal signed both client and agent. this allowance will sent client agent off-chain minimize costly on-chain transactions. allowance will proportional service consumed client. agent will use the greatest allowance received from client when closing state channel. during this operation amount allowed client minus network fee (explained later) will transferred agent's wallet and reminder will returned back client's wallet. state channel can closed agent client. during normal operation, expected that client will send signed allowance agent and the latest will close state channel. such operation called cooperative close normal close. case agent doesn't close state channel client can initiate uncooperative close (or dispute close). client will usually perform uncooperative close return deposit back his wallet, when agent fails provide service all. client required make two transactions. first initiate uncooperative close and second close channel and receive full deposit back. second transaction can made only after some time has passed after the first transaction. this time period called challenge period. client has sent allowance agent, but initiated uncooperative close, agent can make cooperative close before challenge period passes. network fee network fee fee that goes favor privatix company. this fee intended for further development and maintenance privatix core. can changed privatix company anytime, but only between and agent's revenue. this range defined during psc deploy and cannot changed afterwards. user rating both agents and clients can assigned rating based their prior behavior. rating calculated analyzing blockchain transactions. rating calculation involves analysis cooperative closes uncooperative, amount tokens spent/earned, rating partners, time transaction. detailed explanation the rating system can found here service offering each service offering must created strictly according its offering template. offering template offering template maybe seen standard contract for particular service, where some parameters are variable per agent. offering template shipped with service plug-in. each service plug-in has unique offering template. both agent and client have identical offering template, when choose use same service plug-in. offering template may imagined service agreement template: this service contract made and entered into and between any client that accepts this offering (hereinafter the "client"), and provider with [agent public key] (hereinafter the "agent"). whereas, agent and client desire enter into relationship which agent will provide "vpn service" client. client must pay agent for each [billing frequency] [unit name] consumed. price for each unit name] unit price] prix. client doesn't consume service for [max inactive time] agent can terminate this service contract... etc. offering template doesn't contain full text, but only fields that should filled agent. but, desired, can easily included offering template json schema that includes offering fields filled agent. fields can divided two major groups: core fields fields that common for any service. they are required for proper privatix core operation. they are generic and doesn't contain any service specifics. service custom fields (aka additional parameters) any fields that needed for particular service operation. they not processed privatix core, but passed privatix service plug-in for any custom logic. each offering template has unique hash. any offering always includes its body hash corresponding offering template. that's how offering linked template and related service plug-in. when client receives offering, checks that: offering template with noted hash exists client's database offering passes validation according offering template such validation ensures that both agent and client has: exactly same offering template offering properly filled according offering template schema core fields here example offering template core fields: field title field description name service friendly name service offering template hash hash offering template nonce uuid allows same offering published twice, resulting unique offering hash. agent public key agent's public key service supply maximum number concurrent orders that can coexist unit name name single unit service unit price price prix for single unit service. min. units minimum number units agent expect sell. deposit must suffice buy this amount. max. units maximum number units agent will sell. billing type model billing: postpaid prepaid billing frequency specified units service. represent, how often client must send payment cheque agent. max. billing unit lag maximum tolerance agent payment lag. reached, service access suspended. max. suspend time maximum time (seconds) agent will wait for client continue using the service, before agent will terminate service. max. inactive time maximum time (seconds) agent will wait for client start using the service for the first time, before agent will terminate service. setup fee setup fee the price that must paid before starting using service. free units number first free units. may used for trial period. country service origin service service custom fields using service custom fields offering template can add any logic, that should interpreted either service plug-in custom gui. for example, can add "min. download speed" and mark required field. agent will required fill this field pass offering validation. client's service plug-in then may check, agent provide download speed promised his offering and may terminate service, not. service custom fields makes possible create custom logic, while privatix core engine will verify that offering published strictly according template. service offering discovery before service can used, client should: discover service offerings accept offering and place deposit get service access (incl. address service endpoint, credential, settings, etc.) discovery service offering implemented based ethereum events (aka logs) described earlier. client receives offering event together with hash offering and address (url), where can send request get full offering. future may extend url schemes support different mediums, but currently url includes tor hidden service address. tor hidden service allows publish web-service that accessible through tor network regular web-service without revealing address that web-service. this done prevent simple harvesting agent's addresses. service offering messaging channel service offering messaging channel (somc) service that used get offering and endpoint messages. somc implemented web-service and has three endpoints: ping offering endpoint client will send http get request this web-service and specify offering hash. agent will respond with full offering message. client will send http get request this web-service and specify state channel key. agent will respond with full endpoint message. ping ping simply used check that somc accessible. offering message offering message offering that signed with agent's private key. client will verify that agent possess the same private key used publish offering hash blockchain and sign offering retrieved via somc. client will also validate that has template for the offering and that offering filled according template schema. all validation passed successfully, client will store offering his database. endpoint message after client has accepted offering state channel created and deposit placed it. both agent and client will notified via ethereum event successful state channel creation. then agent will prepare special message that includes all necessary information for client start using the service. client will send http get request somc and specify state channel unique identifier. agent will then respond with endpoint message. ensure that sensitive data, such credentials and address are accessible only client that accepted agent's offering, endpoint message encrypted using client's public key. client's public key restored from ethereum transaction that used create state channel for the particular offering. endpoint template same offering, endpoint message should clearly understand client's service plug-in. client also must sure that untrusted data injected via this message. here use the same method with offerings. client and agent both have endpoint template (aka access template), where they both know what data required for client start using the service. after client has received endpoint message, will validate signature and compliance endpoint template. same with offering, endpoint template json schema and has mandatory core fields and optional custom service fields. core fields field title field description access template hash hash this access template nonce uuid allows same access template shipped twice, resulting unique access template offering hash. username hash this access template password can used transfer password payment server address address and port agent's payment receiver endpoint service server address e.g. address vpn server. service custom fields same with offering template, endpoint template can hold any fields that necessary for custom service logic. for example may hold various settings that client's service plug-in need preconfigure before start connection agent's server. maybe config file, server certificate, etc. service offering messaging channel service offering messaging channel diagram shows sequence communication between client and agent through service offering messaging channel and blockchain. this process allows discover new offerings, get offering details, securely pass credentials for the service access and securely provide service endpoint address (e.g. vpn server). privatix core engine components blockchain monitor get ethereum events, filter, create jobs ethereum package that wrap all communication with ethereum blockchain job queue create, update and invoke job processing job processor job handler, that process logic for each job client billing monitor send payments agent according usage agent billing monitor verify that payments align with service usage and control service access. pay server accept payments from client server server that exposes api which used view and control accounts, services, etc. session server server that exposes api which used service plug-in provide consume service, start, stop, get usage data. somc send/get offering and endpoint messages, verify compliance with corresponding templates responsibilities client role register service session usage automatically generate payments based service consumption hold service status (pending, active, suspended, terminated) hold state channel status (pending, active, terminated) synchronize service status between service plug-in and core database send and receive ethereum transactions: transfer tokens between

micro-payments, data validation and service life-cycle automation. each service plug-in has: dedicated offering template dedicated access template custom distributed application code service plug-in can provide consume service. will respectively communicate with agent client api. agent agent will subscribe for newly created state channels. only state channels that passed all validations will retrieved service plug-in. this event can handled set new account arbitrary server for example. after that agent's service plug-in will subscribe changes that state channel and will notified, service access should suspended terminated completely. will also confirm that service was successfully suspended terminated ensure that privatix core service status sync with service plug-in. agent's plug-in may push some common server settings, that will included part endpoint message. this method make possible handle server configuration changes, such dynamic address, etc. agent's plug-ins will periodically report service consumption privatix core. client client service plug-in will subscribe for new state channels. together with new state channel created event plug-in will receive whole decrypted endpoint message. then may prepare start service usage configuring party client software with appropriate settings, credentials, etc. client will also subscribe state channel (service) status changes. privatix core will notify, that service status changed, may implement start stop session. service become terminated, than service plug-in will stop usage and delete any data related the service. client's plug-ins will periodically report service consumption privatix core. service controller functional scheme service controller protocol scheme glossary general privatix company

the privatix network and possible products that can made using the network capabilities buying selling internet bandwidth. global vpn market there was estimate billion internet users worldwide this means that about percent the global population accessed the internet that year. the majority global internet users are located east and south asia, while china the largest online market the world. china had over million internet users, more than double the amount third-ranked u.s., with nearly million internet users. the global average internet speed stood .mbps that year. with the proliferation inexpensive smartphones, many today's billion feature phone users will convert internet users the next years. new users will mainly reside countries with strict strengthening internet censorship. according latest reports, the virtual private network (vpn) market expected reach usd billion cagr (compound annual growth rate) the major driving factors this market are increasing internet censorship, increase the number loud security incidents, growing industries, and the increasing number connected devices mostly countries with strict internet censorship; countries like

http://www.businessofapps.com/top-app-monetization-platforms/ products and services proof concept this section will describe proof concept (poc) products based the privatix network, well the concept the exit nodes software for agents (owners exit nodes). privatix.agent cross-platform software for exit nodes owners this software the primary component the privatix network the one that technically and practically allows the agents join the network and start selling their internet bandwidth. use case the user learns about the opportunity earn selling his unused broadband the user downloads software for his operating system and launches the user sets the percentage the traffic that wishes share and registers the network after connecting the network, the user turns into agent, his recorded the network, and clients can now connect him the user can see all accounting and stats real time after accumulating balance prix tokens, the user can sell them the exchange straight way order withdrawal fiat currency. after that, will sell their token the exchange and send the payment the user fiat currency. alternative solution the market: https://mysterium.network (concept only) user interface prototype privatix.agent will developed major platforms order create total operational system coverage. the user will also able choose wants share his connection for torrenting not; there are many countries where torrenting forbidden and fines may imposed. will pre-set default countries where this policy applied, and disable the torrenting option advance. consumer vpn based dpi-free vpn protocol vpn means virtual private network, secure tunnel between two more devices. vpn creates secure tunnel between your computer and the internet, allowing you surf the web anonymously from wherever you want. vpn also hide your address and changes another one. classic vpn providers use dedicated servers around the world and standard vpn protocols like openvpn, pptp,ltp,sstp, etc. vpn shields your privacy, helps avoid internet censorship and encrypts your transferred data. the problem centralized vpn dpi-based blockers (utilized china) and data server's ip's that detect when you use vpn. vpns based the privatix network will allow you surf between millions exit nodes the best available speed and use advanced modified vpn connections that are undetectable dpis. you choose peer the network, you will able pay for sharing your traffic with other users. you get more traffic than you give you will have pay the difference. vice versa the difference will paid you. classic vpn service decentralized vpn blockchain focused owner's profit only high profit margins huge marketing and data costs complete anonymity risk data access third-party can blocked sophisticated dpi the fact using vpn visible slow speed and unstable connection focus network participants' benefits fair prices without middleman margins low traffic expenses full anonymity private data and logging, access for third-party can't blocked the fact using vpn invisible high speed and stable connection prototype vpn client based privatix network privatix.box portable vpn router hardware device (basically advanced dd-wrt router with pre-set configuration) which allows: connection the privatix network agent without the need install special software shared vpn-protected connection via wi-fi members the privatix team have been using our prototypes these devices, which created the basis popular dd-wrt routers, for long time. this device particularly useful for travelers and acts agent and client the privatix network without the need install any software. also plan produce these devices partnership with suitable manufacturer. use case user goes vacation with his family and stays hotel the user connects privatix.box unprotected wi-fi hotspot the hotel the user encrypts his connection and shares this safe connection with other family members via wi-fi the user opted agent (share broadband), then most likely the user will get excellent and fast vpn cost all. alternative centralized solution product the market: https://keezel.co https://betterspot.com advanced proxy socks selling api platform when the privatix network established, will contain hundreds thousands, even millions, connected devices (agents) and most them will have residential ip-addresses. for thousands companies and businesses, residential proxies are vital and also scarce resource. online retailers collecting comparative pricing information, developers testing their web sites from any city the world, large networks using proxies for ensuring the ads they deliver are safe and compliant, cybersecurity firms checking sites are not malicious, and business intelligence tools use thousands proxies every day parse search engines competitors' websites. our product will include advanced api through which anyone will able buy the use proxies (traffic) from privatix network agents convenient and easy way. use case large online retailer deals with the daily challenge collecting data positions and prices their competitors' websites data parsing directly from their servers using datacenter addresses even the rotation does not work. the ips are quickly detected the competitor and blocked. connecting their software the platform api, the retailer's developers can buy unlimited number proxies with residential addresses and completely mask their activity rotating them and paying only for traffic means the retailer can solve their business objectives very simple and convenient way infrastructure for vpn providers all classic vpn providers the market today use the infrastructure dedicated servers different data centers and purchase ipv address pools. this has number serious shortcomings: limited ability buy new ipv addresses expensive maintenance server infrastructure, balancing, etc. high broadband costs most addresses from the data center are easily detected and blocked, unlike the addresses home small offices computers (residential ips) replacing the infrastructure dedicated servers with convenient and affordable platform that can implemented the product will transform this market, dramatically reduce the cost broadband for vpn providers, and improve their ability stay unblockable with residential addresses. decentralized cdn blockchain privatix network, not want "merely" develop awesome products, eliminate the middleman and reduce prices, but speed the entire internet well. classic cdn today very profitable business. however, content becoming heavier, and more expensive, because the increasing use videos, games and streaming content. the average price for content delivery today per gb. believe that using agents' broadband from privatix network will allow slashing prices even fold the main condition for this large number agents the network. this proposal concept-based and can only developed the network grows big enough and have funds invest r&d. privatix.faas anti-censorship solution for developers freedom service (faas) this the driving force behind privatix.faas. our goal create powerful sdks that will eliminate the need for developers worry whether their app will blocked some country not. privatix will provide mobile sdk that will easy integrate into any mobile application software and give developers the ability send all traffic via the privatix network's secure agents' proxies, ensuring users always have secure and private access their applications and are never blocked. alternative centralized solution product the market: https://www.anchorfree.com/sdk/ privatix.monetize mobile apps and software monetization platform developers build applications used millions people and, many cases they can't monetize they would like do. the most popular monetization methods are paid subscription and injection. both methods always lead huge outflow users, and decrease virality users not like pay watch ads. privatix.monetize will offer developers sdk that will help monetize their apps without ads paid content using the following scheme. users install the app, which registers the privatix network agent and starts selling the users' idle bandwidth while the developer gets the payment for the traffic. the privatix team our team has established record creating world-class internet services the vpn and cyber security arena for more than years. have the proven ability develop amazing products and run successful internet businesses. check out our products and maybe you discover that you are already our customer. our last projects track record the privatix team currently serves more than active users per day and transfers over petabyte traffic per month through more than its

successful team that has proved itself various projects over the past years, and our record demonstrable. this team will become the backbone the future privatix network company which will attract even more talented employees with vision and entrepreneurial spirit, and the hi-tech skills needed this demanding industry. this the first time have tried attract investments. but now has became clear that simply impossible implement such large-scale project privatix network without significant funding. our goals and intentions are clear, and know how achieve them. believe now and you will participate the birth new global company that will change the world for better one. roadmap this roadmap representing projected intentions and may subject changes according the technical development and testing progress. first steps will have several months until the end the year which want prepare the company for the next steps quickly and efficiently possible. first month priorities have some top priority tasks that must finalized the first month after token sale. will report these steps and our progress the community: distributing all bounty tokens participants and suppliers new office spaces renting expanding current ones ukraine, israel, and russia transferring third-party management, "canning preserve", sale existing projects the company hiring administrative personnel legal, and administrative issues some legal formalities, well financial business processes, will need adjusted and facilitated during this period. also, the procedure for selecting and hiring new team members will started. the procedure for hiring talented people not always easy and can time-consuming source the best, but with our experience and funding, will able afford hire the most skilled and motivated people. know exactly who are looking for. privatix network core development the final quarter and the first two quarters will used develop prototype and alpha version the privatix network, well cross-platform software for agents. deadline: the end the second quarter privatix network alpha the first release the privatix network will include centralized elements and will available open source receive feedback from the community the end the second quarter privatix.agent cross-platform software for exit nodes owners this product one the two most important foundations the entire privatix network, since allows you route traffic and sell internet bandwidth the network. the first versions for such popular platforms windows, ubuntu, android, macos, ios will developed. proof concept (poc) products and network for two quarters, further development the privatix network will conducted taking into account feedback from the community. the end that period, the beta release the network will made, which essence will fully working version. the same time, the basis the alpha version the network, the development products based the network will begin; these products will ensure there adequate demand for broadband. hope reduce development time through partnerships the creation specialized individual teams and business units the company. deadline the fourth quarter consumer vpn, based dpi-free vpn protocol the development standard vpn services have competitors. however, are dealing with vpn blockchain with completely different level development. vpn applications will developed for all popular operating systems and platforms for maximum market coverage. advanced proxy socks selling api platform unique platform which possible use the api buy multiple outgoing residential addresses and their associated spare internet broadband. expect that this product will allow create huge demand for traffic the network and therefore have made one our priorities. privatix network beta release the second (beta) release the network will fully working network but with some centralized elements. these elements will fully transferred the blockchain with the final release the network the next stage. additional proof concept (poc) products and network the beginning our company will already have fully working network, the work that will conducted the first two quarters will relate its final release and the transfer all elements the blockchain. also the first two quarters two more products will created based the network. deadline for release the second quarter note: this stage will implemented the maximum goal (hard cap) reached. privatix network final release the final release the network means that from then becomes completely autonomous and any developer can use create their own products. privatix.faas (sdk) product that removes the need for developers worry that their application will blocked from any source, whether local firewall the isp level global block governmental level. privatix.monetize (sdk) this product will allow developers earn more their applications and programs. installing our sdk, the developer will able monetize portion users' spare bandwidth. proof concept (poc) products and network the second half having already working and autonomous privatix network, will able develop additional products based it, which will increase the number participants and, accordingly, the demand for the token itself. deadline for releases end note this stage will implemented the maximum goal (hard cap) reached. privatix.box (hardware) physical device that allows you simultaneously become agent privatix network and also use vpn functions network client. this device can also used secure wi-fi router. infrastructure for vpn providers plan create product the form network-based service and essentially resell the broadband existing vpn providers. they will able use the traffic from the privatix network instead buying from internet hosts, and thereby save costs without losing quality. additional information legal protection framework for exit nodes owners will develop legal framework help exit node owners (agents) handle situations when they are accused improper activity someone who used their node (ip address) the basic concept behind this proposal that certain responsibilities will transferred from agents our company. will provide all agents document stating that company lease their network for our use and resell it. this document will contain the agent's node and hash blockchain and the agent will able download from his dashboard. for example, the event exit node was compromised criminal activity and police make investigation, the agent can print the document and give the investigators. based node hash and timestamps, the investigators can find open blockchain related and relevant information, and also contact and make request for additional data. will also try provide legal help and assistance investigators and compromised agents serious cases our cost. will take out some insurance well; insurance that can extend all our agents future cover these types expenses, should the need arise. anonymity the basis our network. course has certain risks, but response these risks are going free agents from legal responsibility rather than stake out every user. solution for mass adoption problem advocates blockchain principles and decentralized economy, certainly support the idea that all payments need executed internally with our tokens inside our crypto-economy. even though this our paramount goal, understand that would make quite difficult achieve mass adoption and tempt agents. this time, only fraction people understand the crypto-economy concept and don't have time wait for the entire internet climb board; that could take years. order grow fast possible within these limitations, will develop centralized exchange gateway the privatix crypto-economy order create bigger supply spare broadband and multiply the number agents quickly. thus, not just users that are familiar with the crypto-world will able agent and profit from spare broadband, but all regular internet users well. these agents will see the prix token internal currency and the instant value these tokens fiat currency the same time. for example, agent accumulated the equivalent some fiat currency and demanded paid, would provide simple mechanism withdraw this token though exchange fiat and pay him using common payment system. commitment open source community our team strongly believe open source and make promise after three years contribute from privatix profits the development important open source projects. legal disclaimers this document does not constitute offer sell, invitation induce

following risk factors and all other information contained the terms token sale (the "terms") before deciding participate the privatix token sale ("token sale"). the best privatix token ltd.'s (the "company") knowledge and belief, all risk factors which are material you making informed decision participate the token sale have been set out below. any the following considerations, uncertainties material risks develops into actual events, the business, financial position and/or results operations the company and the maintenance and level usage the privatix platform and the privatix tokens ("prix") could materially and adversely affected. such cases, the trading price prix tokens (in the case where they are listed cryptocurrency exchange) could decline due any these considerations, uncertainties material risks, and you may lose all part your prix tokens. risks relating participation the token sale there prior market for prix tokens and the token sale may not result active liquid market for the prix tokens prior the token sale, there has been public market for the prix tokens. although the company will use reasonable endeavors seek the approval for availability the prix tokens for trading cryptocurrency exchange, there assurance that such approval will obtained. furthermore, even such approval granted cryptocurrency exchange, there assurance that active liquid trading market for the prix tokens will develop developed, sustained after the prix tokens have been made available for trading such cryptocurrency exchange. there also assurance that the market price the prix tokens will not decline below the original purchase price (the "purchase price"). the purchase price may not indicative the market price the prix tokens after they have been made available for trading cryptocurrency exchange. prix token not currency issued any central bank national, supra-national quasi-national organization, nor backed any hard assets other credit. the company not responsible for nor does pursue the circulation and trading prix tokens the market. trading prix tokens will merely depend the consensus its value between the relevant market participants, and one obliged purchase any prix token from any holder the prix token, including the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity market price prix tokens any extent any time. furthermore, prix tokens may not resold purchasers who are citizens permanent residents of, people's republic china, republic korea (including its territories and possessions) any other jurisdiction where the purchase prix tokens may violation applicable laws. accordingly, the company cannot ensure that there will any demand market for prix tokens, that the purchase price indicative the market price prix tokens after they have been made available for trading cryptocurrency exchange. future sales issuance the prix tokens could materially and adversely affect the market price prix tokens any future sale issuance the prix tokens would increase the supply prix tokens the market and this may result downward price pressure the prix token. the sale distribution significant number prix tokens outside the token sale (including but not limited the sales prix tokens undertaken after the completion the initial token sale, issuance prix tokens persons other than purchasers for purposes community and employee initiatives, affiliate (or bounty) program development, academic research, education and market expansion and issuance prix tokens reward employees and/or users the privatix platform), the mere perception that such further sales issuance may occur, could adversely affect the trading price the prix tokens. negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price the prix tokens negative publicity involving the company, the privatix platform, the prix tokens any the key personnel the company, may materially and adversely affect the market perception market price the prix tokens, whether not justified. may not able pay any anticipated rewards the future there assurance that there will any transaction volume such that you will receive any rewards anticipated distributed active users the privatix platform. further, even the event there substantial transaction volume and interactions among the users and the privatix platform, there assurance you personally will receive any part the rewards. this because the ability the company pay any reward you will depend the future results operations and the future business and financial condition the company and there assurance the future results operations and the future business and financial condition the company. there assurance any success privatix platform any future business line the value of, and demand for, the prix tokens hinges heavily the performance the privatix platform. there assurance that the privatix platform will gain traction after its launch and achieve any commercial success. although the company has performed some testing, including qa-testing the privatix platform with relatively positive results, the privatix platform has not been fully developed and finalized and subject further changes, updates and adjustments prior its launch. such changes may result unexpected and unforeseen effects its projected appeal users, possibly due the failure meet users' preconceived expectations based the beta version, and hence impact its success. limited usage the privatix platform and potential lack trust for its crowdsourced predictive accuracy would impact the public demand for the prix tokens and correspondingly the trading price the prix tokens. the trading price the prix tokens may fluctuate following the token generation event the prices cryptographic tokens general tend relatively volatile, and can fluctuate significantly over short periods time. the demand for, and corresponding the market price of, the prix tokens may fluctuate significantly and rapidly response to, among others, the following factors, some which are beyond the control the company: (a) new technical innovations; (b) analysts' speculations, recommendations, perceptions estimates the prix token's market price the company's financial and business performance; (c) changes market valuations and token prices entities with businesses similar that the company that may listed the same cryptocurrency exchanges the prix tokens; (d) announcements the company significant events, for example partnerships, sponsorships, new product developments; (e) fluctuations market prices and trading volume cryptocurrencies cryptocurrency exchanges; (f) additions departures key personnel the company; (h) success failure the company's management implementing business, development and growth strategies; (i) changes conditions affecting the blockchain sport technology industry, the general economic conditions market sentiments, other events factors. the funds raised the token sale are exposed risks theft further, upon receipt the funds, the company will make every effort ensure that the funds received will securely held through the implementation security measures. notwithstanding such security measures, there assurance that there will theft the cryptocurrencies result hacks, sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials service errors, vulnerabilities defects the token sale website, the smart contract(s), used, which the escrow wallet and the token sale may rely, the ethereum any other blockchain, otherwise. such events may include, for example, flaws programming source code leading exploitation abuse thereof. such event, even the token sale completed, the company may not able receive the cryptocurrencies raised and may not able use such funds for the development the privatix platform and/or for launching the privatix platform, including but not limited the structuring and through developing the privatix peer-to-peer bandwidth marketplace. such case, the launch the privatix platform might temporarily permanently curtailed. such, distributed prix tokens may hold little worth value, and this would impact its trading price. risks relating privatix token limited. the privatix platform developed, operated and maintained privatix token limited. any events circumstances which adversely affect privatix token limited any its successor operating entities (collectively referred herein "privatix token limited") may have corresponding adverse effect the privatix platform. such adverse effects would correspondingly have impact the utility, liquidity, and the trading price the prix tokens. privatix token limited may materially and adversely affected fails effectively manage its operations its business develops and evolves, which would have direct impact its ability maintain the privatix platform. the sport media technology and cryptocurrency industries, and the markets which privatix token limited competes have grown rapidly over the past years and continue evolve response new technological advances, changing business models and other factors. result this constantly changing environment, privatix token limited may face operational difficulties adjusting the changes, and the sustainability privatix token limited will depend its ability manage its operations and ensure that hires qualified and competent employees, and provides proper training for its personnel. its business evolves, privatix token limited must also expand and adapt its operational infrastructure. privatix token limited's business relies its blockchain-based software systems, cryptocurrency wallets other related token storage mechanisms, blockchain technology and smart contract technology, used, and machine learning and artificial intelligence platforms. all these systems and tools represent complex, costly, and rapidly changing technical infrastructure. order demonstrate continued ability effectively manage technical support infrastructure for the privatix platform, privatix token limited will need continue upgrade and improve its data systems and other operational systems, procedures and controls. these upgrades and improvements will require dedication resources, are likely complex and increasingly rely hosted computer services from third parties that privatix token limited does not control. privatix token limited unable adapt its systems and organization timely, efficient and cost-effective manner accommodate changing circumstances, its business, financial condition and results operations may adversely affected. the third parties whom privatix token limited relies are subject security breach otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services privatix token limited uses, the integrity and availability its internal information could compromised, which may consequently cause the loss confidential proprietary information, and economic loss. the loss financial, labor other resources, and any other adverse effect privatix token limited's business, financial condition and operations, would have direct adverse effect privatix token limited's ability maintain the privatix platform. any adverse effects affecting privatix token limited's business technology are likely also adversely impact the utility, liquidity, and trading price the prix tokens. privatix token limited may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions its network services, hardware software defects, security breaches other causes that could adversely affect privatix token limited's infrastructure network, and/or the privatix platform. privatix token limited not able anticipate when there would occurrences hacks, cyber- attacks, distributed denials service errors, vulnerabilities defects the privatix platform, the smart contracts, used, the ethereum any other blockchain technology. such events may include, for example, flaws programming source code leading exploitation abuse thereof. privatix token limited may not able detect such hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed denials service errors vulnerabilities defects timely manner, and may not have sufficient resources efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously rapid succession. privatix token limited's network services, which would include the privatix platform, could disrupted numerous events, including natural disasters, equipment breakdown, network connectivity downtime, power losses, even intentional disruptions its services, such disruptions caused software viruses attacks unauthorized users, some which are beyond privatix token limited's control. although privatix token limited has taken steps against malicious attacks its platform its infrastructure, which are critical for the maintenance the privatix platform, there can assurance that cyber-attacks, such distributed denials service, will not attempted the future, that company's enhanced security measures will effective. privatix token limited may prone attacks its infrastructure intended steal information about its technology, financial data user information take other actions that would damaging the company and/or holders the prix tokens. any significant breach the company's security measures other disruptions resulting compromise the usability, stability and security the privatix platform may adversely affect the utility, liquidity and/or trading price the prix tokens. are dependent part the location and data center facilities third parties privatix token limited's current infrastructure network part established through servers which owns and houses the location facilities third parties, and servers that rents data center facilities third parties. the company unable renew its data facility lease commercially reasonable terms all, privatix token limited may required transfer its servers new data center facility, and may incur significant costs and possible service interruption connection with the relocation. these facilities are also vulnerable damage interruption from, among others, natural disasters, arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures. additionally, the third party providers such facilities may suffer breach security result third party action, employee error, malfeasance otherwise, and third party may obtain unauthorized access the data such servers. techniques used obtain unauthorized access to, sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against target, privatix token limited and the providers such facilities may unable anticipate these techniques implement adequate preventive measures. any such security breaches damages which occur which impact upon the company's infrastructure network and/or the privatix platform may adversely impact the utility, liquidity, and/or trading price the prix tokens. general global market and economic conditions may have adverse impact privatix token limited operating performance, results operations and cash flows privatix token limited has been and could continue affected general global economic and market conditions. challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time time, contributed, and may continue contribute, slowdowns the information technology industry large. weakness the economy could have negative effect the company's business, operations and financial condition, including decreases revenue and operating cash flows, and inability attract future equity and/or debt financing commercially reasonable terms. additionally, down-cycle economic environment, privatix token limited may experience the negative effects slowdown trading and usage the privatix platform. suppliers which privatix token limited relies for servers, bandwidth, location and other services could also negatively impacted economic conditions that, turn, could have negative impact the company's operations expenses. there can assurance, therefore, that current economic conditions
