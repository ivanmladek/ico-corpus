genesis block the total market value the global cryptocurrency market has soared from dollar today's billion dollars. witnessed the birth ethereum made even crazy vision with smart contract. jointly with the block-chain technology, has created dramatic growth the global cryptocurrency market. what's more, was quietly developing the power that can transform the world. although cryptocurrency has undergone eight years magnificent development, everything has just begun. expected that within years, the market value the cryptocurrency market will exceed the total global gold market value which trillion dollars with great possibility. however, the traditional assets that are directly circulated the cryptocurrency market have credit consensus the global unified market, more efficient trading mechanism and better liquidity due the characteristics the block-chain technology. the same time, form financial innovation tools, "asset digitization" has also developed rapidly. the smart contract system based the block-chain technology applied "asset digitization", which can greatly improve asset efficiency and increase liquidity while ensuring the openness, transparency, traceability and compulsory execution asset transaction links. besides, can avoid such problems under-the-table operations, delay and even payment refusal centralized organizations. therefore, the momentum the convergence block chain and internet assets will irresistible, and the goal the maverick system become the leading force that can promote the combination the two. present situation current cryptocurrency trading market assets are unitary and dominated pure cryptocurrency assets loosely connected with and generally devoid the support the real economy. large number non-block-chain assets are waiting enter the block-chain network. concept and mission concept maverick system: making development trading block-chain easier. providing baas (block chain service) block-chain sdk solution make development much easier. with our sdk, developers can transfer their app into block-chain app smoothly. maverick system will launch its own trading system provide trading platform for such assets. concept: value giving, decentralization the emergence the block-chain technology the milestone the evolution from "information internet" "value internet". the block-chain network, value can given everything, and everything can traded. what's more, the value computing power, storage space, bandwidth, traffic and data can quantified and transacted. the same time, through the block-chain network, the open and transparent payment and settlement that can't tampered can directly carried out. many nodes form distributive database network record all transactions, and nodes are distributed all over the world and can work synergistically using the consensual mechanism, but one can unilaterally change the transaction information. therefore, the centralized database will not suffer from data information loss damage caused natural disasters, network attacks and other unstable factors. the three-stage-rocket product structure: chain sdk trading platform public chain: exists infrastructure, such ethereum, qtum and other public chains. sdk: will pack the functionality various chains into sdk developed easily according application scenarios, transfer the traditional information internet products into block-chain products the value internet rapidly. trading platform: all assets using our block chain sdk can traded our exchange platform ttbtc.com. smart contract another feature maverick system compatibility with "smart contract": system that can automatically transfer digital assets based rules conditions arbitrarily formulated. other words, block chain with welldeveloped turing-complete built-in languages that can code any status condition and also can create contracts ensure the automatic execution transactions. for example, assets can published and tracked the maverick system ecosystem and transactions and processing supports can realized setings allowing assignment, offering prices, inquiry orders, automatic order matching.. the business model maverick system application cases maverick system sdk sdk case no.: through integrating maverick system sdk, app team can rapidly register advertisement space chains, and sdk will assign addresses and private keys. therefore, advertisers can directly launch advertisements selecting advertisement spaces batches, and can directly carry out multiparty payment and settlement the block-chain system, the process which open, transparent, intermediary-free, bringing down circulation costs. addition, sdk will not make such false traffic reports advertisement intermediaries may make adiversers nor will sdk deduct traffic from developer. like safe and reliable account book, block chain can make people who don't trust each other exchange safe and transparent information and value without the overall planning authoritative organizations. when customers use the maverick system, sdk should purchased the open market and sdk should pay maverick coin. customers must buy maverick system sdk open market and pay maverick coin before using it. for the payment settlement chains, transaction fees have paid the form maverick coin. trading platform introduction ... diverse virtual assets: after the maverick system polymerized sdk, can quickly move huge amount non-block-chain assets the block-chain network. therefore, large number high-quality assets can obtained soon possible stably expand the sku exchanges, enjoying prominent preemptive advantages the asset acquisition side. the value maverick system the existence maverick system enables the convenient tradability and liquidity for the traditional digital assets held organizations, companies and individuals, which greatly facilitates the liquidation assets disposal asset holders, substantially increases the liquidity assets, well facilitates ordinary investorss investment high-quality assets all over the world. assets held them the trading market obtain the pricing determined the market and has the widespread liquidity. when using maverick system and its sdk, people need pay certain service fees and transaction fees with maverick coin, thereby reflecting the right use maverick coin. nowadays, internet entering the distributive era, and has gradually evolved from the internet that transmits information the internet used exchange values, and maverick system opens door the mankind entering transparent and reliable credit society. native block-chain assets the native block-chain assets maverick system are maverick coin. possession mvc total, maverick coin serves the guarantee for the normal operation the maverick system and the ceiling amount maverick coin can't increased. the main benefits maverick coin are: pay the additional service fee maverick system and its sdk pay the transfer fee maverick system and its sdk make payment for issuing purchasing assets maverick system maverick coin tokens technology scheme node management all devices running mvc software (inclu ing computer, phones, etc.) are considered nodes mvc. the system mvc, each token can regarded miniature mining point accounts. the more coins account has, the more power the the account create blocks. all the awards received creating blocks are the sum transaction costs within the block. with the creation blocks, maverick coin will not produce new tokens. the redistribution maverick coin occurs when the block generator accepts transaction costs, and the subsequent block creation generated based the unique, verifiable and almost unpredictable information the preceding block. considering the security the system, have added the following principles when designing the pos algorithm: introduce the accumulation difficulty values: each block contains this parameter, and the same time, will pass new difficulty value the next block. case inconsistencies, the consensual mechanism will automatically choose the block with the largest accumulation difficulty value. order prevent hackers from producing new chain generated from the attack genesis blocks, maverick coin network only allows the reorganization blocks based the current height blocks. blocks with lower threshold will rejected. the dynamic threshold can regarded the only fixed check digit maverick coin. ps: different with ppc, maverick coin does not adopt the definition "currency age" the calculation basis the block generating algorithm. the possibility that account generates blocks determined the effective balance the main accounts. sum up, the pos (proof stake), long people hold maverick coin, they can excavate data blocks regardless the number. only maverick coin holders can create blocks and take part the maintenance network security. interest misplacement miners and coin holders will not happen pow (proof work). cryptography basis the cryptography basis maverick coin the hash algorithm and the elliptic curve cryptography algorithm. cryptographic hash function kind method create numeric "fingerprint" from any kinds data and its output value called hash value, and also called hashed value. hash algorithm that based the hash function plays important role modern cryptography, whose purpose often achieve data integrity and entity authentication, while also constitutes security guarantee for variety cryptographic systems and protocols the elliptic curve cryptography algorithm algorithm for public key cryptography based elliptic curve mathematics and its security depends the difficulty elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. the elliptic curve cryptography algorithm has the following obvious advantages: key length short, and therefore requires less bandwidth and storage. all users can choose different elliptic curves the same base domain, that all users can use the same operation complete the domain operation. account security design all accounts are stored network and each account has private key, which educed when account address generated account passphrases adopts the combinatorial calculation sha hash function algorithm and elliptic curve cryptography algorithm.. account addresses that have passphrases can generated through the following calculations: passphrases generate account private keys through the sha hash operation. private keys generate account public keys through the elliptic curve cryptography algorithm. public keys generate account addresses through the sha hash operation. the first digits the account address are the code accounts. when account accessed passphrase for the first time, the account not protected the public key, and when the account enters external transaction for the first time, the -bit public key derived from the passphrase will stored the block, thereby ensuring the security the account. considering that the phrase password doesn't correspond the account number, collision possible. use the following methods detect and prevent collisions: once account has been accessed using specific passphrase and the account has been protected -bit public key, other combinations public key- private key are not allowed have access the account. operation and management system scheme management framework the foundation will managed through the following management mechanisms: the management framework can divided into two layers: the maverick system foundation and the management committee. maverick system foundation the foundation the organization the highest level governing the maverick system, which has the following rights: elect and appoint members the management committee (the firstsession members the management committee appoints candidates, and considering that the maverick system the start-up period, committee members will selected the founding team the maverick system); veto revoke the decision the management committee come with resolutions for major modification solutions the maverick system codes the foundation assembly held biennially, and case special circumstances and one the following conditions, provisional foundation assembly can held. the management committee convenes foundation assembly due emergency. currency holders who have more than voting rights total can cast votes convening foundation assemblies. the management committee the management committee responsible for daily management and operations the project, well the foundation. committee members are elected foundation assemblies and generally serve heads executive departments. the management committee has the following rights and obligations: determine the basic management system maverick system carry out daily management and operations maverick system the management committee consists five departments responsible for implementing specific tasks, including: ... asset audit and management department asset audit and management department responsible for the information disclosure and compliance audit online cryptocurrency and traditional/digital assets order ensure the quality and compliance assets that are born maverick system. ... technical development department: technical development department responsible for technical management, including wallet development, code management, code modification, code testing and audit, bug fixes and on. ... financial management department: financial management department responsible for all the ico raised funds, the use and audit the follow-up cash flow, pay management, daily spend management and other works. ... legal department: the legal department responsible for reviewing all the legal instruments such contracts, agreements and articles association ensure that the business the foundation compliance with laws and regulations and gives legal advice for major events. the department responsible for risk control work the foundation and cooperates with relevant departments the relevant anti-money laundering work. ... administration department: the administration department responsible for the daily operation integrated businesses, drafting relevant documents, business implementation the maverick system projects and foreign cooperation, well employee recruitment, market promotion and brand building the project. token allocation scheme the total issue volume mvc million, subject increase forever. the exchangeable proportion maverick coin ico and btc eth mentioned the ico will saved the open account supervised maverick coin community. the future, will used for operating maverick coin community, including technical development, auditing, legal affairs, business implementation, financial adjustment, the third-party supervision and asset management. use for user incentive pos reserve, and dividends are handed out through the pos consensual mechanism, order build well-developed community, award currency holders and develop maverick coin community and pos. reserved for business landing market promotion, mainly used for the listing fee the partnership exchanges, rewarding business partners, and creating and maintaining the ecological maverick chain. the maverick chain development team holds which unlocked four years, and fixedly unlocked each year from the first day after the end ico. during the locking period, the part maverick coin owned team members can't sold any form, which will written into the contract coded form for compulsory implementation. maverick coin sets aside which assigned the maverick chain consultants and angel investors/institutions, whose purpose provide financial resources and technical support for the early-stage development maverick coin. ico detailed rules and regulations the ico has million maverick coins total. ico divided into three stages: early-bird stage: time: from august august exchanging rules: btc can exchange for maverick coins, eth can exchange for maverick coins, and ltc can exchange for maverick coins. the first stage: time: from august august exchanging rules: btc can exchange for maverick coins, and eth can for exchange maverick coins, and ltc can exchange for maverick coins. the second stage: time: from august september exchanging rules: btc can exchange for maverick coins, eth can exchange for maverick coins, and ltc can exchange for maverick coins. team introduction mingzhao the founder and team leader, who once worked beijing jingcheng machinery electric holding co., ltd., large state-owned enterprise, whose responsibilities
