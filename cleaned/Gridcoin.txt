desktop grid approved distributed computing platforms distributed computing platforms are larger entities approved the gridcoin network. they might host multiple data-processing projects while having only some those projects approved for use the gridcoin network. the berkeley open infrastructure for network computing the berkeley open infrastructure for network computing (boinc) opensource distributed computing infrastructure which provides anyone with data the opportunity process that data for near zero cost utilizing global volunteerbased distributed computing network. date, boinc has been the driving force behind numerous computationally intensive research programs, such pulsar identification, the creation patient specific cancer treatments, the simulation candidate molecules for next-generation solar panels, along with many others. while boinc has been used primarily for science and mathematics, can host data from any open commercial field long the data can formatted for boinc's processes. examples projects include tasks engineering, cryptography, rendering, weather and climate prediction, well social, market, and resource analytics. enigma@home, for example, works break remaining wwii messages encrypted enigma machine. operation boinc consists two main components: project server system and client software. the project server, hosted individually each boinc project, stores and distributes project data the client software running volunteers' host computers. once the host completes the data crunching task, known work unit, returns the results the project server. upon verification the validity and honesty the completed work unit, reward the form boinc credits distributed the host which completed the task. credits serve primarily proof participation tool boinc's larger gamification system. outside boinc, gridcoin uses participant's earned boinc credits calculate their relative grc reward. multiple applications: >>>> >>>> >>>> >>>> cas@home

petaflops processing power. for comparison, the currently top-ranked supercomputer, the sunway taihulight, hosts petaflops. the tianhe- supercomputer, ranked second, hosts about petaflops. the piz daint, the third most powerful supercomputer, hosts about petaflops. gridcoin contributes petaflops processing power boinc, making boinc's processing power. results least scientific papers have been published using results from boinc projects. list these papers can found the boinc wiki page. future platforms additional data-processing platforms are eligible for inclusion, should they approved the gridcoin network. gridcoin the gridcoin blockchain genesis block was mined using proof-of-work protocol october th, gridcoin continued proof-of-work blockchain until october th, when forked onto proof-of-stake protocol which secures the blockchain based the number active grc the gridcoin network. gridcoin has evolved through several iterations proof-of-stake and incentive structures. currently, proof-of-stake used secure the gridcoin blockchain while the primary incentive structure based processing power contributed approved boinc projects. https://boincstats.com/en/stats/-/project/detail https://www.top.org/lists// https://boincstats.com/en/stats/-/team/detail/dbcadcbddff https://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/publications_by_boinc_projects the computation power blockchain driving science data analysis why proof stake? proof-of-stake green blockchain security protocol developed performs the function bitcoin's proof-of-work without the need for energy intensive calculations this frees gpus (and cpus) from the task securing the blockchain. gridcoin incentivizes participants direct these processing resources the completion real world analytical tasks. security the gridcoin blockchain secured through proof-of-stake mechanism similar most other proof-of-stake blockchains. proof-of-stake proven protocol that uses minimal processing resources and rewards stakers blocks with the transaction fees those blocks. incentive gridcoin has developed additional incentive mechanism called grcresearchmint. grcresearch-mint operates minting protocol-defined number the grc cryptocurrency per day and distributing these grc participants based each participant's relative processing contributions approved data analytics projects. defined this way, there limit the number grc minted: grc protocol-defined inflationary cryptocurrency. approved data analytics projects data analytics projects are projects hosted approved distributed computing platforms stand-alone projects. data analytics projects are approved through the gridcoin whitelist processes. the gridcoin whitelist list projects approved gridcoin network participants. the whitelist managed through parameter defined process conjunction with blockchain voting. boinc data analytics projects the boinc distributed-computing platform hosts dozens whitelist approved data analytics projects. the actively maintained list can found the gridcoin website. stand-alone and other platforms' data analytics projects gridcoin ready receive proposals. interested parties can reach the developers creating issue https://github.com/gridcoin-community/projects/issues. possible include brief overview your project. https://www.gridcoin.us/guides/whitelist.htm the computation power blockchain driving science data analysis gridcoin participants are individuals entities who are active the gridcoin ecosystem. there are currently two types participants. crunchers crunchers are participants who contribute their ipp approved data analytics projects. their participation ensures the continued analysis data approved the gridcoin network. cruncher while founded those closest blockchain technology, the gridcoin ecosystem one perpetual growth and expanding inclusion. anyone who sees path make the gridcoin protocol fit their unique needs encouraged participate its continuing development, from coding, writing, the contribution ideas. participants blockchain for everyone cruncher contribution data project server gridcoin stakers stakers are individuals who secure and advance the gridcoin blockchain through the proof-of-stake protocol maintaining online wallet with grc balance. their participation ensures the decentralized creation blocks and superblocks while protecting the blockchain from adversaries. the computation power blockchain driving science data analysis scientific literacy ipp distribution ecosystem defined the unfettered will participants intended encourage scientists and researchers educate participants the usefulness their data. the result such system intended widen the umbrella science fields not directly related any specific task project, thereby expanding general knowledge science and scientific practices. fetching participant ipp contribution statistics order accurately aggregate participant's contribution statistics for storage the blockchain, gridcoin developed tool known superblock. superblock data translated into the gridcoin variable known magnitude, quantifier representing participant's contribution project. magnitude then determines how much the protocol-defined grcresearch-mint each participant receives. each data analysis platform given its own superblock with unique magnitude formula. boinc superblocks boinc superblocks fetch participant's boinc recent average credit, also called researcher rac. rac based participant's earned boinc credits. credits and rac are defined boinc. these definitions can found the boinc wiki page. determine magnitude for project, the individual participant's rac compared the combined rac other gridcoin team participants, and the number whitelisted projects. future superblocks unique superblock protocols will created for each platform and stand-alone project added the gridcoin ecosystem. the intent appropriately distribute grcresearch-mint between all platforms and projects based participant's relative processing contributions and accordance with consensus reached the gridcoin network. blockchain data the gridcoin blockchain currently contains transaction data, held regular blocks, alongside data pertaining network participant's contributions approved data analytics projects, held superblocks. these existing functionalities lay the groundwork for much larger-scale data-storing infrastructure, which could include the following: participant data for sources addition boinc, research data and results, peer-review and scientific journal rating information similar the contemporary impact factor system, and more. ipp distribution gridcoin seeks create ecosystem science, research, and data analysis based the interests the network's participants. individuals will direct their ipp approved projects which they see beneficial, entertaining, otherwise value. project which benefits otherwise presents greater value more people will receive larger share the total ipp the gridcoin network. http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/computation_credit the computation power blockchain driving science data analysis magnitude economics ensure that single project monopolizes the gridcoin network's ipp, gridcoin uses magnitude economics build flatter ipp distribution curve. each approved project given the same amount magnitude split among its participants. this model creates environment which encourages least portion participants the gridcoin network seek out projects with fewer contributors, ensuring the access lesser-known projects significant amounts computing power. why weight votes? infrastructure gridcoin's magnitude economics system conjunction with the different types data hosted approved projects makes dated and lower-end hardware competitive with high-end gpus. prevent attack the network through the voting system. voting was not weighted, attacker could utilize multiple wallets vote polls. each wallet had equal amount voting power, the attacker would over-represented and skew the poll the attacker's direction. the gridcoin network consists collection interconnected nodes running the wallet software. each node connects with several dozen other nodes. worldwide distribution nodes makes the network resistant disasters like local power outages, natural disasters, political upheaval, there single point failure. voting gridcoin utilizes voting system built directly into the wallet. any network participant with significant stake gridcoin (currently grc) can create poll. votes can weighted using user's grc balance, contributions boinc, both. alternatively, poll can tally votes through one-wallet-one-vote onecpid-one-vote mechanism. cpid (cross project id) boinc account identifier. gridcoin values open source gridcoin software hosted github under the mit license. anyone may access, view, modify, learn from, experiment with, copy the software. gridcoin's commitment open-source software brings several benefits. since anyone familiar with the programming language (currently c++) may contribute, the software easily extended, audited, and maintained. this inherent flexibility open-source means that gridcoin development can quickly respond challenges they arise. opensource empowers programmers and contributors recognize issues the code before they present production. open data the data the blockchain accessible either through the wallet software through web-based blockchain explorers. global open-ledger system, blockchain technology keeps the data both open and secure. gridcoin supports the open publishing data which turn allows more people analyze and otherwise experiment with the data. https://github.com/gridcoin/gridcoin-research https://opensource.org/licenses/mit the computation power blockchain driving science data analysis open access access the gridcoin network and its services systematically unrestricted. network consensus the only barrier access the network's computing services. this permits nearly instant, entirely borderless, censorship resistant transactions between parties. gridcoin supports open access academic publications, this encourages public engagement with science and open data, consistent with gridcoin's ideals. open education the aforementioned open-knowledge principals culminate open-education. being open-source community means that gridcoin supports the development open education resources (oer). more educated society means more educated network and more educated contributors from all relevant fields. the current approved distributed-computing platform, boinc, enables not only massive laboratories, organizations, research universities produce projects for discovery, but individuals well. gridcoin values this type open education initiative and whitelists projects which are large scope, such world community grid, well smaller projects such odlk. decentralized operation decentralized system where some decisions the agents are made without centralized control processing. important property agent systems the degree connectivity connectedness between the agents.' decentralization solves the single point failure problem, allows for diversity, larger participation decision-making, provides equality, and limits encroachment centralized higher
