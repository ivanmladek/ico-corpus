background introduction blockchain technology blockchain one the most revolutionary and disruptive technologies all time. above all, blockchain represents new social direction thought, which indicates the arrival new era human transition and change. kevin kelly describes "out control": "the laws evolution nature, society, and technology will shift from biological logic move from edge center edge, from uncontrolledness control uncontrolledness". the technical basis the blockchain the distributed network architecture. precisely because the maturity the distributed network technology, which evolved from systems orbiting the center, weak center, sub-center and then shared, consensual, decentralized organizational structure, that commercial architecture can effectively established. there have been several iterations blockchain technology today: the first distributed ledger. general ledger for all agencies and general ledger for all business matters; second, blockchain technology new type database. there central computer room, there operation and maintenance personnel. the third party enters the data according the consensus algorithm, the use asymmetric encryption algorithm ensures data security; third smart contract. relying smart contracts, the world like supercomputer running fine, everything can agreed advance. compiled into code, accordance with the procedures; fourth, tcp-ip model point-to-point value transfer protocol. its invention marks the fact that internet technology has helped people transmit information more efficiently over the past two decades. you can start helping people realize value interconnection without the help third-party trust endorsement. the core value blockchain lies its realization tamper-proof, secure and reliable distributed accounting system. multiple participants using blockchain ledgers can form the basis trust for multi-party transactions without the need for additional third-party guarantee the transaction, thus enabling low-cost, low-latency information exchange and processing system enable the efficient flow digital value. digital currency encryption encrypting digital currency important application the blockchain. the name implies, cryptocurrency concentrates cryptography. cryptography provides mechanism encode cryptocurrency rules into the system itself. not only can people use cryptography prevent interference with the system avoid confusion, also used code currency units into the mathematical protocol. the concept encrypted digital currency distributed social networks based the bimp distributed protocol implements this concept. relying the unchangeable, safe and reliable attributes the blockchain creates peer-to-peer community allowing everyone conduct encrypted digital currency transactions and exchanges. instant messaging software with the popularization smart phones, instant messengers gradually replaced traditional sms and voice calls people's daily life. countries where mobile communications are developed, instant messaging software (im) such whatsapp, telegram, wechat has greatly facilitated daily life and communication. the majority the population emerging countries, especially urban residents, are high demand for "im e-payment" models. instant messaging software and applications has become platform build advertising, mobile games, e-commerce, peripheral services and other value-added services. constructing well-established online ecosystem emerging markets and creating "one-stop shop" for emerging market individuals and businesses where the openchat team fully committed. while software developing rapidly, traditional enterprises has gradually exposed some the problems their operations. traditional applications usually include three parties: platform, partners and users. each side has role sustain the development the platform. although everyone plays key role, the goals these groups are very different from another. the current model does not provide means which their incentives can coexist and harmonize. driven the supply side's own interests, the future social networks becomes problematic. the platform and partner associations everything possible gain access users' information order extract big data analyze basis for promotion. however, this has caused serious privacy crisis. facebook, skype, microsoft, apple and yahoo! were exposed the prisoners project being implemented the u.s. national security agency, causing uproar. user, you may have done nothing wrong, but you may become the subject suspicion and surveillance. the project had the potential scrutinize all your past decisions and review all the friends you've talked to, and you might penalized for just sending the wrong message once. nowadays, users some countries pay more attention personal privacy, but people other countries may not care what their authority doing and also may not care about the privacy policy statement software apps. "social software communication privacy ranking" released amnesty international was widely distributed social networks. this list compares and rates current mainstream social software services from five aspects: "human rights protection", "end-to-end encryption", "risk alert", "open door open door" and "publishing encryption technology details". global mainstream ims skype and wechat scores were only points and points (out points). the ranking shows the seriousness the risk privacy disclosure. the traditional method information encryption technology called "transmission encryption." service providers use different encryption methods encrypt the transmission information. the biggest drawback this encryption method that the messages sent between users are plaintext. other words, the service provider charge information transmission wants peek the privacy users inadvertently release the information, all the user's chat records are unreservedly exposed the public. the prospect troubling future longer the disclosure personal information, but the prediction user behavior. when the development technology advances state where artificial intelligence (ai) can predict, affect and direct people's decision-making. when the intellectual property and algorithms these are controlled large corporation, the ethics the application the technology comes into question. blockchain new composite application mode computer technology that includes distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanism and encryption algorithm. blockchain, strong guarantee digital assets, has been well received the industry. however, the traditional ims, which should responsible for the privacy users, does not provide any corresponding entry point the blockchain. the same time, providers traditional third-party products are constantly competing with each other ensure their own interests. they simply can not enter into state mutualism and mutual benefit. over time, products become more homogeneous, the industry will gravitate towards acquisitions and mergers, with some products being eliminated from the market. this not only harms the diversity the market but also stifles many great ideas. electronic payments electronic payment methods can classified based two basic concepts cash and credit. credit card transactions are currently one the major online payment methods. for example, user shopping amazon. first you need enter your credit card information when billing. amazon receives the account information and feeds back the payment "system" the information processor, bank, issuing company and other intermediaries. using third-party payment facility such paypal alipay, the user experience model would for the intermediary company collect the user's bank card information and approve each transaction information and settle the payment with the seller the end each trading day. credit-based electronic payment convenient, but its security cannot guaranteed. either the buyer's user information the payment channel itself are compromised, then the payment system will susceptible harm. the cash-based payment system, however, increases the payment system complexity while avoiding the security risk providing bank card information directly the buyer. users and sellers can not communicate directly. they have open account with third-party payment company. encrypted digital currency, represented bitcoin, supports both user-merchant transactions and transactions between users and users. fact, the bitcoin system does not distinguish between users and merchants. much bitcoin's success due its support for transactions between users and users. from the beginning, every bitcoin user can send other bitcoin users. result, cryptocurrency likely become substitute for credit card companies and third-party payment agencies the future. will truly deliver point-to-point real-time trustless transactions the primary choice for electronic payments. addition, whether based cash credit payment, cross-border payment with high fees are one the pain points the market. according the mckinsey report global payments: strong cornerstones despite changes", cross-border payment transactions account for less than global payments. however, the transaction fee brings the worldwide payment transaction fee. the cross-border payment revenue was billion u.s. dollars. improving efficiency and reducing costs for urgent need that blockchain technology must address. openchat ecosystem the openchat project set distributed protocol bimp based blockchain technology. the first floor-to-ceiling application the bimp protocol will be: instant messaging platform with add-on light wallet application based the blockchain cross-link technology (partially implemented); social networking platforms using decentralized technology which will build completely new social-networking ecosystem the future (partially implemented); exchanges that use the protocol and tokens voting mechanism (currently discussion with several leading exchanges). openchat team actively discussing with these strategic application partners implement the protocol and circulate the token. chatcoin tokens made the bimp protocol are widely supported bimp-based chat tools. used the platforms issue, reward, pay users and will have wide-ranging practical applications. instant messaging project (imp) introduction the instant messaging platform built the openchat protocol platform consolidate and support multiple blockchains using the "im wallet" model. the model uses instant messaging software platform build advertising, mobile games, e-commerce, peripheral services and other value-added services, eventually becoming stable sustaining online ecosystem. for users, "one-stop shop" platform handle all personal and business matters. the foundation for the project development. many assets emerging countries and markets have not been digitized, such housing, automobiles and on. but the future, when more assets are digitized moved onto the blockchain, ims can realize the agreement with chatcoin inspire the community's development capabilities for better circulation these digital assets. this turn drives chatcoin's acceptance and circulation. the complexity the technology facing the first generation cryptocurrencies often too intricate for most consumers. transaction costs, private keys, and alphanumeric address issues create barriers for mainstream users. these include the common requirement hold cryptocurrencies first (only cryptocurrencies must held before the other tokens can acquired and utilized). openchat will try greatly reduce this type friction and grant users user-friendly entry point the blockchain. prior being able interact with chatcoin, user-initiated processes not require them hold cryptocurrencies. the imp maintains the community interest principles, which protects the interests users and developers and unites everyone involved improving and promoting the project. but the decentralization the imp does not mean anarchist disposition, but rather platform that can help societies resolve the issue trust social activities low cost. effective means promoting the establishment honest and trustworthy (or trustless) society. blockchain-based electronic wallet the main function required enable the digital community use cryptocurrencies wallet. first step, the imp will consolidate the wallet for each user account. the associated user interface will allow the most common wallet interaction and support millions active users consolidating their wallets. the wallets have the potential become the most popular and used cryptocurrencies wallet the world. self-media (personal media) ecosystem this tool dynamic display all your social activity, news, quotes, transactions one platform. information about the activity friends can found alongside the activity their own blockchain transactions. this feature actually effort nurture users' habits rationalizing blockchain wealth. because the focus many users place messaging and social networking, there sound financial literacy for digital assets. displaying social activity and blockchain metrics together, users can look the what their friends are doing but also aware their own digital asset-related changes the market. this will help users develop the rational use digital assets and configuration habits. social/chat function with the chat function, users can keep contact with family and friends and establish their own social circle. users can also share other decentralized apps the platform with their social network. the platform offers the fastest mobile communication with video, voice and text. uses unique distributed technology, highly secure encryption service ensure fast and free communication. the platform boasts delay-free, high-quality voice/video calls and supports over users for simultaneous group chats. the product user base grows size, each user's social structure will further merge with the instant messaging platform over time. the social relations such family, friends, acquaintances will extend work/professional connections, and ultimately all connections form global social system. application network (network) the application network global, decentralized, symbiotic application market that openchat offers. users can download the products provided third-party application developers here. the user gains access the app paying providing valuable action/activity. developers earn chatcoin issuing dapps. openchat will maintain and monitor the network, making timely adjustments the developer reward strategy maintain the stability the symbiotic environment. the same time, openchat will encourage more developers provide innovative dapps. qtum-based system the platform needs medium for operations before users can interact and trade with each other. traditionally, this medium was provided reputable network owner. however, with the advent the common foundation quantum chains, can provide users with decentralized, de-licensed, trustless, and cryptographically verifiable protocol that grants fair access. the quantum chain evolves, the world has the technology necessary create better model the internet. think the qtum team will continue disrupt financial technologies, the internet things and decentralized applications. qtum will eventually become social technology. order realize its perceived potential, need maximize the utility non-technical users. needs ubiquitous, always accessible and needs part our everyday life. economic model openchat committed creating open source symbiotic economy. under this system, all participants (users, dapp developers) will become community with shared interests. the community must all work together win common interests. with the continuous increase participants, this system will also expand indefinitely. user, chatcoin rewards provided dapp developer are granted proof valuable activity (clicking ad, sending link, etc.). this not only enhances the user's active ability but also reduces the developer's promotion cost, realizing the common promotion benefits. dapp developer, this open source symbiotic economy, they can learn from each other and share each other's technological expertise and finding out their own shortcomings. all developers can really connect into community interests. everyone will work hard develop better applications. openchat, the other hand, offers lots chatcoin rewards developers who make significant contributions technological advancement motivate more developers. business model the new digital lifestyle service platform openchat partners will launch several market use cases that will allow consumers and brands use chatcoin. through experimentation, openchat partners plans iterate through products for users create unique two-sided market applications. the supply side, automated programs content creators will create unique experiences. the demand side, users will consume such products services. openchat partners' automated programs will able form their own unique business model the near future. application scenarios addition social scenarios, point-to-point wallets allows users fully inter-operate transactions. e.g.: scenario ser egyptian user. however, has live and work outside his home country united arab emirates. his spare time will use openchat protocol imp make transnational calls with his family. after receiving his salary, can send money his family through chatcoin. this eliminates the need for expensive currency exchange and transfer fees. scenario user music enthusiast who loves newly released music. can buy online music directly with the openchat protocol wallet. scenario user chinese user who intends bring his family travel abroad holidays. before going abroad need exchange large number foreign currency. each bank before and during the trip will draw transaction fee. the way travel, the traveling family will always have worry about whether the money they are carrying safe. the end play, you also need convert the leftover foreign currency into the home currency. the process very complicated. the openchat protocol wallet used, currency can paid directly when spent online offline, and the excessive fees every point during the trip can avoided. scenario user intends invest vacation real estate but finds that the price domestic house already high price. some overseas countries are attracting more and more people travel there holiday. this great opportunity buy vacation home overseas. user uses the openchat protocol wallet buy house the bahamas without excessive cross-border transaction fees. project implementation openchat protocol applications and openchat protocol partners have debuted the apple app store (app store) and google play. users can download and use openchat-based software directly visit the official websites. governance mechanism and risk management openchat investor community openchat will build decentralized international community and set the openchat foundation ensure the
