ambitions "what was the standard mode operation before v-id?" just like now difficult imagine what the world was like prior the internet, believe vid will become accepted and widely used element modern digital society. v-id will used any organization that wants fraud-protect its digital files fail-safe way. comparable how certified ssl connections are currently used for websites. believe that fast adoption v-id's technology possible, because radically different from other current fraud prevention technology. v-id offers validation any digital file with maximum security, optionally site with certified notary present, oversee the process. implementing v-id costeffective, fast and completely non-intrusive existing workflows. any recipient can verify the file seconds, without account,

downsides the digitalization society the difficulty combating fraud with digital files. source: itv news, november link the solution v-id service that uses blockchain technology make fraud with digital files impossible. v-id users can divided into two groups: creators and receivers. once creator registers file v-id, this file's authenticity can then verified the recipient. www.v-id.org v-id (c) v-id v-id's validation process guarantees that the person registering the file actually represents the organization issuing the file. v-id does not save copy validated file and therefore easily complies with the gdpr guidelines. verification the recipient the file can verify the authenticity and content the file entering into the verification terminal https://www.v-id.org. once the file verified, v-id generates report the verification. oic (origin information certificate) offered pdf format. this certificate contains all the details about the issuing party, the file itself and all blockchain data such timestamp and proof existence. www.v-id.org v-id (c) v-id the validation process validation can take place two ways: validation certified v-id employee and self-validation. transaction with v-id tokens takes place for each validation. due the data connected these transactions the blockchain, both the validating party and the validated file are fully transparent. validation v-id employee remote validation (level the issuing organization submits the files v-id using secure connection. v-id then validates the files. on-site validation (level v-id employee validates the files the issuing organization's location. on-site validation under notary supervision (level v-id employee validates the files on-site the issuing organization's location, with notary

lower operational costs. source: spoorpro, januari source: sva, januari this means more and more paper documents are replaced digital documents. file travels from the start the end process, passes dozens stations. through computers, modems, network towers, internet nodes and corporate networks that are managed different organizations, the file, one the copies, ends environment that may may not

document fraud. there are number startups and research groups that experiment with form security using blockchain technology. the massachusetts institute technology (mit) conducted pilot program with students, who received digital version their diploma alongside the physical version. this concept, only the student can download copy the diploma. the concept only works through app, and the recipients cannot check the certificate for authenticity later time. gradbase and skillchain are two startups that focus exclusively resumes. both are still the development phase and have customers yet. www.v-id.org v-id (c) v-id digusign project under development community enthusiasts around the digibyte coin. uses digital signature for documents and records them the blockchain via project environment. they leave the validation process the users. there are customers yet, but digibyte claims have more than users. furthermore, there fairly large number commercial organizations, such adobe and signix, which offer some certainty about the origin documents with digital signature. however, these are one-sided, not easy implement and not easily verifiable methods. addition, the relevant files have adapted for this purpose and these "signatures" password protections offer real, flawless protection against changing the file. verification services are offered growing number market parties, such nuffic and trulioo. these services use methods based human control, using knowledge, experience and sampling. interesting concept civic which offers similar validation and verification service for personal identification (passports, etc.). civic also bases its method the bitcoin protocol, the most established blockchain the world. conclusion the potential market for v-id virtually unlimited and growing rapidly. the worldwide digitalization ensures that paper file fraud increasingly moving digital file fraud. the validation service still new and unique. currently, there organization that has already won any significant market share. v-id provides the simplest, most scalable and most generically applicable solution. the v-id service approach not market application

prevent legal issues, v-id changed the tokenomics model march exclude dividend. this section has been updated march www.v-id.org v-id (c) v-id summarize, the v-id tokenomics show the following expected factors contributing the increase the v-id token value: utility and scarcity v-id tokens are the heart the validation process. validate files, publishing party pays with v-id tokens only. v-id provides all other cryptocurrency required cloud hosting for the platform. the token eliminates the need buy dgb, eth and btc for transaction fees v-id takes care this. the transactions are key the identification and confirmation the identity the publishing party. the number v-id tokens that will issued limited. vidt cannot mined and the tokens spent are burned quarterly. v-id transactions are public and traceable, providing transparency. the number v-id tokens needed for validating files expected increase, because the number organizations that validate files with v-id expected increase. the price per validation (in vidt tokens) controlled v-id. clients can choose between fixed market price. www.v-id.org v-id (c) v-id after first establishing client base medium large businesses, the v-id platform will further developed facilitate consumer-oriented services. these services will open additional market consumers, who will use v-id tokens for range applications around online identification, rights management and file validation. these api based applications will enable any website implement v-id service to, for instance, simplify the registration and due diligence
