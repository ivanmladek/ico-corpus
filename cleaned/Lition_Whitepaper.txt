highlights lition developing the world's first scalable public-private blockchain with deletable data features, made for commercial products. this state-of-the-art protocol enables blockchain-based applications step out their current niche into commercial mainstream deployment. blockchain development co-innovated with sap, whose chief innovation officer dr. jurgen muller also advisor lition. sap, company with million users and developers, developing the decentralized ledger and smart contract layer, while lition providing the open consensus layer. lition will run the public mainnet using lition tokens issued ico for transaction execution, staking and sidechain creation. lition well positioned design blockchain infrastructure for business use, launched the world's first energy trading dapp that commercially live mass market with real revenues and real customers over cities. addition this existing trading dapp, there second use case which lition, together with major bank and real estate company, has developed mvp syndicate loans, and later tokenize the loans security tokens (stos). beyond this, there are many more use cases with the potential disrupt not only the energy and banking spaces, but many others well. furthermore, sap can easily implement this blockchain into their existing products and services for their customer base >,, making them immediately ready for blockchain use cases. therefore well positioned become the standard mainnet for business applications. lition highlights: offerin all sin esses eed lic rivat legal efficien frast your data kept

businesses, from small companies large corporations. our blockchain should the number one choice for any developer company seeking use blockchain technologies. lition white paper the blockchain infrastructure why blockchains miss mainstream adoption even though blockchains are regularly praised technology with the potential disrupt wide range industries like the internet did years ago, see limited mainstream adoption. very few distributed applications (dapps) have made into massmarket use, and large companies continue shy away from the technology. instead, see many proof-of-concept pilot projects that showcase the technology but never make the next step. leading tech companies have not begun pushing blockchain into the market. the reasons for this are both commercial/legal and technical. commercial legal reasons large-scale adoption new technical solutions comes primarily from established companies that already own the majority customer interfaces across industry sectors like technology, automotive, healthcare, finance, etc. these are typically large corporations that use specific frameworks order decide whether not roll out new technology their customers. block ain

has experienced first hand that there blockchain infrastructure available that fulfills the technical requirements needed for mainstream adoption outside very specific, niche use cases. instead,

efficient and scalab (near) infinit sid echains missing deletability and privacy figure technical reasons for low mainstream adoption blockchains these limitations largely explain why mainstream adoption blockchains has been slow, and why public attention has instead been driven cryptocurrency price developments and speculative use. lition's approach bring blockchain into mainstream use order bring blockchains into mainstream use, lition needs address the commercial and technical issues outlined above. many commercial issues cannot necessarily solved innovative but inexperienced players, lition has partnered with sap. the software giant sap the worldwide leader business software, with market capitalization $bn, over users from their customers and the power developers. with lition's extensive knowledge and experience from launching the world's first blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading application mass market, we're working together next-generation blockchain infrastructure. the lition/sap blockchain made specifically the standard blockchain infrastructure accepted big industry players and used any developer working dapp that serves mainstream market legally compliant way. lition white paper with the backing strong company like sap, and innovative privacy and deletability features, our new blockchain addresses many commercial issues outlined figure making lower-risk choice for corporate executives turn enabling mainstream adoption. more detailed description the partnership outlined separate section page addition the commercial purposes, the new blockchain specifically designed address the technical limitations outlined figure one integrated blockchain infrastructure. more specific, lition addresses six core infrastructural issues outlined figure along the existing live use case, shows the whole breadth all improved features within single customer journey. depending the use case the commercial blockchain applications, some all these features may needed. figure improvements new blockchain infrastructure, illustrated along existing peer-to-peer trading use case feature light client that can run iot devices many use cases require iot devices, e.g. sensors, appliances smart meters, used lition (see the smart metering section page today's blockchain clients which participate the network nodes always require significant storage and processing capacity. lition's current ethereum client from parity (parity.io), the most popular client use, requires over storage. even special clients like geth require storage their fast modes, dropping low for pruned (trimmed) clients only the most recent blocks are stored. pure light clients that only store block headers can down mb, but just like remote clients that don't require any storage, light clients not have access the data previous blockchain executions, which needed execute smart contracts and verify the correct execution network nodes. blockchain built for widespread commercial use therefore needs clients that can run thin hardware, such smart meters the control units the distribution grid's voltage regulators, while still calling and verifying the smart contracts they deploy. other industries face the same barriers with existing blockchains, for example banking with lightweight point-of-sales (pos) devices the automotive sector with connected cars, increasing relevance for such features beyond the energy space. see https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases lition white paper promising solution could provided slock.it, which piloting similar light client, but far limited the ethereum network with its corresponding shortfalls. feature low transaction costs high transaction costs caused low energy efficiency are common drawback typical blockchain implementations, with bitcoin the most prominent example. the existing energy use case, before migration lition's own platform, smart contract executions can cost usd depending ethereum's network congestion. this caused the high number hash computations that are required the network's proof-of-work (pow) consensus algorithm, which results extremely high energy consumption. bitcoin currently needs twh annually for its blockchain operate, amount energy equivalent the country colombia's annual energy consumption. lition, core value the sustainable use natural resources, and therefore pivotal that operate the most energy-efficient platform available. comparison, the ethereum blockchain consumes kwh/transaction, thus making times more energy efficient than the bitcoin network, which uses kwh/transaction. these numbers will further improve once ethereum developers switch from their current pow solution into proof-of-stake (pos) algorithm and vitalik buterin's work off-chain smart contracts with plasma released into production state. operate sustainably, lition aims reduce energy consumption, and thus cost per transaction, less than usd almost all modern infrastructure chains like nem, cardano, zipchain, hashgraph have developed solutions solve this issue with the many available open-source reference implementations. therefore, this issue has been solved. however, none these chains are additionally able solve the other drawbacks that concern businesses, like delectability storage private data separate but publicly verifiable sidechains. feature fast block confirmation currently, customers need wait well over minute before their transactions are successfully executed the ethereum blockchain. the underlying reason high block confirmation times seconds along with block height several blocks needed for certainty. many use cases require transactions finalized about seconds, lition pursuing protocol massively improve the block times for smart contract executions. with the issue high transaction costs, most modern chains have claimed find solutions this problem while staying permissionless. but the case with the transaction cost issue, they have not been able while also addressing other shortcomings, like private data. feature private sidechains for private data today, typical permissionless blockchains store their data publicly, potentially allowing criminals misuse this information, e.g. bank accounts social security numbers. the existing use case, this could smart meter data, e.g. availability electrical appliances, which could provide indication household income: customer possessing tvs, energy-efficient dishwasher, dryer and electric floor heater obviously wealthier than the average household. this all data that lition can already detect digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption plasma.io lition white paper today with its smart meter integration (see the use case section later this white paper for details), but customer would want this information publicly known. this aspect applies many industries, such (a) banking with personal loans and account transaction data, (b) construction with historic property data, (c) healthcare with medical patient data, (d) supply chain management with product, contract and origin data (e) social media with identity personal (meta)data. typical solutions propose achieving privacy putting private data public chain and encrypting it, suggested e.g. researchers karla kvaternik et. al.. lition aware that these solutions have fundamental limitations, the encrypted data still publicly available and therefore prone hacking vulnerabilities the encryption are found sufficient processing power available. this unlikely now, but the data stored permanently and publicly will still there years, when quantum computing set emerge and loopholes may found. this has happened many times far, e.g. for the widely used wep encryption, which due faulty design does not give reliable protection against hackers. instead, lition knows private data needs reside private sidechains available only trusted nodes. furthermore, public sidechains are still needed for public data, such the current energy prices power plants that must publicly available. both the private and the public sidechains need embedded greater public, permissionless network that new participants can easily join, ensuring easy and developer-friendly adoption the chain. solution the utilization probabilistic zeroknowledge-proofs shown the technical white paper. this would allow public nodes verify the private transactions inside private sidechains, ensuring overall consistency. feature api for chain backend communication for easy developer access during the development the energy trading use case, lition developers had spend great deal time and resources develop api interface that enables communication between the blockchain and the lition backend application. blockchain nodes need simple api interface allow easy integration into non-blockchain applications. this required business blockchain applications every industry that require integration into off-chain systems. this issue needs addressed order allow quick and easy rollout the lition blockchain solution into mass markets and additional use cases. typical large industry players have complex legacy landscape, making easy and seamless integration even more important. these findings are not new, corporate-targeted projects like nem sap's blockchain-as-a-service solutions have also identified this pain point, which must now addressed. however, neither nem nor sap's current solution able also solve the other issues that remain regulated markets. feature data can deleted from blockchain currently, transactions blockchains are permanently and irreversibly stored the blockchain. while this precondition any public chain, not necessarily the customer's best interest. ongoing business relationship, customer might accept that his social security number bank account needed, but want make sure this data deleted once the business relationship ends and the data longer needed. however, once customer terminates his contract, there currently way delete this sensitive data blockchains are not designed for this. most solutions today that support deletion data only store the references the blockchain, with the real data stored off-block. when private data needs deleted, the on-block reference kept see privacy-preserving platform for transactive energy systems, middleware', las vegas, nevada usa, arxiv.org/pdf/..pdf lition white paper unchanged, but the off-block data deleted. the problem with this approach that any smart-contract execution requiring private data needs access the off-chain resource, defeating the purpose blockchain. addition customer issues, there are also legal requirements from the gdpr (general data protection rules) effective throughout the eu, and many other national data-privacy guidelines. they enforce deletion private data once longer needed. the eu, violations this law can lead fines company's global annual revenue, which can hundreds millions dollars for large corporations. this has been the focus several press articles while this might not issue for proof-of-concept blockchain applications, will once application launches and brought commercial mainstream adoption. therefore, any business desiring share its blockchain application with on-block storage private data the masses needs use infrastructure supporting data deletion. the partnership with sap sap, the world's business software leader with over customers and developers, has signed co-innovation contract work with lition solving the limitations today's blockchain infrastructure, such privacy, speed and transaction costs. summary this cooperation outlined dr. jurgen muller, sap's chief technology officer (cto) the following interview: watch the interview with sap's cto explaining the cooperation at: https://youtu.be/lxpbrhptykk sap and lition believe that technical solution the issues limiting mainstream use will spur adoption blockchain and blockchain-influenced applications. this will benefit sap's customers and lition's public mainnet users alike. sap and lition are therefore cooperating design permissioned platform that focuses data storage and exchange, with layer for publicly verifiable claims, similar concepts described commonly zero-knowledge proofs. this will allow high throughput and low latency for the majority private transactions and public validation capabilities for select records. based this design, sap would leverage their existing database middleware expertise explore platform that incorporates pluggable verification layer. lition would provide decentralized consensus and verification mechanism tailor-made hold these publicly-verifiable claims, extending the capabilities identity-agnostic audience and thereby turning into public blockchain. this allows sap validate the concept backing records against public blockchain. meanwhile, lition can run its ecosystem the public segment the solution, where miners execute transactions and are compensated tokens similar today's ethereum see e.g. https://iapp.org/news/a/blockchain-technology-is-on-a-collision-course-with-eu-privacy-law/ lition white paper blockchain. sap can further integrate the blockchain into their existing product portfolio and offer their over customers. comparison with existing chains lition has conducted extensive discussions with leading experts order overcome the issues outlined the previous section. after researching dozens different chains, lition found many solutions almost every individual issue, but integrated, coherent

https://medium.com/lition-blog/a-legal-framework-for-blockchain-made-in-germany-with-the-help-of-startups-like-lition-aef lition white paper piloted use cases other energy sectors network effects the energy industry well suited benefit from certain characteristics blockchains, like immutability and direct connection between peers. many articles have stated that blockchain has the potential disrupt the energy sector, for example pwc describes multiple use cases their papers. the opportunities are widely recognized, but far there has only been progress pilot scale, e.g. the brooklyn microgrid which tests how blockchain technology can used affect direct neighbor-toneighbor sales solar energy. other pp-energy projects mvp pilot-scale include wepower, powerledger, restartenergy, verv and enosi. other applications like blockchain-based billing electric vehicle charging stations with motionwerk, certificate origin trading like solarcoin for electrify.asia are all the mvp/pilot stage. leading the frontier commercial readiness with proven peer-to-peer energy trading application with real customers and power plants, the lition blockchain infrastructure already has strong application

already signed and lined multiple international partners for this. more details can found this whitepaper's growth chapter. use cases for smart metering and energy-data-driven recommendations end-to-end transparency the guiding theme lition's core trading use case. using the blockchain-based lition energy exchange platform, consumers can now choose their preferred renewable energy producers. while this novel transparency the production side great, want take one step further and also bring this transparency households and businesses. this enables any energy retailers and smart meter providers using the technology offer additional services their customer base. the smart reader makes smart meter out our fuse box ... you know when and how much each device consumes the smartreader makes the household smart energy supplier using the lition energy ecosystem the depicted smartreader box installed next your bundles the product with its blockchain-based energy tariff, home's fuse box and connects the internet through current clamps, the device measures energy flow several thousand times per second detect appliances offering: itemized energy bill device time-sensitive tariffs more down payments only pay what used all smart home benefits provided the stand-alone box figure illustration the lition smart reader app this achieved installing smart reader, small device connected the internet via wi-fi cable connection, next the customer's fuse box. smart reader smart meter significantly lower cost. the smart reader measures energy consumption and sends the data privately the blockchain, effectively providing the same functionality smart meter fraction the cost. using mobile app, customers are able observe detailed real-time visualization the energy usage all their household's electrical devices utilizing energy disaggregation. customer can detect which appliances are currently active, e.g. washing machine, tv, fridge, etc., and review statistics the overall energy consumption kwh. the app further provides various smart home features, like safety alert when you've kept your oven for too long security alert device like light switched when you're not home. while these features are useful their own, bundling them with blockchain-based energy supply contracts offers additional benefits. using smart reader (equivalent smart meter but installed the fuse box) identify energy consumption individual household devices, supplier using this lition blockchain-based technology can offer itemized monthly energy bill. lition white paper this means instead charging estimated monthly down-payment based annual traditional meter readings, customers are charged the exact amount measured, and they benefit from further breakdown the bill for each detected device. this will provide full transparency consumers who want know their exact monthly cost per device. furthermore, consumers will able replace high energy-consuming devices with more energy-efficient appliances using our data-driven approach. such analysis and smart recommendations are additional services provide the future. there another major benefit having smart reader. accumulating the data received from thousands smart readers lition's customer households, energy retailers will able offer time-sensitive tariffs customers. with these tariffs, customers can save costs during off-peak hours e.g. the very early morning hours. these tariffs will also enable demand-shaping, customers will have incentive relieve the grid peak times and shift their load off-peak hours. germany, for example, only high-consumption customers (over kwh annual consumption) can benefit from lower off-peak prices now. moreover, reasonable product recommendations (e.g. new fridge aaa led-bulbs due high costs) based various partnerships are further potential revenue streams, while providing customers with recommendations for saving energy and money. this global marketplace for energy-data-driven, ai-generated product recommendations gives customers unique insights for the right appliance decisions. summary, the benefits are: smart affordable identifies your appliances and their energy consumption benefit from low market prices during off-peak hours pay only for energy that has actually been consumed receive product recommendations based your energy data save household

provides the daily energy quantity for blockchain-based energy trading. the additional benefits such device disaggregation are currently being implemented and will available the consumer the near future. make this use case possible, lition has partnered with the smart reader pioneer watty from stockholm, sweden. they are supplier smart reader devices and developer ai-based algorithms for device detection, and they are currently the market leader disaggregation technology. lition white paper use cases for electric vehicles the blockchain technology and the underlying lition token well positioned become the standard for charging electric vehicles and will highly impact worldwide desirability and usage e-mobility. background and challenges e-mobility due environmental problems and changes global outlook e-mobility, the market growing rapidly. based manufacturers' launch plans and expected penetration rates, the market potential for electric vehicles projected reach approximately usd billion which equivalent percent the global automotive market that year. global plug-in vehicle deliveries reached million units resulting sales volume higher than the growing number electric vehicles requires increasing number charging stations, and also increases the demand for electricity; the average electric vehicle consumes nearly much electricity four-person household per year. other words, electricity consumption per household doubles when electric vehicle purchased. with today's e-mobility infrastructure, drivers electric vehicles face three major issues when charging their vehicles: numerous payment systems for e-mobility solutions often make charging and payment for electric vehicles unnecessarily complicated for customers. pricing expensive, inconsistent and non-transparent. electricity prices vary more than between individual charging stations. buying electricity charging stations involves high-priced intermediaries and lacks transparency. again, large energy suppliers are hoarding the profits. www.atkearney.de/documents///emobility-the_long_road_to_a_billion-dollar_business.pdf/fbfd-c-c-b-db www.peakresources.com.au/news/global-plug-in-sales-for--q-and-the-full-year-prelim/ lition white paper contrary many customers' beliefs, green energy charging stations don't necessarily use green energy but often rely traditional local and nuclear energy sources. suppliers can free themselves their bad reputations obtaining easy-to-access and cheap green certificates. fact, electric vehicle can pollute much driving dirty combustion engine vehicle. lition's blockchain infrastructure foundation e-mobility the lition blockchain infrastructure the foundation solve these problems with its unique and globally adaptable blockchain approach. lition already partnering with leading charging operator with whom the use case will developed and then deployed their charging stations. the underlying blockchain infrastructure will the basis for this, which will result the following benefits for the consumer: convenience cost smart charge their electric vehicles any charging station use their existing individual record-low tariff save money when charging use their individual smart contracts within our end- to-end energy exchange platform charge their electric vehicles use their producer choice for charging their ev. this may the same producer they already selected for their electricity home completely new one. receive one bill for e-mobility and electricity earn money car used electricity storage while plugged drive with genuine green energy instead coal nuclear energy table benefits for consumers use cases for smart grids far, lition has commercialized one use case (pp energy trading) and actively developing three other use cases (e-mobility, smart metering and data recommendations) described above. top this, there are additional applications from within the energy sector for which lition actively looking for partners, with smart grids being one the most relevant. connecting customers and producers directly via lition's trading use case, transmission and distribution grid companies gain additional insights into their power flows. top this, lition's blockchain technology can support their businesses various ways: time-of-use pricing: reduce demand during high-cost peak usage periods, communications and metering technologies inform smart devices homes and businesses when energy demand high, and track how much electricity used and when. these technologies also give utility companies the ability reduce consumption communicating devices lition white paper directly order prevent system overloads. for example, utility could reduce the usage group electric vehicle charging stations shift temperature set points air conditioners city. motivate them cut back use and perform what called peak curtailment peak leveling, prices electricity are increased during high demand periods, and decreased during low demand periods. assumed that consumers and businesses will consume less during high demand periods possible for consumers and consumer devices aware the high price premium for using electricity peak periods. this could mean making trade-offs such cycling on/off air conditioners running dishwashers instead pm. when businesses and consumers observe direct economic benefit using energy off-peak times, chances are high they will include energy cost operation into their consumer device and building construction decisions. hence, they will become more energy efficient. energy pricing already defined blockchainbased pp-trading, time-based pricing logical and easy extension. distance pricing: applying the same principles for time-of-use pricing, distance between the power plant and the consumer can factored into customer pricing offered through the blockchain solution. customer chooses power plant close by, can save paying lower price compared power plant further away. reliability: the smart grid makes use technologies such state estimation which improves fault detection and allows for automated corrections the network without the intervention technicians. this will ensure more reliable supply electricity and reduced vulnerability natural disasters. blockchain provides the necessary infrastructure for this, including reliable source underlying data and verifiable transactions resolve issues. security: grids using the robust, tamper-proof lition blockchain will mitigate vulnerability terrorism cyberattacks because data and transactions are highly secured. with cyberattacks the rise worldwide, experts rate these features very important for the future. bi-directional energy flows: next-generation transmission and distribution infrastructure will better able handle possible bi-directional energy flows, allowing for not only distributed energy such from photovoltaic panels building roofs, but also the use fuel cells, charging to/from the batteries electric cars, wind turbines, pumped hydroelectric power, and other sources. classic grids were designed for one-way flow electricity, but local sub-network generates more power than consuming, the reverse flow can raise safety and reliability issues. smart grid aims manage these situations via lition's pp-trading solution the blockchain. the underlying energy flows are already contracted the blockchain, managing the physical flows the blockchain logical next step avoid data duplicity with single source truth. use cases for certificates origin the certificate origin (also guarantee origin) instrument that labels electricity from specific source, e.g. specific power plant certain type renewable energy generation through legal means (directive //ec europe. with this label, customers can certain the origin their electricity. operation, "green label" "tracker" guaranteeing that one mwh electricity has been produced from renewable energy sources. gos are traded. when company buys gos, documentation for the electricity delivered consumed, the gos are cancelled the electronic certificate registry. this single yih-fang huang; werner, s.; jing huang; kashyap, n.; gupta, v., "state estimation electric power grids: meeting new challenges presented the requirements the future grid," signal processing magazine, ieee vol., no., pp.,, sept. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:l lition white paper standardized instrument makes possible track ownership, verify claims and ensure that gos are only sold once and that there double counting. while this practice works theory, highly inefficient process with many intermediaries such the energy producer, its energy reseller with market access, the exchanges which certificates origin can traded, the distribution grid operator obtaining the certificate from the producer, and the transmission system operator invoicing the energy retailer, who eventually bills the customer. they all need trust each other, and they all need communicate. this conventional use case which the trustless, open nature blockchains, together with asynchronous encryption the point origin (the power plant), can simplify process taking out the many middlemen. customers are already trading energy with producers via the lition energy exchange, storing certificates origin the blockchain easy extension allowing for global scale. this way, the certificate origin does not have linked the physical energy delivery all. lition white paper use cases other industries fast transaction speeds aren't the only requirement all use cases; regulated businesses also require data deletion and truly private data. other current blockchain can fulfill these requirements outlined the previous chapters, lition's new blockchain infrastructure the solution choice for the disruption many additional use cases across multitude industries outlined figure

infrastructure selection some the potential applications detailed the section below. use cases for healthcare currently, medical patient data regarding diseases and insurance details are filed different places. when patient has settle insurance claims, she has collect and file all this data. with blockchain solution, this highly sensitive information can stored private sidechain for doctors and insurance companies during claim settlement. after the claim settled, the patient can with the new infrastructure delete the data the blockchain. thus, patients' privacy will kept secure all times and this complex process can managed efficiently. lition white paper use cases for pharmaceuticals data privacy crucial across the pharmaceutical industry. the research, development, and clinical testing data required for approval new drugs public institutions like the fda (food and drug administration), and private patient data concerning illnesses, medication, age, gender, and family medical history require absolute confidentiality. however, relevant parties still need access that sensitive information. with the new lition mainnet, confidential data will stored private sidechain, providing access involved parties, and allowing for deletion private patient data when longer needed. this will significantly streamline and further secure the entire approval process for new drugs. use cases for enterprise data management research recently predicted that the rapid digitization consumers' lives and enterprise records will increase the cost data breaches usd trillion globally data exchange between enterprises indispensable, privacy and security more than crucial. the lition mainnet offers exactly the features needed ensure privacy and security while effectively sharing data with the appropriate parties. confidential data stored private sidechains only accessible with private keys and deleted soon the data longer required. the functionalities decentralized data storage, limited availability private data and highly restricted access prevents data theft and sabotage. use cases for bond finance the worldwide corporate bond market requires myriad approvals (e.g. credit rating scores, balance sheets) and many middle men (for settlement, custody, etc.). the lition mainnet enables decentralized storage all prerequisites for loan, plus automated issuance using smart contract. after the bond has been issued, the beneficiary company can delete the data they longer need. bond financing can fully described within the public/private logic the lition mainnet, representing much faster, more reliable and cheaper way for companies issue bonds around the globe. use cases for purchasing/logistics the infrastructure the lition mainnet allows users publicly store material inventory data such stock items, certificates origin, quantities, prices, manufacturers and complaints. linking this information private sidechain with purchaser information can automate payment procedures, increase restocking efficiency, optimize transportation, and improve material quality and response supply and demand. but not all data these processes meant public; e.g. prices and demand. again, the advantage the lition mainnet the private/public logic the blockchain. use cases for automotive odometer manipulation major issue second hand car sales. even highly regulated countries like germany, police estimate odometer manipulation all second-hand cars sold, resulting annual damages for insurers between and billion euros. odometer levels are classified private data due the connection the car holder, they cannot currently publicly https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemorgan////cyber-crime-costs-projected-to-reach--trillion-by-/#dbaa https://global.handelsblatt.com/companies/protecting-used-car-buyers- lition white paper stored. with the lition mainnet, anonymous movement data can stored the private sidechain, ensuring privacy the vehicle holder, well fraud protection purchase via the public availability the car's history. additional car details regarding accidents, repairs, etc. may also shifted private sidechain and used settle insurance claims. again, upon the driver's request, personal data deletable when longer required. use cases for travel common search engines for hotels, flights, and rental cars operate middle men between the customer and partners the tourism industry, causing unnecessary costs both sides. with the lition mainnet solution, all offers can stored public blockchain. the customers' private information during the booking process (date travel, prices, bank data, etc.) held private sidechain, where payment procedures and travel details are kept anonymous and secure. request, data can deleted when longer required. use cases for sap customers even though this was only very brief description potential use cases, demonstrates the potential the lition mainnet nearly unlimited commercial and industry applications. sap already forms the it-backbone many modern enterprises and can integrate the blockchain into existing sap systems running more than companies with more than million users worldwide. this way, rapid market penetration inevitable. lition white paper partners lition backed major industry players the utility and finance sectors well specialized technology
