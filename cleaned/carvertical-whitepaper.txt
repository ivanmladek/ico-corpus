carvertical tokens securities? industry trends the team product development timeline for contributors subjective arguments proving why carvertical token valueis going grow the future overview [tl;dr] automotive market growing. aftermarket growing even larger extent. used vehicles change multiple owners and multiple countries. real vehicle history does not exist, because car data does not travel fast cars do. the lack trusted vehicle history generates perfect ecosystem for unfair practices, which turn generates false vehicle value. because false value and unreliable vehicle history data, insurance companies overcharge for taking risks, therefore consumers overpay for it. vehicles generate large amount data which monetized third parties. data owned its creator, hence vehicle owner the owner data generated their vehicle. however, today vehicle owner has real control over data the vehicle generates. collect vehicle history, store blockchain and give back the control the owner the vehicle. are building tools and products for vehicles generate more trusted data which then added blockchain. are creating incentive mechanisms for owners, that they could get value for data their vehicles generate. all data goes into creating trusted, tamper-proof, and decentralized vehicle history registry. using vehicle history are building decentralized mechanism for transparently calculating vehicle value. history, reports, and value calculations will sold parties need and vehicle owners, content creators, will rewarded. this will bring transparency and trust the used car market. which specific problems are addressing? scattered data vehicle data scattered across multiple sources and the only way get whole picture about true state the vehicle gathering piece piece. there are least primary car history parts: the accuracy odometer readings information about prior damage (as result various accidents) maintenance records the number previous owners the legal status vehicle (e.g. stolen) possible ownership restrictions (e.g. liens) archive photos each these parts scattered across number sources which, top that, differ depending country region. unwillingness disclose data limited availability information none the parties holding data about vehicles are willing disclose it. some data closely linked personal data, even though all can depersonalized. only vehicle owner has rights their data. unfortunately, this area, content creators have incentives get their data, they have use for it. this closely linked the fact that organizations holding automotive data not provide tools for data owners collect it. this yet another reason for today's multi-billion car fraud business. inter-country data loss absence synced regulations between countries organizations within country not have infrastructure share information real time. the situation even worse the inter-country scale. today's problems, economy, and used vehicle market are rapidly becoming more global. centralized organizations which hold important data cannot catchup with the fast progress globalization trends. result, every country (and every entity within the country) has its own rules for gathering and managing the data, and usually those rules are not aligned among different states. the time gap between deregistering vehicle one country and registering another usually marks grey area where previous accidents are hidden and mileages are clocked. various nature data makes difficult draw conclusions get market-specific insights every organization, entity, and country has different data formats. even basic units length have not been unified yet (germany has kilometers, the miles, sweden swedish miles). this creates even more difficulties unifying vehicle history today's global market. getting complete conclusions and insights practically impossible. unfair trade practices defined law, but hardly traceable terms timing there are laws protecting against these fraudulent and unfair practices. the same time these law enforcement agencies are being blocked simple lack trusted information. falsifying documents tampering the odometer can done much more quickly than can detected law enforcement. after these falsifications, vehicle sold and link between the fraud and the person who commits lost. lack trusted source for vehicle value today, there trusted way calculate vehicle value. vehicles are evaluated privately, with questionable data, and low accuracy people who mainly base their decisions personal experience. accuracy, transparency, and trust are vitally important this area lot expensive decisions are made according this number. deep dive into solution carvertical blockchain-based vehicle history registry. collect large quantity information from lot different trusted sources, organize the form records and store blockchain. then feed this information into our data analysis stack, which, using machine learning and advanced mathematical models, calculates the real value. most our elements will open sourced and our system will moving full decentralization preserve transparency. will incentivize and empower users easily collect and get rewarded for the data they own. they are content creators. data first there are three main data source categories: iot miners; data accessible only vehicle owner; trusted sources; iot miners are working with industry-leading iot device manufacturer create the version carvertical miner. installing these miners into your vehicle obd slot will generate stream real time information which will sent our data farm for processing. exchange, the owner miner will receive tokens reward. data accessible only vehicle owner there number data sources which can only reached vehicle owner. are working with advisors and partners create ways for users grant access such data exchange for tokens. primary sources such information are local registries. data will depersonalized, securely stored, and encrypted. not need personal data. only the data owner will able unlock and grant access such information exchange for tokens. this will allow user control and receive value for their information. every vehicle data exchange will have pass ethereum smart contract validated and unlocked. are using merkle tree with merkle reduce list store final state vehicle data ethereum. trusted sources most the vehicle history records are stored closed and private databases. are onboarding insurance, business fleets, state registries, classifieds, auctions, law enforcement agencies, and workshops open vehicle data for vehicle owners. such data exchange the best interest all parties: the owners who officially hold data and businesses that need this data benefit. all exchanges will done with carvertical token. vehicle value are building decentralized and open-sourced vehicle value calculation service. will use information owned users and will provide trusted, open, and collaborative source true vehicle value. this high demand lot service providers, such insurance companies, car mortgage providers, leasing services, and many more. frauds and inaccuracy are usually very expensive for such companies, while additional price usually overpaid customers. history reports and insights our system will examine vehicle's data, technical specifications, and other records, and provide the history details, insights, well future predictions for the vehicle. using these reports are bringing trust and transparency into today's chaotic, unfair and, very often, fraudulent secondhand vehicle market. business model one world one decentralized registry for all vehicles. this unprecedented case. are building company which will allow users truly own, control, and benefit from the data their vehicles generate. our company's healthy life cycle calculated the soft cap the ico etherium. this amount money could help safely build company and run for years only developing products. aim start revenue flow few months after close the ico with carvertical.reports (section .). another product carvertical.whitelabel (section will add income cash flow months after completing the ico and carvertical.api (section months. for detailed cash flow execution please check cash flow analysis (.). the main goal the ico: the hard cap etherium the most rational budget for our company's years runway with maximized marketing expenses. additional budget gives leverage onboard databases more different countries earlier and start selling our products these countries. producing car's history blockchain registry will enable our team build four different products which will fully utilize blockchain technology, the token our company, and will the core elements stable cash flow.
