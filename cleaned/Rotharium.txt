believe that the future internet technology. designed decentralized system, blockchain provides optimal basis for developing extraordinary, spectacular and user-friendly applications. our solution will connect blockchain with existing solutions create maximum benefits. achieve this, will develop decentralized business-to-consumer (bc) platform which will contain blockchain and additionally developed services for different types businesses. will call rotharium platform. our platform will the first blockchain system which allows direct interaction between consumers and business providers (without middleman) using blockchain-based interaction between applications, business services and common databases. design, our platform will also the first blockchain system which allows the integration legacy applications and databases. will help customers implement our solution interface between previously implemented solutions and save customers from investing the same amount money again. additional the decentralized blockchain platform, will also develop our own business applications. due the fact that our platform will support all models, the integration new business applications will extremely easy. help understand how our platform will help simplify business processes using blockchain, have provided detailed information for two business applications: booking app and sportsbook app. the developer crypto future gmbh (the developer) the company leading the rotharium project. the founders the developer have been the blockchain business since and have considerable experience this area. within the context the rotharium project, are leveraging our experience improve existing create new solutions which can used anyone the world. initial coin offering due the fact that are creating new solutions for the community, aim provide the possibility for the community part our project. will develop new crypto currency the ethereum network and create the possibility acquire our crypto currency for defined amount ether (the crypto currency ethereum). this whitepaper, you will find detailed description the so-called initial coin offering (ico) process, which explains how participate and part the rotharium project. blockchain background the development bitcoin core and the launch bitcoin digital payment system november are regarded the beginnings the blockchain technology. what blockchain generally does store data one decentralized database and prevent manipulation the data. data stored data blocks, which always contain information about the previous block. order have exact connection between the blocks, the system creates the hash value the previous block and saves this information the following block. the event data manipulation one block, the hash value the next block will automatically change and, therefore, the entire chain will change. although may seem that blockchain completely new technology, the blockchain principle has already been use for many years. good examples are enterprise resource planning systems, which store the entire accounting data company. the final balance based many transactions performed during the business year and, somebody were change only one the postings, the final sum would also change. the big difference between such systems and blockchain the access the data. while the accounting data company stored one central database and only permitted users can access the data, the data the blockchain stored the form decentralized database and everybody can see and check the data integrity. ethereum blockchain ethereum blockchain was described vitalik buterin late and implemented july introducing the ethereum blockchain, new crypto currency called ether was also introduced. ethereum blockchain distributed system and all participants the ethereum blockchain use peer-to-peer network transfer the data. order able so, the clients have full copy the blockchain. while bitcoin was designed used worldwide digital payment system, ethereum was developed platform for distributed apps. distributed apps are built so-called smart contracts. using smart contracts, developers can create new applications such virtual organizations, sports betting platforms, booking exchanges, document management systems, etc. using smart contracts create new apps the ethereum blockchain opens new possibilities for developers create extraordinary and spectacular applications. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bitcoin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethereum platform model the rotharium platform will have two primary layers: blockchain and services. order have full operating system, two additional layers are connected the platform: database and application. application app app app services rotharium blockchain rotharium services platform ethereum blockchain database private cloud figure platform model the main reason separating the application and database sections from the rotharium platform able create more flexible and reusable solution framework which can cooperate with different apps and databases. the rotharium platform intended provide easy integration and maximize the subsequent use legacy applications connecting these applications the blockchain. important notice: rotharium platform will collection development tools and program libraries needed implement foreign applications databases provided gpl-licensed sdk. applications additional the rotharium platform, will develop our own apps provide all the requirements for single business solution. far, have defined the functional design specifications for following apps: smart wallet app, sportsbook app, booking app, and storage app. are currently working the booking app. important notice: the applications connected the rotharium platform will enable normal users create smart contracts the blockchain! sophisticated knowledge will required. one additional reason for placing the application section top the rotharium platform because plan create solution delivery platform which useable also with existing customer applications. this means that company already has app for its specific business, our platform will provide integration interfaces allow the integration the app. services the main purpose platform services support interconnection between apps, the blockchain and databases. some cases, the entire business logic can simple that additional services are needed and the apps work directly the blockchain. business requirements are complex and require considerable computing resources, the business logic will created the services section, that applications can run faster and the user app experience not affected the business logic. far, have completed the functional design specifications for the following services: encrypted protocol and data management service. blockchain all the advantages the blockchain (decentralization, smart contracts, data integrity, etc.) will considered that can reduce additional development work the service section. depending the functional specification and the business requirements, the decision which part the solution created the blockchain will made case-by-case basis. database create boundless platform which capable being used for various business requirements, there should not restriction how save critical data. our platform will support common cloud-based and on-premise database solutions. application can work without storing the data, the solution can also implemented without database. rotharium applications and services this section, will provide detailed description the booking app. other applications like sportsbook app and storage app are working similar way, that these apps can build the same rotharium platform and some platform services can used for those applications too. booking app ... requirement problem consumer: good platforms for hotel bookings provide incredibly high number hotels and rooms. however, you have specific wish: hotel with pool and gym, the city center, and not far from the next underground station, you have set search filters and check the availability and rate. some cases, you will find suitable rooms, available the time you would like travel, but the rate too high. unhappy with the rate, you start change the search filters: remove the pool and check again; remove the gym and check again, etc. the search not immediately successful, you will probably try the next day, the day after and on. business: all hotels set their room rates according their pricing strategy. they can reduce the rates too many rooms are not booked, but they can also increase the rate case high demand. companies can collect and analyze user data order able create appropriate offers, but they can't exactly say how much consumers are willing pay. some cases, hotels react too late and rooms remain unused. ... solution means our booking application, will reduce the time necessary find appropriate hotel room. the user will able set the search filter within seconds, define the rate they are willing pay and send the information the blockchain. soon suitable room available, the smart contract will execute the room reservation and send confirmation the consumer. this could happen just few seconds after the reservation request, but can also happen hours later the user doesn't have online all the time. the advantage for the hotels (business) will that they are able see all reservation requests with the exact rate the customer willing pay (please read section ... booking exchange). the event that only few rooms are booked, hotels can reduce the rate match the requirements customers. there match, the rotharium platform will confirm the reservation request and the customer (consumer) will receive written confirmation. detailed descriptions both processes can found the next page: figure rotharium platform for travel booking application many consumers open application (on smartphone, tablet pc) define filters, set the price and confirm rotharium platform creates smart contract the blockchain with defined information from consumer smart contract information automatically forwarded

match, rotharium platform service creates reservation (c) rotharium platform executes the smart contract and forwards written confirmation business/consumer important notice: booking app can used for any type reservation: table reservations restaurants, car reservations rent-a-car providers, flight reservations, etc. interfaces provided the rotharium sdk will allow easy integration foreign booking applications (or just reservation forms) into our booking system. have learned the blockchain section, information stored the blockchain decentralized and unchangeable. however, the smart contract (reservation request/offer) defined and saved the blockchain, what happens the consumer business would like change/cancel the reservation request offer? solution: some parameters can changed this permitted the original code! one method could assign the logic code the library and use the callcode function call the code located specified updatable address. means this method, two versions the data exist. "starting with the ethereum homestead release, there now delegatecall opcode. this allows you essentially forward calls separate contract while maintaining msg.sender and all storage. for example, you could have contract that maintains the same address and storage, but forward all calls address stored variable". figure smart contract.sol see below for extract from the ethereum homestead release: "eip delegatecall: add new opcode, delegatecall xf, which similar idea callcode, except that propagates the sender and value from the parent scope the child scope, i.e. the call created has the same sender and value the original call. this means contracts can store pass through information while following msg.sender and msg.value from its parent contract. great for contracts which create contracts but don't repeat additional information which saves gas." https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions//upgradeable-smart-contracts http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/the-homestead-release.html#milestones-of-the-ethereumdevelopment-roadmap ... booking exchange provide overall solution, will also develop completely new booking exchange, which will become part the booking app solution (e.g.: this exchange could placed www.bc-exchange.com and have different blockchain booking areas for hotel bookings, car rentals, table reservations, storage bookings, etc. every type reservation one place). the one hand, this new exchange will show all business offers (hotel rooms, restaurant tables, rental cars, etc.). the other, consumers will see all reservation requests. our booking exchange will work similar way exchange for crypto coins, but with one key difference: exchanged goods are not coins, but booking assets (rooms, cars, tables, etc.). the visibility the offers and requests mentioned above will help businesses change their offers time there risk having unreserved assets. also, consumers will have better overview business offers and can place new orders they have changed their opinion (e.g. are willing pay higher rate/price). our booking app will automatically connected our booking exchange and all offers and requests will visible there. for exchange maintenance and support reasons, will charge successfully executed bookings with maximum the booking amount and the payment transacted our crypto currency. (other booking platforms charge between and %). ... business model for booking app and booking exchange the travel and tourism industry one the world's largest industries, with global economic contribution (direct, indirect and induced) over trillion u.s. dollars the direct economic impact the industry, including accommodation, transportation, entertainment and attractions, was approximately trillion u.s. dollars that year. number countries, such france and the united states, are consistently popular tourism destinations, but other, less well-known countries are quickly emerging order reap the economic benefits the industry. present more concrete example how the booking app and related booking exchange will generate income, will take the priceline group (products: booking.com, priceline.com, agoda.com, rentalcars.com, etc.) with revenues billion usd and net income billion usd basis. consider just priceline group's revenue the goal for our booking exchange, are talking about million usd. since all the major booking providers charge between and commission per booking, depending the location, number rooms, room rate, and competition the area, will provide booking exchange with lower commission fees (%). for all business users which use our crypto currency for fee payments, will charge just the one hand, this approach course reduces the revenue, but creates incentive use our booking exchange. business customers can save (if the maximum fee and provide booking assets with lower rates/prices for the end customer. the other, will create additional demand for the rotharium coin. instead paying bitcoin ether, users (businesses) can just the conversion the rotharium coin, pay the exchange fee and https://www.statista.com/topics//global-tourism/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_priceline_group save additional rotharium coin demand would also support the increase the rotharium coin price the future. smart wallet app our vision that, the future, everybody will have smart wallet and will use online when shopping and paying for all online services. doesn't matter whether they are buying books, making hotel reservations, booking flights, paying for storage space sportsbook betting, our smart wallet will enable every user completely replace hard wallet. combination with the rotharium platform, the relevant amount will automatically credited/debited your smart wallet. our smart wallet used connection with the rotharium platform, will use encrypted protocols ensure secure communication between the application, services and database. sportsbook app the main difference between existing betting applications and our sportsbook application will the decentralization. decentralized platform like blockchain, odds can communicated without middleman. consumer: instead using credit cards, bank account consumers will use the smart wallet place bets the betting platform. business: the betting provider will have direct relationship with the consumers (via the blockchain and their smart wallet), that the risk losing customers' money data will dramatically reduced. figure sportsbook process current process: the left-hand side figure you can see the current process for sportsbooks. using credit card, consumers can transfer amount money from their bank account the account the sportsbook portal. with this starting balance, consumers can place bets and wait for the result. there win, the consumer's account the sportsbook portal will credited with the relevant amount. blockchain solution process: the right-hand side figure you can see the blockchain solution process for sportsbooks. due the fact that the consumer already uses smart wallet (e.g.: buy books the internet, for reserving hotels and flights, etc.), the consumer can use the same smart wallet for placing bets the sportsbook platform. doing so, the consumer creates smart contracts and forwards these smart contracts the blockchain platform. when the bets are concluded, smarts contracts are executed and the amount money from winning smart contracts credited the consumer's smart wallet (wager win) and the money from losing smart contracts credited the smart wallet the sportsbook provider. the advantage for the consumer that, after bets finish, the money always sent back smart wallet and therefore available for other payments, not only for sportsbooks. the provider has the advantage not being responsible for the money which not used for bets. (under existing solutions, the provider responsible for the money until transferred back the bank account). annex: you can imagine, considerably more services and interfaces are needed provide the full blockchain sportsbook solution (figure shows just extract the full sportsbook processes). our rotharium platform will provide the basis for such services and interfaces. our platform will allow the adding functions, services and interfaces meet the requirements further applications. however, very important mention that the completion one application (e.g. booking app) and related services and interfaces for this app, will not mean that the services for other applications are necessarily also completed. each app has its own specific requirements, further services and interfaces might necessary order able create other applications (e.g. sportsbook app). storage app when you have some property that you don't use every day and you don't have enough space your home flat, you may store them storage space provided space providers. consumer: avoid some unnecessary steps, our application will provide the option reserve suitable storage space online and perform the related payment using the smart wallet. business: with additional hardware devices (mounted directly the door), access the storage area can controlled via the smartphone application (qr code), that consumers can use the storage space immediately after online reservation. staff will needed hand over the key the key will the consumers device. the advantage using blockchain smart contracts that smart contracts are designed automatically initiate transactions when conditions are fulfilled. manual intervention needed. our use case, long the contract not canceled the consumer business party, the smart contract will initiate daily/weekly/monthly payments (money transfers from the consumer's smart wallet the smart wallet the business partner) and access the storage space will granted. the payment not possible, the smart contract will lock the space and the consumer will not able access their storage area. also such cases there will need involve the staff the business party. the only thing the consumer should transfer some money their smart wallet and initiate the payment. this action will automatically unlock the door and the consumer can remove items and cancel the contract keep using the storage space. the only reason for the business party some manual work when the consumer unable pay and, after defined period, clear and clean the space. encrypted protocol service achieve maximum security for users the rotharium platform, will develop our own encrypted transfer protocol. data management service some business processes, basic data (e.g. customers, items, assets, etc.) must saved permanently. cases where data should not visible everyone (e.g. customer data the sportsbook application), data will stored common database solutions provided the business party. this database can cloud-based on-premise solution. order able use common database solutions, the rotharium platform will provide the necessary data management services and interfaces. rotharium token name, symbol
