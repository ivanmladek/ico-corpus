bluepaper actinium building and supporting the lightning network contents who are goals technology specifications mining mobile applications hardware wallets electrum support tor integration zerocash zerocoin stealth addresses lightning network lightning network mobile wallets links who are actinium began hobby project, designed written single developer. this project was created mainly provide direct competition the overwhelming influx scams, shady developers, and blatant abuse open-source technology. the actinium network was launched april th, with pre-mine, pre-sale, founders rewards, and the development team owns significant share (acm) coins. the actinium development team has always been--and will always be--publicly visible. actinium leverages the latest bitcoin and litecoin codebases with specific focus the perpetual development future technologies and the empowerment users through intuitive user experience. actinium provides stability against volatile speculation through our highly-motivated development plan that prioritizes longevity over short-term price action. actinium was created for everyone because believe that people who collectively determine the value things. therefore, cryptocurrency must work for everyone order any value. the actinium team takes pride offering truly ethical, motivated, and technologically advanced cryptocurrency. goals paper wallets address-generators mobile wallets for android ios hardware wallet integration electrum servers clients tor integration segwit bech addresses lightning network atomic swaps smart contracts exchanges education blockchain technology, security, and lightning network technology the actinium codebase built using the litecoin code and follows the bitcoin development branch. the actinium development team continuously integrates the latest blockchain technology features like segregated witness, bech addresses, tor, and much more. actinium actively implementing second layer solutions such lightning network developing porting tools for stable, simple on-boarding and adoption. actinium has successfully integrated tor libraries because firmly believe privacy and anonymity must available every cryptocurrency user via user-friendly applications. maintaining the safety and security all user(s) funds the utmost importance. thus, actinium has full hardware wallet compatibility with ledger nano and ledger blue. (pending the approval the ledger co.) actinium aims support many different miners possible, therefore, use the gpu-friendly lyraz algorithm that works effectively with both nvidia amd cards. further secure the network actinium utilizes the lwma our preferred difficultyadjustment algorithm. specifications launched: april fair launch: premine, airdrop, ico, "founder rewards" mining: pow with gpu (nvidia amd) algorithm: lyraz since block maximum supply: coins block reward: acm halving every blocks (approx. every years) block time: .minutes segwit: active since block bech addresses: supported prefix acm lwma difficulty retargeting adjustment algorithm since block tor integration: activated with single parameter since version ... mining actinium uses lyraz proof-of-work algorithm. advantages lyraz: energy efficient algorithm keeps gpu cards from overheating lowers efficiency-gap between amd and nvidia gpus. currently asic, fpga, botnet resistant lwma difficulty readjustment algorithm advantages lwma: proven more effective stabilizing hash-rate than the -block algorithm used litecoin bitcoin. readjusts the difficulty every block; taking into account the calculations the last blocks reacts quickly large spikes hash-rate. mobile applications actinium mobile wallet available for android ios coming soon! the iphone version currently development. hardware wallets actinium compatible with ledger nano and ledger blue. have successfully completed tests our integration code. awaiting ledger hq's final approval. electrum support make using blockchains easier for our users operate specialized electrum servers that support actinium also offer alternative electrum spv wallet. tor integration actinium has supported the tor anonymity protocol since v.... activate tor, users need only enter single parameter into their configuration file everything else will done automatically. additionally, support pluggable transports ensure censorship resistance against high-level tor traffic blocking systems. zerocash, zerocoin, and stealth addresses actinium currently testing the zerocoin, zerocash, and stealth addresses. the zerocash zerocoin protocols help anonymize user transactions making the actinium blockchain impervious chain-analysis. zerocash enables confidential transactions creating specialized actinium coins that obfuscate any-and-all transaction data including transaction amounts, sender/ receiver identification information, and more. zero-knowledge proofs confirm the validity confidential transactions without revealing any details. stealth addresses prevent any possible public association transaction with recipient's wallet address. they conceal actual destination addresses thereby hiding the receiver's identity actinium's network. lightning network actinium's main priority facilitating the adoption the lightning network. support segwit, necessary protocol for lightning network. also have activated our own lightning network that based c-lightning bolt implementation. https://ln-explorer.actinium.org lightning network mobile wallets support the spark-wallet, mobile wallet available for web, android, and ios. visit our wiki for detailed information how install your device. links https://actinium.org https://github.com/actinium-project https://github.com/actinium-project/actinium/wiki https://paperwallet.actinium.org https://faucet.actinium.org https://explorer.actinium.org https://explorer.actinium.org https://ln-explorer.actinium.org
