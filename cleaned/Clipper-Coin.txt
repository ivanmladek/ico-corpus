exponentially the scale token launches recent years has increased exponentially. according tokendata, financing from token launches surpassed billion usd nearly larger than the million during the same period, the instances token launches grew the past three years token launch data can seen below: total financing (usd) yoy growth token launch instances yoy growth market participants have historically seen high returns. token launches have generated average roi exceeding that bitcoin (.x) and ether (.x). clipper coin capital clipper coin capital declining market trust token launches give smaller companies the same financing opportunity larger companies and not require excessive information disclosure. however, too limited information disclosure can harm the crypto market. investors may have difficulty judging the accuracy digital currency project, leading mixed crypto project quality. excellent projects can further improve blockchain technology and promote market player interests. contrast, poor quality projects will hinder the development the blockchain and bring market player losses. poor quality projects lack real business support while launching "empty coins" raise money fraud. "empty coins" continue flood the market, investors will lose confidence token launches and general crypto market investment. new token launches seek the reputation and support market leaders improve their project credibility. this marketing tactic can effective, however, lack systematic nature. furthermore, market leaders are not always able fully understand and authenticate every project seeking their support. this leads severe market credit deficiency. token sales challenge vcs token sales originated from stock market ipos and were originally meant crowdfunding for blockchain technology projects. recently, token sales have extended other areas, becoming many startup companies' preferred method financing. from its popularity has increased pace from fast frenzied. according smith crown, the record for financing set eth has repeatedly been broken since the beginning token sale scales have increased exponentially total financing september alone exceeded million, with total investment value $,.m, quickly closing traditional investment totals $,m. clearly, token sales may quickly become startups' preferred financing method; such, will adversely impact many traditional investment banking services. clipper coin capital challenges vs. opportunities crypto and traditional finance informational asymmetry the early crypto market participants were technical and idealistic. however, the recent market expansion has attracted more speculators. such, many current crypto projects are opaque and subject manipulation. decentralization vs. intermediation blockchain technology enabled the crypto market become decentralized. however, decentralized market may suffer from two challenges: lemons markets and high matching costs. george akerlof won nobel prize economics for paper that articulated the "market for lemons" problem, pinpointing quality uncertainties and market mechanisms through the analogy used car market. akerlof observed phenomenon which asymmetric information between car buyers and sellers disproportionately hurt high-quality sellers buyers bid the average sellers' offers. the long run, high quality assets, which possess higher inherent value than average market prices, eventually withdrew from the market while low quality assets flooded the market. reducing informational asymmetry was the solution. clipper coin capital akerlof also observed that, without informational intermediaries, matching costs rose exponentially with each new market entrant. result, traditional financial markets introduce intermediaries form two-tiered system reduce matching costs from exponential linear growth, thereby facilitating effective matching structure. ratings agency reducing informational asymmetry the solution. defined market structure, the introduction informational intermediaries can counter informational asymmetry and reverse market adverse selection. different markets have different informational intermediaries. for example, the real estate market, there are realtors; financial markets, there are ratings agencies help investors understand investment standards. these intermediaries can carry out enhanced due diligence, thus reducing informational asymmetry. providing open platform for sharing information another form informational intermediation. yelp great example this type platform through understanding previous consumers' experience, the user can make informed restaurant selection. opportunity: clipperx rating agency through launching clipperx rating, ccc will become crypto market informational intermediary, restoring confidence market participants. clipperx rating has two forms intermediation. first, clipperx rating will establish standardized rating system collect information ico projects. clipperx rating will integrate manpower with computing rate cryptos and provide objective project evaluations. second, clipperx rating will develop community forum and pricing market, enabling common investors participate the judgment and rating projects. this 'collective wisdom' will increase price discovery, information sharing, and ultimately create objective and subjective project judgment process. crypto market needs professional financial services speculation and high volatility the current crypto market dominated speculators. compared traditional financial markets, crypto markets are shallow and have high turnover. additionally, cryptos are difficult price and lack reliable information. many market participants focus short-term speculation, thus inducing strong price fluctuations. need professional asset management services the expansion the crypto market attracts many with inadequate risk tolerance, thus further exacerbating the market bubble. the inevitable collapse the bubble may lead large losses for investors. opportunity: clipperx capital brokerage clipperx capital broker-dealer the clipperx platform combining crypto and traditional financial products, and offers professional investment research, market making, and asset management services: clipper coin capital investment research: the current crypto market needs professional financial institutions offer long-term independent research, data analysis, and reporting better inform investors, provide checks and balances for the crypto market, and promote the healthy development the entire market. market making: the introduction market makers will improve market efficiency and reduce price volatility through arbitrage. market makers can provide additional liquidity through active market making and increase price discovery efficiency. asset management: most investors lack time and energy understand the crypto market well personal risk tolerance. asset managers can understand client needs, identify individual risk tolerance, and provide professional investment services. broker-dealers offer diversified portfolio services, including: investment advisory, private accounts, hedge fund services, and etfs. service the essence that promotes healthy financial market. this not only true traditional financial, but also crypto markets. token sales need investment banking services with the growth the crypto market, many startups are turning token sales new funding channel. some vcs are beginning explore crypto investing and models increase the efficiency early-stage investments. crypto investors, white papers contain project information completed the project team. however, token sales are mixed bag. many white papers contain attractive formatting and strong marketing tactics, but lack substance, resulting "empty token." the project team often lacks the financial experience complete token sale. they need assistance with industry research, financial advisory, legal and compliance, and marketing. furthermore, token pricing usually arbitrary, lacking proper pricing mechanisms that reflect market supply and demand. opportunity: clipperx investment bank clipperx investment bank will provide professional investment banking services the token sales market: token investors: clipperx investment bank will review the project's white paper, perform due diligence, conduct industry research, and make recommendations. token projects: clipperx investment bank will provide industry research, financial advisory, legal and compliance, and marketing services. token market: clipperx investment bank will introduce nobel-winning auction pricing mechanism, vickrey auction, promote effective market pricing the token sale market. the regulatory framework for token sales currently lags behind market development. blockchain projects are difficult govern, particularly because their boundaryless nature. introducing market intermediaries, like investment banks, will provide reliability and self-governance the market. clipper coin capital just consumers trust amazon filter retailers, list premium products, and reject the subpar, investment banks would provide similar services for token sale projects. furthermore, receiving project tokens partial service fees, investment banks would align their interests with market participants and further incentivized bring only the best projects market thereby increasing the quality and reputability token sales through pseudomarket governance. clipper coin capital clipper coin capital vision clipper coin capital

unprecedented prosperity. beginning with markowitz great minds like sharp, fama, and black have transitioned the art finance into modern science. the modern financial theory entered wall street and revolutionized traditional market practices. the team clipper coin capital has been pioneering the utilization science and technology traditional financial markets and will now apply the crypto market. clipper coin capital vickrey auction mechanism token sales parallel ipos terms central pricing principles; therefore, investor preferences are generally more difficult determine with current pricing mechanisms. low market efficiency and transparency, and conflicts interest between investors and firms have all been detrimental market equality and investor participation. clipper coin capital integrates the "vickrey auction" mechanism into token sale pricing structures cater blockchain's spirit decentralization while increasing market efficiency. the key points vickrey's auction mechanism include: for the seller, the highest price and second highest price are equivalent; for the buyer, the bidding price closer the psychological value. there advantage for anyone submit bidding price that more less than what they are actually willing pay, whereas first-price auction, the buyer trying guess what everyone else willing pay and submit bid that slightly higher than the next. result, our bidding cost lower than that other auction mechanisms. clipper coin capital clipperx rating clipperx rating agency that uses modern portfolio theory analyze and rank listed cryptocurrencies and ico project tokens with the objective providing high sharpe ratio investment portfolio advice. since the development the crypto market, more than thousand cryptos have launched, with uncountable more launching every day. many these projects, unfortunately, are simply tricks obtain financing without actual content. the teams and projects have countless flaws, and after icoing, effort used progress with the project. the goal clipperx rating find the next blockbuster coin while promoting the market's overall healthy development. there are still major problems with current crypto evaluations. ratings are insufficiently objective, overly rely experts, conflicts interest, etc. clipperx rating will combine the high efficiency robots with the professional background ccc's team provide timely and effective evaluation crypto projects. furthermore, the introduction independent experts will not only greatly broaden the bandwidth rating capabilities, but also allows comprehensive evaluation projects experts different backgrounds. clipperx rating will simultaneously release "expert ratings" alongside "community ratings" provide comprehensive project judgments. clipperx rating system the purpose clipperx rating establish simple and transparent evaluation system for investors identify problem projects and choose quality cryptos. the clipperx rating system divided into six levels abcdeu. abc are investment grade, are junk grade, and unrated. rating category definition gold chips hard currencies the crypto market blue chips strong project, good project development, stood the test time. has long-term growth potential new chips good project and solid team with growth potential. early stage, yet time tested trouble chips delayed project, team conflicts, other challenges. has potential for improvement bad chips project team with exaggerated claims, plagiarism, fraudulent behavior. project discontinued team dysfunctional unrated unrated clipper coin capital clipper coin capital clipperx rating factors operating time: a-grade cryptos have been widely recognized the market, and usually have existed for more than few years. b-grade have existed for while, project development has been smooth, high liquidity secondary markets, and still have room for growth. c-grade have project and team potential but are relatively young cryptos. project: projects are crucial rating the development potential cryptos. determines the initial rating for crypto and will continue affect its prospects. experts will evaluate crypto projects through its white paper, proposals, and team interviews. large factor there any plagiarism, forgery, exaggerations, and logic found within the project. team: project teams are another critical factor. experts will interview and track project teams evaluate their ability meet deadlines, stability, and investigate there are any inconsistencies between claimed qualifications/abilities and reality. technology: technology the foundation any crypto project. experts will evaluate through open source code and project documents github. for young projects, the integrity code and documents top concern, while more mature projects will judged the development the project community, developer feedback, and project efficiency. business strategy: business strategy mainly examines project's executability and development plan. for application projects, business strategy the most important factor ratings. clipperx rating and experts will continuously collect project plans and implementation results carry out statistical analysis and, ultimately, provide rating. risk compliance: clipperx rating's legal team will conduct risk compliance evaluation for different projects. crr will evaluate project's competitive differences, innovation, and regulatory environment. this factor will not directly affect project's rating. development status: project's development status the primary factor consideration for mature projects. particularly, experts will consider the progress project submissions, quantity project customers/users, commercialization, and profitability. factor inspection: experts will have checklist objective project elements verify. project missing any factor, its overall score will reduced. clipper coin capital clipperx rating man machine analysis the crypto market rapidly developing with further room grow. there are considerable amounts coins and huge growth potential. however, current entirely dependent inefficient human evaluation find coins with value. therefore, clipperx rating combining machine power with manpower increase rating efficiency. clipperx rating will develop ddbot review project information. any potential issues that are found will reevaluated clipperx rating's team experts, then communicated project teams for response. through this approach, clipperx rating strikes balance between efficiency and accuracy, experts and project teams. ddbot data services the crypto market are still immature. the proportion structured data far lower than that mature financial markets and its quality uneven, mostly written materials like white papers. time limited resource; the amount required comprehend white paper may lead reader negligence miscomprehension. through natural language understanding technology, especially semantic recognition, ddbot can quickly handle large-scale text and capture the emphasis and insights articles. clipperx rating uses ibm watson discovery, natural language understanding's (nlu) natural language technology batch process white papers and other text materials, achieve rapid evaluation projects. ddbot clipperx rating's intelligent robot based the capabilities ibm watson natural language understanding and the google search functions. ddbot can sift through the natural language text media reports, white papers, and social media debates identify potential plagiarism, fraud, exaggeration, and deceptive behavior. most deceit white papers manifests the following ways: stolen content. even quoted, does not show the origin. buzzwords are listed together with explanation between them and the other words/token project. empty conversation about big data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, without solving practical issues. team members seemingly have association the industry project. ddbot cannot solve all problems, but can assist quickly discovering falsifications white papers and other information disseminations. the ddbot workflow includes two aspects: white paper content analysis team analysis ddbot will fragment all important sections the white paper. text decomposed into smaller segments and charts are extracted. ddbot uses google services its backend and sends text into google's anti-plagiarism service while images are sent google's pattern search engine for inspection. once content discovered repeated, review will begin. clipper coin capital once the white paper complete, ddbot will scan team member information. for each team member, ddbot will use google query the member's background information- what accomplishes they have the field, etcand analyze the intersections between previous experience and the current project. will ultimately output score. ddbot will use ibm watson nlu capabilities extract features from and score important sections the white paper. team member information also characterized and graded. ddbot will then compare the two scores and ultimate judgment made. for example, team members not have similar experience their current project and they have never collaborated together, the credibility such project would quite low. identify problematic projects, that is, distinguish between and d-grade projects, clipperx rating uses big data and machine learning approach analyze and verify information. and d-grades can difficult distinguish the clipperx rating system; requires identifying which portion projects are more likely falsified while also trusting project teams provide this information. such, clipperx rating will train ddbot with projects that have been proven deceivers. more projects are evaluated, ddbot will become incrementally more intelligent, ultimately identifying false projects more quickly and accurately. simultaneously, will also gradually build large data system projects draw upon and complete more comprehensive data support. expert examination clipperx rating will use industry, technology, and financial experts build upon ddbot's preliminary results and review the project full. clipperx rating experts will include both inhouse and externally approved blockchain, finance, and other industry experts. clipperx rating will avoid excessively subjective judgment project's technological structure, business plan, implementation process, and team; however, will search for instances plagiarism, fraud, exaggeration, and fraud. clipper coin capital clipperx rating will hold telephone interviews with crypto tycoons, cornerstone investors, and project advisors verify their partnership with the project and understand the terms agreement between both parties. questions and concerns will communicated and further investigated. clipper coin capital project feedback during the grading process, clipperx rating will communicate with the project team and provide sufficient time respond inquiries and modify, improve, even withdraw project information. this ensures fairness and impartiality within the evaluation system. when project teams have concerns about ratings results, they can clarify points weakness through the clipperx rating response system and provide clarification material. clipperx rating will reexamine the case and, the clarifying material deemed sufficient, will adjust the token's rating and file the new materials. deemed insufficient, clipperx rating will provide updated feedback the project team and await their continued feedback. cryptobase clipperx rating will catalogue all information database for later inquiries, like crushbase the industry. the information stored this database will serve the benchmark for all ratings. cryptobase will record project team members' blockchain career paths, project investor occupational movements, and career verification blockchain advisors. through this information, investors can understand team members' historical projects, advisor experience and relation projects and team, and overall experience all market players. cryptobase will reduce the difficulty conduct product evaluation and investment decisions. clipper coin capital clipperx rating information market the clipperx rating information market information platform for all crypto market players. clipperx

investment-grade cryptos (abc), according individual risk appetites. for beginner crypto investors, "digital gold" coins are preferred investment mediums. for those seeking higher growth potential but lack time play the market, "blue chip" etf recommended. find the next blockbuster coin, invest "emerging" coins high risk for high profit. however, clipperx rating strongly recommends avoiding "problematic" and "avoid" cryptos. when joining the clipperx rating information market, investors will receive cccx incentive participate community activities purchase products/services the marketplace. project issuers project issuers can establish individual project communities the clipperx rating information market. project teams can display project information, invite clipperx rating
