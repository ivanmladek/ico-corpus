asch chain technology co. ltd introduction the emergence bitcoin makes possible decentralized currency system. after several years development, has been found that the block chain technology bitcoin has great potential and can widely used all walks life. order make better use the block chain technology, there appears number application platforms represented ethereum, which encapsulate the underlying protocol and build the infrastructure provide the developer with more friendly and more flexible interface, making the developer focus the business logic and improve the development efficiency greatly. the asch system introduced this paper also development platform for decentralized application, the following part will elaborate the characteristics, principles and application scenarios asch system. overview decentralized application decentralized application has following features: the application must completely open-sourced and run autonomously, which means should not tampered any centralized organization, institution individual. can revised respond the market requirements, but the revision must recognized all users. the application data should stored distributed network that has secure, open, and redundant order avoid data manipulation and single node failure. application users need tokens access, and application contributors can get tokens rewards. beijing asch chain technology co. ltd the application must apply value-proved cryptographic algorithm generate tokens. the centrality application can invest the development the application authorizing stakeholders the system, thus providing the potential for self-sufficiency. these kinds application also have the advantages such publicity, security, and need trust. therefore, not strange that decentralized applications will have promoting prospectin following fields: payment, data store, cloud computing, e-business, and etc, and even possible that the value created those applications will exceed the market value giant international company such visa, dropbox, amazon. about sidechain blockchain well-ordered collection data blocks generated using cryptographic algorithm. each block data contains amount network transaction information which used validate the authenticity, well generate the next block. normal user looks like public ledger which every single transaction will recorded, and anapplication developer looks like distributed database, which features are decentralized, open, selfautonomy, and tamper-resistant. the blockchain presents very tight relationship with decentralized application which makes very suitable for storage. specific blockchain, the sidechain applies "spv (simplified payment verification) pegged" technology achieve the goal that the user's asset can transferred from one blockchain another, which means users can use their current assets utilize the new cryptocurrency system. there will need worry about the disadvantage bitcoin that hard adapt the innovation and meet the new request. what need done just create beijing asch chain technology co. ltd sidechain and link the mainchain bitcoin. inheriting and reusing the powerful blockchain bitcoin, other issues such liquidity shortage and market fluctuation, often occurred when new currency introduced, can averted. furthermore, since the sidechain isolate individual system, any severe failure will only impact the sidechain itself instead the whole blockchain, thus significantly reduce the risk and cost innovations. about asch platform asch decentralized application platform, providing series sdk and api help developers creating decentralized applications based javascript and sidechain technology. providing whole set industry standard solutions including customized sidechain, smart contracts, application hosting, and etc., asch intends offer easy-to-use, fully functional and plug play ecosystem, which developers can rapidly iterate their javascript applications, and easily deploy them into application store built the system. these application can smoothly downloaded and executed every node and user located everywhere this ecosystem. the whole process will secured the asch sidechain consensus network. the other hand, asch itself also fully opened, decentralized application, which has its own cryptocurrency known xas.xas capable interfacing with sidechain any decentralized application (dapp) through "two-way peg" mechanism that can the bridge media for the asset transition among all dapps, and achieve that purpose, the xas will sold the investors before the deployment the system. once the asch system published, will not under the control the core development team, but the stakeholders the system and the owners xas. beijing asch chain technology co. ltd who should use asch platform apart from some basic services, asch platform also provides technology and toolkit support, whose main target audiences are follow: developers developers can create and deploy dapps asch platform following the criteria application development and business activities. the business model these dapps may free fixed price, pay with value added service. all the developers themselves. enterprises the tools provided asch platform can used create complete blockchain easily, and more importantly, this blockchain can pegged into main chain asch platform even the blockchain bitcoin, thereby connected with well-developed cryptocurrency. very attractive feature that suitable for small and medium enterprises (smes) especially start-up companies. smes can utilize blockchain technology provide the information and data that were enclosed inside companies internet the past, and connect with the system data owned authority that they canenhance the business transparency and improve the companies' image. consequently more trustiness can brought the investors and financial institutions make easy get the funds contracts. inevitable for smes public their business information. smes found difficult prevent social community know their secrets. therefore can assume that blockchain will play vital role smes everyday business activities. beijing asch chain technology co. ltd normal users normal users can download, install and use numbers decentralized applications through asch built-in app store, which similar with application store current smart phone. asch system supports different kinds decentralized application which normal users can make profit contributing the program content. possible for developers and users create vivid ecosystem together. design philosophy turing-completeness scripting sidechain the scripting engine highlight design bitcoin which not only can transfer the currency but can realize the smart contracts such multi-signature, escrow and arbitration, and gambling. bitcoin's scripting system, however, applies concise design setting series limitations due the consideration security and difficulty implementation, for example, cannot support loop, must strict the length its scripts, only supports limited numbers standard transactions. the most attractive characteristic ethereum that significantly expands the scale functionality this scripting engine. detail, ethereum adds several instructions such reading blockchain, charging, jumping, etc., well releases the limitation the invoke depth stacks and functions, and length the script. ethereum claims that its scripting engine turing-completeness which developers can carry out almost any computation that can represented mathematic model. beijing asch chain technology co. ltd although with ethereum, expanding script became prevail approach decentralized application platform, still has one disadvantage that cannot ignored: the application itself and the data generated have stored the same blockchain, which makes the blockchain grows extremely rapidly. ethereum tried slow this trend down optimizing compressing the program code and data, but still cannot solve the problem completely. moreover, since those applications based scripting have share the same ledger, some parameters, i.e., created-time blockchain, cannot changed, which prevents developers from customizing the application. sidechain mechanism, contrast, deals with scalability another way. every sidechain running different distributed network node, having separate users, investors and development team. this partition-like solution has resolved the blockchain expansion problem, and has made every application has its own ledger, which the consensus mechanism, block parameter, and transaction mode can customized. for this reason, believe sidechain mechanism lower-cost, more flexible and easier use solution than turing-completeness transaction scripting. account utxo within bitcoin and derived systems, there so-called "account" save the user's balance. the balance has dealt with the transition the whole transaction system's status. let's introduce new term, utxo, standing for unspent transaction outputs. every utxo has its own nominal price and its owner and each transaction has multiple inputs and outputs. each input includes reference current utxo and cryptographic signature generated private key related owner's address. user own this private key, he/ she can consume the value this utxo, other words, the balance this user has the sum the currency value all the beijing asch chain technology co. ltd utxo related the user's private keys. the main advantage utxo high level privacy, which means the user can generate new address for each his/her transaction that he/she cannot traced. great thing for currency involved transaction, but variety dapps, not sure. compare utxo, account has following benefits: space efficiency. for instance, will take user bytes space when he/she has utxos: (++) bytes bytes for address, bytes for transaction no., and bytes for transaction amount). meanwhile using account, the storage space will limited bytes: ++= bytes (in this case, bytes for address, bytes for balance, and bytes for random number). easy monitor. due the account, the cryptocurrencies are easy recognized, since all have know the account that the currency coming from. simple, easy code and understand. referring fixed time. light client can access all the data user's account fixed time, while with utxo system, the access time will change once there transaction. asch platform not pure currency system because has contain various applications. general, account mechanism better option under this circumstance. relational database non-relational database present most blockchain system choose use lightweight nonrelational databases, such berkeley db, leveldb, and on. usually these kinds database support some simple data structures, like b-tree, hashtable, queue,etc. and they are not able manipulate data through sql. generally non-relational database good enough the application cryptocurrency system, but speaking application platform, not the case, especially when talk about finance, bank, e-commerce and on. within these beijing asch chain technology co. ltd fields, the relational database wildly used because its following advantages: transaction processing very low cost data updating capability complex query (using join, for example) decide adopt sqlite, high-performance lightweight embedded rational database. sqlite can support data volume, and the data file can shared smoothly among different byte order machines. the most attractive feature sql, which very suitable for dapp developers. system highlights ease use development language developers can use javascript and numerous npm libraries create their application. unlike c++ and stack script for bitcoin and new solidity for ethereum, javascript more popular, has wilder audience, and easier master. furthermore, introducing relational database, asch platform make decentralized application development more like coding traditional web application, hence become the easiest way among all the current development approaches. toolkits asch system provides command-line tool rapidly create sidechain which any kind applications can created and deployed. also the system provides series api, involving consensus mechanism, strong random number, database, and beijing asch chain technology co. ltd cryptography, help users creating complex smart contract applications. deployment deploy the applications, all the developers need committing their dapps onto github, and registering web wallet light wallet. after that dapps will presented app store download. flexibility developers can freely customize all parameters their sidechain, such generating speed block, transaction type, and transaction fee, etc., even can carry out new consensus mechanism, for example, developers can use the pos pow replace the default dpos. security one well-known highlight asch system consensus algorithm based improved dpos, detail, the system embedded highperformance byzantine fault tolerance algorithm upon original dpos hence significantly reduce the possibility network forks. long there more than nodes which are attempting attack together, the system will not fork, that the risk double payment will avoided. secondly, asch system closely examined every detail with security consideration, such passphrase hint based bip algorithm, second secret, and multi-signature, etc. beijing asch chain technology co. ltd technique specification consensus mechanism the consensus mechanism used asch system based dpos, mechanism delegates vote, but applied optimized variant algorithm pbft, which can make loyal nodes reach agreement, i.e., not fork, o(n^) message complexity and o() time complexity when n/. here "t" refers the number byzantine node (on which any situation can happen, such network delay, machine shutdown, malicious attacks) and "n" refers the number all nodes. delegates vote the delegates vote mechanism asch similar with the one dpos, which composed delegate nodes. delegate trustful account voted community, and delegates who have the most votes are allowed running the nodes which maintain the network and generate the blocks. those accounts who cannot the top are called "candidates", who can delegate once they get enough votes become the top every asch user has the right vote delegates, and the weights vote determined the amount xas owned this user. each voting round will generate blocks, and the ranking change each voting and delegates will shown the next round. the new block will generated seconds after the previous one, and then broadcasted into network and added the blockchain. once new block added, the confirmation count all transactions before will increased time. after gaining confirmations, transaction can treated "safe". the amount transaction beijing asch chain technology co. ltd small, less confirmation count allowed. other words, larger confirmation count necessary when large transaction improve the security. some failures occurred few delegates, such under attacks shutdown, the block will miss, and this issue will recorded. this problem has impact the online rate this node hence the voting community. therefore the election delegate should treated solemnly, for example, delegate needs have experience running website, ability maintain the nodes stable, that the security and stability the whole system will strengthened. byzantine fault tolerance the major difference between asch system and dpos reflected the second part the algorithm. what the dpos applied is, first, randomly sorting the delegate list current round (to make sure the delegate order each round will different and the delegate next round cannot predicted then let delegates create block turn through round-robin way. the main issue this algorithm that, delegate attempt attack, may broadcast many different blocks, which may contain double payment trades, "fork" the whole network. doubt that only one delegate betrays, the fork will solved syncing with the next longest chain. however, will take much longer time eliminate betrayed nodes their amount increasing. few betrayed nodes are enough have serious impact system security, which means even the transaction gain confirmations, still may not safe. deal with this problem, introduced algorithm known pbft (practical byzantine fault tolerance). same dpos, pbft also chooses delegates the way round-robin. the different part there will not block generated after delegates are voted. beijing asch chain technology co. ltd fact, there will piece propose issued determine the hash code next block. only when more than all nodes agree with this propose, next block will generated. the hash next block must the same that agreed with all delegates current round. essentially, the introduction pbft solved the issue abusing the delegates' right, and improved the control capability ledgers. sidechain and dapp asch system provides command tool which developers can easily create basic sidechain system. developers are also able fully customize their sidechain system, including its own database, consensus mechanism, trading mode and account architecture. sidechain system can hosted the clusters nodes individual delegates, that partitioned mechanism can naturally generated hence avoid the rapid expansion the main blockchain. every dapp related sidechain. sidechain's core code developed nodejs, but can programmed any frontend techniques such qt, html, javascript. the communication between front-end and back-end usually implemented under json rpc protocol. the developer owner dapp can trace the usage their application. compare cryptocurrency that based community consensus, dapps are more like private company. all the transactions within dapp are handled main node, which run dapp's owner. the owner dapp must have asch account, like multi-signature account, whose major objective create consensus new block and sign dapp's main node, just like multi-signature wallet. once new dapp created, and signed main node, the sha hash this block need calculated, and submitted the main blockchain asch system dapp block the owner it. beijing asch chain technology co. ltd when asch's main blockchain received information trade including dapp hash, the delegate will compare with the previous one and then store into asch blockchain. then lately when main node sync with network, the user will validate all dapp blocks through asch blockchain, which means impossible remove the previous dapp block from main blockchain. developers can replace asch blockchain with bitcoin blockchain use the same functionality since the usage asch api will the same. the security dapp can also guaranteed bitcoin blockchain. developers can take advantage both xas and btc the currency their dapp. the case money in-and-out when using dapp, the xas btc will delivered dapp address, and appropriate amount money will shown that dapp's account, ready use. the deposit mechanisms both btc and asch are the same, which deliver particular dapp address, and then the appropriate amount will shown the account. every dapp the account created the developer, all deposited btc asch coin will saved related address. considering the security, only those dapp accounts owned trustable signers with multi-signature are recommended. withdrawal from dapp main node's responsibility. when someone requests withdrawal money, dapp main nodes will acquire the request and move the currency from dapp address asch blockchain bitcoin blockchain. developers are allowed issue token their own dapp, and use the currency this dapp. these kinds token can circulated dapp like xas btc, but they are not allowed transfer from one dapp another directly but through asch main blockchain. sandbox and sandbox execution environment that restricts program's activities under the security policy. early time was used test beijing asch chain technology co. ltd suspicious software, for example hackers usually use sandbox technique run some virus unsafe program. the implementation classic sandbox usually intercept the system calls, monitor program's activities, then control the usage computer's resource such disk i/o according user's policy. asch system implemented sandbox mechanism using module nodejs. the module encapsulation javascript engine, which used run the pure javascript code. but cannot use system apis like file system network communication. also lack "require" function therefore the third-party libraries cannot imported smoothly and even worse, the modular development cannot conducted. this requires dapp developers use "browserify" technique bundle all the third-party libraries they used javascript file, that asch system can load and run. some necessary system level api will provided sidechain through ipc (inter-process communication), which takes into account both security and functional completeness. transaction asch system has built abstract transaction layer, which almost all the functionalities system core are established, such transferring, voting, application store, deposit, and withdraw. the sidechain itself can also implement its own type transaction. the main difference between each transaction their types and assets. the data structure basic transaction follow, and the extension transaction will saved different asset table according its type. beijing asch chain technology co. ltd transaction required varchar() required varchar() required tinyint required int required varchar() optional varchar() required bigint required bigint required binary() optional binary() optional text required binary() id; blockid; type; timstamp; senderid; recpientid; amount; fee; signature; signsignature; signatures; senderpublickey; let take vote transaction example: the vote entity connected basic transaction through transaction like follows: asset_votes required varchar() optional text transactionid; votes; account system every account asch system consists one master secret, pair public/private key and address. users can also set their own second secret. note that the difference with bitcoin here that beijing asch chain technology co. ltd each account related only one address, instead multiple addresses and private keys related one wallet bitcoin. master secret mnemonics used produce real wallet line with bip standard. the mnemonics much easier remember for people than other binary hexadecimal characteristics. the way which master secret generated convert entropy multiple bit into several words, particular asch system, the length entropy bit and will converted into words. the master secret, top-level password, maintained users instead published public. once users lose their passphrase they would lose the ownership their account. master secret generally like follows: barely decline dust stamp protect color certain cup arena busy latin shell pair keys includes public key and private key, which uses sha hash master secret seed and generated through edwards-curve digital signature algorithm (eddsa). looks like this: public key: baefdfbabaebeaf adcfa private key: efeeddcdeebddfcfbcdb abaefdfbabaebeaf adcfa beijing asch chain technology co. ltd the account address big number generated reversely converting the first bits sha hash public key, shown follows: client asch platform provides three types clients: the full version client perfect solution for those super users, delegates and developers, running windows, mac osx and linux, but only linux system can run delegate nodes which blocks forging enabled. the light wallet client allows users connect network through full version wallet api, but necessary open all the rights this api the owner this full version wallet. full version wallet can download the whole blockchain from other full version wallets through peer-to-peer network. ordinary user usually use light wallet manage his/her asch account. the light wallet can run windows and mac platform without installation. utilizes the system built-in browser. needs noted that the light wallet cannot run network node since would not download the blockchain data but only links with other nodes through http protocol, which have several advantages: first, blockchain data downloaded would keep the volume small; second, private key broadcasted network make possible make all types trade since all the data will signed locally. you want run delegate node, you can use light wallet register delegate account, but cannot run delegate node through produce block. order run it, downloading and running full beijing asch chain technology co. ltd version wallet linux would necessary. the dapp users can take advantage light wallet manage installed dapp. the apis both dapp and node are available for developer invoke, that can make them rapidly and easily creating javascript dapp through node.js. the mobile version client allows users manipulate their own asch accounts their mobile devices, both ios and android platform. they can download the client from appstore google play. the backend the client based our solution applied our desktop version, but mobile client applies responsive instead fit the mobile device screen and changes some interface mode according the device characteristics. this mobile application brings mobile user-friendly interface, like bitcoin some major bank application, and course, the mobile client can also support all the dapp you like running inside it. performance all the information transaction usually occupies about bytes. let calculate how much network bandwidth will demanded when system achieve tps. since the interval block production seconds, each block needs carry transactions, which make the volume become mb. this data needs broadcasted whole network, even under the best situation, nodes will achieved the first step, and then nodes the next step, and each step supposed complete seconds, which makes the necessary bandwidth mb. considering the bandwidth loss and unexpected circumstance, think that bandwidth needs least satisfy the tps throughput. although this volume bandwidth not easy gain, can sure that will bring much more benefit delegates than the cost. nov the peak throughput alipay payment system reached per second. beijing asch chain technology co. ltd there still possibility for optimization trade throughput asch system, which our major investment the future. scenarios token system the "hello world" program generated asch toolkit would basic token system. developers may not need write even line code but adjust some initial parameters genesis.json, publish token system. like tokens based ethereum, the token asch system can represent gold, stock, mortgage, any other type asset. these tokens can traded with xas transferred sidechain decentralized way, and with any other currencies centralized exchange. mediatory contract let assume that buyer wants trade with person he/she does not familiar with. generally the trade well-doing, both would not hope the interference from third-party. but there any issue occurred the process, like the buyer does not satisfy with the items, they would like mediator help solving the problem. the mediator will ask both sides present some evidences and then make decision, for example, ask seller making refund. this business process can described follows: both the buyer and seller the transaction choose mediator together. the buyer creates multi-signature account using public key shared with all the three parties. then the buyer transfers the beijing asch chain technology co. ltd money into this account, then signs and publishes transaction which the buyer's account and seller's one are treated promotor and recipient respectively. this moment this transaction would not confirmed immediately until two these three people have signed. the seller deliver the item the buyer. the buyer received the item and satisfy with it, he/she will sign the transaction with his/her private key. after that when the seller sign the transaction again, will completed successfully. the buyer does not satisfy with the item, he/she can can appeal the mediator and show evidences about the item with faults. then the seller also can show evidences against buyer's one. finally the mediator would make agreement with one the two sides trade and sign this trade together complete it. decentralized exchange there are two types decentralization according legal currency support. legal tender not supported, the full decentralization can realized; otherwise only half decentralization would supported. this case, legal tender can circulate through gateway but transaction information would made public. full decentralized exchange can still divided into two types: one peer-to-peer trade through "atomic cross chain exchange api". the other one pending order, which require seller transfer amount asset asch sidechain from other blockchain. this transferring should achieved the spv proof frozen assets main chain. beside, with the support relational database, easy create well performance matching engine using uniontable query and index. existence proof beijing asch chain technology co. ltd existence proof used register copyright, patent and on, which based the idea that prove existed particular file saving hash code this file into asch sidechain. addition can add metadata such timestamps, owners' digital signatures prove when they own these files. this kind information cannot forged tempered, also will not expose the privacy data and ready verify any time without third-party authority. iot (internet things) there are numerous online devices existed iot, which make difficult manage all the devices and identification every nodes centralized institution. asch sidechain excellent solution for it. firstly, can deal with trustiness among different nodes. means that all devices connected each other distributed network, and trade between devices can verified consensus algorithm, and can traced, audited, and analyzed. secondly, different types devices can connected different sidechains, and this natural partition mechanism that mentioned above can prevent main ledger from explosive increment. let imagine that vending machine sidechain based iot can not only monitor and report its own stock, but also analyze historic trading data select suppliers through bidding, and then complete payment automatically. conclusion asch system decentralized application platform, which designed lower the threshold for developers, such using javascript develop language, supporting relational database save transaction data, and making dapp development similar with traditional web application. sure that these characteristics beijing asch chain technology co. ltd are very attractive developers and smes. the ecosystem the whole platform cannot improved until developers make huge progress productivity. also, asch platform designed open for various fields, not limited some particular parts such finance, file storage, copyright proof. provides underlying and abstract api which can combined freely create different types applications. consensus mechanism, asch inherits and enhances dpos algorithm, which the possibility forks and risk double payments would significantly reduced. furthermore, asch sidechain mode not only can mitigate the pressure blockchain expansion, but also make dapp more flexible and personalized. asch system, proactive, low-cost one-stop application solution, will surely the next generation incubator decentralized applications.
