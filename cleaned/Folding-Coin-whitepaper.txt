(protocols) for exchanging value between participants decentralized computer network. bitcoin (btc) the most famous and widely adopted digital currency. most cryptocurrencies use hard-to-solve cryptographic puzzles called "proof work" secure the operation the network. the process verifying the cryptographic solutions commonly referred "mining". bitcoin introduced "reward" system, where the miner who solves block awarded small amount the digital currency. this reward compensates the miner for contributing their hardware and electricity securing the network. finding the solution block vital operation allow distributed consensus, and adds the block the blockchain. the early days, one could mine decent amount bitcoin blocks standard computing hardware, most notably cpus (central processing units) and gpus (graphics processing unit). bitcoin uses the sha hashing algorithm for proof work. asic (application specific integrated circuit) mining hardware, specializing sha, began dominate and bitcoin mining was longer profitable general purpose computers. was around this time that hundreds alternative cryptocurrencies released blockchains try compete with bitcoin. many these "altcoins" used standard computing hardware from miners that had previously mined bitcoin before the asics took over. many used the scrypt algorithm instead sha. this was allow the continued use general purpose computers mine the scrypt coins asics could only mine sha coins. many former bitcoin miners moved scrypt coins. early scrypt asics appeared, and once again mining was longer feasible the non-specialized cpu/gpu miner. the phrase "standard hardware" refers cpus and gpus found everyday consumer and corporate pcs. the energy consumption standard hardware comparison asic hardware not efficient. many believe that altcoins are problem because the following reasons: the amount energy used hash these blockchains considered many vast waste energy most these coins die off these coins can underdeveloped become abandoned they end being scam coin traded "pump and dump" coin bring new great innovations bitcoin itself scientific distributed computing digital currency mining was not the first application for distributed computing. the internet emerged consumer phenomenon the late and early 's. soon after, scientific investigators found applications for distributing massively parallel computing jobs individual bitcoin https://bitcoin.org/en/ consumers. consumers could install software provided the scientific investigator their own computer and leave the machine powered even when not actively using it. the scientific investigators would use the leftover computing cycles assist solving their scientific problems. early example such system was distributed.net founded the initial problem they investigated was the mathematical principle the "golomb ruler". once the and mark golomb rulers were solved, they moved trying break the rc- encryption standard. they remain active and expect take years exhaust the rc- key space. addition distributed.net, two other popular platforms have dominated the grid computing and distributed computing communities: berkley's boinc and stanford's folding@home. these systems have gained mass adoption the little under two decades they have been operating. between them, these networks have hundreds thousands participants, combined contributing millions computational flops. today can seen that these projects are still larger than most supercomputers and have immense combined power somewhere between petaflops (the largest single supercomputer petaflops and number petaflops) folding@home stanford university started the folding@home project (fah) october the project runs computational algorithms, simulate the way protein molecules fold the body. protein folding central healthy biological processes. cancer and alzheimer's (among others) are well known medical conditions that arise when proteins misfold. scientists and medical researchers alike investigate why the proteins fail fold properly and how medicines can designed correct the process. stanford provides the data output from the fah program these researchers order help understand how solve the misfold issues. simulated protein folding problem that can solved many computers working parallel. when donor joins the fah project, they register account, install program, and fah begins downloading "work units" their computer. work units are "bite sized" protein folding problems that the fah researchers want learn more about. from this research many scientific papers have been written and can found here. donor finishes folding problem and submits the solution fah's server, they are assigned more work units. modern day computers have cpu speed, memory capacity, and graphics performance that would have been hard imagine years ago. the fah software takes advantage all this newly developed hardware. the faster one's computer completes work units, the more "credits" one can earn. fah's public distributed.net http://www.distributed.net/main_page berkley's boinc http://boinc.berkeley.edu/ stanford's folding@home http://folding.stanford.edu/home/ distributed computing power http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_distributed_computing_projects most powerful supercomputers http://www.top.org/lists/// fah white papers http://folding.stanford.edu/home/papers statistics system keeps "score" all work submitted and credits earned all donors. but these credits carry value themselves, beyond "bragging rights". counterparty and user created assets many extensions the bitcoin protocol emerged, commonly referred "bitcoin systems. bitcoin systems use the distributed blockchain technology pioneered bitcoin extend the network novel ways that were not envisioned satoshi nakamoto and the early bitcoin core developers. counterparty example bitcoin system that allows users create their own assets, along with complete suite additional financial tools, within the bitcoin blockchain. user project with unique value proposition can use counterparty's open source technology create digital currency asset. the user created assets are often generically referred "tokens" simply "assets". digital currency project can use and distribute the tokens support their value proposition nearly any way they see fit. since counterparty built inside the bitcoin blockchain, requires bitcoin transaction for all actions taken with these assets. this accomplished inputting the data from these assets the bytes unused data that each bitcoin transaction allows. tokenly bitsplit distributor the crypto startup tokenly created the bitsplit distributor that allows someone distribute mass amount these tokens simply uploading all the recipient addresses and total amount tokens they are receive csv format. then the distribution server automatically sends the allocated amount the token the address which the same row the amount. genesis foldingcoin inc. july group miners were looking for ways use their legacy mining hardware for useful purposes, while staying part the digital currency movement the same time. this became foldingcoin inc. foldingcoin inc. created asset with "proof fold" concept verify contributed computational power. participants contribute their cycles medical research the folding@home platform instead "proof work" "proof stake" algorithm traditional altcoin blockchain. this makes the energy receive the token reward towards something more meaningful than alternative blockchain bitcoin's blockchain. thus the power not considered wasted, goes towards medical research. since counterparty assets share the bitcoin blockchain, this allows the legacy mining equipment from altcoin mining redirected towards medical research, since the bitcoin miners are already covering the security and hashing rate the bitcoin blockchain. fah team and donor stats http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=userstats counterparty http://counterparty.io/ tokenly https://tokenly.com/ choosing the right distributed computing platform foldingcoin inc. researched many scientific distributed computing projects that would allow for the use the legacy mining equipment, and pros and cons were found for each. many factors had considered: common hardware: the hardware most commonly used for bitcoin and altcoin mining was amd/ati gpus. amd/ati gpus outperform nvidia gpus when comes sha and scrypt hashing. folding@home (fah) also performs very well amd hardware. easy: ease setup for the general computer user was also evaluated. fah was the most polished here creating simple "download and go" program that runs the background with simple use settings. large user base: besides the bitcoin network, fah the largest distributed computing platform the world, harnessing nearly petaflops computational power. with more users the fah platform, makes easier gain awareness about the new token reward system. strong development team: foldingcoin wanted find platform that had solid development team and mission. fah superior when comes overall production and security. since fah stand alone project the platform, the developers fah spend all their time focusing bettering the fah platform, without the worries developing and maintaining other distributed computing projects. fah has also gone great lengths provide solid security download and uploads the protein data files. fah only interacts with the installed fah program and other files data personal computer. non profit: the platform chosen must non profit platform with goals bettering humanity. without the platform being non profit, this would create issues building profit top already profitable platform. fah (c) company with all the data available medical and scientific researchers upon request. foldingcoin decided direct their efforts towards integrating with folding@home. already existent "cause" coins there are also some existing digital currency projects such curecoin and gridcoin that had involvement scientific distributed computing, but these run their own separate blockchains. foldingcoin decided that with the advances bitcoin systems, there was longer compelling need for separate blockchain. separate blockchain did not contribute anything novel the project, but rather would require more focus for the developers. they would have put time and resources into the creation, hash rate, and security brand new blockchain and wallet interface. this would take away time and resources building and developing community. fah security measrues https://folding.stanford.edu/home/faq/#ntoc folding@home (c) https://folding.stanford.edu/home/donate/ creation foldingcoin foldingcoin cause coin built counterparty. distributed schedule, fldc given those that donate cycles folding@home based their individual contributions. initial announcement forum and call out for developers join the team was posted early july forum post letstalkbitcoin! which can found here. the ease both creating counterparty assets and accessing the fah public stats allowed for manually computed proof concept. the first weekly distribution "fldc" tokens was july eight folders paying from folding time period july july th. the project gained traction and the proof concept showed this would viable venture. the distribution method that had been manually calculated was reduced set scripts that can run from server. also with the addition the tokenly bitsplit distributor, fldc could automatically distributed any amount counterwallet addresses without having manually send them out one time. with the combination these two features, foldingcoin inc. was able start paying out fldc the donors daily basis and began this august due higher btc transaction costs and additional folders joining the network, the foldingcoin project began distribute consistently monthly basis instead daily basis beginning foldingcoin (fldc) asset details only billion tokens will ever created this hard cap. the asset has been locked and there way for anyone ever issue more them. million tokens will designated for development rewards the foldingcoin team has designated million fldc paid those who contribute necessary work and code the project based the project's needs. this constantly updated and can found the foldingcoin website what have paid, and what are looking pay out for work needed. tokens will distributed according half-life schedule the half life will proceed follows: initially the fldc, daily distributions are fldc once fldc are distributed, daily distribution becomes fldc once fldc are distributed, daily distribution becomes fldc once fldc are distributed, daily distribution becomes fldc and on. this halving occurs every days there are fees there will service fees. stats who was paid will updated the website regularly foldingcoin inc. ann forum http://letstalkbitcoin.com/forum/post/asic-proof-altcoin-on-counterparty fldc team and payouts http://foldingcoin.net/resources/fldc-dev-team/ keep the issuer check and insure that all payments have been received. distributions will continue long the foldingcoin project has the funds maintain the payments. donations are raised keep the project going. won't asics just attack this? order for asic contribute folding power earn fldc, one would have get hold anton supercomputer which asic specifically for protein folding and this doesn't seem possible anytime soon. and was created, this would help bring more computational power towards fah, can only good thing. foldingcoin distribution calculator foldingcoin inc. uses php code running commercial hosting provider calculate how many fldc tokens award each folder. the code runs once day and tracks the fah credits earned each folder the hour period since the previous day's snapshot. for merged folding participation, the code allows anyone export csv file custom start date, custom end date, and the amount tokens you wish distribute within the selected time frame. the export calculates the total tokens each participant should receive within that time frame. folding@home public statistics folding@home (fah) provides text file listing every folder the network and how many credits they have folded the moment text file was produced. this file placed fah's public website for anyone download, and updated once hour. daily snapshot once day, foldingcoin inc.'s snapshot code downloads the fah daily user summary text file and searches line line find those folders who have set their folding software according the foldingcoin inc. instructions the initial release fldc, anyone who wanted get the tokens had join fah team and set their fah user name their counterwallet bitcoin public address. this scheme worked very well for the initial roll out and still fully supported the present day for the original folders. will not advertised heavily not recommended and further developed code has replaced this model. responding feedback from existing folders fah, october method was devised where fah user would not have change teams, and could have more friendly identifier than just bitcoin address. the new scheme works with any fah team. folder indicates the address award their tokens setting their fah software to: username_fldc_counterwalletaddress the snapshot code looks for "_fldc_" and uses this determine fldc folders. here example real folder: pooktwo_fldc_muwhtjayrrxrknbwwtmtcgxscxdzj regardless which scheme the folder used, all affiliated folders get their up-to-date fah donor text file http://fah-web.stanford.edu/daily_user_summary.txt.bz fah credit quantity written that day's fldc "snapshot" the mysql database. calculation tokens award after the snapshot, separate process runs calculate token award amounts: each folder the current awarding period's snapshot read. the code determines the folder's address valid bitcoin wallet address. their bitcoin address not valid, there point including the folder any further calculations that awarding period. there would way send them their fldc tokens. these invalid fah credits are simply disregarded. for each valid folder, their credit count the previous awarding period's snapshot determined, and subtracted from the current awarding period's credit count. this results "delta". the delta shows how many fah credits have been earned that folder that days work. the foldingcoin team then waits for the month end. the first saturday the following month, the foldingcoin team runs report from the previous month every day. the report adds all the "deltas" from each day the last month showing total fah credit for each participant. the list valid folders then read and that folder's delta multiplied that awarding period's fldc amount per fah credit, and this determines how many fldc tokens each address. the awarding period's list valid folder addresses and corresponding fldc token amounts rendered csv formatted data suitable for entry into the tokenly bitsplit and exported the foldingcoin developers. all this calculated data available the foldingcoin inc. distribution summary webpage. all mass distribution addresses can also found the website with each individual bitcoin transaction associated with each payout anyone can run these reports from the foldingcoin statistics page. tokenly bitsplit distributor the fldc team has leveraged tokenly's bitsplit from the start. tokenly has authorized foldingcoin inc. use their automated distributor. this was great improvement over the manual transactions that were done during the proof concept stage. the way that the tokenly bitsplit distributor works follows: the title the distribution submitted, fldc uses the method "fldc december payout" but this title can anything the counterparty asset that distributed entered. csv file can imported containing the receiving counterwallet addresses the first column and the amount receive the second column pasted into the entire list with each address having comma after then the amount asset should receive putting each address its own independent line fldc daily summaries https://fldc.tech/new/reports/ fldc distribution payouts http://foldingcoin.net/distribution/ the distributor then tallies how much the selected token must sent specific btc address and the amount btc that must sent that same address distribute all the assets once the distributor has these funds will automatically distribute the addresses and the specified token amount every distribution address that foldingcoin inc. has sent out since the beginning, can found the distribution webpage. merged folding the foldingcoin inc. team members have received requests from other counterparty projects asking how was done and how they can follow the same model for their token. since folding@home tallies statistics (credits) based the amount computational power each individual participant contributes, foldingcoin has the ability incorporate multiple counterparty tokens into the open sourced distribution calculator based individual missions the respective token. these include: projects looking develop new coin for particular service but not wishing develop their own unique blockchain could use this methodology distribute their tokens their participants. foldingcoin only distributed tokens participants the folding@home project, which leaves many other distributed computing projects without token used incentive. one could created and distributed foldingcoin inc.'s platform entice participants. existing counterparty projects can run promotional token giveaway the platform way advertise their project. following the same distribution methodology from the above section, fldc participants can now earn the additional tokens that are looking distribute the foldingcoin platform. with more tokens being added the foldingcoin inc. distribution family, more adaption gained for folding@home, fldc, counterparty, and the respective token, all the same time. tokens distributed the platform this way will receive recognition from the foldingcoin website being distributed the platform, but since this open for anyone distribute on, direct endorsement will come from foldingcoin unless otherwise stated. the foldingcoin project will take this case case situation. each token will have its own distribution methodology. what that means that the tokens' developers will choose when and how much distribute. they will also have their own unique way cutting that distribution amount down should they desire. foldingcoin inc. setup allow anywhere between daily monthly distributions and all variations between. token distribution fldc will continue distributed monthly foldingcoin inc. allow the tokens built fldc asset distribution addresses http://foldingcoin.net/distribution/ foldingcoin inc distribution calculator https://github.com/foldingcoinnet merged folding tokens http://foldingcoin.net/merged-folding/ our platform decide how often they wish their distributions. this can done setting start and end date. the token team must have tokenly bitsplit login and account order these distributions. registration links are provided the foldingcoin website. disclaimer foldingcoin inc. will only assist the respective tokens the calculation the respective token payouts and provide assistance new folders the platform including setup and general inquires. foldingcoin inc. does not charge any amount financially any tokens development team the platform for the provided services. foldingcoin inc. not responsible for any actions taken the respective tokens' development team payment issues regarding the respective token. you will still receive fldc from the foldingcoin team but any discrepancies with other token payments should taken with those token developers and not foldingcoin inc, unless the discrepancy involves lack foldingcoin inc. providing the respective token with accurate fah statistics. this would then fall under foldingcoin inc.'s responsibilities. foldingcoin inc. reserves the right remove any coin from our website due lack development, distribution payouts, anything done manner that could hurt the image foldingcoin inc. though still noteworthy that since our platform open that token team can still distribute their tokens they still hold tokenly bitsplit account. counterparty assets vs. traditional altcoins counterparty assets have significant differences from traditional altcoins. foldingcoin inc. believes that the pros significantly outweigh the cons, but wishes transparent about the various feedback that was given. the following sections will over arguments for both sides and rebuttals for each one. benefits counterparty btc miners hash the blocks for the transactions. this provides strong foundation security, based cryptographic computations the largest distributed computing platform currently operation. rebuttal since counterparty using the bitcoin blockchain, new innovative ideas such lower transaction times are incorporated the tokens. unless bitcoin updated address potential concerns, counterparty runs just bitcoin currently does. asset issuance can locked the counterparty protocol ensuring that even the asset owner can't introduce more the token into the market. fldc was created locked asset. rebuttal even with the "locked" asset feature, still possible for the owner the token take control with bad intentions steal the undistributed tokens once they become valuable. bitcoin and counterparty developers innovate, assets evolve with them. since counterparty open source, developers throughout the community create new and innovative ideas applied counterparty. when counterparty outside fldc locked asset http://blockscan.com/assetinfo/fldc developers create applications for counterparty, all assets are compatible automatically. most altcoins have develop their own apps and features since they have separate blockchain. many altcoins not have high enough interest the overall crypto community for outside developers create applications for them. rebuttal many altcoins that introduce new innovative ideas like anonymous transactions have gained strong support from outside developers. direct mining required for counterparty assets. token creation and transfer can verified third party sites such "blockscan.com" yet still verified the btc miners. for the fldc asset, this available blockscan.com rebuttal although resources are used hash blockchain, the verification system depends the security and coding efforts put forth the counterparty team. since counterparty application, could have potential bug that could affect the counterparty network. there exposure attack unless happens the bitcoin network itself. rebuttal some new altcoins coming out have implemented proof stake concept which the attacker would need the total coins existence order potentially harm the network. this much more unlikely than simply having the total mining power network lot cases. counterparty assets automatically get security and gui updates from the strong bitcoin and counterparty developers, due the common bitcoin blockchain. due this, the asset owner can focus adoption, distribution, applications, and economy the coin, and not software development the blockchain and wallet itself. rebuttal this means that each counterparty asset dependant upon third parties for updates. benefits traditional altcoins every asset payment recipient from counterparty assets requires btc order included the blockchain when using the tokenly bitsplit distributor for distributing multiple addresses. sending single transaction counterwallet, will cost the current miner fee addition btc. with large numbers recipients, the btc costs could obstacle. rebuttal that fee could potentially lowered depending counterparty's willingness change their code. could also depend the blockchain accepting micro transactions. the current fear that miners would reject satoshi transaction counterparty assets only get sent single satoshi. bitcoin gains value the transaction fees will naturally become lowered. assets the counterparty network may considered "fully pre-mined" since decentralized blockchain not continuing issue new tokens upon block creation. non-locked assets can have more tokens created the discretion the asset owner, instead creating and locking all tokens once. this causes the issue potential mass creation tokens once the token obtains real value. blockscan.com fldc info http://blockscan.com/assetinfo/fldc rebuttal with counterparty there current way doing decentralized asset creation and issuance. although you lose the benefit token creation from hashing blockchain, you gain the fact that the blockchain not developed underfunded dev team, but rather developed two highly funded projects being the counterparty platform and the bitcoin network. the undistributed tokens are control the development team. this causes the following concerns: the development team decides use the undistributed funds for inappropriate purposes, the option there for them so. rebuttal foldingcoin inc. fully compliant with law and has incorporated indiana non-profit company. this imposes certain accountability obligations the organization. the sole beneficiary all assets there ever dissolution stanford university's folding@home project. the undistributed tokens are only secure the development team makes them. the development team lacks security the private keys, the funds could hacked. rebuttal foldingcoin inc. takes security the undistributed tokens very seriously. the team has all but two weeks worth distribution paper wallet and changes that paper wallet once every two weeks once another two weeks worth funds are needed. the team has the fldc funds cover the amount fldc that could potentially stolen from the distribution address. the creation the paper wallets follows: ubuntu computer that "air-gapped" generate the cold storage usb dummy printer connected via usb only with network capabilities bip wallet encrypted case the issue one dev unavailable any way, comodo secured encrypted emails the bip private keys are sent the main developers. the password the key only communicated via voice call that way even the email unsecured, only the trusted devs have the password unlock the wallet. these steps will changed multisig addresses once board directors established for foldingcoin inc. requiring half directors sign off distributions. the coin must distributed the dev team. should the dev team lose interest continuing the project, the token could die. rebuttal the end the calendar year the aim establish board directors who are dedicated the mission. not the aim just select random developers from the internet either. medical professionals are also needed this board that understand protein folding and see the value something like foldingcoin inc. existence. this one the main reasons why foldingcoin inc. wished incorporate. now that incorporated non profit, now has some accountability that has been added it. automating the distribution must still done partially done manually. with applications like the tokenly bitsplit distributor system, only one transaction the total amount tokens distributed needs sent this address, then the server sends the appropriate amount tokens the designated addresses, but dev must still responsible for sending the first transaction the distribution server. rebuttal this gives foldingcoin inc. the chance give second look before distributing the funds out the donors. should any miscalculations there, foldingcoin inc. has the ability correct the mistakes before sent out. project value and global benefits appeal the community digital currency mining, well scientific grid computing, are both great measures user-contributed computing power. many bitcoin evangelists have problem with all the wasted energy that has gone into mining for altcoins. the trouble with these altcoins that many are just "pump and dump" coin that retains value the end. fldc does productive work instead securing blockchain. fldc can more appealing since represents real benefit humanity through medical research. there are lot original bitcoin miners with lot idle gpu and cpu hardware since early when the asics took over the scrypt mining community. foldingcoin was developed both way use that hardware productively, and also provide boost the stanford university folding@home network. foldingcoin can reach large population the general public with the sweet spot combination fldc and fah. the foldingcoin team has met many "non bitcoiners" who are not comfortable with computers, know nothing about cryptocurrencies and don't want know the details, but they still want help use their idle computer for useful medical research. foldingcoin's semi-automated installer can help make the process easier for those people. that allows them also generate valuable asset the counterwallet platform which much easier for the general user use than wallet bitcoin core client. this gets the general public used the idea digital currency with crypto representing something productive that much the general public can see valuable. value for crypto miners are constantly mining different coins. all sorts crypto-switching programs can retarget mining equipment every minutes the most profitable coin. then the miners instantly sell out the altcoin for bitcoin trying get immediate profit. this not system which coin can become established. many miners don't even know what coin they are mining majority the time. since folding different platform than mining and requires flops not hashes, current software allows computer easily switch back and forth between folding and mining. value earning tokens bonus the merged folding platform offers many other tokens that might worthless when they are distributed. over time some those tokens may worth more than fldc itself. this aspect the distribution platform appeals gamers, collectors, and speculators that helps draw more people into folding for tokens. value for miners receiving more than one coin dream come true for miner. foldingcoin offers single platform for miners merge fold, receive many coins for folding. with fldc being the flagship token merged folding, all participants will receive this token from foldingcoin inc. regardless the success failure other tokens the platform. this allows miners receive many coins that they can sit some scenarios exchange for bitcoin help pay for the mining costs. value for mining costs your cooling and electricity costs may lower with fah. when mining cryptos with cpus and gpus, the brute-force hashing requires lot power and heat dissipation. whereas running folding@home the cpus and gpus don't get nearly hot use much power computing protein folding simulations. fah usually measured flops, which bit different than mining being measured hashes. value for helping small start-up coins developers smaller startup coins spend most their time trying maintain blockchain. updating and securing blockchain full time job. many altcoins have neat ideas having coin used for something other than pumping and dumping. the success digital currency depends the dedication the development team. the merged folding platform will empower the ability for token development teams not have maintain blockchain anymore. time can focused now solely the mission creating token with use and start working features well. they can now more directly involved their token's community rather than wallet and source code. other traditional altcoins having issues with hashing power blockchain maintenance could make the move counterparty harness the folders' participation. these coins could hold their own burns, foldingcoin inc. could help with burn exchange the original altcoin with the new counterparty token. many out there have great ideas for coin, but don't want deal with the wild west altcoin mining. this gives them the ability get their coin out there without having worry about things like getting listed exchange, difficulty fluctuations, and blockchain security updates. they will grow with counterparty and their distribution will help increase the available folding power. global benefits the amazing thing about non-profit distributed computing one was compensated for their work this point. this made sense back when distributed computing was first developed. was charitable thing donate your computing cycles for science instead giving money volunteer hours. the introduction bitcoin added financial incentive get more and more computational power for mining. foldingcoin looking add similar rewards increase folding@home computational power benefit humanity. better use energy for the world there direct translation from one another, but common consensus hash equals flops when comparing the two side side. the fah grid computing network has over petaflops and known the world's most powerful computing network outside the bitcoin mining network. the time before asics and fpgas started hitting the market december the hash rate the btc network was terahash's mostly gpu and cpu power. based rough comparison petaflop terahash the potential computational power that could added fah is: terahash petaflops petaflops. imagine that power was harnessed for molecular protein folding. most this power was redirected altcoin mining after the sha asics came out, since there was profit motive for folding the past. foldingcoin looks bring profit motive for people fold proteins distributing fldc along with other counterparty tokens. convert hash flops http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk%aflops#bitcoin_.flops._computation_on_bitcoinwatch most powerful dcn
