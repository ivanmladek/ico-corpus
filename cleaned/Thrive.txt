"there not one definitive way address the issues surrounding brand safety and transparency" says simon stone, commercial director, collective. recent incidents when brands have appeared context and next inappropriate, distressing, damaging content has swung the pendulum back towards the research for premium placement. companies not control their advertisement will appear well-known premium title. for brands that want appear next several premium placements one go, there not really quick-and-easy way doing since today's marketplace not geared this way working. what advertisers need something that has been talked about quite lot before, but never fully realized premium decentralized marketplace. today, several attempts achieve this utopian ideal have failed. the establishment clear ground rules and strict membership criteria ensure all publishers pass the premium and transparency test were led giant networks trying push their own agenda and personal interests. but over the last few years, blockchain has emerged potentially disruptive technology based the concept decentralized and distributed consensus ledger. thrive strongly convinced that this new paradigm will the enabler that defines the future digital marketing. thrive labs ambition statement "build better internet", together. thrive's ultimate goal establish the first meritocratic community based premium advertising market place, where all participants become strong contributors defining clear publisher interests, commercial benefits and self- thrive whitepaper reinforcing processes make joining the group no-brainer. thrive believes the community the backbone its business model, therefore all main actors who are actively contributing the market place development such consumers, reviewers, advertisers and publishers are eligible improve their economic performance. this game changing concept the digital advertising industry strictly regulated transparent and meritocratic reward model

increase from estimated billion u.s. dollars just over billion u.s. dollars following this pattern, mobile advertising spending the u.s. also forecast double between and data are taken reference since indicative for the overall advertising industry. thrive whitepaper value proposition strategic framework: the supply side, publishers are seeking low fees and transparent ads rules. this can found thrive, provided that publishers ensure that their content premium and clean. reviewers' community, thanks their reports will meritocratically rewarded, which will guarantee publishers are going represents premium placement for advertisers. the demand side, advertisers care about brand protection and effective retargeting maximize their ads conversion. while brand reputation will ensured the premium content reviewers' process, predictive retargeting and high conversion will possible thanks thrive data platform management. consumers' behavioral anonymous data, meritocratically rewarded, will feed thrive dmp with best class information across the whole customer journey. thrive whitepaper thrive's platform, supported blockchain smart contracts the backbone this integrated ecosystem. value proposition: built from community consensus. private survey, collecting responses, has been circulated among top players the advertising industry average yearly views). the response can summarized follow: thrive survey number participants: avg yearly views per websites avg banners per websites avg publisher cpm (eur) interested data sharing data interested sharing data rewarded eur cpm avg professional report requested yearly thrive joiners with adv. fee between and thrive joiners with adv. fee between and thrive joiners accepting crypto currency payment method thrive whitepaper survey results show wide interest and potential adoption thrive market place among advertisers and publishers. thanks blockchain low transaction costs and full ledger transparency, thrive will able lower its fees between and reaching around survey consensus. looking current fee ranges applied other competitors (from translates into huge value creation for the industry. the survey also demonstrated that publishers are interested receiving professional reports how improve and optimize their web content every three/four months. the token incentive for data sharing, highly supported the publishers consumers (thrive survey), thought not only speed the platform rampup/adoption but also ensure reviews questionnaires get constantly improved and tailor-made for each specific website. for the first time, both publishers and consumers willing voluntarily share anonymous data will get monetary rewards helping thrive community steadily support the market. something today everyone already doing for free, ignoring all risks related data storage security. (see case study reviewer reward. meritocracy the core value for services rewarding. plenty websites promise rewards for users test users review. looking the major ones (e.g. trymyui, user testing, analysia) the average monetary reward can assessed eur per test for maximum available tests per week. web tester can earn today eur/year. thrive's meritocratic model will assign token equivalent prize eur each winning reviewer plus eur shared among the top contributors. (among concurrent reviews needed for each website) the meritocratic model based the concept that web site report needs several concurrent reviews before being considered reliable. thrive whitepaper this means reviews needs submitted before the a.i. engine can establish the winning one assigning: eur tokens equivalent prize the winning reviewer eur tokens equivalent prize the non-winner best contributors. case the equilibrium ratio broken, the difficulty index may vary dynamically from regulating the number concurrent reviews from while maintaining constant distribution tokens among participants. this translated potential reviewer yearly income keur tokens equivalents, increasing the value creation for reviewers factor compared existing offering. user reward. the value consumers' data sharing. the digital advertising world, once you have idea the customers, you should further drill down explore them more detail. what are their media consumption habits? what are their expectations and aspirations? what are their priorities? how much disposable income they have? what are their buying habits? are they likely have children? how many holidays they take year? how can you help them? this information was the past obtained variety ways, from commissioning specialist market research agency, examining sales patterns social interactions. nowadays with the development internet, mobile and social media platforms, consumers' information owned very few giant companies that are fully benefiting from the good faith consumers. today, fact, consumers' addiction popular social platforms and search engines triggering unconscious sharing their behavioral information. most the cases without any self-awareness and without perceiving any benefit. thrive the first adv. marketplace platform rewarding consumers' anonymous data sharing. thrive whitepaper considering both the latest statistics internet traffic average cost per eur/gb) and the average monthly internet consumption traffic per user gbs), see appendix references, thrive's blockchain going reward equivalent anonymous data sharing per user/month. enough entirely pay highly contribute consumers' mobile internet subscription. all data will treated fully anonymously respect all gdpr laws and regulations. once segmented and profiled, data will permanently deleted. the anti-patronage advertising marketplace, reputation based. more and more publishers are continuously investing relevant and valuable content. but unfortunately, they often get cut out major adv. platforms due unclear policies regulated monopolistic market few. this phenomenon, together with humongous advertising fees applied major platforms, can considered the main root cause failure many newborn web products, despite their real value. thrive going guarantee all publishers to: access the new marketplace with equal rights, with clear and transparent rules for joiners. receive detailed reports provided thrive how improve their website's content and effectiveness per year. benefit from transparent and extremely low market place fee (%). achieve fee discount exchange for anonymous visitor's data. within thrive's ecosystem, publishers' interest provide premium content remain the ecosystem. reliable, transparent and sustainable reputation management mechanism will minimize the risk fraudulent behavior. publisher's reputation being regulated two parallel mechanisms: reviewer's reports described above thrive whitepaper anti-fraud mechanism. the algorithm will analyze thrive's blockchain transactions parameters such the volume confirmed/paid/not verified transactions automatically adjust the level publisher credibility. thrive's activity system glance competitors blockchain advantages the digital-advertising industry growing strongly, with revenues increasing sharply over recent years, leading consolidation big players the exchange market like google doubleclick, appnexus, criteo, openx aol's marketplace. recently, few icos have been announced this topic such adex shares, basic attention token, papyrus and bitclave. while the dynamism digital advertising world would not prevent any users from simultaneously using several innovative new products, majority legacy companies will not have enough flexibility suddenly dump fees from one day another without hugely impacting its current organizational structure. thrive labs going disrupt the industry becoming the cheapest premium market ever. despite none the blockchain products have yet reached relevant product maturity, it's already possible analyze the competitors' pain points both technology and business model. -adex. initially based ethereum blockchain, announced recently migration neo. adex sorting out the limited transactions per second handling issue but not the gas requirements one. fact, continuous gas requirements may lead ad. price rising. neo chinese blockchain and today there assurance will blocked the great firewall anytime. user's profiling based forms filled users themselves and therefore less reliable than thrive's profiling which based behavioral data tracking. how much (or if) the users will get rewarded and how much fees will applied not clearly declared. -bitclave. it's considered the anti-google decentralized search engine. the project very solid data collection point view and data transparency, but the blockchain usage for data storing purposes seems have some limitations. the data storage itself may become too heavy handled the blockchain. base system, bitclave adopting, meant work currently ethereum. ethereum blockchain current transactions per second handling far too low for the purpose. can considered show stopper for the project. how much users will

however, profiling seems less effective than thrive's since data collection not systematic and there mention behavioral patterns analysis. this key point could potentially put risk the success the

their "attention". feel that this very hard forecast. this project based ethereum blockchain. ethereum blockchain current transactions per second handling far too low for the purpose. can considered show stopper. fees are not declared. seems fees calculation will done according the measurement the attention well. -mad network. analysis cannot done this stage. the whitepaper shows complex and vague business flow that not backed any detail. information about blockchain technology used for the project (in the competitor analysis chart assumed run ethereum blockchain). thrive labs project going beyond the decentralized market place concept, since building and integrating active community around it, with clear and transparent engagement rules. thrive company based blockchain and smart contracts with all competitive advantages this technology brings in, ensuring full transparency, data security and safety. thrive tech team duly analyzed major blockchains available the markets considering all the threats stated above terms transactions handling, speed, gas requirement and data storage capability. after this analysis has decided move building his own proprietary blockchain tailored made marketing needs. ethereum blockchain will used only for crowdsale purposes. token swap will provided once thrive proprietary blockchain deployed. heavily reducing the cost advertising (cutting off most the profit for middlemen) will make advertisers and publishers eager switch blockchain platforms. fully differentiate from competition, still leveraging all blockchain competitive advantages stated above, thrive conducted extensive market research and launched private surveys clearly understand its value proposition was both fully line with industry needs and self-sustainable from financial point view. how many ico projects have sound business plan behind? the thrive team backed solid business plan, based months surveys and market research. the thrive team working the industry since years part existing and profitable company. the thrive team understands technology, and therefore spending time selecting the best scalable blockchain solution fully support and deliver the project. the thrive team the only project declaring fees applied and users/websites rewards transparent and clear way its community. the thrive team has clear strategy ramp-up its platform before opening the market place and becoming profitable. competitor analysis chart: blockchain performace community engagement rules trasparency case study case advertisers are you control advertisement placement? your brand reputation riskless? today this not always the case. months ago, major brands including verizon and walmart pulled their ads after they were found appearing next videos promoting extremist views hate speech. both, the telecom companies at&t and verizon, well the pharmaceutical company gsk, pepsi, walmart, johnson johnson and the car rental firm enterprise, have all pulled advertising from google's video-sharing platform. "until google can ensure this won't happen again, are removing our ads from google's non-search platforms" at&t spokesman said statement. "so, when there's problem with advertising like this, it's big problem," krasodomski-jones said (researcher the thinktank demos). the row highlights uncomfortable fact about advertising the digital age: most brands don't know exactly where their online advertising running. black box machines are now largely responsible for the placement ads online....when appears alongside piece content, it's not always clear whether it's been shown based person's previous browsing behavior, interests, demographic data because the brand affiliated with particular content creator*. *source: https://www.theguardian.com/technology//mar//google-youtube-advertising-extremist-contentatt-verizon thrive labs platform goal deeply decrease the risk brand reputation damages providing premium placements reviewed its community. case publishers fed running your site exactly the way google wants and paying crazy fees? developed good content but suddenly banned adsense for uncler reasons?

stemmed from investigation into the social network company conducted alongside similar probes belgium, france, germany and the netherlands, the aepd authority said. aepd said found three cases which facebook had collected details such the gender, religious beliefs, personal tastes and browsing history its millions spanish users without informing them how such information would used. according the aepd, the tech giant did not sufficiently inform users about how would use data collected third-party websites, and did not obtain consent use it. facebook's privacy policy contains generic and unclear terms, the authority said statement. the social network uses specifically protected data for advertising, among other purposes, without obtaining users' express consent data protection law

initially targeting publisher websites with least yearly views and banners spaces available for placement, targeted increase over time towards portfolio websites with average annual views. this

september the number existing online websites counts billion unique hostnames. considering discount factor for non-active websites due parked domains reduces applicable base count million active

winterberry group survey and radar research survey, all senior executives believe that dmp will their future. see dmp solution critical/major player expanding the performance long-term and marketing strategy. globally, agency-side media buying professionals use dmp technology. this figure can viewed very strong, especially given that research conducted july showed media buyers had dmp solution place representing increase just two years. this symptomatic agencies' desire increase their competitive edge. globally, dmps are primarily used agencies for audience targeting (%), audience insights and analytics (%), and data unification (%). looking industry verticals, overall already use dmp and are planning implement one within the next months. however, dmp adoption longer enough for agencies achieve differentiation, with such high percentage competitors having very similar technology. therefore thrive labs aiming deeply change the paradigm how dmp works today. currently dmps available the markets collect data about customers directly from digital advertisements, websites and mobile applications. most the time these touch points represent only the last click the customer's journey. thanks thrive's dmp, for the first time, advertisers will experience first dmp fully leveraging customer data collected along the whole customer journey. thrive labs main services: data onboarding

retargeting and customer segmentation functionalities will ensure high conversion rate. thrive labs blockchain blockchain communication protocol that identifies technology based distributed database logic database which data not stored single computer but multiple machines connected one another, called nodes). blockchain database made blocks that store valid transaction blocks correlated timestamp. each block includes the hash non-invertible algorithmic function that maps arbitrary length string predefined length string) the previous block, linking the blocks together. the linked blocks form chain, with each additional block that reinforces the previous ones. blockchain also public and shared registry consisting number clients. blockchain organized automatically update each the clients participating the network. every operation performed must automatically confirmed all nodes through encryption software that verifies private key seed data package that used sign transactions. guaranteeing the digital identity those who have authorized you. thrive labs blockchain will ruled and its transaction will validated proofof-stake, instead the traditional proof-of-work system. proof-of-stake innovative way validate transactions and achieve the distributed consensus. the first digital currency use this method was peercoin together with shadowcash, nxt, blackcoin, nushares/nubits, qora and nav coin. unlike the proof-of-work, where the algorithm rewards miners who solve mathematical problems with the goal validating transactions and creating new blocks, with the proof-of-stake the creator new block chosen deterministic way depending its wealth, also defined stake. since the digital currency entirely created the beginning and kept constant, the proof-of-stake system there block reward. therefore, the miners are rewarded the transaction fee. thanks proof-of-stake system, validators not have use their computing power. the only factors that influence their chances are both the total number coins owned and current complexity the network. key features the blockchain: reliability: giving all the direct participants control over the entire chain, blockchain becomes less centralized, less alterable, and the same time safer and more reliable system (e.g. malicious attacks). only one the chain nodes undergoes attack and gets damaged, all the other distributed database nodes will still active and operative, welding the chain and not losing important information. transparency: blockchain transactions are visible all participants, thus ensuring transparency operations. solidity: the information already stored the blockchain cannot changed any way. this way, the information contained the blockchain solid and reliable. irrevocability: with the blockchain all transactions are irrevocable and the same time more easily traceable. this ensures that the transactions are definitive, without any possibility being modified canceled. the software packages thrive labs software packages basically are two types: the data mining software package and the client software package. the data mining software package needed collect and send data either
