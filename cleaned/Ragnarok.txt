(c) ragnarok project http://ragnaproject.io ragnarok project overview creating ragnarok coin (ragna) made cryptocurrency with focus decentralization and secure storage ragna digital wallets. utilizes energy efficient proof stake protocol, second-tier masternode network along with blockchain and financial model that would generate income for ragna owners while utilizing itself for the security the ragna blockchain. have also inherited, through selected fork pivx, the ability provide for near-instant payments through swifttx. ragnarok form online digital money that can easily transferred all around the world blink eye with nearly non-existent transaction fees. you can buy ragna and just hold earn rewards similar interest, trade exchange buy crypto mining items online. address the issue previous first-generation cryptocurrencies, the network provides the owner the option ensure fungibility ragna through the inherited functionality pivx's zerocoin protocol. our main goals are advanced digital currency that fast and secure which can used earn money online buy crypto mining items from online store will partner with, this something that has not been done before. this enables you buy crypto mining items like gpu, motherboards, riser and without having give anyone your credit card payment information (c) ragnarok project http://ragnaproject.io coin specification (c) ragnarok project http://ragnaproject.io proof stake proof-of-stake algorithm the storage all the operations ragnarok wallet and requires user have certain number ragna for them have chance getting reward. synchronization the wallet nodes running proof-of-stake which carried out through the peer-to-peer network, pp. this more efficient and environmentally friendlier than proof work algorithm, which the user validates transactions and creates new blocks performing certain amount computational work. the longer you keep ragna wallet, the more credibility that wallet will given the network. the wallet will likely receive block reward because the relative weight that wallet contributes the protection the network. the amount time wallet participates protecting the network also factor. the node serves the first layer the hybrid cryptocurrency network confirming transactions the blockchain, selecting network masternodes for instant transactions, and creating the next block for storing future transactions. (c) ragnarok project http://ragnaproject.io masternode masternode plays important part the ragna network. masternode the second layer the network that donates processing power confirm transactions instantly utilizing the swifttx technology inherited from pivx. this tier system reward split between mns and traditional pos (staking) wallets. mns require ragna collateral. masternode receive from the block reward and the remaining for traditional staking wallets, these rewards are paid directly the ragnarok wallet that linked the masternode. using masternodes also ensures the stability and security the entire network and serve special purpose within the network mix various transaction amounts increase fungibility and anonymity transactions.
