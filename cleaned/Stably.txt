transparent reserve-backed stablecoins for multiple blockchain protocols whitepaper last updated september first published november abstract: stableusd (symbol: usds) fiat-backed stablecoin that designed work across multiple blockchain protocols which will initially include ethereum and stellar. stableusd will utilize proven centralized model fully back every token issued with equivalent unit real currency (i.e. dollars) transparent reserve managed stably, inc., the central issuer usds tokens, well our fiduciary custodial partners. addition regular third-party audits, token issuance/redemption transactions are recorded on-chain and all off-chain transactions well reserve balances will broadcasted the public frequent intervals. the existence physical, transparent and

www.stably.io background: decentralized applications are here stay the need for stablecoins the blockchain premised upon the sustainable value cryptocurrency and decentralized applications (dapps), with time-horizon that goes beyond the current speculative hype. since there has been some confusion the media, let first define decentralized applications distributed software which multiple untrusting parties can achieve consensus the state the system without the need any trusted centralized. furthermore, let define cryptocurrencies digital assets that enable decentralized applications through incentivization. the bitcoin protocol can viewed the first decentralized application solve previously unsolved problem; creating payment network which nobody can stop individual from spending their own money. bitcoin the cryptocurrency that enables this application. the unique advantage decentralized applications censorship-resistance transactions. this new breakthrough censorship-resistant software has caused much excitement amongst investors, entrepreneurs and developers alike. some this excitement noise, and some signal. for the first time the history civilization, society seems have solution for civic autonomy for the individual. while the appeal this may seem tenuous those who have lived comfortably developed countries, the potential decentralized applications "put not your trust money, but put your money trust" ~oliver holmes sr. for the majority the world's population who deal with unpredictable governance, censorship, economic mismanagement and monopolistic corporations immense. yet seen blockchain infrastructure and its current blueprints will achieve this ideal. for the team stably, answering this question less important than recognizing decentralization unstoppable technological and economic movement. furthermore, will explain the next section, stable-value currencies the blockchain are essential tool required for this ecosystem become minimally functional. why need stablecoins money arguably the most successful story mankind has ever told. give strangers exchange for goods and services. this allows transfer value them even they don't know us. when strangers give money can convinced things otherwise may not want because believe that this money will useful the future and that others will accept for something that adds value our lives. this captures two important criteria money, the ability use medium exchange, and its ability store value over time. the modern financial world, government issued currencies often play this role well, serving medium exchange and store value for people around the world. order for cryptocurrency serve medium exchange, must fulfill certain criteria. first, there must counterparties willing accept payment. serve medium exchange, the participants the exchange must give value. second, must have fungibility that any two identical units will have the same value. without fungibility, would have instead barter system. third, its value must not rapidly appreciate. with holders expecting have significantly more purchasing power the future they are incentivized hold onto their currency rather than use for exchange. similarly, for cryptocurrency serve stable store value, must also fulfill certain criteria. first, its value must not rapidly depreciate. holders cannot expect their value stay relatively constant then they will need find another asset serve stable store value. second, the holders the cryptocurrency must confident that there will accessible counterparties who are willing accept future point time. without counterparties, there ability unlock the value when needed. immediate need for stablecoins the blockchain ecosystem still its infancy but are already seeing immediate demand for price-stable cryptocurrency. tether (usdt) cryptocurrency that pegged the dollar via centralized model administered tether limited, company based out hong kong. tether's "put not your trust money, but put your money trust" oliver holmes sr. model, every usdt that "minted" into existence must backed exactly reserve. usdt holders can then choose either redeem usd directly from tether limited exchange their usdt for usd the open market. another option, also, exchange usdt for other cryptocurrencies and then exchange those cryptocurrencies for usd. since its inception tether's total market capitalization has grown from less than more than $.-billion today, increase more than just two and half years. result, tether has managed become the de-facto stablecoin now possesses monopolistic market share over (based either market capitalization trading volume). usdt currently enjoys massive trading volumes across most major cryptocurrency exchanges with total -hour volume surpassing $.-billion, placing place globally right behind bitcoin, ripple and ethereum. the popularity usdt can mainly attributed the fact that was the only available stablecoin the market the past few years that had not only sufficient liquidity but also actual reserve backing. simply put, there just wasn't any other good alternative besides usdt for those who needed stablecoin. later sections this paper, will examine tether and other stablecoin attempts the last five years with more depth order understand how the stablecoin market arrived its current state today. although has its own fair share problems that will later discuss, the rise tether has undoubtedly demonstrated the current growing demand for non-volatile cryptocurrency act stable medium exchange for traders and investors who would otherwise have ways de-risk themselves from cryptocurrency volatility other than converting back stable fiat currency like the usd. stablecoins are crucial the future the decentralized economy the blockchain economy needs stable store value and medium exchange order scale beyond its current speculative state. imagine conducting $-billion m&a transaction denominated bitcoin, only find out the next day that bitcoin has lost value overnight. this scenario may just sound like another normal day the world cryptocurrency but for the party that received those bitcoins, they will wake $-million loss that wouldn't have happened had the transaction been conducted with real currency instead. many decentralized applications that need store cryptocurrency for their operations are currently using ether but this has proven impractical large scale due exchange rate risk presented ether's price volatility. additionally, ether's price can also negatively influence the stability decentralized apps and organizations (daos) too much their underlying operations are relying ether transactions. this would the case for any "put not your trust money, but put your money trust" oliver holmes sr. cryptocurrency that not inherently stable. other words, you are basically building systematic risk into your product exchange for the benefits having transactions done the blockchain. many, this does not seem viable long-term solution. the decentralized economy grows, the demand for stable crypto mediums exchange will need increase exponentially order accommodate the mass adoption blockchain technology. use cases for stablecoins will also expand beyond what our limited foresight can see right now. however, one thing certain: there will more than just one major stablecoin few years from now and tether's market share will not stay one piece for long. competitive landscape competitors using centralized model (organic stability) tether (usdt): tether limited's usdt currently the most widely used stablecoin the world. this model, tether acts centralized, holding usd reserves bank accounts back each one their usdt tokens. they have simple creation and redemption mechanism peg their usdt token the usd. that is, the price usdt trades above $., market participants are incentivised exchange for usdt from tether, then sell back the market for profit. likewise, the price usdt trades below $., market participants are incentivized buy the cheap usdt and redeem (burn) this token for from tether. there are few concerns with tether's business model, however, especially with regards transparency and single-company risk. with over the market share, tether's sprawling influence can now felt across the crypto market, evident its recent hacking that saw $-million worth usdt stolen from its treasury wallet when news the hacking got out, most major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin immediately saw panic selling and steep price drops, wiping out billions dollars market capitalization. reality, not much damage has really been done since the hacker only stole usdt tokens and not the actual usd reserve tether's bank accounts. tether then started implementing updates its omni protocol order void the stolen usdt before they enter circulation. the one good thing that did come out from tether's hacking was that proved the centralized model was able quickly take actions prevent further damage from spreading. other than that, the tether hack clearly demonstrated how relying one single stablecoin across most major exchanges can induce serious systematic risk the entire blockchain ecosystem. lastly, there also fair share other criticisms about tether's business model and its lack transparency, including allegations that tether undercapitalized. "put not your trust money, but put your money trust" oliver holmes sr. competitors using decentralized model (inorganic stability) bitshares/bitusd: the original bitshares/bitusd whitepaper can found here. from high level, bitusd stable cryptocurrency that issued backing its value with collaterals. bitshares the network's base token used for its financial contracts. order mint new bitusd, someone has lock least equivalent value bitshares. this, along with forced liquidation mechanism, creates the peg for bitusd. when the market value bitusd goes over $., users are incentivized mint new bitusd, and when the value goes under users can redeem bitusd for the underlying bitshares. although elegant theory, this mechanism prone black swan events the underlying bitshares. large enough down move would create positive feedback cycle selling cover, potentially driving the value down far below par value. makerdao: according makerdao's whitepaper there are two key features that underpin the stability the maker dai stablecoin: collateralized debt positions (cdps) and mkr governance tokens. cdps are smart contracts that lock collateral asset exchange for dai stablecoins, the same mechanism used bitusd. maker plans allow many different tokens used collateral assets, diversifying the risk from token flash crashes. the system self-governs paying stability fees holders mkr tokens, incentivizing these token holders vote certain risk parameters sensibly order ensure stability. the dai has target rate that based upon the sdr, which essentially weighted basket five major fiat currencies. there are few potential concerns with the maker model, including whether not their stability mechanism can really withstand rapid depreciation value their top collaterals, such ether. the biggest concern, however, maker's scalability since requires excess amount collateral back each coin. this makes very expensive mint new coins that are required for scaling due opportunity cost capital. basecoin: basecoin attempt create fiat currencies public blockchain described their whitepaper this model aims set token value through manipulation the money supply. similar how government monetary policy influences the real purchasing power its citizens, basecoin uses bond issuance and buyback mechanism influence the real purchasing power basecoin. when basecoin trading above its peg value, the network increases money supply purchasing bonds from users baseshare holders when more bonds need paid out. when basecoin trading below peg value, the network contracts the money supply selling bonds market price. "put not your trust money, but put your money trust" oliver holmes sr. while basecoin takes novel approach tackling the stablecoin problem, falls short being compelling solution. makes many simplifying assumptions, such zero inflation being the ideal long run state and provides clear mechanism for changing system parameters away from these defaults. additionally, this type approach suffers from cold start problem, unlike other stablecoin approaches where the system bootstrapped leveraging existing value, this one tries create spontaneously, which requires other participants have already accepted and given the token value. the stably solution illustrated the competitive landscape section current approaches creating stablecoin are classified either centralized decentralized. centralized model, such that employed tether, has the benefit immediate viability, which evident tether's current $.-billion plus market cap. despite the concerns around tether, its popularity has validated that people trust usd-pegged coin that backed physical -to- reserve cash. however, such model requires high level trust order function effectively and centralization can corrupted there not enough transparency. decentralized projects such maker that are employing asset collateralization model create capital inefficiencies requiring large amounts collateral issue basic medium exchange. the other hand, decentralized projects that attempt mimic central bank, such basecoin and bitusd, are creating digital fiat currencies with reserve backing and will run into the network cold-start problem. insightful summary the economic viability stablecoins can found preston byrne's article this topic. byrne, who has years experience structuring financial products believes the reserve-backed centralized solution with redeemability the most robust solution. our team agreement with this view, and has thus chosen pursue this path. stableusd: reserve-backed erc token our first iteration stablecoin, stableusd, will improvement tether's business model, which arguably has already been successfully validated. there huge opportunity for more transparent player share tether's $.-billion market capitalization that still growing speak. once launched, stably intends operate canadian money services business (msb) well partner banks, custodians and msbs other countries. stably will not follow banking/lending business model and will not engaging fractional reserve practices like banks. the cash reserve will "put not your trust money, but put your money trust" oliver holmes sr. transparently managed either stably jurisdictions where msb-licensed and also other licensed third-party banks/custodians. every stableusd token will always backed -to- and redeemable for real currency token holders. order directly purchase stableusd tokens from stably, subject terms use, kyc/aml/sanction list-verified clients may wire real currency stably/stably's custodian which will then held reserve. clients may also send eth which will then converted real currency exchange and then added the reserve. stableusd tokens are redeemable -to- basis. order redeem stableusd tokens, subject terms use, verified clients will allowed send them back stably's smart contract burned return for eth real currency. stably will not control the exchange stableusd tokens after they have been sold stably. consequently, stableusd tokens can also available for secondary market trading centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges. stably will have web platform and api endpoint which will allow platform users purchase redeem stableusd tokens directly, minus any slippage and third-party transit costs (e.g. bank wires, exchange fees, mining fees). however, outside slippage and third-party transit costs, stably plans offer stableusd token purchase/redemption additional costs clients for indefinite promotional period after launching. the biggest problem for tether have mentioned lack transparency for their usd reserve. establish ourselves fully transparent and trustworthy from the start: since stably accepts off-chain fiat transactions from clients, this leaves gap transparency. for these transactions, stably will create and submit their hashes the blockchain for later verification during audits. all stably's transactions and bank balances will made publicly available our website's transparency dashboard via bank and broker-provided apis. stably will also provide links publicly available transactions the blockchain. stably will employ reputable third-party audit firm (tba) conduct scheduled audits and attestations for our reserve accounts and off-chain transactions. audits will take place the first month every quarter and attestations will happen weekly. all results will posted our website soon they are available. "put not your trust money, but put your money trust" oliver holmes sr. stably stellar anchor stably will integrate with the stellar network, which very promising blockchain network with low transaction fees and confirmation times that aims replace legacy interbank payment infrastructure. "anchors" who integrate onto stellar can issue credit tokens for any asset (fiat, cryptocurrencies, real world assets, etc.) and must hold these redeemable assets reserve. anchors are also responsible for their own fiduciary obligations well kyc/aml compliance. the stellar foundation provides compliance templates out-of-the box for this purpose. stably plans act issuer usd this network well being issuer our stableusd erc tokens which, future iterations, can transferred other blockchains using atomic swaps other cross-chain technologies. multiple blockchain support stably aims provide native support for reserve-backed stablecoins across variety select blockchain platforms the industry evolves. eos and potentially rchain are both very strong candidates that are considering. target market and use-cases medium trade settlement crypto exchanges providing gateway for fiat crypto currently resolved any crypto exchange that directly deals fiats (usually usd). however, many exchanges such kraken, bittrex and binance not deal directly fiats and instead offer crypto pairs that use usdt the quote currency. stably will target these exchanges offer another immediate usd-backed stablecoin. this will help them diversify away from usdt order reduce single-company-risk from tether. decentralized applications decentralized applications rely economic incentive structures which are currently denominated volatile cryptocurrencies. many applications are too sensitive exchange rate risk for that viable and they need use stable store value ensure that their mechanisms are incentivizing users the intended way. example augur currently denominates its decentralized prediction markets ether. there are very little volume these markets since the underlying price "put not your trust money, but put your money trust" oliver holmes sr. volatility ether often outweighs whatever information you might have bet the future event with. example locking value that fluctuates wildly rarely good for either party escrow service. doing with normal cryptocurrency not practical, unless price-stable cryptocurrency like stableusd. crypto risk diversifier many crypto traders and investors not wish exposed crypto volatility the time. the moment, they have few choices other than usdt. there are also professional fund managers who want enter the crypto market but would prefer park their funds stable cryptocurrency first give them time before deciding make allocation. payment, remittance and money transfer stableusd can used instantly transfer value that denominated real currency any location the world that has internet access. scale over time, the cost using stableusd will also drop, making our stablecoin more competitive with traditional business models this field. our integration with the stellar network will provide the infrastructure for this use case. cross-blockchain payments api supporting real currency-backed stablecoins across different blockchains, stably will create api for applications that integrate with variety dapps the background. for example, suppose application requires you make payment storage dapp ethereum well e-commerce dapp stellar. instead clumsy user experience whereby user installs chrome extensions for ethereum and stellar with their respective token accounts each, our api will allow the user seamlessly spend their stableusd tokens across these different blockchains apps, with cross-chain atomic swaps implemented our backend. this results payments which will support consumer adoption cryptocurrencies. banking and lending are exploring future prospects creating full-fledged stably bank that will licensed, regulated and accept stableusd tokens deposits well engage stableusd token-based lending activities. please refer example section "put not your trust money, but put your money trust" oliver holmes sr. developing economies example utilize stableusd wallets for easy access stable store value. for example, someone venezuela zimbabwe may fear economic mismanagement their local currency, and want simple means for accessing cryptocurrency that offers stability similar the usd. example the event hyperinflation non-usd currencies, stableusd can integrated with consumer merchant payment processing services that people affected geographies can continue conduct business. countries where this frequent risk (venezuela, zimbabwe, congo, etc.), such payment processing services for stableusd may even able replace payment local currencies, with without the local government's blessings. example cross-border remittance for the underbanked, like the case construction worker the uae sending money back his family bangladesh. cryptocurrency attractive option for such individual due the ease access and lower costs, and stableusd-integrated exchanges can integration endpoints cross-border payment network. example create banking/lending platform for individuals and small businesses that integrated with both real currencies and stableusd tokens. this platform would useful for micro-financing activities well providing credit underbanked entrepreneurs. proper banking licensing will required and will likely need become regulated deposit-taking institution order expand this use case. go-to-market plan short-term go-to-market plan years) the first important task that vital any stablecoin's future gain much adoption and market share possible. further development and scaling advanced stablecoin ecosystem can only made possible its market capitalization well liquidity reach critical mass. the case stableusd, define this having: total stableusd market capitalization least $-million, average daily trading volume least $-million and official adoption least major cryptocurrency exchanges such bittrex, binance and kraken addition decentralized exchanges like etherdelta and stellar dex. believe that the best way capture market share tackle the most immediate need the market currently which providing medium exchange for trade settlement cryptocurrency exchanges. with usdt "put not your trust money, but put your money trust" oliver holmes sr. commanding virtual monopoly the multibillion-dollar stablecoin markets across major exchanges, does not take long for one wonder about the serious systematic risk that this could have the entire cryptocurrency market whole. additionally, tether's questionable business model does not instill complete confidence and trust everybody. even tether legitimate-which truly hope the case because this would tantamount mt. gox things turn out otherwise-it still does not make sense that single company should have the privilege providing the only viable stablecoin solution for everybody. this concern has only been growing recently the crypto community and regulators are increasingly questioning tether's business model. confidently predict that the near future, usdt will lose its dominance over the stablecoin market newer stablecoins-including stableusd-come and start carving away market shares. exchanges some point will also have consider diversifying their stablecoins since completely the interest both the exchanges and their clients reduce single-company-risk from the current tether monopoly. not would be, our opinion, irresponsible the part exchanges. not offering variety stablecoins for their clients, exchanges are effectively turning diversifiable, unsystematic risk into undiversifiable systematic risk. upon reaching critical mass, will expand stableusd's use cases. mid-term go-to-market plan years) once stableusd has garnered enough adoption and liquidity, will start integrating stableusd tokens with dapps and daos that need hold cryptocurrencies their own reserves for operational purposes. since three out four dapps are currently built the ethereum protocol, our erc stablecoin should able easily integrate with most dapps long ethereum remains the most popular dapp development platform. addition dapps and daos, stableusd can also integrated with traditional off-chain business models, such e-commerce, payment, remittance and money transfer. any business that involved the transmission monetary value would great candidate for stableusd integration and plan aggressively market our solution this sector. our cross-blockchain support will also enable the creation payments api that can integrated into websites that interact with variety dapps, allowing for the seamless ability spend real currency tokens across these background dapps. "put not your trust money, but put your money trust" oliver holmes sr. long-term go-to-market plan years) our ultimate goal one day serve the market segment that actually needs stable currency the most: developing and underdeveloped economies that lack stable currency have high inflation, such venezuela, zimbabwe and argentina. are already seeing explosion the mining and usage bitcoin well other cryptocurrencies venezuela, country that has recently been plagued political instability and failing economy. the same trend also surfacing across many other developing countries despite restrictive government regulations designed discourage outright ban the use cryptocurrency there. fortunately, are not too worried about governments banning cryptocurrency because impossible for them long their citizens have access the internet. the end the day, believe that the global blockchain economy will always find ways thrive, with without governmental blessings, and will only matter time before crypto-hostile nations have other choice but embrace the use cryptocurrencies parallel with their local currencies. additionally, due the infinitely divisible nature cryptocurrency, will eventually make more sense for people from developing and underdeveloped economies use stableusd over physical dollar bills because stableusd token can broken down many decimal units match the purchasing power local users. our plan for foreign expansion first make inroads non-hostile countries that are more welcoming cryptocurrencies, for obvious reasons. this may take place during the course our mid-term go-to-market plan well. leveraging experience and expertise that will have already gained then from executing our mid-term plan, will able quickly help local businesses integrate stableusd into their operations. last but not least, mass adoption stableusd will enable explore banking and lending solutions with our stablecoins viable business model. this especially important developing economies that have not developed credit score system, where many people are locked out local banks and have rely microfinancing shady loan sharks get access credit. through stableusd loans, these unbanked and underbanked market segments can now access credit and start building credit history that they would not able obtain otherwise.
